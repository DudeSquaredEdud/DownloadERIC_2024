        "description":"In the United States female and male students supposedly have the same educational opportunities. Females continue to score below male students on the mathematics portions of standardized tests and less frequently choose mathematics-oriented careers. In this experimental study (n=95), 47 first-year algebra students participated in a month-long Specialized Supplementary Curriculum Component (SSCC). The SSCC included exposure to three female speakers who used mathematics in their careers and four lectures with follow-up activities about historical female mathematicians. Data for the control group (n=48) and the experimental group (n=47) were analyzed using one-tailed t-tests. Results indicated that students' attitudes toward careers in mathematics and the personal importance of  mathematics were significantly improved. Students' attitudes also reflected less stereotyping of mathematics as a male domain. (Author)",

        "description":"It has been shown previously that many students solve chemistry problems using only algorithmic strategies and do not understand the chemical concepts on which the problems are based. It is plausible to suggest that if the information is presented in differing formats the cognitive demand of a problem changes. The main objective of this study (involving 62 students in a chemistry course at Purdue University, Indiana) is to investigate the degree to which cognitive variables, such as developmental level, mental capacity, and disembedding ability explain student performance on problems which: (1) could be addressed by algorithms; or (2) require conceptual understanding. All conceptual problems used in this study were based on a figurative format. The results obtained show that in  all four problems requiring algorithmic strategies, developmental level of the students is the best predictor of success. This could be attributed to the fact that these are basically computational problems, requiring mathematical transformations. Although all three problems requiring conceptual understanding had an important aspect in common (the figurative format), yet in all three the best predictor of success is a different cognitive variable. It was concluded that: (1) the ability to solve computational problems (based on algorithms) is not the major factor in predicting success in solving problems that require conceptual understanding; (2) solving problems based on algorithmic strategies requires formal operational reasoning to a certain degree; and (3) student difficulty in solving  problems that require conceptual understanding could be attributed to different cognitive variables.

        "description":"Science process skills are described as a set of broadly transferable abilities, appropriate to all of the science disciplines and reflective of the true behavior of scientists. While science process skills have gained wide acceptance as an integral part of the science curricula, the development of valid and reliable instruments to assess those skills has lagged behind. The purpose of this study was to gather evidence of the construct validity of the multiple-choice and performance-based versions of the Test of Basic Process Skills in Science (BAPS), the only research instrument designed to measure all of the most widely accepted basic science process skills for elementary and middle school students. A multitrait-multimethod construct validation technique was used to gather  evidence of the convergent and discriminant validity of the BAPS tests. The BAPS multiple-choice test and the BAPS station test, a performance-based instrument, were used to measure the trait of interest. The Test of Logical Thinking (TOLT) and the Bending Rods (RODS) Piagetian manipulative task were used to measure the discriminant trait, science reasoning ability. The four instruments were administered to a sample of 151 seventh grade students from a west Florida school district. The results indicated strong support for the convergent and discriminant validity of the BAPS instrument. Considerable evidence of the construct validity of the BAPS tests can be inferred from this study. (Author/KR)",

          "Lederman, Norman G."],
        "description":"Ten preservice biology teachers were followed through the final year of their preservice education to assess the content and stability of their knowledge structures of biology. A questionnaire asking the subjects to list the topics which make up biology and to diagram these topics in relation to one another was completed three times during the Fall Term. The questionnaire was completed again in the Spring Term during student teaching and was followed by an interview. Qualitative analysis of the data attempted to derive any evident patterns among and within the preservice teachers' stated subject matter structures. The data suggest that preservice teachers' knowledge structures of biology are extremely fragile and are influenced by the opportunity to think about teaching subject  matter. Teaching, and courses specifically related to science teaching, provided integrating themes for the perception of isolated biology topics created by college science coursework. These results suggest that courses in science education may be the natural and most effective location for initial reflection on the integrating themes of science, but that the translation of such understandings may not be realistic for the novice teacher who gives priority to planning and classroom management. Since many of the new reforms in science education depend on the incorporation of integrating themes, inservice programs may be critical to foster teachers' reflections on subject matter structure and its translation to science instruction.

The researcher-developed prediction activities were designed to stimulate student interest and critical thinking prior to formal instruction on the concepts. Enhanced levels of classroom discussion and interaction, higher achievement motivation, positive attitudes toward science, and greater mastery of genetics concepts were identified as the areas of effectiveness being evaluated. Although the quantitative analyses showed no differences between the experimental and control groups, there were apparent qualitative differences. Students in the experimental treatment classes were described as displaying higher levels of interest  and participation in the lesson. They were depicted as asking more thoughtful questions, and responding with interest to the challenges presented them while making and defending their predictions. (Author)",

        "description":"As part of a major effort towards the documentation of teachers' roles, in a project (Toledo Support Teachers Program) aimed towards their restructuring, one female science teacher was observed using ethnographic techniques while performing her daily work as a teacher, department head, support teacher during the winter and spring of 1989. The technique used is called &quot;shadowing&quot;, since both the observer and the subject were together for a long time each day. Jointly written by the observer and the teacher, this paper attempts to analyze the technique both as a research tool and as a medium for the teacher's critical examination of her practices. The paper addresses in detail the description of the technique used, the teacher's reaction to the observation, and post-observation  effects on the teacher's practices. (Author/CRW)",

Featuring the innovative and influential methods of Pestalozzi, a review of how geography was taught in Great Britain and Ireland in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is outlined. Teaching by the inductive method and discovery by personal observation as advocated by Pestalozzi are strongly recommended. The time is ripe for American classrooms to adopt the idea that learning geography first hand by  actual experience of the environment and by active teaching methods produces positive results. (NL)",

It also contends that educators must stop debating elite versus democratic values or traditional versus contemporary problems in humanities education, and start communicating with students, colleagues, and the rest of the world. Reformers want students to take more humanities courses, but they have forgotten that what portion of the humanities proves viable and enduring depends not upon what is taught but upon what is learned. The question is raised as to how well humanities teachers are communicating their ideas when much of what they teach, students regard as simply noise. In an age in which  information accumulates at an alarming pace, meaning lags far behind the information received. It is concluded that humanities teachers must be more concerned with their students needs and the applicability of what they are trying to teach. A 7-item bibliography is included. (DB)",

An assignment for middle school students on how to interpret a map provides a test to accompany maps used in the classroom. There are also suggestions on how to instruct students to read a table, rank order states, compute a percentage of the total, and identify selected  states and countries using blank outline maps.

Points discussed include historical developments, the national curriculum project for &quot;maatschappijleer,&quot; goals and content, government educational policy, and the position of East-West relations in the curriculum. Political decisions recently taken in the Netherlands are crucial to the future development of the content and structure of education. This also is true for political education. In other European countries such as England and Scotland, there is a tendency in educational policy towards core curricula, national criteria, grade related criteria, and nationwide tests. This paper concludes with thoughts on the position and significance  of East-West relations in the curriculum and suggestions for more international cooperation and coordination. (Author)",

Education in the region is diverse both in terms of structure and policies, and of educational thoughts and practices in schools. The entire region has made considerable progress in the past decades. That even the rural South Asian countries saw encouraging economic growth indicates favorable soil for educational development. Reform has been the main theme in education in the region. Despite the diverse objectives in the reforms, commonalities do emerge. There is a general tendency to decentralize the administration and finance of education, and to create new sources of finance. In terms of educational planning,  human resources development has become the central concern, either explicitly or implicitly. On one hand, there is movement toward micro-level planning so that education may better serve local needs and encourage local initiatives. On the other hand, there also is the trend to move away from purely economic and manpower considerations, and to carry out educational planning in an integrated and multi-level manner. Despite various problems and difficulties, prospects of education development in the region are generally optimistic, provided that economic situations do not deteriorate and political situations remain stable. Ten annexes are included. A number of tables and figures appear throughout this document. (DB)",

Respondents were 319 elementary education students, 71 prospective secondary math teachers, 52 prospective teachers of secondary English, 23 noneducation math majors, and 19 noneducation English majors. Although there is much diversity between and among the subjects, there were some areas of consensus. In answering questions about student diversity, the respondents did not endorse stereotypes about gender differences or differences in content appropriate for students from different family backgrounds. In responding to questions about what would be helpful in learning to teach, they gave the expected endorsement  of experience, as well as high ratings for classes of questions about generic and subject-specific teaching methods. In answering questions about the mathematics or writing they would teach, the respondents expressed surprisingly little enthusiasm for seeing these subjects as systems of rules to be memorized. One difference of note was that the noneducation majors indicated less belief in the &quot;power of pedagogy,&quot; that is, in the ability of prospective teachers to succeed in learning to teach academic content, especially more conceptually oriented content.

The report has five sections. Section 1 discusses at-risk students: who they are, their characteristics and instructional needs, and the implications for beginning teachers. Section 2 focuses on beginning teachers and their needs. Section 3 discusses support systems for beginning teachers--their primary goals, the major support issues, types of support programs, and five models of beginning teacher support programs (inservice induction programs, mentoring support programs, local system inservice and &quot;internal&quot; mentoring models, teacher education and local school system models, and comprehensive  school system models). Section 4 addresses the issue of the knowledge base needed by teachers, instructional leaders, and supervisors on the positive and negative factors that influence at-risk students. A bibliography to assist in developing such a knowledge base is included in this section arranged under 10 headings: teachers, parents, peers in class, student's self-image, assessment, curricula, instructional materials/aids, classroom environment, school environment, home environment, additional readings, and readings related to at-risk students. Section 5 presents some conclusions. Three appendixes supporting information discussed in the text and four pages of references conclude the report. (JD)",

        "description":"Out of the school reform movement of the eighties have come recommendations for professional development schools, site-based management, and teacher empowerment. Such initiatives can be implemented only in environments where continuing pursuit of new knowledge exists at every level. There is a pressing need for educational models that strive to ensure student learning, enhance teacher professionalism, and narrow the existing disjuncture between educational theory and practice. The instructional model at the Falk Laboratory School of the University of Pittsburgh conceives the school to be a center of inquiry. In this environment, emphases are placed upon the generation of new knowledge, the intellectual growth of teachers, and the development of inquiring attitudes in students.  This paper describes both the theory and application of the model. An example of the application of the inquiring school model is presented in the form of a lesson description which demonstrates the use of graphic organizers to facilitate understanding and analysis of a story by primary students.

        "description":"Because of increased emphasis on accountability, program evaluations today must go beyond measures of change in program participants to consider the effects, either direct or indirect, of staff development on students and their learning. A model is presented illustrating the relationship between staff development for teachers and student learning outcomes, and the external factors that influence this relationship. Three factors are identified: (1) quality of the staff development program; (2) the content of the staff development program; and (3) the characteristics of the context in which the program is carried out. Although other models consider implementation as a separate factor, in this model quality or degree of implementation is considered a facet of the total process and  therefore is a component of the first factor, the quality of the staff devlopment program. The potential effects of these factors on program evaluation results are described, along with procedures for estimating those effects. Finally, strategies are outlined, based on the model, for enhancing the quality and validity of staff development program evaluation. (IAH)",

        "description":"The University of Alabama set up a communication network pilot program to enhance the early childhood and elementary methods block in the College of Education. The pilot program incorporated electronic mail (E-Mail), a fax machine, and a microcomputer communications network. The network made possible instructors' clarifications of assignments, transmission of student progress reports, assistance in planning and implementing lessons, and other communications related to field placements. Some of the objectives were to save travel time and costs and to see if there would be any effect on students' success. Four schools participated in the project: Two schools with appropriate technology served as experimental sites; one school was a restricted experimental site; and one school was a  control site using traditional supervisory methods. Each participant was asked to keep a log of interactions with others on subject matter, type of communication used (telephone visit, fax, computer network, etc.), and comments about the result of the interaction. The logs, student evaluative essays, interviews, and the Microteaching Skills Rating System provided the data for the study. According to the data analysis, 75 percent of the professional contacts were via computer network, the control school had the fewest contacts per student, and most contacts concerned lesson planning and classroom activity. A similar communication network system associated with the College of Education at the University of Virginia, as well as networks in schools, are also discussed. (IAH)",

The development of rational thinking, attention span, and ability to memorize in the first years of life are very much dependent upon motor experiences gained through exploring and comprehending. Early learning experiences should not be forced upon the child, but should develop through self-discovery, play with others, and personal challenges. Uninhibited movement experiences, rather than regimented or forced activities, produce the essential and lasting curiosity and thirst for knowledge necessary for human creativity. Within this context, the 28 chapters of this book discuss the following topics: spontaneity and sureness of movement; keen perceptual awareness; orientation  in space; rational visualization and creativity in movement; comprehension of situations and independent reaction. The content covers prenatal through age 8, with a heavy focus on preprimary years. The book provides a variety of suggestions on how to promote a child's own competence, starting with the first year of life. (AMH)",

        "description":"The principles of andragogy, as explained by M. S. Knowles, in contrast to pedagogy, provide a frame of reference for a differentiated approach to inservice teacher education. Adults are self-directing and ready to learn when they experience a need to know or do something, are life-, task-, or problem-centered, are motivated by both internal and external forces, and bring with them a variety of life experiences. Adult educators, therefore, become resource persons and facilitators of learning rather than instructors. Teachers entering an inservice program are at different stages of development and have different needs and learning styles. The Individualized Learning Modules (ILM) format, a competency-based model for inservice teacher education, provides ways to respond to both the  characteristics of adult learners and the diverse needs of teachers. Each learning module addresses specific topics and is designed to achieve one or more independent objectives. The ILM includes a self-assessment of needs, content delivery, sources for further investigation, individual study guide, collaborative group learning guide, performance products suggestions, log form, and evaluation form. Participants select the modules or units that will meet their individual needs. The design of an inservice program using well-defined learning modules assures flexibility and provides a means for responding to a variety of needs in a context of mutual respect and collaboration.

        "description":"The Office of Educational Research and Improvement's new National Center for Research on Teacher Learning expects to include at least four elements: to accommodate public expectations for schools, to incorporate a theory of the teacher as a learner, to incorporate a theory of the teacher's task, and to build on a theory of the unique features of teaching practice. This report defines the direction of the center's work with respect to each of these points, reviews what is currently known, and derives the central questions that need to be addressed. The center's agenda is defined according to three important learning tasks: (1) teachers need to transform their beliefs about the nature of subject matter, about the teacher's role in facilitating learning, and about the pedagogical  implications of diverse learning; (2) teachers must understand both subject matter and diverse learners; and (3) teacher learning requires a difficult balance between situating new concepts and criteria in the context of practice, on the one hand, and protecting teacher-learners from being overwhelmed by the demands of the situation on the other. The center is conducting three parallel programs of research based on these three tasks. The projects within these programs are listed. More than 100 references are cited. (IAH)",

        "description":"Few reliable data exist to provide an accurate estimate of the money invested in staff development or inservice programs in the United States for elementary and secondary school personnel. There are, however, some indicators by which costs of staff development programs at the federal level can be inferred. The problem of accurately gauging staff development costs is compounded by the lack of agreed-upon reporting standards and the lack of consistent definitions of what constitutes staff development and inservice education. This paper presents a statistical analysis of the staff development costs reported by four major studies and the implications resulting from that analysis. The statistical analysis focused on two purposes: (1) to explore the degree of correlation between  reported staff development cost factors for each of the four studies individually, as well as across all four studies; and (2) to develop appropriate regression equations, based on the calculated correlation coefficients for each of the four studies. One goal of this investigation was the identification of predictive cost factors related to staff development. In this investigation four combinations of factors were found to have sufficiently strong correlations for regression equations to be determined. Implications of the findings for state legislative policy are discussed. Ten tables are appended. (IAH)",

        "description":"Instructional clarity is a cluster of instructor behaviors that contains an appropriate use of keys, links, framing statements, focusing, and examples and avoids vagueness terms and mazes. In this study, students' (N=59) achievement and their perception of clear instruction were significantly affected by both the amount of clarity an instructor provided in a classroom presentation and the type of conceptual structuring that was used in a lesson's design. The number of keys, links, framing, focusing, and example moves made by an instructor predicted the amount of achievement that a student would be able to attain in defining, identifying, and applying concepts. Students who were presented with lessons containing more positive instructional clarity moves achieved more. Clear  instruction is most beneficial when a variable coordinate concept structure is appropriately used. Achievement of college students is negatively affected by unclear presentations of even well-structured, conceptually presented material. As a concept structure becomes less complex, the amount of instructional clarity becomes less relevant. (IAH)",

This first stage explored the question of whether these students held cognitive constructs about teaching and what these constructs were like. Data were obtained through one-to-one interviews. (A copy of the interview protocol is included.) Findings indicate that the students did hold cognitive constructs about teaching, that they held different, in part mutually exclusive constructs, and that the constructs were both strongly held and deeply imbedded. The possible influence of cognitive constructs held by prepreparation students on their preparation and classroom experiences is  explored, as well as the possible implications of such thinking on research into preservice, novice, and inservice teacher beliefs and practices.

It compared them in the light of two hypotheses: (1) compared to professors, teachers are &quot;novices&quot; about developmental psychology; and (2) compared to professors, teachers have &quot;different,&quot; rather than deficient, knowledge about development and organize their knowledge differently. According to the second hypothesis, teachers and professors are both &quot;novices,&quot; but only with respect to each other. Results supported the cognitive difference hypothesis more strongly than cognitive deficit: professors and teachers highlighted different sorts of issues about children when organizing their knowledge of developmental psychology, even though  professors provided more verbally prolific taxonomies overall.

A random digit telephone survey was conducted of noninstitutionalized residents in a medium sized California city. Subjects ages 18 and over who volunteered to participate were questioned about their involvement in both formal and informal leisure-time physical activities during their childhood and teen years. Self-reported adult levels of aerobic activity were recorded along with reasons for participation in physical activity for all three time periods. Relevant demographic data were also collected. The results indicated that aerobically active adults were significantly more likely to have participated in organized physical activities  during childhood. They were also significantly more likely to have been involved with informal physical activities during high school. Self-evaluation of athletic ability during childhood was significantly more favorable among those children who became aerobically active adults. (Author)",

Theme parks, designed to enable parents to entertain everyone in the family with minimal frustration in organization and application, provide a single-price, inside-the-gate, complete experience. In 1955, Disneyland opened in southern California; due to technological advances, today it represents the past. Disney World (in Florida), which represents the present, recognizing that children are well served in all theme parks, pioneered in dults as well. Jurassic Park represents the fictitious future, the major change being in entertainment (live dinosaurs). Biological and electronic technologies have combined to produce live dinosaur clones. What is absent, however,  is hands-on excitement. The leisure challenge presents the following problems: (l) people have very little time to play; people forget how to play; and they even forget what play is; and (2) play has become too structured; it is completely rule-bound and calls for little imagination. Visitors to theme parks tend to conform to the technology with unquestioned acceptance. The leisure-oriented solution would be to: learn to use technology, rather than just react to it; be innovative and creative in approaching leisure options; and use technology as an asset. (LL)",

Three aspects of sport are discussed: (l) the perpetual conflict between process (training) and product (the actual contest); (2) technophobia, the fear of the new world of technology; and (3) \"technosport\" or technological training. It is necessary to understand that sport technology requires an ethical foundation, rather than a philosophy of win at any price. Because of such practices as genetic engineering and drug use among athletes to improve performance, decisions must be made on ethical standards and basic rules. Rules set ethical judgments and tell athletes how much is too much and what cannot be done to win. It is not possible to wait until problems become glaring in order to deal with the  implications of technology for sport. Sport success should not be simply a matter of who can spend the greatest amount of money and time to train, nor of who is willing to take the most chances with their future health by abusing their body with overtraining or drugs. The public expects schools to teach right conduct and should expect the same of the sports system. (LL)",

Entry data were collected at orientation and planning workshops for 42 League of Professional Schools teams from Georgia districts. The schools were represetned in three regional 2-day orientation and planning sessions. Each of the 214 attendees was asked survey questions focusing on: happenings in participating schools with respect to instructional changes, decision-making processes, priority instructional initiatives, and perceptions regarding enhancing or impeding factors in terms of the project. The discussion compares and contrasts responses from  schools electing to join the League and those choosing not to join. The survey yielded identification of elements of readiness for administrators and staff members planning to engage in large school-based improvement projects. The analysis revealed that such distinct phases and elements relate to and may influence entry decisions and project success, thus raising questions about ways of assisting school personnel to prepare for major improvement efforts.

Full group data allow evaluation of: (1) how program results compare to district, state, or national results in each subject area; (2) what the long-term effects of the Chapter 1 program are; (3) how the standardized test results compare to performance on program criterion measures; and (4) what the trends in achievement over time for each cohort are. Subgroup data allow the determination of  the relative gains for students at different levels, and assessment of how students who exit the program compare with those who remain. Individual data can provide insights into how to deal with students who do not seem to progress. Case study analysis can reveal much about the achievement of individuals. Data are generally collected with a specific purpose, but this guide shows ways in which additional questions and hypotheses can be examined. Five graphs and three tables present the study results.

        "description":"The analysis of North Carolina performance on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is part of a larger program addressing the improvement of public school students' performance on skills measured by the SAT. This second of two volumes presents individual school system profiles for the mathematics and verbal sections of the SAT for the 126 school systems that released their scores. The profiles include disaggregated scores for subgroups of students according to: (1) total year-long credits in six academic subjects; (2) sex; (3) ethnicity; (4) family income; (5) parental education level; and (6) self-reported academic grade point average. Tabulated data in the profiles also include: the participation rate (PR), which is computed by dividing the number of SAT takers by the 7th-month  grade 12 average daily membership; the yield, which uses both the average percent correct achieved on a test and the PR; and mathematics and verbal percent correct scores, which are based on the percent of the total scale score achieved. The yield index permits the state or school system to compare its performance from year to year on a scale adjusted for varying PRs. North Carolina's PR was 52% in both 1989 and 1990, based on the 126 school systems and the calculation of PR. The state's mathematics yield was 20 in 1989 and 21 in 1990; and the verbal yield was 17 for both years. Mathematics and verbal test results are provided in two tables, respectively, for each of the 126 school systems. (SLD)",

Sixty-one of the students were in a first-year chemistry class, and 40 of the students were in a second-year chemistry class. Correlations were determined between the CASA and (1) the first chapter test, (2) the quarter grade, and (3) the Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI). The 6-month test-retest reliability on the CASA was 0.69. The  internal consistency (alpha) was 0.93 for the test and 0.94 for the retest. There was no significant correlation between the CASA and achievement, the CASA and the TAI, or the CASA and the worry subscale of the TAI. There was a significant correlation between the CASA and the emotionality subscale of the TAI. Females scored significantly higher than did males on the CASA, and first-year students scored higher than did second-year students on the CASA. The mean on the test was significantly higher than on the retest. This study supports the reliability of the CASA. A 25-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

        "description":"The Office of Research and Evaluation of the Austin (Texas) Independent School District (AISD) has been monitoring the dropout situation in the AISD since 1983-84. In July 1986, a computerized database, the Secondary Student Longitudinal File, was constructed to enable tracking of the enrollment of any group of students beginning with the 1983-84 school year for high school students and the 1985-86 school year for seventh- and eighth-grade students. Dropout rates are also calculated by ethnicity. This fact sheet provides selected statistical data on trends in dropout rates in the AISD between the 1983-84 and 1988-89 school years. The total dropout rate in 1988-89 in grades 7 and 8 (4.2%) was the lowest it has been since monitoring was initiated. The dropout percentage in 1988-89  for grade 9 was lower than in the preceding year. Longitudinal dropout rates are given for the senior high school 1983-84 cohort and the junior high school 1985-86 cohort. By 1989, 29.8% of students who began secondary school in 1983 had dropped out of school. In the same year, 17.2% of those who had started in 1985 had dropped out of school.

The ENSM, a blending of the Normative Systems Model and Metanoic Principles, emphasizes participant decision making and cultural change. The processes experienced by a commission appointed to study academic organization (composed of 15 faculty, 2 administrators, and a community leader) were examined using reports and documents, interviews with 8 community leaders and faculty members, a questionnaire completed by many faculty members, and a participant observer. Data were organized according to the ENSM's major theoretical process occurrences (a shared vision, alignment  around the vision, participant decision making and involvement, internal and external assessment, and organizational culture change) and the product outcomes of change and increased participant decision making. These outcomes were reflected in the growing involvement of faculty from the initial 15 to over 70 in the evolved council and committees. Analysis of the data suggest that the process occurrences can assist movement toward cultural change. The ENSM is supported as a participatory change approach to higher education. The findings question the leader's role as the originator of the vision, and suggest that a more effective leader may be one who encourages and supports members of the organization to fulfill leadership roles.

Subjects were asked to rate the attributions. The United States sample included 50 undergraduate education students, 50 graduate education students, 50 undergraduates from an introductory psychology course, and 50  adults who had never attended a college or university. The Israeli sample included 53 undergraduate education students, 80 graduate education students, 56 undergraduate psychology students, and 50 adults without a college background. Three-way factor analyses of variance were used for group, sex, and attributions. Israelis were more internal than were subjects from the United States for task difficulty and luck, and were less predictable on task difficulty, less controllable for competence, but more controllable for luck. In all four groups, attributions of skill, knowledge, and luck revealed the largest differences between the two groups. Results are discussed in terms of the cultural views and experiences of the two populations. The rating scale used is included. (SLD)",

These two indices and a Mantel-Haenszel chi square test examined DIF for the  1987 group. About one-third of the items in the verbal and mathematics reasoning tests were found to have DIF, but few English subtest items did so.

For the artificial data set, the alternative orientations of the two-dimensional projection plane in the three-dimensional space did suggest different interpretations of the unidimensional score. The relative position of item vectors changed with each orientation, and the definition of the axes in the  two-dimensional solution was different in each orientation. Results with the real data were not as clear as those for the artificial data; however, some differences in the dimensions of the solutions were apparent. Results imply that multidimensional exploratory analyses should follow a strategy that emphasizes determining the largest number of dimensions that yield meaningful results, rather than the smallest number of dimensions that come close to reproducing the relationships in the data.

Interviews were held from May through September of 1990 with different survey instruments for 30 participating states and 24 nonparticipating states. Open-ended and forced-choice questions were included to identify perceived barriers to and incentives for full-scale implementation of dropout statistic collection. Twenty-eight participating states believed that the data collection was feasible for statewide implementation. Nineteen of the non-participants reflected a similar attitude, responding  that there were no serious barriers to providing dropout data if such an item was added to the CCD. Major areas to be addressed before adding a dropout statistic to the CCD include: (1) logistical problems in data collection and reporting; (2) problems of complicated and rigorous definition of dropouts; (3) determining the possibility of assessing the status of school leavers with sufficient accuracy to provide a reliable dropout count through school district records; (4) problems of classifying school leavers as dropouts with sufficient comparability when state policies and procedures differ; and (5) determining the effects of differences in operations among state agencies.

        "description":"Additive conjoint measurement models for educational research are construed as practical applications of the hermeneutic theory of scientific instrumentation. It is argued that the model of the text is no less paradigmatic for quantitative method in the natural and social sciences than it is for qualitative, ethnographic methods. It is also suggested that qualitative ethnographic research limits itself if it does not follow through on its critique of quantitative thinking by demonstrating the alternatives it offers. Two studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that metaphors provide virtual meanings that can be honed into actual measures. In one study, a relatively homogenous sample of 36 Americans rated the meaningfulness of 68 entailments of the metaphor &quot;love is a rose.&quot;  In the second study, a group of Nigerians rated the meaningfulness of a local saying. Both studies support the hypothesis that the virtual measures of meaning provided by language can be sharpened into actual quantitative measures. Implications for application of conjoint measurement models are discussed. It is concluded that the methodological and epistemological dilemma of social research is more complex than merely recognizing the barriers to scientific objectivity; it is more a matter of recognizing that the model of objectivity which researchers have attempted to replicate does not exist even in the sense of a heuristic device.

        "description":"The comprehension processes of adult students solving two-step problems of comparison were studied using eye-movement experiments based on the assumption that eye fixations are synchronous with internal cognitive processes. Twenty university students each solved 24 two-step mathematical word problems of three sentences each with consistent language (CL) or inconsistent language (IL) structures. In CL problems, the unknown variable was the subject of the second sentence; in IL, the unknown was the object of the relational sentence. Raw eye movement data were transformed into consecutive fixations. Overall results were generally in line with the model of A. Lewis and R. Mayer (1987) (LM model) suggesting the increased difficulty of IL problems as indicated by increased time  required to process the sentences and the number of errors of reversal of correct mathematical operation. Apparently, just as it is the case for the performance variable error rate, the effect of inconsistent language on aspects of the solution process (such as total solution time, initial reading time, and fixation time on the relational clause) is exhibited only when the compare problems have to be processed and solved under rather heavy cognitive demands. Some theoretical conceptions are developed as alternatives to parts of the LM model. One table and one bar graph supplement the discussion. (SLD)",

This comparison was accomplished by using phi and tetrachoric correlations among dichotomous data and Pearson product-moment correlations among Rasch probability estimates of the same dichotomous data in factor analysis. A sample size of 324 resulted from 36 persons at each of nine score values. Eigenvalues for the phi, tetrachoric, and Rasch-r correlation matrices derived from each of the data sets were computed. The Rasch approach, as a psychometric measurement model, was chosen because it met the assumption of a linear ability  continuum underlying dichotomous item response data.

The first objective was to clarify the relation between intellectual ability and working method (e.g., orientation and systematical orderliness), and to determine the effects on learning of working method, independently of intellectual ability. A second objective was to determine whether instructional aid by presenting students with a well-structured task, instead of unguided learning by discovery, might compensate for lack of ability or a poor working method. Twenty-seven first-year university students of relatively high intelligence (n=14) or low intelligence (n=13) worked in either a structured or an unstructured learning environment. Thinking-aloud protocols were analyzed  in terms of the quality of working method. Results indicate that the working method of high-intelligence subjects was significantly better than that of subjects of low intelligence; working method was also a strong predictor of learning, independent of intellectual ability. No learning effects due to the level of structure of the learning environment could be detected. Five data tables and a 28-item list of references are included.

        "description":"In an address to the National Council on Measurement in Education, R. M. Jaeger (1987) commented that there appears to be a fundamental difference in measurement philosophy between those on the two sides of the debate over the Rasch model. Jaeger's observations are explicated by contrasting the views on measurement of B. D. Wright and E. F. Lindquist with relation to the interpretation each has of the validation of constructs as considered by C. Cherryholmes (1988). Lindquist conceives of test items as given in an objective reality; the discursive action of construct validation is assumed to take place outside the context in which the construct is manifest. Wright suggests that test items amount to nothing more than guesses about how a construct articulates itself. Instead of  objectifying test takers by subjecting them to unquestionable authority, the Rasch approach to test construction suggests that questions are tested by the respondents just as much as the respondents are tested by the questions. It is argued that by recognizing the inevitability of the imposition of political, moral, and aesthetic criteria on test items and data, and by formulating models of how these criteria can be implemented and criticized, the Rasch model and supporters of Wright's position have made a great contribution to measurement. Two tables expand on the discussion. A 133-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

The question of whether philosophy can have a unique thesis is examined. It is suggested that the thesis of philosophy asserts the creation of meaning as an ongoing project that must be constantly monitored. Divergent approaches to this thesis are illustrated in the work of H. G. Gadamer and J. Derrida. The most obvious way in which the thesis of philosophy bears on educational research and practice is that educators are deeply involved in the study of meaning. The field of testing provides an example of a fundamental way in which philosophy's thesis can improve educational research and practice. Learning could become motivated by the  teacher and the learner's own curiosity; testing could become a matter of investigating the inquiry that is constitutive of learning with that constitutive of measurement.

The purpose of the first was to determine if the level of performance of college students would be higher if the allowable length of the assignment was greater or smaller. Subjects were 126 education majors at a large state university participating in an extra-credit program called the Voluntary Homework System (VHS) as part of a course in educational psychology. The maximum number of test items prepared for extra credit that could be submitted each week was set at 100 for one group and 25 for a second group. Students gave self reports of their own competence. Analysis of variance indicated that length limit and perceived self-competence level affected performance, with a significantly lower level of  performance produced by the 100-item limit. In a second study, 63 students from the same course had a 25-item length limit and were graded according to preset criteria of 300 points for a single bonus and 450 points for a double bonus. Other aspects of the VHS were identical. The grading criteria tended to affect performance differently for the different self-competence levels. Its overall impact was not great, but students low in perceived self-competence tended to receive the greatest motivational boost. Implications for instruction are discussed.

Testing is an inherently circular and two-sided process; to know which questions are appropriate, the examiner has to have asked some questions. Educational measurement becomes conversational when it makes the articulation of the object of discourse and the negotiation of meaning the  first task of measurement. The measurement models of G. Rasch and B. D. Wright allow the object of discourse to represent itself through the players involved.

Subjects were 124 students at Purdue University (Indiana). After reading three practice texts for which subjects were administered a test that was in line with their expectancies, subjects read and attempted to free-recall a fairy tale or an expository text. The only expectancy to significantly enhance recall relative to the intentional learning control was the essay expectancy, and this enhancement was limited to the expository text. Results were congruent with the hypothesis that subjects expecting an essay  test perform more organizational processing of the text than do those expecting other test formats. The authors suggest that there was no increase in recall of the fairy tale due to the essay expectancy because subjects routinely perform organizational processing while reading a fairy tale.

Specifically, log-linear models were used to investigate whether contingency tables for ethnicity (55 African Americans, 186 Anglo Americans, and 189 Hispanic Americans) or gender (332 males and 627 females) by item response by mental health status suggested evidence of an interaction between the background variable and item response. The investigation focused on a set of 35 Likert-type items that measure subjective well- being and coping behavior. Several log-linear models were fit to the data, and  rationale for the composition of the various models is discussed. Among tables where a statistically significant ethnicity by item response interaction or a gender by item response interaction was found, the technique of proportional standardization to unity was used to plot response rates according to ethnic and gender subgroups. Plots show that most of the interaction comes from respondents whose mental health status is diminished. In general, log-linear models were found useful for investigating DIF. Two tables and 24 graphs present study data. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"Collaborations between teachers and researchers at summer workshops were studied. The workshops were part of a project of the American Federation of Teachers and the Learning Research and Development Center of the University of Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) to enhance mathematics education by making information about the latest research available to the teaching community. The focus was on the contrast between the workshop in 1988 and that of 1989. In 1988, it was evident that the dialogue between researchers and the three teachers necessary to accomplish project goals had not been achieved. This workshop's product--a document summarizing research for dissemination to teachers--was not the desired synthesis of ideas, and the atmosphere seemed to hinder teachers' opportunity to  discuss content areas. In 1989, teacher selection procedures were changed, two additional teachers participated, and interactions were designed to be less formal and to recognize that teacher participants were operating with a store of knowledge and a strong sense of what was important. Analysis of the videotaped dialogues from both years indicated the increased engagement of all parties with the substantive content of the research. This second workshop's product document was a better synthesis of the ideas discussed and was useful in the dissemination of the ideas by teacher participants in workshops for other teachers. Two tables and eight bar graphs illustrate the study. An appendix describes the sampling design used. (SLD)",

A return rate of 67% (228 practitioners) was obtained. A total of 216 questionnaires from 103 males and 113 females were included in the data analysis. The average respondent served 148 individual students last year, conducted 34 initial LD evaluations and 22 reevaluations, and reported direct  data-gathering responsibilities in 74% of initial evaluations and 65% of reevaluations. Ability-achievement discrepancy criteria were used for placement according to 90% of the respondents and were recommended for future use by 56% of those answering the question (a plurality of 46% of respondents). The effect of prereferral interventions was mixed. Implications for the evaluation of students referred for LD placement and roles for the school psychologist are addressed.

Valid results with relatively small numbers of examinees represent one of the advantages typically attributed to this procedure. In this study, examinee item responses were simulated to contain differentially functioning items, and then were analyzed at five sample sizes (2,000, 1,000, 500, 200, and 100) to compare detection rates. Five different 75-item tests were generated for each group. Results show that the MH procedure missed more than 30% of the differentially functioning items when groups of 2,000 were used. When 500 or fewer examinees were retained in each group, more than 50% of the differentially functioning items were missed. The items most  likely to be undetected were those that were difficult, those with a small difference in item difficulty between the two groups, and poorly discriminating items.

        "description":"Item response theory (IRT) model parameter estimates have considerable merit and open up new directions for test development, but misleading results are often obtained because of errors in the item parameter estimates. The problem of the effects of item parameter estimation errors on the test development process is discussed, and the seriousness of the problem is demonstrated with simulated data sets. Solutions are offered for this problem in test development practice, which arises because item information functions are determined by item parameter values that in turn contain error. When the best items are selected on the basis of their statistical characteristics, there is a tendency to capitalize on chance due to errors in the item parameter estimates; among the generally  promising test items, items with parameter estimates that are the most overestimated are also the most likely to be selected. As a result, the test falls short of the test desired or expected. Simulation studies using a hypothetical pool of 150 test items with sample sizes of 1,000 and 400 confirmed that tests do not perform as well as expected when items are selected to match a target test information function and standard errors are correspondingly underestimated. The following suggestions for eliminating this problem are presented: (1) use large samples in item calibration to gain precision in item parameter estimates; (2) revise the extreme item parameter estimates by subtracting one or two standard errors from their values; and (3) exceed the desired target information by 20 to 30%.  Two tables and six graphs supplement the discussion. (SLD)",

The evaluation results for teachers with special assignments were examined, since many teachers felt that their special areas did not lend themselves to successful classroom observation. The evaluation system uses the observations of trained observers who rate the teacher on 28 identified teaching practices and also prepare a narrative summary of teacher performance. It was hypothesized that ratings of teachers in special assignment areas would not differ from ratings for other types of classroom teaching. These assignment areas were: (1) kindergarten; (2) combination classes; (3) classes for exceptional  children and vocational education; and (4) secondary classes in specific subject areas. Evaluation data were gathered for over 5,000 teachers in grades 1 through 5 in both 1988 and 1989. Comparisons indicate that the generic skills evaluation system did not discriminate against any class of teachers. It is also apparent that evaluators could use the system fairly and that teachers were able to improve their skills based on feedback from the observation system.

The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) should remain an indicator system but should use more performance-based methods in its assessment. National testing proposals are usually based on the false premise that measurement itself will produce positive change in education. A national examination could undermine needed and emerging reforms such as school-based management and shared decision making. A national test would tend to centralize decision making, making education less accountable to parents, students, teachers, and  the community. A national examination would not promote educational equity. The weaknesses of multiple-choice examinations are also dangers inherent in a national examination. Recommendations are made for appropriate educational reform; these include development and implementation of performance-based assessment methods. Attachment A is a statement on proposals for a national test, which summarizes the reasons for opposing a national test. Attachment B is an open letter, which discusses 10 concerns and recommendations about the roles of the NAEP and the National Assessment Governing Board.

The following key conclusions are reported: (1) a high percentage of principalships (about 30 percent) have turned over since the passage of the CSRA; (2) the turnover is expected to rise to between 40 and 50 percent by 1991; (3) all principals will be operating under 4-year performance contracts by 1991; (4) white principals were extremely likely to be retained regardless of the racial composition of the LSC; (5) no strong relationship could be established between an LSC's retention decision and the principal's race; (6) both  the percentage of Hispanic principals systemwide and the retention rate for Hispanic principals were very low; and (7) the central school administration does not give LSCs or principals adequate assistance with the selection process. Recommendations for improving communications and the recruitment process are suggested. Statistical data are presented on 11 tables.

        "description":"Despite statewide standards, the accuracy of statistical data on dropouts reported by New Jersey schools appears to vary considerably from district to district. Moreover, statewide dropout rates differ significantly depending on the method of calculation used. Several different methodologies, which incorporate unverified information collected from local school districts, result in the reporting of different statewide dropout rates in national and state reports. None of these methods includes information on individual students, or on students who drop out of elementary school. Varying interpretations of state dropout reporting requirements and the wide range of dropout rates reported by districts underscore the need for more carefully defined criteria for district reporting as  well as evaluations of the accuracy of the reported data. However, the additional information needed to accurately compute the dropout rate would place huge demands on urban districts, most of which have little or no computerized support due to financial constraints as well as to reluctance to adapt to new technologies. The Department of Education must emphasize the requirement for reporting presecondary dropouts and incorporate that information in the calculation of statewide dropout rates. A statewide electronic student tracking system, interconnected to district data bases, appears to be the only realistic solution to overseeing student enrollment status and relieving the ever-growing reporting burdens on urban districts.

Evidence of school completion, academic preparation, college participation rates, undergraduate enrollment, and college graduation rates supports the compelling observation that minorities, many of whom are in lower socioeconomic levels, are caught in a cycle of defeat and have not been well served by higher education or the education system in general. Experience indicates that the disparity among achievement levels of White, Black, Hispanic, and American Indian students will not be adequately addressed until there  is systematic change at state and institutional levels. In 1988-89, the State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO) sponsored a challenge grant program that sought responses to the following issues: (1) improved data collection and student tracking mechanisms; (2) improved student transfer functions of two-year institutions; and (3) improved funding and admissions policies. This publication presents higher education board reports from the eight states selected to develop models of success. The reports reveal that minority success requires a concerted and coordinated effort from all the partners: public schools, colleges and universities, community agencies, businesses, and state and institutional leaders.

Adolescent parents and their children depend heavily on a number of services to survive, including education, health, and social services. While some programs exist that provide a coordinated range of comprehensive services, many others are piecemeal and fragmented and operate in isolation from each other. Holistic service networks are critical in helping adolescent mothers succeed as students and parents. This report presents 16 problems and recommendations specific to the needs of pregnant and parenting teenage students. The report proposes a model education  program to coordinate available services and suggests additional health and social services. The case manager is seen as the critical link between school and other essential services as well as the means to save money by avoiding duplication. While schools cannot and should not assume complete responsibility for noneducational services, they are crucial in coordinating educational and social service agencies. Recommendations are included for both in-school and community day care programs. The report includes a bibliography listing 41 references. (AF)",

Phase I workshops were based on a needs survey, Phase II workshops were follow-up workshops, and Phase III workshops provided information on Chinese American history and literature upon request. Evaluation information included questionnaires completed by workshop participants and telephone interviews with principals and workshop participants from 11 of the 47 schools receiving services in 1989-90. A-AC met its objectives of conducting a pre-Phase I needs assessment, providing 40 Phase I workshops and 20 Phase II  workshops, and offering Phase III workshops and follow-up services upon request. It partially met its objective of providing parent workshops on request due to insufficient staff. The project should reevaluate its involvement in providing support services, given the low level of need expressed by the schools. (FMW)",

The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales were used to measure the progress of three cohorts of children from enrollment in prekindergarten or Head Start through grade 1. Preschool students were exposed to the following educational models: (1) Model M, combining child-initiated and academic, teacher-directed approaches; (2) Model AD, an academic, teacher-directed approach; and (3) Model CI, a child-initiated approach. Kindergarten students were exposed to  ModAcK/SE, emphasizing socioemotional goals, and ModAcK, emphasizing academic preparation. The following summary conclusions are presented: (1) Model M is ineffective and should be eliminated; (2) Model CI fosters a higher level of social development and basic skills than the other two models; (3) Model AD places children at a disadvantage for later social development; and (4) ModAcK/SE programs in kindergarten emphasizing socioemotional goals are more effective than ModAck programs emphasizing academics in kindergarten.

        "description":"Newly available statistical data from the March 1990 Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS) indicates that Asians and Pacific Islanders were the fastest growing minority group in the United States during the 1980s. While the size of the Asian American population trails behind the Hispanic American and Black populations, changes in immigration law and the increasing number of immigrants from Southeast Asia are likely to add to their diversity and growth. Even though Asian Americans are often viewed as an economic success story, they are not rewarded economically at a level consistent with their educational attainment. Asian Americans have slightly higher average family incomes than Whites, but they also have much higher poverty rates. The large number of Asian Americans  currently enrolled in graduate and professional schools indicates that their average family income should rise during the 1990s. However, the prospects for some of the more recent immigrant groups from Southeast Asia who have less education are not promising. The economic success of Asians makes them likely targets for the frustrations of other minority groups as well as Whites, who fear the growing economic power of the Asian-Pacific rim countries. While Asian American are perceived by Whites as the &quot;model minority,&quot; subtle employment discrimination in the form of the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; prevents Asian Americans from achieving their full economic potential. Statistical data are presented in one table and five graphs. A list of 27 references is appended. (FMW)",

The School-Library Resources Program focused on acquiring and implementing NEWSBANK, a microcomputer CD-ROM-based system providing access to information in over 400 newspapers, in 18 senior high schools. The overall impact of NEWSBANK on student achievement could not be assessed because the equipment did not arrive until the end of 1989-90. However, limited statistical data from the pilot project site  indicated a high amount of student use. ITFS focused on improving the use of instructional television (ITV) to support the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC), in-service teacher education, and production of live mathematics tutorial programs for grades 4-12. Problems with collecting statistical data at most sites prevented a clear assessment of program impact.

However, they have noted the global revolution in the development and application of computers. Most Africans believe that computers and intensive and relevant education for all provide opportunities for speeding up the development process. Although most education in African nations is directed at youths, computers could be applied to many aspects of African adult education, such as retaining students, providing information systems, retraining, computer literacy, distance education, and computer conferencing. Conversely, several problems could develop in the use of computers in adult education, such as  computer-related crimes, policy setbacks, the presence of nontechnical administrators, an inadequate supply of personnel, an inadequate infrastructure, costs, technical issues, and suspicion of computers. Surmounting such problems requires concerted international cooperation in fostering the use of computers in Africa, training adults in computer use, and promoting adult education research.

Unfortunately, the current policy on education is targeted to young people who go on to college. Another fundamental problem with schools is that the school curriculum has become disconnected from real work. Education must be about opportunity. Students, teachers, and youths and the educational problems they encounter are also Education Act, as reauthorized in 1990, incorporates some of these priorities. The new law focuses on accountability for program quality and student achievement; program improvement; flexible regulations that will permit state and local educators maximum freedom to develop programs that meet student  needs; the integration of vocational and academic curricula; and the Tech Prep Education Program that strengthens partnerships between secondary and postsecondary educators. Business has an important role to play to reform education. Education and business relationships improve the school-to-work transition by helping vocational education respond to changes in the labor market and by ensuring that students get the skills needed for available jobs.

It examines and discusses current issues, legislation, and action being taken regarding educational programs that assist this at-risk population about to enter the school-to-work transition. The paper also analyzes the school's role in this process. The unique educational needs of these youth and the educational problems they encounter are also studied. Current federal legislation that directly affects the educational welfare of this target population and legislative changes considered in the 100th Congress are reviewed. The paper concludes with a call for youth at risk to be considered a priority in the design of first-chance programs, primarily  those outlined within the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act considered in the 100th Congress.

        "description":"During the years 1988-1990, the Virginia vocational education delivery system directed its resources toward achieving the purposes of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act. Significant progress was made in coordinating secondary and postsecondary programs, developing 2+2 check prep initiatives, integrating academic and vocational curricula, serving target populations, and improving program and service quality. When compared to national standards, the 14 Service Delivery Areas (SDAs) that comprise the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) delivery system reflected a high level of accomplishment. Services provided to JTPA participants included on-the-job training, customized skills training, work experience, basic education, job search assistance, employability development,  and youth services. Coordination activities between vocational education and JTPA were undertaken in school divisions, community colleges, correctional institutions, and SDAs. The broadly based efforts emphasized coordination with education beyond the agreement in the vocational plan. The Virginia Council on Vocational Education held public meetings, made program visits, suggested activities for the state vocational education plan, solicited and disseminated descriptions of innovative programs, and made Business and Industry Partnership Awards and Advisory Council and Advisory Committee Awards. (A listing of SDAs and a cooperative agreement are appended.) (YLB)",

A total of 336 usable questionnaires from a sample of 477 were returned. About 40 percent thought OSHA's enforcement program was effective; about 95 percent thought the inspection force needed to be increased; about 75 percent thought civil fines were inadequate to serve as a deterrent to safety and health violations; and about 80 percent thought increased use of criminal sanctions would greatly  reduce violations. Inspectors identified over 75 safety and health hazards that were unregulated but should have been and believed health standards were more difficult for employers to understand than safety standards. Most reported that lack of knowledge contributed greatly to work-related injuries and illnesses and believed OSHA's efforts to increase knowledge about workplace safety and health were moderately effective for employers and less effective for workers. Most thought current levels of employer and worker involvement in safety and health activities were too low.

The publication is organized in seven chapters. Chapter 1 discusses briefly the history of adult vocational training, reviews its purposes, describes the prominent features of adult vocational education, offers a rationale, and suggests a model for developing a promotion plan. The remaining chapters, which follow the six steps of the promotion plan, cover: determining needs for training, retraining, and upgrading; setting funding goals; developing objectives for program goals; identifying the public; selecting the marketing mix; and developing the implementation plan. Ten  appendixes provide the following: needs survey query, sample promotion plan, sample information sheet, sample schedule of classes, sample public service announcements, sample speech for civic organizations, news release for seeking additional funds, sample letter for seeking support through funding, sample speech for businesses for government groups, and letter to businesses for customized training.

Chapter I defines \"eldercare,\" discusses the role of caregivers in the work force, describes caregiver tasks and relationships, and outlines basic needs of caregivers. Chapter II presents a rationale for the participation of aging network agencies in developing employer-based eldercare programs. These types of programs with which businesses are becoming involved are described: information and referral; informational resources; seminars, workshops, and forums; support groups; training for business managers and employee assistance staff; caregivers' fairs; written materials for employee  publications; case management; directory of services/resource manual; respite care; caregiver library; and employee surveys. Brief descriptions follow of several employers' programs in eldercare. Chapter III focuses on approaching the business community about eldercare. It addresses selecting businesses, approaching targeted businesses, assessing the competition, determining whom to approach, and determining fee schedules. Section IV poses five problems associated with making an eldercare program appealing to employers and suggests strategies to solve them. Chapter V offers suggestions on how State Units on Aging can serve in a leadership role in developing eldercare programs. An appendix lists print and nonprint resources. (YLB)",

In 1988, the earnings gap for hourly earnings was 26 percent; for weekly earnings, 30 percent; and for annual earnings, 34 percent. Although the direction over the past decade is toward greater equality, the pace is extremely slow. The earnings ratio data are not uniform among all occupations. In nontraditional occupations, women receive approximately equal compensation. In more traditional jobs, employers can still act to keep wages low. Traditionally, women have \"crowded\" into a few occupations. Arguably, women choose an occupation that tends to have less skill obsolescence for workers who leave and reenter the labor force and requires less educational  commitment. They may have been fearful of employment opportunities in other occupations because of lack of knowledge about the field or fear of sexual harassment. Factors besides occupational choice that may affect the earnings gap include seniority within the firm and in the job and higher turnover rates for women. The effect of sex discrimination on the earnings gap is hard to measure. The earnings gap is narrowing and should continue to do so as women work more hours in the week, spend more years at work in their lifetimes, continue to increase their educational investment, and widen their occupational choices.

Objectives were to determine intrinsic motivation factors that influence special needs populations during their vocational training programs and their transition into employment and to determine how this information can be used to help them through the transition process. A literature review identified attitudinal, motivational, and affective measures associated with transition efforts and factors associated with successful transition processes. Strategies and a conceptual model were then developed to assess the identified motivation-related factors. The assessment strategies were administered to a sample of special needs learners. Ten vocational instructors and nine  support service providers at two technical colleges were questioned about instructional problems and accommodations related to students with low intrinsic motivation; they also reviewed assessment strategies. The program developed a conceptual model of the key aspects of intrinsic motivation factors; a table of specifications that identifies the issues that motivation assessment should address; and surveys and diagnostic interviews. (An attachment is a three-page summary of a national survey of 1,265 professional association members to determine opinions about the relative importance of six concepts related to categories of issues that affect students' motivation traits.)

It strengthens the achievement of those goals with an initiative to establish independent assessment of whether the schools are reaching them. As endorsed by the majority of the  committee members, the bill contains modifications that include school-based management/shared decision making, model schools of excellence, mathematics and science programs, star schools programs, high technology educational techniques, and dropout prevention.

        "description":"A project studied the early labor market experiences of the high school graduates of the class of 1980 who attended proprietary schools. The analysis was based on the &quot;High School and Beyond&quot; survey that followed that class through January 1986. About 9 percent of the 1980 seniors attended proprietary schools, and more than half of them completed their programs. Many proprietary school students enrolled in colleges as well. The study found that the proprietary school students were more like students who attended community colleges or had no education beyond high school than they were like four-year college students. However, they often had higher family socioeconomic status and a stronger orientation toward work. Higher proportions were women and black. The analysis showed that  men who attended proprietary schools were no more likely to be employed than men who attended only high school. Although their hourly earnings were higher, this appeared to be due to factors such as social status rather than to their training. Women who attended proprietary schools were more likely to be employed than women who only completed high school, and their hourly earnings were also higher. Although other factors could have affected their earnings, completing proprietary school was at least partly responsible. Students who attended proprietary schools had no more difficulty repaying their loans than college students. Three appendixes include (1) description of the methodology of the study (explaining use of the data from the High School and Beyond Survey, specifying models used  for predicting labor market outcomes, and explaining how information on tuition, grants and loans was compiled); (2) a set of 18 tables; and (3) an annotated list of 14 other studies with findings about students who attended proprietary schools.

It is designed to address the increasing gap between emerging job requirements and the ability of Florida's work force to meet them. It was developed to prepare students for the world of work, a competitive global marketplace that is changing every day. It is also designed to enable all high school graduates to get a job. The blueprint provides a rationale and framework for career education, sets goals, and suggests practical methods of achieving them for each grade level. It also advocates school-business partnerships and describes some possibilities. Following a statement of the Department of Education's commitment to leadership, the blueprint sets out a  6-year plan for action to enable all schools in Florida to participate in the plan. A glossary, a chart comparing rates of growth in occupations between 1984 and 2000, and a 23-item bibliography are included in this document. (KC)",

        "description":"Few studies have been conducted on nontraditional student attrition in postsecondary vocational educational programs. This lack of attention is due to methodological limitations, lack of priority on data collection in vocational education, and lack of perceived need for research. The conceptual model of student attrition in postsecondary vocational education proposed in this paper is is adapted from other conceptual and theoretical approaches found in studies conducted in two- and four-year postsecondary institutions. The model draws also upon the previous research on traditional students, including Spady's model of the undergraduate dropout process (1971), Tinto's longitudinal model of student persistence (1975), and Pascarella et al.'s model (1983). Other sources include  studies that focus on nontraditional students, such as Bean and Metzner's model of nontraditional student attrition in postsecondary education settings and Brown and Kayser's model of educational adjustment. The proposed model includes several new variables. It is developed to account for attrition among different subgroups of nontraditional students. Exogenous factors describing students' backgrounds include disability and outside community agency support received. The model also seeks to examine the interrelationships of disability and disadvantage with external environmental factors. Several concepts described and tested in other models, \"institutional commitment\" and \"social integration,\" are expanded in this model. (157 references) (YLB)",

A new tutor data application form was also developed. Space was provided for comments by the volunteers regarding training and the five-step process and observations by the staff of the volunteer's potential. An objective that  was not achieved was the provision of a process for staff, volunteer, and student to assess the program's procedures.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine how parents perceive their involvement in planning the transition from school to work for their children with disabilities. A random sample of 240 parents in 9 school districts in Texas identified as having exemplary disabilities programs were contacted with a mailed survey, and 17 parents volunteered as a result of advertising in parent newsletters. Of the 240 surveys mailed, 50 were returned (20 percent); 9 of the 17 volunteers responded to the survey. Most of the parents who responded had children aged 16-18; 32 were White, 7 Black, 7 Hispanic, and 4 Asian. The study found that 46 percent of the parents had never been contacted by the school about their child's transition; most who had been contacted were contacted only once or twice; and  only 13 parents reported some type of involvement. The study concluded that although the response rate was too low to draw any firm conclusions, it appears that many parents are ill-informed regarding transition and transition planning for their children with disabilities. It is possible that the low response rate is indicative of the status of parental involvement: parents may not have understood enough about transition planning to complete the survey instrument. Further research, to include telephone interviews and case studies, is planned. (13 references) (KC)",

According to a survey of teachers, the strength of the program is the high level of awareness of and instruction directed toward career development needs in senior high school and integrated activities in the elementary school.  Teachers cited the following program weakenesses: lack of K-12 planning and delivery of a career education strand in the curriculum, lack of resources, and low level of awareness of career education in the elementary and junior high school. Students surveyed saw areas of greatest need as self-analysis, job-seeking skills, and ability to locate information on careers.

A survey research tool was designed to reveal perceptions of the value placed on various adult education publications. The first part contained a list of 393 English language books related to the adult education field. Respondents were encouraged to include additional publications they had found to be of value; this resulted in 125 new books and monographs being mentioned. Participants checked on a final list those publications they judged to be of high value. The second part of the instrument contained several questions designed to obtain demographic information about the respondents. Responses were returned by 135 out of 400 adult educators. Most respondents mentioned a fairly large  number (39.13) of books of value. Eight of the top 20 were focused on adult learning or adults as learners, including the top 5 books. Eight were general, historical, or introductory in nature. The other four covered topics of continuing professional education, program planning, more radical approaches to adult education, and research. Suggestions for further research included an update every decade; a larger, more diverse audience; a study of the value of journal articles and conference papers; and an evaluation of the sources.

        "description":"The most prominent theories of unemployment that have emerged since 1960 are search, disequilibrium, implicit contracts, efficiency wage, and insider/outsider models. Search models assume that it takes time and effort for employers and potential employees to find each other. A &quot;partial-partial&quot; equilibrium approach focuses on one side of the market. The reservation wage approach focuses on the problem of finding an employer willing to offer adequate compensation. The most promising is the trade friction approach. The fixed price or disequilibrium literature shows that the most effective policy for combating unemployment depends upon which markets are out of equilibrium. Recent work has shown that imperfect competition in a general equilibrium setting may result in &quot;coordination  failures.&quot; Basic assumptions underlying research in implicit contracts are that contract terms are isolated from market forces and that workers are more averse to risk than employers are. This line of research has encountered difficulties in attempting to explain the coexistence of wage rigidity and unemployment in a contracting framework. The two most promising lines of research in an attempt to explain wage rigidity and unemployment are efficiency wage theory and the insider/outsider theory of unemployment. Two issues remain: empirical verification of critical features of the models and similarities across models. (An index and 176 references are provided.) (YLB)",

        "description":"This handbook is designed as a tool and resource document for school and agency personnel involved in the school-to-work transition of persons with disabilities. It includes forms, checklists, and sample documents. After a brief overview describing why transition has become a national priority, an individualized 4-year transition process is presented. This process uses both an Individualized Education Plan and an Individualized Transition Plan. It is recommended that school and agency personnel plan and coordinate services by using the Individualized Transition Planning and Record Sheet. Since a variety of school and agency personnel often have a role in the transition planning process, the roles and responsibilities of each potential participant--students, parents, school and  agency personnel and employers--are described and discussed. Given the multitude of personnel involved in a smooth transition process, a section on team building discusses ways to assemble teams initially, develop interagency agreements, and work together to eliminate gaps in services so youth experience an effective transition process that results in employment. Twenty-two references and a glossary are provided, followed by these appendixes: Ohio Cooperative Agreement for Supported Employment; camera-ready masters; charts of organization service areas; outlines of legislation affecting transition; transparency masters; and capsule descriptions of exemplary transition programs.

        "description":"The 1987 annual survey of the state directors of correctional education was designed to gain basic information about correctional education programs provided in the adult and juvenile correctional systems in each state. Of the 82 adult, juvenile, and consolidated state correctional systems in the United States, 49 responded. Additional data were collected from the 1987 American Correctional Association Directory. Statistical procedures determined that the sample was representative of the total population of correctional systems. The two main findings on administrative structure and personnel were that 52 percent were administered through a state department of corrections and most state directors were middle-aged males with long tenure in their positions. Highlights of findings on  type and extent of programs provided showed that: General Educational Development test preparation was the only educational program offered to a uniformly high degree across all types of correctional systems; adult correctional systems provided adult basic education at 84 percent of their institutions; and the average percentage of inmate enrollment in the majority of educational programs was low. Among the findings on financial resources were that the average starting salary for an instructor was $19,667 and that juvenile correctional systems spent a much greater amount of money per inmate.

        "description":"A study examined Missouri postsecondary marketing and midmanagement curricula to determine consistencies and inconsistencies among the programs and to develop specific guidelines for articulation between secondary and postsecondary programs. Postsecondary marketing and midmanagement information--program requirements, course descriptions and outlines, and course hour or credit allocations--were collected and analyzed. Major differences noted in institutions offering a marketing or midmanagement program leading to the degree of Associate of Applied Science were in program title, program requirements, required courses for degree, course credit hours, and internship requirement. Curriculum and articulation guidelines were collected from other states. In general, articulation programs  were based on one of two models: time-shortened or advanced-skills. Recommended guidelines for postsecondary marketing and midmanagement programs were developed, calling for uniform program titles, program descriptions, program lengths, delivery models, and internship/simulation experience requirements. Recommended guidelines were developed for articulation of students enrolled in secondary marketing education programs into postsecondary programs. (Following the report are seven appendixes containing a course/institution matrix, summaries of two Wisconsin articulation plans, an articulation flow chart, and other project materials. An explanation of procedures, a list of 12 references, and a glossary are also included. (YLB)",

        "author":["Meyer, Earl C."],
        "description":"Effective strategies for developing the affective work competencies of marketing education students include teaching procedures, acquisition of skills and materials for teaching in the affective domain, and implementation considerations. Affective concerns in marketing can be grouped into three broad types of performance categories--self-concept, human relations skills, and work attitudes. Techniques for self-concept development include opportunities to overcome feared situations, goal setting techniques, positive affirmations, and positive social reinforcement. Procedures for developing human relations skills are role playing, behavior modeling, and coaching. Procedures for developing work attitudes include self-evaluation, discrimination activities, controlled practice, and  experiential opportunities. Teacher coordinators who need to acquire the skills and materials to assist student development in the affective domain can acquire them through independent efforts, ranging from personal research and experimentation to participation in commercial self-improvement programs. Successful implementation of the affective curriculum requires that instruction be designed with specific outcomes in mind. Key factors include the following: (1) developmental activities should be spread throughout the program; (2) the teacher coordinator's attitude toward the affective domain is most critical; and (3) evaluation of progress should be measured by observations in the workplace.

        "description":"A study surveyed 4,400 students enrolled in 24 of the 26 private career schools who were members of the Minnesota Association of Private Postsecondary Schools in January 1990. A questionnaire gathered demographic data on students, information on how they came to choose the school and program, and students' assessment of the quality of the training and services they received. Analysis of the data revealed that a majority of students were women, white, beyond the typical college-going age, single, and high school graduates. Students rejected other types of institutions because they thought the quality of programs offered was poor, the program was too long, or the institution did not offer a program in a field of interest. The primary reason students chose a particular school was  its reputation for job placement. Students indicated they would recommend the school to a friend. Over 70 percent were satisfied with admissions, their programs, facility and equipment, and job placement assistance. Few student characteristics were significantly associated with satisfaction with school. Differences among students enrolled in schools accredited by the three major accrediting bodies--National Association of Trade and Technical Schools, Association of Independent Colleges and Schools, and National Accrediting Commission of Cosmetology Arts and Sciences--were identified.

        "description":"Recent legislation on adult basic education (ABE) in the Netherlands has two important aims: to offer one uniform organizational financial structure and to improve educational quality. ABE institutes have concentrated on restructuring the organization and merging the precursors. The change in structure is supported by a change in organizational culture with a focus on substance and innovation. A review of the social construction and reconstruction of school culture distinguishes at least three domains: the functioning of the principal; the nature and degree of goal consensus; and the nature of professional relations in the team. A study examined current practices in 17 institutes for ABE. The research instruments used were indepth interviews, document analysis, and observations.  The new principal was found to play a crucial role in bringing together the precursors and in introducing and implementing curricular innovations. Some principals had a &quot;second&quot; leader in the form of dual management. The nature of the courses offered by the institute had an impact on goal consensus. Most institutes offered a broad range of courses for various target groups. Problems in fostering professional cooperation were lack of contact among teachers and failure to involve teachers in policy matters and issues concerning course content. (16 references) (YLB)",

The latter two sections had two scales: frequency of occurrence and degree of impact. The survey sought to determine the kinds of induction assistance that beginning vocational teachers perceived they needed and to compare perceptions to what they actually received in their first year. Of a total sample of 625 teachers, 352 returned usable responses. The proportion involved in beginning teacher assistance programs was dismally low--only 25 percent. Slightly over half reported having a mentor or buddy teacher assigned. Involvement was higher among nonteacher education certified teachers than teacher  education certified teachers. The most frequently reported form of assistance was feedback and evaluation from the principal; almost a quarter did not receive a curriculum guide for organizing a course they had never taught. In general, the types of assistance that teachers regarded as important tended to be ones that are most frequently experienced. Positive experiences occurred much more frequently than negative experiences. Recommendations were that all beginning teachers be provided with curriculum guides and instructional materials; inservice programs be spread out over the year; and teachers be provided with released time for planning.

Ten purposefully selected groups of beginning vocational teachers from eight different states participated in nominal group technique sessions. Two groups were selected for intensive follow-up for case study. A mail survey of a stratified sample (n=625) of all first-year vocational teachers in the United States was conducted near the end of the 1989-90 school year; 352 usable responses were received. Findings from the qualitative research indicated that teacher education certified (TEC) teachers primarily noted problems related to students. Nonteacher education certified (NTEC) teachers tended to focus more on the facilities and materials. Case study analyses confirmed  differences in the nature of problems faced by TEC and NTEC teachers. The positive experiences identified were focused predominantly on students; case study analyses confirmed the results. Findings from the national survey showed that (1) only 25 percent of respondents were involved in assistance programs but over half had a mentor or buddy teacher assigned; (2) two items with the highest perceived impact rating dealt with curriculum and availability of curriculum guides; and (3) assistance items rated as \"major\" impact were among the most frequently reported. Recommendations included assignment of a mentor or buddy, provision of curriculum guides, extra assistance for teachers taken from industry, and thorough orientation. (18 references) (YLB)",

        "description":"Organizing adult education must be done within the context of development policy. Cultural filters should be used in considering theory and research knowledge. A sensitive use of cultural filters also applies to learning from practice. An assumption is that there should be interfacing and interlinking structures of primary education and adult education. At the other end are innovations in organizational structures, including some micro-institutional arrangements; some important organizational themes; and examples of total systems of institutional arrangements to deliver adult education services on a national scale. An agenda for action has organizational tasks intended to achieve institution building and organizational design and development. Ideology and technology are the two  dimensions of the model. Operational steps to develop an organizational system to deliver adult education include: (1) establishing a National Adult Education Council; (2) developing a national mission; (3) surveying adult education; (4) making sociogeographic maps; (5) developing the blueprint for a comprehensive organizational network; (6) socially mobilizing resources; (7) providing technical and professional leadership and support; (8) developing organizational capacity building through training; (9) developing and deploying resources; and (10) developing and sustaining political will.

        "description":"A 1990 questionnaire and interview survey identified requirements for programs and courses relating to human resource development for international operation. The survey was designed to seek the views of United Kingdom (UK) and European and international companies, professional associations, and accounting firms. Of 540 organizations, 91 returned usable surveys. Organizations reported that &quot;creating a more flexible and responsive organization&quot; was the key human resource issue. Non-UK organizations ranked &quot;Europeanization&quot; and &quot;internationalization&quot; significantly more highly. The most important quality sought in members of a senior management team was &quot;strategic awareness.&quot; Organizations cited marketing, business policy, and corporate planning as the subject areas in which a  European element should be most significant. Education and development at the executive program level for senior management and directors ranked highest in importance. The most relevant modes of study were &quot;tailored company-specific programs&quot; with a &quot;project component&quot; and &quot;in-company delivery.&quot; Human resources and marketing were the two most important &quot;core subjects&quot; of a Master's in Business Administration (MBA) program. In two-thirds of the cases, the employer took the initiative regarding participation in MBA programs. European and/or international awareness and perspective were developed through experience rather than through formal training. (The instrument is appended.) (YLB)",

        "description":"Influences upon trends in literacy research include national and international agendas, active networks, and public images of literacy. Five trends in literacy research can be discerned. The first trend is research that tries to determine the extent of difficulties with literacy and its causes. Another trend is a shift in views and definitions of literacy toward a \"social view.\" Third, a trend toward developing models of literacy learning appropriate for adults is noticeable. The fourth trend is an appreciation of the diversity of needs for literacy within the populations of industrialized countries and the development of flexible types of provision to meet these needs. A fifth trend is toward seeing literacy within the broader framework of language policy within a country and  investigating the accessibility of contemporary language. Appropriate prerequisites for adult literacy research are examination of links between research and practice, an interdisciplinary approach, and international networks. (Appendixes include 129 references, examples of international and national agendas for literacy, summaries of methods and results of selected literacy surveys, and information on an exchange network on functional literacy in industrialized countries. An abstract in French is provided.) (YLB)",

Specifically, SCANS determined the level of skills required to enter employment. Fundamental changes in the nature of work were identified; these changes were found to hold implications for the kinds of workers and workplaces the nation must create. The research verified that &quot;workplace know-how&quot; defined effective job performance. This know-how had two elements: competencies and foundation skills. To describe how this know-how is used on the job, five scenarios were developed that portray work requirements in the context of the real world. The scenarios came from five sectors of the economy: manufacturing, health  services, retail trade, accommodations and food service, and office services. They showed that work involved a complex interplay among five competencies (resources, interpersonal, information, systems, and technology) and three elements of the foundation (basic skills, thinking skills, and personal qualities). A proficiency scale with five levels was proposed: preparatory, work-ready, intermediate, advanced, and specialist. Three major conclusions were reached: (1) all U.S. high school students must develop the competencies and foundation skills; (2) the high performance qualities of the most competitive companies must become the standard for most companies; and (3) the nation's schools must become high performance organizations. (A letter to parents, employers, and educators and an  executive summary are provided. Appendixes include definitions of the competencies and the foundation.) (YLB)",

Counselors may have to work with students affected by drug addiction, fetal alcohol syndrome, homelessness, poverty, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and divorce. Students may present problems of sexual, physical, emotional abuse and neglect; violence; poor housing; poor health; or racial discrimination. To indicate worth and value of students individually, the guidance counselor needs to accept each learner intrinsically. Much assistance and help needs to be given to teachers to accept each student. Guidance counselors can help teachers secure the interests of students; assist students in attaching meaning to each  presentation; and provide for individual differences. The guidance counselor needs to impress upon teachers the necessity of accepting each student and assisting each to attain proficiency. The guidance counselor needs to assist teachers in understanding the principles of behaviorism and humanism. Helping teachers help students is one of the vital roles guidance counselors play. Securing the interests of students, providing for individual differences, and attaching meaning to ongoing lessons and units are some criteria which should be considered when teaching students.

        "description":"This survey analyzed the nature and level of services in adolescent pregnancy prevention in the developing countries of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. While focusing on programs to prevent adolescent pregnancy, many of the groups surveyed were also responding to the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic in their work with youth. The majority of the organizations also provided services to youth beyond reproductive health, such as tutoring and scholarships, income generation and vocational education, and general adolescent health services and community development. An analysis of the 103 programs that responded to the survey found that the majority of the organizations were nongovernmental organizations which relied heavily on overseas assistance. A variety of  professionals worked in the programs, but health professionals and educators were the personnel most commonly found. The most frequently reached clientele were in-school youth, although many programs also served school drop-outs. The sex education offered by most of these programs focused on the biological aspects of reproduction, but more than one-half of the programs also included additional information. Peer education as a method of sex education continued to be an important component of many adolescent pregnancy prevention programs. The vast majority said they offered contraceptive services, with condoms being the most frequently cited method, followed by oral contraceptives. Printed educational materials for youth continued to be an important aspect of sex education. The report also  provides a directory of programs by region and country that includes program name and address, type of organization, age range of clientele, and program focus. (LLL)",

In addition, the study examined whether high or low use youths differed on items related to a health orientation including health risk factors, sense of coherence items, and health value items. A group identification approach was used to obtain a sample of high risk youth among 1,200 high school students from rural and urban Southern California. A total of 82 youths identified themselves as belonging to a high risk group. High school-aged high risk youth showed the problem-prone distinguishing characteristics of relatively high risk-taking, noninvolvement with  sports, and greater use of cigarettes and alcohol. The youths also showed greater socio-environmental use of cigarettes, a greater likelihood to violate norms to protect their friends, greater self-reported family conflict, and greater likelihood to use revenge or have a party as coping strategies. These youths were somewhat lower on risk factor items, sense of coherence items, and health values. However, aside from three of the risk factor items (likelihood of becoming a smoker, likelihood of becoming a drinker, and getting exercise), the youths did not differ from the other groups on the health-related items. Consideration of the social context of high risk youths along with the value they place on their health seems of major importance to decrease the likelihood that they will become  regular smokers.

It offers helpful advice to top management, supervisors, employee representatives, and workers. The first section discusses whether drugs in the workplace are a problem, the next section explains how to tell if employees have problems with drugs, and the third section discusses what can be done about the problem of drugs in the workplace. It is recommended that top management review organizational options, set the policy, and assign accountability. Supervisors are encouraged to confront workers with performance problems and to refer workers to employee assistance programs (EAPs) or other forms of assistance. It is suggested that employee representatives consult with management, that union  representatives develop a member assistance program, and that workers themselves establish a system of peer referral. A section on alternatives to drugs in the workplace explores EAP options. Descriptions of 10 model programs and three sample policies are appended, along with drug fact sheets on cannabis, inhalants, cocaine, other stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, narcotics, and designer drugs. A discussion of drug testing and list of resources are also included. (NB)",

It analyzes public and private sector policies, practices, and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing and eliminating alcohol and other drug problems. An introduction by Robert L. DuPont desribes the history of environmental approaches to the prevention of alcohol and other drug use. \"Illicit Drug, Tobacco, and Alcohol Use Among Youth: Trends and Promising Approaches in Prevention\" (Lawrence Wallack and Kitty Corbett) reviews the recent history of AOD abuse prevention efforts and concludes that a broad-based, comprehensive approach is needed. \"On Drugs and Mass Media in  America's Consumer Society\" (Todd Gitlin) argues that drug use is a predictable consequence of U.S. culture's emphasis on consumerism and immediate gratification. \"Stories That Hurt: Tobacco, Alcohol, and Other Drugs in the Mass Media\" (George Gerbner) summarizes research on the interrelation of drugs and the mass media and offers insights into the conflicts underlying mass media messages about drugs. \"Drug Availability in a Public Health Perspective\" (James F. Mosher) focuses on the availability of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana, contending that new regulatory and legal policies should be considered that address all levels of drug availability.

Chapter 1 identifies three types of services usually offered by information centers (lending materials, document delivery, and reference services) and suggests activities helpful in providing these services. Chapter 2 focuses on the tasks and duties of the center's professional and clerical staff. Chapter 3 looks at space, furniture, and  equipment; chapter 4 considers the focus of the collection and the types of materials in the center; and chapter 5 concentrates on getting materials from local and national sources. Chapters 6 and 7 focus on organization: how to organize the shelves and how to organize the subject files. Chapters 8, 9, and 10 focus on guidelines for providing services, how to promote the center, and evaluation, respectively. A bibliography contains citations for books and articles on running an information center, alcohol and drug periodicals for the basic collection, core reference books and documents, and relevant addresses.

Its primary focus is on the possible costs and benefits of part-time work among high school seniors. The focus of the report is on three psychosocial themes: problem behaviors (drug and alcohol use, aggression, victimization); time use (sleep, exercise, recreation); and subjective experiences (satisfaction, self-esteem). Results are presented which revealed that hours of work were positively correlated with smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, using illicit drugs, interpersonal aggression, theft, trouble with police, arguments with parents, victimization, lack of sleep, lack of exercise,  and truancy, and negatively correlated with seniors' satisfaction with the way their leisure time was spent and the amount of fun they had. It is also noted that self-esteem showed practically no correlation with hours worked. The document concludes that the interpretation of these findings is difficult since long working hours (and high earnings) are reactions to other factors, some of which may be pre-existing problems. It is suggested that policies aimed at curbing hours or earnings should be viewed with caution at this point. Two tables and 33 figures are included. (NB)",

The paper focuses on two areas: the reconceptualization of psychoanalytic developmental psychology, and the impact on psychoanalytic metatheory. The discussion is limited to Stern's first stage of development, The Emergent Self. Implications of infant observational research in general and Stern's work in particular for the reconceptualization of infant psychosocial developmental theory are discussed. The works of Heinz Hartmann, Rene Spitz, and Margaret Mahler are reviewed. A discussion of some methodological changes implemented by Stern is followed by  an analysis of the research Stern cites in support of his concept of the Emergent Self. Implications for psychoanalytic metatheory are then discussed. Stern's Emergent Self is contrasted to Mahler's stages of normal autism and symbiosis. The conflict between Stern's and Mahler's works is discussed using drive/structural and relational/structural models. (Author/LLL)",

        "description":"This study investigated young adults' (N=88) perceptions of their parents' sex role characteristics on the basis of maternal employment status. The object of the study was to assess whether an employed mother's nontraditional role affected perceptions of her sex-role characteristics and those of her husband. In addition, the study looked at the relationships among parental sex-role characteristics, family conflict, and negative attitude toward maternal employment. The test packet used in this study consisted of three separate questionnaires, along with a page designed to obtain background information about each subject. The three questionnaires were: the Childhood Appraisal Scale; two subscales of the Minnesota Counseling Inventory (MCI); and the BEM Sex Role Inventory. A  relationship was found between maternal masculinity and paternal femininity, which suggests that mothers who are perceived as more instrumental tend to have husbands who are seen by their children as more emotionally expressive and nurturant. Children from two-paycheck families perceived traditional sex-role differences between their parents, seeing mothers as more feminine and fathers as more masculine. Mothers in these families were also perceived as more closely approximating the feminine ideal than fathers were viewed as fulfilling the masculine ideal. Paternal femininity was significantly associated with less problematic family relationships and a reduced tendency to blame negative outcomes on maternal employment. The association between both maternal femininity and masculinity, and  more positive family relationships and less blaming of maternal employment suggests that both sets of maternal qualities facilitate two-paycheck family functioning.

It was hypothesized that black adolescents would have higher scores on the general self-esteem measure, while they would not have have higher scores on all specific self-belief components. The overall self-esteem, as well as specific self-belief components were measured in a sample of 305 black and 338 white middle school students in two small southern towns. As expected, blacks had significantly higher scores on self-esteem. However, considerable differences emerged between the two groups on a few specific self-belief components. Greatest differences in favor of blacks pertained to self-beliefs  about one's appearance and attractiveness, followed by beliefs about one's physical abilities and academic self-beliefs about reading. The reverse direction was present in relation to self-beliefs that reflected control of events. Smaller internal attributions, greater powerlessness, smaller attributions of success and failure to ability, and greater attributions of success or failure to chance and task difficulty among blacks were examples of these. Although the results provide some support for the hypothesis, the support is not as strong as suspected. There is a need for testing other explanations, such as the possibility of using different self-evaluative frames of reference by black and white adolescents. (Author/LLL)",

        "description":"Two approaches were used to estimate the amount of illicit drugs consumed and available for consumption in the United States. Estimates of the number of drug users were multiplied by estimates of the average amount of drugs consumed. Then the supply of drugs available for consumption was examined by estimating the amount of drugs that enters the United States and escapes seizure. Prevailing retail prices were used to convert drug amounts to dollar value when sold to final users. The results indicated Americans spent approximately $18 billion on cocaine, $12 billion on heroin, $9 billion on marijuana, and $2 billion on other illegal drugs in 1990. Retail sales of both cocaine and marijuana appeared to have fallen by about 24% from 1988 to 1990, while retail sales of heroin seem to  have fallen slightly less, by about 22%. Approximately 263-443 metric tons of cocaine were available for domestic consumption. The net effect of increases in both production and foreign and all seizures has been a 22% decrease in the amount of cocaine available for consumption in the United States between 1988 and 1990. Estimates are reliable enough to imply that the trade in illicit substances is immense, roughly $40 billion to $50 billion. The social costs from drug consumption greatly exceed the amount spent on illicit drugs themselves. (ABL)",

The study presents a model and a set of analytic techniques for studying the ways that school and individual variables relate to adolescent alcohol abuse. Recently developed Hierarchical Linear Model procedures were used to estimate and test the school-level contextual effects, controlling for the student-level variables. The analyses are based on 61 schools, with 10,344 students from 6th, 8th, 10th, and 11th grades. The student outcome, abuse, is the level of alcohol abuse determined by multiplying the frequency of alcohol use by the extent to which the student gets \"high\" when using alcohol.  The two student-level determinants in the within-school model are social, reflecting how much the student socializes with friends, and good, the degree to which the student fits the traditional stereotype of good by getting good grades, staying out of trouble, attending church, and talking with parents about problems. The estimated social effect in this model is positive, indicating that more socializing is associated with more abuse, while a negative coefficient for good suggests that increasing goodness is associated with decreasing abuse. The predicted effect of social on abuse was generally positive, and the predicted effect of good was generally negative. (The effects are represented graphically.) (LLL)",

        "description":"A 3-year longitudinal study of children at risk for depression was completed, studying children (aged 8-16) of unipolar depressed, bipolar, chronically medically ill, and normal women. Nearly 100 children from 68 families were included, and the psychiatric status and functioning of the mothers and children were studied at 6-month intervals. Mothers and children were observed discussing an area of disagreement. Observations showed that unipolar women were the most negative and withdrawn; children's outcomes were specific to the communication dimension; and depressed mood was most strongly associated with withdrawal and poor task focus. Observations indicated a reciprocity of dysfunctional interactions in the family. Children's utterances showed criticism directed toward depressed  mothers. Depressed mothers were specifically negative toward children with difficulties. A unique between-sibling sample of children where one was doing well and the other was not, indicated that mothers interacted differently with each. Difficulties in the quality of the mother-child relationship, and also the impact of each other's difficulties on the other, caused symptomatology. It was concluded that maternal background factors such as personal experiences in her family, current mood and stress situations, and child's own behavior, all contributed to the quality of the interaction. Further study is needed to understand maternal depressive behavior and the impact on the child. (BHK)",

        "description":"To determine how often children falsely report being sexually abused, this study asked professionals to indicate the percentage of children with whom they had worked who had made false reports. In addition, this study examined the variables that might be associated with the percentage of false allegations reported by professionals. The factors examined were age of the child, profession of the interviewer (law enforcement versus mental health), expectation of the interviewer (whether they believe children generally do not lie about sexual abuse versus interview children neutrally), and sex of the interviewer. Boston-area professionals, including 74 law enforcement professionals and 127 mental health professionals, were interviewed by telephone. The results indicated that women  reported a smaller percentage of false allegations than did men, and that all professionals reported fewer false allegations for children under 6 than they did for children age 6-9 or 10-12. An age-of-child X profession-of-interviewer interaction indicated that the law enforcement and mental health professionals were differentially affected by children ages 10-12. Mental health professionals reported a significantly higher percentage of false allegations than did law enforcement professionals. The results of this study indicated that professionals reported a small percentage of cases as having been false. The results also indicated that the percentage of false reports was related to the sex of the interviewer, age of the child, and profession of the interviewer. (BHK)",

        "description":"This study explored the relationship between characteristics of abuse and time before seeking treatment for adults molested as children. Those who sought early treatment were called early presenters; those who sought treatment later in life were called late presenters. Data were collected from intake interviews of 364 adults molested as children. Data were analyzed using Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression. The results indicated that age at onset of abuse, duration of abuse, whether the abuse was reported to law enforcement, and the number of sexual acts were all factors significantly related to the number of years between the end of molestation and seeking treatment. Each factor was individually related to time before seeking treatment, but the combination of these factors  significantly increased predictive value and accounted for a 36% percentage of the variance. The directions of the correlations indicated that those who came to treatment early had reported their abuse to law enforcement, were older when abuse began, had an abuse of long duration, and experienced more sexual acts. Overall, these results indicated that there were at least two distinct patterns of abuse that related to when adults molested as children presented themselves for treatment. (Author/BHK)",

        "description":"In 1896, Sigmund Freud stated that early childhood seduction caused hysteria in his female patients. He later recanted his original finding and claimed that the reports of abuse he heard from his patients were not descriptions of real events, but his patients' expressions of unconscious childhood wishes. The theory of the Oedipal complex gave practitioners a reason for why they were hearing about seduction in childhood from their patients, and supported these practitioners in the belief that sexual abuse was a rare phenomenon. To date, research on child sexual abuse and children's knowledge of sexuality fails to support the Oedipal theory. The theory of the Oedipal complex, although criticized by many authors, continues to exert an influence on the field. It seems as though some  have accepted this theory as &quot;truth&quot; and have not examined whether it is consistent with the growing body of knowledge. Given all of this, it must be seriously questioned whether this theory is useful for child abuse professionals. It must be especially questioned whether it is helpful in making forensic judgments, understanding the causes, or treating victims of child sexual abuse. If it is not, it is time to explicitly say so and move toward developing theories grounded in data and scientific facts. (ABL)",

The data were collected at an intake interview administered at the time the adults molested as children entered out-patient treatment. Results of the study indicated that boys and girls were equally likely to be molested by natural fathers. Girls were more likely than boys to be molested by stepfathers; boys were more likely to be molested by friends of the family. Molestation started at the same age  for both boys and girls, but lasted longer and ended at a later age for girls. Males and females were equally likely to experience fondling from the waist down and oral intercourse, but there were significant differences for incidence of anal intercourse (more common among boys) and fondling from the waist up (more common among girls).

Unincarcerated males (N=2,291) were interviewed over the telephone regarding any violence towards their wives and any violent behavior toward individuals who were not in the family. Subjects, a subsample of the 1985 National Family Violence Survey respondents, were comprised of those men who were currently or recently living with a spouse or female partner, and had responded to a series of questions designed to assess the existence or absence of assaultive  behavior. Results indicated that 15% of the men in this sample had engaged in some form of violent behavior over the past year. The majority of violent males specialized in their choice of victims; that is, they chose to assault only family or non-family members, but not both. Only 10% of the violent males reported assaulting both family and non-family individuals; 75% of the violent men admitted assaulting their wives within the previous year; and 33% admitted to non-family assault.

        "description":"The value of physical or corporal punishment is disputed among psychologists; most regard it as harmless, although a subgroup of researchers has controversially suggested that parental use of physical punishment may be causally related to the development of aggression. Thus, the psychological community appears to have separated into determined pro- and anti-physical punishment factions. An examination of the literature reveals that most studies are supportive of a relationship between physical punishment and aggression. Further, prospective studies suggest that physical punishment may contribute etiologically towards the development of aggressive behavior. It should be noted that age and gender differences appear very important, since the relationship may only be valid for  school-age and older males. The association between physical punishment and aggression may be valid in the more extreme or frequent cases; low physical punishment may serve to either increase or decrease the incidence of aggression, while most studies suggest that moderate physical punishment does not increase aggression. However, the literature's conclusions are greatly limited by significant methodological flaws, notably control for factors such as child abuse, parental substance abuse, and other parenting behaviors.

        "description":"Like many other newly independent countries of the Third World, Botswana, at independence in 1966, sought strictly utilitarian uses of education to train manpower for modernization. By the mid-1970s, however, the country had assumed a more humane development ideology, promising economic equality, democracy, and social justice. The policy of &quot;Education for Kagisano&quot; (education for social harmony) promoted universalization of primary education, and offered nonformal education to youth and adults, bypassed by the formal system of education. The fifth National Development Plan (NDP5), 1979-85, attempted to eradicate illiteracy by the end of the plan period. Consequently, the Botswana National Literacy Program (BNLP) was launched in 1981. By 1985, BNLP was to make all of the estimated  250,000 to 300,000 illiterate adults literate in Setswana, the most widely spoken language chosen as the language of literacy for Botswana. The goal proved to be too ambitious; however, the cumulative enrollment was close to 170,000. The sixth National Development Plan (NDP6), 1985-91, has also undertaken some bold educational initiatives. It assigns a permanent role to non-formal education in the development of Botswana, and seeks to introduce and institutionalize a new educational role within the development culture, that of the &quot;extension educator.&quot; At this point in the life of NDP6, however, its educational initiatives remain far from implementation.

The 2,400-word text was divided into four lessons, and students answered text explicit-, text implicit-, or no questions (a control group) as they read silently and were videotaped. In addition, the placement of questions was manipulated. After the four lessons had been read and adjunct questions answered, all students were given a comprehension test that included repeated questions that had been asked previously while the students were reading (an index of direct learning) and new questions (an index of indirect learning). Results showed a strong effect for the use of questions on direct learning. Also, there was evidence of indirect  learning as shown by students who were not allowed to look back in the text to answer questions.

        "description":"The project described in this paper, called Talking to Literacy Learners or TTALL, was designed to improve the quality of parent child interaction involving reading and writing, to promote gains in literacy standards, and to engender a more positive attitude toward schooling. Designed for an urban community in New South Wales where adult and youth illiteracy are above national standards, the project differs from most other parent involvement programs in that its focus is on the adult rather than the child. The project was designed to be completed in 5 distinct stages over a period of 18 months. The stages were as follows: (1) training 25 parents to interact more effectively with their children; (2) deploying those parents as tutors in the school and the community; (3) preparing  resource kits, leaflets, and aids to promote literacy; (4) providing advanced training for parent-tutors; and (5) training of selected parents from the parent-tutor group to assume coordinating roles for separate community clusters attempting to introduce the program. Although the program has completed only the first stage, it appears to have been highly successful: 24 of the 25 participants completed stage 1, and 18 of the 24 returned for the second stage.

        "description":"A study examined the relationship between reading instruction and the development of decoding and spelling skills and the writing fluency of children with varying levels of phonemic awareness. First grade children from two classrooms in a rural Florida school district who began school high and low in phonemic awareness received either whole language or traditional basal instruction. The whole language curriculum included the shared book experience and extensive writing activities; the traditional basal curriculum included explicit phonics instruction, but very little writing. Results show that high phonemic awareness children outperformed low phonemic awareness children; there was no significant difference between instructional approach in the performance of children on any of  the measures. Effect sizes indicated that children who started school high in phonemic awareness were at an advantage in the whole language classroom. Children who started school low in phonemic awareness were given an advantage by being placed in the traditional classroom, although the magnitude of that advantage was not as strong as was the advantage to high phonemic awareness children of being in the whole language classroom. Children in the whole language classroom became more fluent writers; children in the traditional classroom became more accurate spellers in their compositions.

Subjects, 20 adults in an adult basic education group, 20 students in a &quot;high-risk freshmen&quot; group, and 18 students enrolled in a senior level reading methods course, were administered an informal reading inventory (IRI), an intelligence test, and a self-report interview. The three subject groups differed in reading ability. Miscue patterns were analyzed on the IRI in terms of syntax, semantics, and graphophonics. Comprehension data were gathered for passages read on the IRI. Interview data were analyzed for reader's familiarity with IRI passage topics, interest in IRI passage topics, and familiarity with IRI passage writing style. Regression analyses procedures were  used to explore the amount of variance associated with reading strategies noted on the IRI and comprehension of IRI passages and 13 predictor variables, including text length, content, and readability. Results indicated that: (1) miscues varied as a function of a combination of many factors; and (2) readability of a selection to a specific reader provided the most variance in the production of miscues. Findings suggest that miscues are influenced by the interaction of text and reader variables. (Eight tables of data are included; 42 references are attached.) (RS)",

Miami's two Spanish-language daily newspapers, &quot;El Neuvo Herald&quot; and &quot;Diario Las Americas,&quot; were analyzed. Stories--excluding advertising content, editorials and letters to the editor--that dealt with the presidential primaries were coded two ways: (1) for candidate(s), if any; and (2) according to whether or not the story made any reference to Hispanic concerns. Finally, stories were coded by topic, i.e., the election itself, candidate/party platforms, and  campaign activities. The results from the two Miami newspapers were compared to the presidential primary coverage of &quot;La Opinion&quot; of Los Angeles. Results indicated that the papers cannot be justifiably accused of overlooking Hispanic concerns; there seemed to be a slight tendency for stories dealing generally with the candidate or party platform and those dealing with general political news to address Hispanic concerns; and some evidence suggests that the coverage followed the partisan policies of the newspapers.

The value of such ethnographic research for a writing program is that it provides a useful critique of disciplinary practices in English, rather than a critique of the &quot;foreign&quot; practices of other disciplines. In an examination of her own writings for an economics class, a researcher concluded that student papers tended to correspond to ideas and forms of expression present in instructor lectures and the class textbook. By contrast, the study of English is preoccupied with individual achievements of writers. In composition classes, student writers are discouraged from using cliches or from  imitating other authors. The question of whether the celebration of individual achievement in writing tends to isolate students, particularly in marginalized groups, is worthy of analysis. Also worth examining is whether institutional entities place obstacles in the way of students' learning processes. (SG)",

        "description":"As a radical supplement to multiculturalism a liberatory pedagogy is needed that explicitly challenges social conditions and ideologies that reproduce inequality. In training new teaching assistants of composition, a teacher used Jane Tompkins'&quot;Pedagogy of the Distressed&quot; to try an experiment in critical pedagogy. In her text, Tompkins argues that the performance model of teaching is the dominant model of alienated teaching in academia today. In an introductory literature course organized around the theme of growing up in America as represented in the autobiographies of Russell Baker, Richard Wright, and Maxine Hong Kingston, a substantial portion of class time was given over to student direction. Class experiments, however, in trying to &quot;desocialize&quot; students from sexist,  racist, and classist ideologies acquired in previous educational experience were only intermittently successful. Possibly this is because literature teachers and students have been traditionally socialized to think of literature in some ideologically purified sense, above the temporal fray of historical conflict. Tompkins' pedagogy can be an effective way to transcend the traditional performance model of teaching, contribute to the empowerment of students, and enhance multicultural awareness--as long as teachers maintain constant dialogue among themselves and provide adequate space for students to develop independent voices and overcome feelings of cultural hegemony.

        "description":"Inspired by the researcher's interest in the subject, but also in response to state-mandated assessment, Virginia Military Institute (VMI) initiated a pilot program to evaluate the portfolio method of teaching writing. Half of VMI's English department used the portfolio approach, while the other half applied other teaching methods. Prior research suggested that the portfolio approach should increase both writing skill and efficacy because it: (1) encourages revision skills development; (2) allows students to set goals; (3) promotes long-term effort; (4) involves self-assessment; and (5) evaluates students on the basis of their best work. Results of the study indicated that efficacy varied according to grade and also, to a large extent, according to whether a given student was in  a portfolio class. Portfolio students felt more confident than other students in their writing abilities in several specific areas. Motivational and behavioral factors were more significant in portfolio than in non-portfolio classes. The portfolio method seemed to tap metacognitive skills. There seemed to be correlations with learning styles in portfolio classes only. Educators need to find more ways of helping students to develop self-monitoring abilities. Because the portfolio method lends itself well to individualized instruction, it may offer teachers an excellent opportunity to improve the writing skills of all students.

        "description":"The impulse toward comedy in the poetry of Canadian author Margaret Atwood occurs as a by-product of an interaction between scripted text and performing reader. Reading, then, may be profitably viewed as a rehearsal for both. In the classroom, this stylistic approach to Atwood's poetry can be emphasized over thematic analysis. In her poetry, parentheses act as textually defined cues for comedy. Additionally, the reader specifies the exact voicing for the persona, opening up the text's potential for comic interpretation. Readers may use rate, pitch, stress, and vocal tone to highlight comic attitudes. Many of Atwood's poems allow the possibility of sounding sarcastic, manipulative, condescending, and witty. The implications for Atwood's canon are: (1) that there may be more  similarities than initially realized between poetic and narrative texts; (2) that Atwood's poems benefit from comic interpretations; and (3) that a comic rendering of Atwood's poems alters and reshapes the voice of personae. As a result of the enlarged vocal dimension, the reader-text relationship is changed. A rehearsal of comic impulses enlarges Atwood's poetic potential.

While the masculine style of peer-response to student writing is largely aggressive, the feminine is conceptually different in its social, feel-good acknowledgement of the writer's effort. While the masculine demands or orders exactly what should be done, the feminine reflects self-consciousness and self-correction. Furthermore, masculine insult and vulgarity contrast with feminine politeness strategies. Strong stylistic and epistemological differences cast doubt on the possibility of &quot;translation&quot; between the genders. It has been observed that when  confronted with masculine argumentation, the historical role of women is mimicry. The feminine style of less task-serious play and emotion ruptures the structure of the writing classroom. Only when education goes out of the bounds of the classroom is it possible to speak with the grammar of its shaping ideology, insisting on the legitimacy and variety of ways of being, speaking, and knowing that traditional education proscribes. In the meantime, a dismantling of masculinist pedagogy could begin with the notion of the evaluative criteria guiding peer-response sessions which turn discussing into judging, narrowing the focus of writing to the text as replicable model to be done right, rather than expanding it into the speculative, imaginative realms of discourse, for which there are no  checklists.

Although there are dangers associated with any critical theorizing about the subject positions of students and/or pedagogues, a new conception of writing, textuality, and ethics could reveal different means for reformulating subjective relations in the writing classroom. Writing, ethics, and radical alterity are impossible subjects; as in &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; they are like Cheshire cats smiling down upon an impossible croquet game. It may be that to teach writing it is first necessary to make the impossible writable. When writers try to play the  game, the language is like Alice's flamingo, constantly turning around to look at them, and the truths that writers seek are like the hedgehogs on the field who uncurl themselves and scurry away. Whether rescuing or discerning the subject, it is important to remember that the impossible subject, like the Cheshire Cat, is merely a suspended apparition revealing and concealing the abyss below; but, it holds the possibility of the impossible in its very smile.

        "description":"First year writing students were asked which kinds of writing they enjoyed, and why. Their responses indicate a preference for &quot;creative&quot; writing, where &quot;creative&quot; is defined as &quot;personal.&quot; The students in the research sample reacted against a form of knowing that requires them to place more emphasis on objects (human or non-human) in their world than on themselves, suggesting that subjectivist and procedural knowing work hand-in-hand for college-age students. Their responses show that, overall, they understand the reality of separate knowing, the voice of reason that doubts and questions each proposition it encounters. In addition, many students are able to use their knowledge of how to write for the intelligent but uninformed reader, yet simultaneously believe that the best  writing reveals truth through self-generation of knowledge. Separate knowing is too impersonal for these students; yet their marked preference for personal writing, their distinct need to &quot;get into&quot; a subject and be able to understand immediately, suggests that they might readily and with much less protest gravitate toward this way of knowing if encouraged to do so. As a consequence, the passage of students to the perspective which integrates thinking and feeling, self and other, while acknowledging that knowledge is constructed and the knower is an intimate part of the known, could be a more pleasurable collaborative experience for both student and teacher.

Fourteen of the 18 students completed the assignment. Results indicated that: (1) 10 of the 14 narratives conveyed in metaphor that the classroom is a closed system in which the teacher's purpose is to win students over to the teacher's way of seeing the world and doing the world of school; and (2) 4 of the 14 narratives evoked a &quot;convergence&quot; metaphor in which teachers and students are common participants in a learning event. Findings suggest that such  narratives can be potent instructional vehicles for working with neophyte teachers, for the very elements that identify these texts as narratives carry cultural and political assumptions that in part constitute teaching.

Survey data were gathered from introductory history, political science, management, philosophy, and sociology classes as part of a pilot project. While the particular survey differed in different courses so that results cannot be compared exactly, these surveys clearly indicated that student perceptions of their writing abilities were greater than faculty perceptions of those abilities; and that while most students agree college students have inadequate writing skills, the individual student does not appear to believe  that he/she is one of that majority. A primary cause for this gap is that students and faculty differ in what they understand to be required to write successfully in college courses. Findings suggest how the gap might be closed: (1) educate faculty outside of English about incoming students' entrance level skills in writing; (2) provide students with some detailed assessments of their writing ability in several courses; (3) explore with faculty their contrary but necessary roles as coach and judge; and (4) help students perceive and apply approaches to writing learned in one context to new contexts.

All of the eighth-grade students (125,756) who participated in a statewide assessment of writing during spring 1989 and spring 1990 were included in the study. Eighteen writing tasks were administered during these two years. The writing tasks were classified in terms of mode of discourse (narrative, descriptive, and expository) and also in terms of experiential demand (direct experience, imagined experience, and outside knowledge). A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted with five dependent variables used to assess writing quality (content/organization, style, sentence formation, usage, and mechanics) and three independent variables (mode of discourse x  experiential demand x gender). Results indicated that mode of discourse, experiential demand, and gender were significant predictors of writing quality. The quality of writing was more highly rated for females than for males with effect sizes ranging from .33 for content/organization to .49 for mechanics.

Students should consider audience as they begin a writing task. Then they should get away from it all and simply write. If they find an audience inhibiting, they should feel free to ignore the idea of audience altogether or alter their concept of audience. When they are ready to make a draft public, they should have enough material to work with a real public. It is then that students should be aware of the unique aspects of an oral culture and the oral nature of discourse. An awareness of this sense of an orality and its characteristics and using the unique oral aspects of a classroom as forum for written work are ways in which students can use rhetoric more  effectively. A good assignment for the freshman confronted with audience analysis might be to chart his or her awareness of audience from the composition's inception to its completion. The result of such charting may reveal an evolving audience which combines the best aspects of all the audiences along the continuum. (An audience continuum chart is included.) (PRA)",

        "description":"In response to criticisms from an accrediting agency, the director of the Writing across the Curriculum (WAC) program at the State University of New York, Farmingdale, designed a one-day marathon session and a series of biweekly seminars to bridge the gap between WAC truths and the assumptions of the engineering faculty concerning writing processes and writing to learn. At first, the engineers blamed the English department for their students' inability to write acceptable laboratory reports. After a lively debate in one session which began with the realization that students did not know what was expected of them in the lab report, the engineers realized that they could not even agree among themselves about the objectives of a lab report. They realized that the problem was not  that the English department had failed, but that they were not able to articulate for their students what a lab report should be. The second semester saw the addition to the program of faculty in physics and chemistry and a revival of the earlier discussions about the failure of the English department by the new participants. Responses to the WAC program are encouraging: participants speak of the impact of the program on pedagogy, critical thinking and cross-curriculum thinking, writing as a learning tool, and interdisciplinary responsibility. While the requirements of the accrediting agency and administrative support were crucial in getting started, what has sustained the program is that the faculty began to see improvement in student learning.

        "description":"A longitudinal study, involving five beginning teachers, revolved around questions about how teachers' own emerging theories of literacy instruction are shaped by their interactions with other theories and perspectives and through their own work with students who are learning to read, write, and understand text in schools. Trained in the whole language or process approach to literature, the teachers in this study found it difficult to implement that approach with inner-city African-American, Latino, and Filipino students. The purpose of the study was both to inform teacher education policy and to provide teacher educators with ideas for better supporting beginning teachers. Triangulated data sources which documented the new teachers' learning consisted of audiotaped transcripts  of monthly collaborative meetings and bimonthly videotaped classroom observations of literacy lessons as well as audiotaped open-ended interviews with the teachers. These teachers' experiences suggest at least three areas for reform in literacy education: reconsidering programmatic attention to beginning reading; integrating knowledge of literacy and school cultures; and redefining the boundaries of teacher education. All of the teachers found that sticking to the popular and policy-imposed &quot;rules&quot; for using original literature in any form was inappropriate for many children. The stories told by these teachers suggest that it may be beneficial to support beginning teachers internally as they are learning to teach literature. Without this support, the difficulty in learning to teach a  literature-based, whole-language program designed to give all children access to literacy may lie with the institutional rules in schools and not with the new teachers.

To understand the changes in both teachers' and childrens' learning, multiple forms of data were collected, including: taped and transcribed conversations about teaching and learning at monthly collaborative meetings; videotapes of monthly classroom observations, children's responsive conversations,  and audiotaped open-ended teacher interviews about literacy lessons; teacher's collections of portfolio-type evidence of two target children's progress in each classroom; and three whole-class measures of response to narrative and expository text. Themes were traced through the data using perspectives from feminist epistemological and critical theories as well as sociocognitive and sociocultural response theories. Three processes emerged from the data as supporting the teacher's learning: (1) critiquing the constraints on children's responses; (2) seeking support for instructional changes; and (3) observing resultant changes in children's responses.

It has been suggested that monologic, fundamentally one-sided argument is inappropriate for a feminist discourse that should instead teach methods of negotiation and mediation. Kenneth Burke proposed shattering views of ideological correctness, or &quot;pieties,&quot; by juxtaposing a piety with another view of a different ideological stripe in such a way as to weaken or disintegrate the piety. A student in an upper division course in the rhetoric of feminist discourse practiced Burke's technique in writing a description of June Cleaver. Feminist writers have developed this technique as well. Frequently, feminists and others interested in social change also employ the  technique of reversal--turning the seemingly natural on its head. Critics have observed that because the ruling class has a vested interest in maintaining univocity and the appearance of univocity as a naturally occurring phenomenon, aspects of struggle between two or more social languages (what has been termed &quot;dialogism&quot; by Mikhail Bakhtin) are often muted, obscured, or even censored. Periods of revolution improve prospects for more open dialogism. Feminist critics can recombine existing language features to create new discourse. (SG)",

        "description":"A study examined whether teachers in different personality type groups respond to student writing in different, possibly predictable ways. Nine teaching assistants at Florida State University responded to student essays and took the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which measures several personality preferences. Using the MBTI scores, the teachers were divided into four groups: sensing-thinking, sensing-feeling, intuitive-thinking, and intuitive-feeling. Responses to the essays were used to examine what the teachers commented on and how they phrased their comments. Results indicated that personality type, along with teacher background, training, and other things, can affect responding styles. Further research may show a clear connection between teacher personality types and  responding styles, allowing educators to gain a better understanding of some of the reasons people respond to English classes as they do. G. H. Jensen and J. K. DiTiberio report in their 1989 study that while most English teachers are intuitive, most people in the general population are sensing; hence it is possible that teaching styles conflict with the learning styles of many, if not most, of the students. Educators could remedy this problem by balancing teaching styles or at least by teaching the students to read and interpret their (the teachers') responses.

Twelve high school, community college, and university-level writing teachers completed questionnaires and were interviewed to determine whether they prefer intuitive or sensory perception, and to learn how they evaluate student writing. Results indicated that many writing teachers continue to focus on limited, product-based criteria. Furthermore, state-mandated testing such as Florida's CLAST essay examination could quite possibly be having an extremely negative impact on what is being taught in writing  classrooms. Writing teachers who serve as evaluators of product-based writing tests are becoming increasingly comfortable with applying out-dated, product-based standards to writing, and are even finding themselves applying these standards to their own students' writing. Entire English departments are being trained in CLAST scoring strategies and are applying its limited, product-based criteria. Writing teachers should not have to set aside preferred ways of viewing student writing when asked to serve as evaluators for state-mandated tests. (PRA)",

        "description":"The current public debate between the images of the smiling war hero and of the grimacing Vietnam veteran provide opportunities to define two discourse communities that manifest themselves in students' written discourse. These can be seen as akin to the first American jeremiads, which were Puritan treatises written by seventeenth century religious leaders, often drawing upon the Book of Jeremiah. As in the early jeremiads, students often argue with a sense of urgency, employ emotional appeals, assume a homogeneous audience, and argue in a dualistic manner. Like the early jeremiad writers, students frequently look back to the past for answers to current problems. Unfortunately, &quot;correct&quot; conceptions of history do not exist, and the rhetoric and dualism of the jeremiad do not fit  many academicians' concepts of academic discourse. Students must be taught that different discourse communities make varied rhetorical demands. This can be achieved by: (1) discussing the current language of sloganeering politicians; (2) having students point out jeremiads in each other's papers; (3) encouraging students to back emotional assertions with academic evidence; and (4) asking students for definitions of shallow political terms. Such steps are necessary in preventing students from clinging to easy dualisms that mar extended argument. (SG)",

        "description":"In 1866, Alexander Bain proposed that by evaluating unity, coherence, and emphasis (which he brought together under the acronym &quot;CUE&quot;), students could judge the effectiveness of their written paragraphs. One hundred twenty-five years later, the proposition is still central to composition instruction. A review of modern writing textbooks reveals that unity is the most entrenched of the CUE concepts, followed by coherence and emphasis respectively. Some books even try to unite the CUE principles with non-traditional methods of writing. Implicit, if not explicit, concern for CUE is found in every writing textbook. The bottom line of writing instruction seems to be recognizing and fostering two sharply different forms of discourse: unity, coherence, and emphasis on the one hand, and  appreciation for creative disunity, incoherence, and a complete lack of emphasis on the other. Alternatives are available to instructors: they can encourage more creative writing in freshman composition courses; they can assign creative take-home tests in place of expository in-class exams; and they can point out differences between the two types of discourse. In any case, the processes of arriving at the unified, coherent, and emphasized written product is infinitely more important than whether the time-honored CUE formula was used in achieving the result.

One-hundred two developmental English students participated in an experimental writing class that used only collaborative learning techniques. The study measured the effects of collaborative learning on sentence structure, word usage, verb form, and an overview of the writing samples through the category of problems detected. Results indicated that collaborative learning appears to have a greater impact in the areas of sentence length, the use of passive voice, the use of the verb &quot;to be,&quot; and overall number of problems. There seems to be less impact in the areas of  coordination and subordination, and the impact in the word usage areas is inconclusive. Results also demonstrated a need for better grammar-checking computer software for use in future objective-qualitative studies. Finally, findings suggest the validity of the conventional subjective attitude among developmental instructors that developmental students are not necessarily inferior in any intrinsic way, and appears to indicate that, overall, collaborative learning has a positive effect on the writing skills of developmental students.

The co-written essay brings out language's heteroglossic richness, as shown by the students' collaborative writing experiences in a college writing class. Students worked within the frames of two assignments: (1) an analysis of a text or trend; and (2) an exploration of a minority group to which none of the writers belonged. Because the latter assignment required interviews, it involved dialogue not only between the members of the co-writing group, but between the group and interviewees. In response to questionnaires, the students projected a view of voice as static and best not changed. When asked to socially create or alter their knowledge, and with that their voices, students felt  dissatisfied. The students disliked exploratory essays because the essays did not require writers to support a single point of view, but rather to explore multiple approaches to an issue. Because they felt oppressed by the multiple voices, the students often rejected essay form in favor of a research paper approach with a dull academic voice. The intensity of co-writing awakened students to a different view of voice. Students noted the need to consider others' views and to investigate their own thinking processes. (SG)",

Nine school districts participated in the second part of the study which correlated 668 tenth graders' performance in the direct writing assessment to their performance on standardized tests and to their grade point average. The subjects responded to a writing prompt concerning friendship and were given two 50-minute periods to write and revise their responses. The strengths and  weaknesses of the subjects' writing abilities were analyzed for each of six writing traits: ideas and content; organization; voice; word choice; sentence structure; and conventions.

Those who assert that one epistemology is more &quot;right&quot; set the stage for paradigmatic conflict. Some theorists predict a dismal resolution of these so-called &quot;paradigm wars,&quot; which could result in discredited epistemologies and methodologies being cast onto the intellectual slag heap. Nascent paradigm wars can be warded off in a variety of ways. Epistemologies can be viewed as ways of knowing that exist on separate, non-intersecting planes, rather than as forces struggling to occupy the same territory. The problem, then, is not in establishing or defending the legitimacy of any one  plane but in coordinating analyses resulting from different ways of knowing. Facets of meaning-making can be reexamined and conflicting epistemologies can be transformed into complementing ways of knowing. Application of three primary ways of knowing--experimental, psychological, and anthropological--is a product of the researcher's (or learner's) purpose, intentions, and needs. All three ways of knowing indicate that meaning is multifaceted. An embrace of contraries is necessary to serve the students who enter classrooms trusting in their teachers. (SG)",

        "description":"Although previous generations have by no means been disloyal to the popular music of their youth, the tenacious attachment of the Baby Boomers to the music of the 1960s seems unprecedented. Three main reasons account for this constantly widening musical reclamation project. First, the Baby Boomers have a clearer sense of generational identity that any other generation has had. They are incessantly studied, written, about, renamed, \"targeted,\" and otherwise reminded of their own supposed uniqueness and importance. Second, the Baby Boom generation refuses to let go of childhood and youth. This notion of longevity is attributed in part to a lack of a clear connection to an acceptable history (in a sense, World War II ended history, and the assassination of John F. Kennedy did  something similar). This resulted in a need of Baby Boomers to create a substitute culture which remains strongly embedded in their memories as they ultimately become a part of the mainstream. Finally, the mass media, especially in their marketing and advertising functions, encourage both the generational identity and longevity. Examples are seen in the repacking of the VH-1 video channel and MTV, the recycling of the 1960s songs in current advertising, and the musical/televisual attempts to reconfigure the present as consistent with past ideals.

Mergers of curriculum programs from different subdisciplines have occurred over time because of economic pressures and erroneous judgments about student and university needs. Student interest in the social sciences has declined, and communication programs have shifted their focus from rhetoric and argumentation to media technology. The expected merger of more speech and journalism programs raises the need to identify unifying principles in the communication subdisciplines. Those who promote &quot;practical&quot; approaches to curriculum building would support skills development at the expense of valuable comprehensive thinking. Students must learn that communication occurs in an environment, not  a vacuum. If students learn communication theory well, they will be able to transfer and integrate the knowledge into other areas. Speech communication and journalism educators have the opportunity to strive for the challenge of integrating the two subdisciplines.

The learning of new cultures from individual systems (e.g., interpersonal interaction) cannot be as efficient or effective as learning from collective or institutional systems. Evidence suggests that while primary or individual systems are capable of mediating the learning of secondary institutional culture, they cannot be as effective, efficient, or comfortable sources of cross-cultural learning as are secondary institutions such as the mass media. As communication resources, the mass media are an institutionalized information, leadership, education, and  entertainment service. Accordingly, certain expectations could be drawn, using African students as examples: (1) that the amount of television viewing among African students would be significantly and positively related to cultural adaptation; (2) that Africans students would have a distinctive, if not unique, pattern of television program choice related to cultural value preference; and (3) that African students' amount and type of television viewing would differ from other foreign students.

In one condition the coach used a monologue and the skaters were not permitted to ask questions or otherwise interact with the coach. In the other condition the coach interacted in a dialogue with team members. Both teams had significantly higher morale and were significantly more productive in the dialogue condition than in the monologue condition. Also, both teams behaved significantly more unproductively when the leader used a monologue than when she used a dialogue. A democratic style of coaching which engages members of a skating team in a dialogue is likely to be better for both morale and productivity than an autocratic style which directs the team by employing a monologue.

        "description":"Gay and lesbian adolescents are marginalized at many levels. Their needs and interests are slighted in the balance of advocacy work that purports a concern for the welfare of minority children. Their presence is overlooked in studies of youth and the mass media. Their existence is excluded from American popular culture. The symbolic annihilation of gay and lesbian youth exhibited by television in the extreme (and by most mass media in general) contributes to a dysfunctional isolation that is supported by the mutually reinforcing invisibility of homosexual adolescents on the television screen and in the real world. Such invisibility and isolation can be examined through a spiral of silence process, which outlines the reciprocal communication-based conditions through which the  oppression of gay and lesbian youth is achieved. The social-psychological mechanism of the spiral of silence also partially accounts for the inefficacy of oppositional interpretive practices for disrupting pluralistic ignorance in this case; the relative ability of gay and lesbian youths to actually subvert dominant meanings, in an empowering way, is called into question. There is an exigent need for more programatic research in this area. In pursuing research within this emergent agenda, researchers must confront a number of concerns: the position of argument in social science; the methodological significance of the relationship between individuals and subcultures; the value of critical analysis; advocational possibilities relative to mainstream and alternative media resources; issues  involving mediated intrusions into childhood &quot;innocence&quot;; and the range of uniquely severe barriers that stand in the way of research activity in this area.

        "description":"Many universities rely on multiple choice or true/false tests to admit students to mass communication programs. The high stakes that prospective majors face suggest that there is an urgent need for departments to rethink their assumptions about entrance testing, as a narrow conception of scholastic ability can undermine any attempt to &quot;weed out&quot; the under-prepared student. Recent research suggests that rhetorical &quot;modeling&quot; may be the best method for teaching writing. Although modeling is a highly accepted and effective method for teaching news writing, most departments that employ modeling in the upper division reporting classes rely on rote learning to enroll journalism majors. The test attempts to measure writing proficiency by assessing the ability to identify and correct  grammatical errors. An alternative testing system is needed to better judge student strengths in more than one area of learning. One idea is to administer two tests: an objective skills test, and an essay test. Or departments could use the CUNY Writing Skills Assessment Test, which tests an understanding of essay organization, and the TEEP (Testing in English for Educational Purposes) test developed by Cyril Weir, which reflects a &quot;communicative paradigm&quot; for testing reading comprehension, writing, and speaking.

Subjects were 339 public school students in Tennessee who completed a self-administered questionnaire. Findings demonstrated clear evidence of novelty effects. Students' judgments regarding preferences for computers declined significantly as did their perceptions of learning from the technology during the 3 years. Perceived difficulty of using computers, which was expected to decline, remained stable. In addition, both gender and age proved to be significantly related to all three dependent variables. Older students  were consistently more skeptical about the technology than were younger students, and boys were consistently more positive than girls. These relationships showed no evidence of change over the course of 3 years. The results support critiques of the methodological limitations of the dominant approach to the study of computer effects in learning environment. Reports of short-term experimental applications of the technology have led to misleading generalizations about the computer's instructional potential. (Thirty-three references are included.) (PRA)",

        "description":"The debate over American dominance of mass media exports gained new momentum in the late 1980s, when the European Community moved toward restricting the number of television programs imported from non-European countries. Research suggests that Europeans enjoy American television programs such as &quot;Dallas&quot; because the series embody basic myths and let viewers identify with characters. Studies of East Indian viewers appreciation for Hollywood films attribute the films' popularity to their entertainment value, the opportunity to learn about Western life, and the films' superiority to their Indian counterparts. In Britain, the popularity of American movies has been attributed to the American emphasis on the youth and working-class values of courage, cunning, and luck. American  domination of the world film industry began in the 1920s, as the American movie outnumbered other imports and domestic films in most countries. Some European countries limited American film imports, citing economic and cultural reasons. American writers explained the popularity of United States films by citing Hollywood's lavish production budgets. Early European critics observed that American filmmakers had a &quot;sense of the film&quot; that was lacking in Europe. Since global mass media studies are burgeoning in higher education, more academic research is needed to define audience appeal, particularly where economic and political influences do not blur the picture.

A major obstacle to managing conflict and interpersonal relationships successfully in general is the tendency people have to attribute careful, rational planning to the actions of others when, in fact, much behavior is simply careless and thoughtless. An understanding of how people develop an exaggerated sense of their own communication proficiency may help to distinguish between careless behavior and behavior designed to cause problems. Instructors should be concerned with developing and sharing the best possible understanding of the communication process with their students.  Careful examination of the factors which lead to a distorted sense of communication proficiency is essential to nurturing students' ability to engage in an on-going reflective analysis of their behavior.

Specifically, this report compares and contrasts the ways in which local districts responded to being placed in &quot;Level III&quot;--a category for school districts that did not meet state performance criteria. For the most part, objections were widespread. Most district administrators were in agreement that urban school districts were penalized because of their large economically disadvantaged minority constituencies, dismayed by the negativity demonstrated by the New Jersey Department of Education, chagrined that the state chose only quantifiable measures, and disappointed that the  state made no provisions to fund needed district improvements. The conclusion that New Jersey can initiate other evaluative models that do not punish and label school districts leads to the following recommendation for revision: that New Jersey do away with &quot;compliance&quot; monitoring in favor of &quot;diagnostic&quot; monitoring.

        "description":"In 1981, the Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) Board of Education contracted with an External Review Team composed of educators of national stature representing diverse perspectives and experiences to realize a portion of its mission statement, &quot;To provide the board of education, the superintendent of schools, and the general public of Pittsburgh with an objective assessment of: (1) the priorities set by the board of education since 1980; (2) the programmatic responses of the superintendent and administration to those priorities; (3) the implementation and evolution of these programmatic responses and their integration into the educational program by school district staff; and (4) the status of the overall educational program compared to other public school districts.&quot; The educational  program audit examines a large number of individual program-focused activities. As an evaluation tool of educational programs, it reviews common themes, outcomes, and problems. This report describes the motivation behind the Pittsburgh School District's educational program audit, the manner in which it was designed and conducted, and the benefits realized from the effort. In addition, the External Review Team members share their perceptions of the audit, analyze its pitfalls, state how to avoid pitfalls, and recommend how to realize audit objectives. The review team found that: (1) Pittsburgh's children are well served by their public schools; (2) outstanding professionals staff the city's schools; and (3) school programs are relevant because of systematic and coordinated planning.  Student achievement score gains reflect the successes of educational programs in the Pittsburgh school district. (JAM)",

This principal began by informing staff, students, and parents of his limited repertoire of competencies as master teacher, administrator, and parent to his own child. He also listed his incompetencies as lawyer, policeman, judge, social worker, physician, nurse, and parent to children other than his own. Educators can no longer claim competency in areas other than instruction and school counseling. Although school staff must be knowledgeable about  community resources to help resolve youth-related problems, the schools cannot be expected to police, parent, judge, nurse, motivate, and simultaneously deliver high quality educational services. Clearly stated expectations precede desired change. Once expectations were published in Northside High School's teacher and student handbooks, the consequences for compliance or noncompliance could be administered fairly to children of both the influential and the powerless. Police were called in drug possession cases, and parents became more knowledgeable and responsive concerning drugs, teens, and use of available community resources. (MLH)",

        "description":"Although the use of computers in the classroom has been heralded as a major breakthrough in education, many educators have yet to use computers to their fullest advantage. This is perhaps due to the traditional assumption that students differed only in their speed of learning. However, new research indicates that students differ in their style of learning as well--some preferring visual information; others, auditory or tactile. A new generation of computer software that can be tailored to a student's preferences has been developed, and its use in the classroom has yielded dramatic results. For instance, Thinking Networks has developed a program designed to help improve writing skills--skills that are notoriously poor among many students. By presenting nonverbal graphic images  that symbolize semantic relationships, this program is immediately accessible to many visually-oriented students. The program also develops basic thinking operations, such as sequencing, organizing, comparing, and contrasting, and can be tailored to students' preferences in a number of other ways as well. Through the thoughtful use of computers and Computer Managed Instruction, technology can serve the needs of education in a way no other tool can. (RJS)",

        "description":"By 1990 Australia had experienced almost 10 years of incessant activity to restructure education. In many respects, educators are not in control of the change process. This paper explains transformations that have occurred in the senior education positions, in the shape of educational organizations (including schools), and in the way education is being conceived of and described. Concerning educators and managers, the education profession is no longer a definable club, but has become a more diffuse, complicated, and political arena. Senior educators are termed &quot;chief executives&quot; and are usually highly mobile, middle-aged males who have economics degrees, but may not be professional educators. Newly emerging school organizations are characterized by simple, politically controlled,  and efficient management; portfolio and policy coordination; lean head office management; decentralized responsibility; and reliance on national government policies and priorities. The postbureaucratic organization banishes certain assumptions regarding specialization, hierarchy, and status, and substitutes the constellation or network model. Somehow, &quot;educational administration&quot; has been transformed into &quot;efficient management.&quot; Speculations are provided concerning possible future developments, such as self-governing (privatized) schools, professional services, school administrators' roles, teacher career patterns, and career planning.

The inquiry process is a central feature of the accelerated school, a comprehensive school renewal initiative. The traditional approach to changing educational practice, staff development, is ineffective in that it fails to include transformation of the school culture. The accelerated school vision is based on university-school collaboration, three guiding principles (unity of purpose, empowerment, and building on strengths), and four values (participation, communication, reflection, and experimentation). Pilot school results include increased participant inquiry, school-sponsored  community meetings, and changes in the retention policy. Implications for staff development planning include analysis of the school as an organization, recognition of the school community as a knowledge resource, and empowerment of teachers and parents.

Data were collected from longitudinal student data, case records, interviews with Classroom Alternative Support Team leaders and principals, participant questionnaires, and a longitudinal attitude survey of pilot schools. The findings indicate that the program contributed to an overall change in teachers' problem-solving practices as well as to a reduction in student referrals.

In year-round education programs, students have off-track time during the school year at four different intervals. This time is often utilized by school districts to give students additional educational experiences. The formal name given to the off-track program is intersession. The authors describe a peer tutoring program that has given middle school students the opportunity to return to elementary school settings and work with younger children in a variety of capacities ranging from reading aloud to groups of children, working in one-on-one tutorial situations, to correcting papers. In addition, at the middle school level  peer tutors can work with students during intersession times who are in need of remediation in the core subjects as well as assist teachers in various classroom assignments. To date, 182 students have participated in the program. (Author)",

Five policy options are offered, which include subsuming school finance within public finance, developing comprehensive databases, rearranging the sequence of school finance policy, developing an accountability system, and increasing collaboration. A conclusion is that each part of the system must compromise to a small extent and that school finance reform will not take place until actual school improvement occurs, which requires additional  funding.

To accomplish this goal, the design studio provided explicit instruction and experience in applying theoretical, empirical, and experiential knowledge to practical problems. Expert practitioners coached students through the processes of problem solving and definition as they developed action plans. This process of cognitive coaching focused on school problems rather than on traditional subjects of study. Six coaches who were practicing school administrators were selected from the faculty of the Department  of Educational Administration at the University of Utah to supervise graduate students enrolled in a seminar on the principalship. Program evaluation involved document analysis, participant observation, exit interviews with students and coaches, and review panel assessments. Findings demonstrate the need for coaches' training and practice in reflective and inductive questioning, fixed prerequisites for a student-focused design studio, continuous program evaluation, and provision of specific learning cases.

        "description":"Much more is known about how to best prevent and remediate learning deficits than is being applied. However, much remains to be learned about effective programs for students at risk of failure. Major restructuring of compensatory and special education programs in the early grades is needed to ensure all students an adequate level of basic skills for later years. This book provides information on effective programs for students at risk and lays a groundwork for program changes. Three major types of programs--compensatory, special education, and general education--are analyzed through review of their history, legal requirements, and practical restraints. Examples of effective classroom, pullout, preschool, and kindergarten programs and their principles are described. Instructional  issues for teaching students at risk are addressed. Results from a study of 24 schools on the quality of compensatory education and instructional settings, activities, and other design features related to achievement gain are given as well as effective strategies for academically handicapped students in the regular classroom. A redesign of programs is offered and conclusions are drawn for new practices and policies. References appear at the end of every chapter, and an index is included. (EJS)",

        "description":"Three broad themes run throughout restructuring reforms: decentralization, collaboration, and accountability. The California Legislature recently established a statewide school restructuring demonstration program to help determine whether California educators can make restructuring work. This analysis examines the concept of school restructuring, focusing on: (1) current performance deficiencies in the state school system; (2) restructuring components and their potential for improving educational quality; (3) a summary of research on school restructuring's effectiveness; and (4) the state's future role in restructuring efforts. The analysis is intended to be descriptive, rather than judgmental, and is based on an extensive literature review, interviews with experts, and direct  classroom observations. From this research, several conclusions may be drawn: First, more research is needed concerning restructuring's effectiveness. Second, teachers need sufficient release time and training to meet added restructuring demands. Third, schools must link restructuring components to the effective delivery of a challenging curriculum. And finally, schools basing restructuring on strategic planning (instead of piecemeal reform) may have greater success. Besides establishing pilot projects, states can restructure teacher preparation programs, experiment with performance-based waivers, conduct additional, broad-based research projects, and improve coordination of the state's educational policy objectives with the model curriculum frameworks.

SIGN provided collegial, focused, professional inservice training to refine schooling processes and pupil outcomes. Each SIGN established a goal, &quot;gameplans&quot; or incremental steps, and operating procedures. Major, positive, and lasting changes resulted. Project SIGN was aided in its goal achievement by following a communication/change model. The project was evaluated and validated by comparing it to other process and theoretic models. Program evaluations completed by participants  indicated that SIGN was more collegial, productive, and effective than traditional inservice approaches. SIGN became a vehicle for districtwide improvement in 1990-91.

        "description":"This document presents the results of a mandated study of commercialism in the schools carried out by Washington State's Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The study was prompted by the issues surrounding Channel One, a 12-minute televised news program designed for secondary school students that includes 2 minutes of commercials. Schools are offered about $50,000 worth of free receiving equipment in exchange for showing the program to most students during the regular school day. At least 10 Washington schools participate; the figure is 5,308 nationwide. This document reviews commercialism, narrowing the scope to &quot;electronically transmitted&quot; commercialism in schools and tracing the responses of various individuals, organizations, and associations to the Channel  One offering. Washington's 1989 and 1990 state policy actions regarding this issue are detailed, along with a review of policy actions in other states. The report lists six policy options and their potential positive and negative consequences. Preferred options were narrowed to the following recommendations: (1) The state's Legislature, Governor, and Superintendent of Public Instruction should take steps to provide Washington schools with appropriate educational technologies; (2) the state legislature should adopt a statement leaving viewing decisions to local school boards; and (3) the State Board of Education should establish a representative task force to address issues requiring further study. Appendices provide a bibliography of 90 references, definitions, legal precedents,  educational organizations' statements, survey findings, selected legislative materials, and a literature review on the effects of television viewing on children.

        "description":"Concerned with how new schooling structures, once implemented, will remain in place, this paper reviews findings of the International School Improvement Project (ISIP) about institutionalization and suggests their application to educational restructuring results. According to the ISIP study, indicators of complete institutionalization include acceptance by relevant actors, routinization of the change, widespread usage, firmly expected continuation, and legitimacy or invisibility of the change. The restructuring literature largely sidesteps the topic of institutionalization. A more general literature review reveals institutionalization's dependence on high-quality innovations, local and external contexts, and the change process itself. A case study analysis discloses other key  factors, such as policy-level confirmation, vision-building, external and internal support, school leader maintenance, staff ownership, and embedment. Institutionalization is not monolithically determined, but is ensured by a configuration of key aspects. The ISIP results suggest action implications for those desiring to institutionalize change in schools: applying alternative frames (managed change, cultural change, assimilation, and conflict); achieving district-school congruence; providing extra energy resources; allowing sufficient time; developing a clear, shared vision; envisioning implementation as prefigured institutionalization; managing transition effectively; stressing personal and organizational learning; routinizing internal support; and avoiding staleness.

Most people gave the schools in their community a B (39 percent) or C (35 percent), suggesting a relatively high degree of satisfaction with schools. Some 29 percent of the population indicated that schools have improved over the past 4 years, 20 percent indicated they have become worse, and 42 percent said that they have stayed the same. Two-thirds of respondents saw their provincial government as somewhat or strongly committed to maintaining a high quality educational system, and one-half felt that the government received food or excellent value for its education dollar. The biggest problems facing schools were perceived to be drug and alcohol abuse (17 percent), discipline (11 percent), preparation for the work  force (9 percent), and improvement of basic skills (9 percent). The most positive assessments (grades A or B) were accorded to teacher effectiveness and staff responsiveness to parents' concerns about their children. However, respondents indicated great dissatisfaction with performance in reading, writing, and speaking; 22 percent were somewhat dissatisfied and 11 percent very dissatisfied. Schools in jurisdictions with over 1 million population are viewed more negatively in many cases. Appendices contain a sample questionnaire and a summary of demographic characteristics.

Facts about student alcohol and drug use are provided in this handbook. Watching for school and home related behavioral indicators of drug use is an immediate concern for schools. Drug use follows a six-stage continuum: no interest, interest, experimental use, regular use, harmful involvement, and dependency. Proper responses to substance use situations require a policy that considers the situation type (five are described), decision-making process, and documentation procedures. How school personnel can respond at the classroom, building, and district level is discussed and procedural considerations are outlined. Basic communication ingredients and skills are  discussed to help ensure successful communication with students about substance abuse. Training components of substance abuse education and awareness for students, faculty, parents, and the community are delineated. Four principles of policy development and an 11-step development process follow. Three sections address areas essential to policy content: student conduct and discipline; prevention; and identification and intervention. A sample alcohol and drug use student behavior and discipline policy and examples of community resources for assistance in substance abuse situations conclude the handbook. (13 references) (EJS)",

        "description":"Although California's real spending per pupil grew 13 percent between 1980-81 and 1990-91, real growth in educational spending here has not kept pace with the rest of the country. The reasons are complex, with many causes rooted in the state tax system design and the resulting school finance structure. This paper describes how and why California's system developed and discusses the options available to policy makers. The current situation can be traced to three watershed events during the past 20 years: (1) the &quot;Serrano v. Priest&quot; legal challenge to California's school finance system; (2) passage of Proposition 13's property tax limitation; and (3) passage of Proposition 98's minimum funding guarantee for education. These events have shifted control of school finance from local  districts to the state. The reliance on state funding has placed California's schools in a precarious position, as the current budget deficit is approaching $10 billion. The state legislature treats the 40 percent minimum funding guarantee as both a spending floor and a ceiling, and may even suspend the proposition this year. California has achieved a system that largely equalizes expenditure disparities and has eliminated tax effort differences across districts. The price of this achievement has been increased state control over revenues available to local school districts. Even the education community's efforts to garner a fixed percentage of the state budget for schools has failed to provide a substantial growth in educational funding. (13 references) (MLH)",

The discussion describes how teachers can act as central agents for meaningful educational reform. Based on a new technology-based paradigm in which the teacher's role is management of a multiple learning source system, the teacher becomes an information resource and mentor. Advantages of using computer-based technology for educational restructuring include increased planning time for teachers, creation of an active student learning role, individualized learning that eliminates student placement systems, a focus on outcomes rather than input, and  increased opportunities for professional growth. Making the restructured system a reality requires a view of schools in their social context, investment of the business sector, and substantial financial commitment. The first steps mandate the full involvement of teachers, leading to professionalization, and public and private collaborative funding. (LMI)",

Next, six broad categories of policy are explored: (1) leadership; (2) learning; (3) inclusion of community members and organizations; (4) organization; (5) finance; and (6) renewal. Specific topics discussed include following a shared vision, strategic planning, changed leadership roles and responsibilities, exemplary leadership practice, barriers to improved leadership, the  preparation of all students, high expectations and performance outcomes, instructional approaches, parent and community involvement, interagency cooperation, business cooperation, shared decision making, accountability, financing restructuring, funding and results, federal involvement, growth and renewal for individuals and groups, the development of future educators, and the evaluation of progress toward a shared vision. Policy changes needed in each area are summarized. Appended are examples of current restructuring approaches and philosophies; examples of district and state policy and administrative action to support restructuring; and information on financing restructuring, labor relations, and student assessment.

Three different systems from Curriculum Computer Corporation (CCC), Ideal Learning, Inc., and Jostens Learning Corporation were piloted in three elementary school to evaluate ILS usefulness in reading/language arts and math. The pilot evaluation was to answer questions about ILS results in other school districts, implementation problems, day-to-day operations, instructional program and district goal correlations, staff and parent ratings, academic achievement improvements, and Chapter 1 instruction. Qualitative measures (classroom observations, implementation difficulties, and curriculum review) and quantitative measures (parent, principal, and staff surveys,  pre-pre/post-skill test scores, and costs analysis) were used for evaluation. Test scores did not show major differences in achievement; however, teachers, parents, and principals stated that ILS had positive effects on children's learning. The Ideal program had the most weaknesses such as implementation and curriculum problems; CCC was more expensive but made more academic gains than Jostens. recommendations include continuing CCC and Jostens programs for another year and discontinuing the Ideal system.

Project LEAD's essence is rooted in the need to understand school environment functions and operations, local impacts of national/global issues, and the District of Columbia's public school system. To assess the program's impact on emerging leaders and administrative interns during the 1988-90 school years, three survey instruments were mailed to 56 participants (33 respondents) and one survey was sent to 15 mentor principals (14 respondents). Research questions asked about participant experiences, numbers of participants, program strengths and weaknesses,  effects on participant employment, mentor principal experiences, and how to improve the programs. Findings indicate that Project LEAD is carrying out its professional development and preparation function, but it is too early to determine if the training pays off. Recommendations include continuing the selection of quality faculty facilitators and developing a procedures manual to guide training activities.

One reason to implement this type of management is that school reform requires the involvement of all stakeholders in the educational process to be effective. During 1988-90, the West Virginia Legislature passed bills that mandated site-based decisionmaking. A group of three teachers and an intermediate service agency educator was organized to conduct a study to identify model site-based decisionmaking programs. Out of 55 programs, 8 were selected. The development, goals, organizational structures, training resources, accomplishments/obstacles, future, demographics, and contact information for each  program are given. Recommendations to educators as they begin restructuring include involving all persons affected by decisions in the decision-making process and valuing the opinions of others.

Purposes of the study included: (1) the development of more precise definitions of the concepts of restructuring and site-based management; (2) a description of the actual restructuring processes within schools; (3) and an exploration of changes in the uses of power and how that use of power affects the attitudes and behaviors of teachers and administrators. Methodology involved document analysis of 51 grant proposals submitted by Oregon schools for inclusion in the state's &quot;2020 School Improvement and Professional Development&quot; program for the 1990-91 school year. Interviews were  conducted with the principals and at least one site team teacher of 16 of the schools. Findings indicate that lack of a clear definition of &quot;restructuring&quot; did not prevent action. Successful change is possible in situations characterized by a ready staff, supportive principal, shared vision, and minimum of bureaucratic interference. A major factor for success is that reform is real to the people implementing it. Finally, the concept of facilitative power is useful for describing change strategies based on voluntary independent activities. A copy of the questionnaire is included in the appendix.

To observe school characteristics before and after the reform movement's spark by the release of &quot;A Nation at Risk,&quot; information from 59 schools' accreditation reports for 1979-80, 1984-85, and 1987-88 was analyzed to determine if the composition of curriculums has changed in the direction of the current reform movement and if those changes have had an effect on student outcomes. There has been a steady and significant increase in the  offerings and enrollment in the four core areas. However, increases in math and language course participation were not accompanied by improved test scores.

A review of literature concludes that positivism separates practice from abstract theory; phenomenology offers a different view of reality; ethnomethodology is based on the consensus of school community members and recognition of contextual influences on action; and critical theory can generate a dynamic self-reflection process. Positivism views the school administrator as an agent of the social order; phenomenology, as a negotiator; ethnomethodology, as a collaborative leader; and critical theory, as a facilitator for the fulfillment of others' human potential. A conclusion is that there are  limitations to each paradigm, yet each offers a new richness of interpretation for educational administration research, theory, and practice.

        "description":"Many of the first-wave reform initiatives of the 1980s have been successfully implemented on a widespread basis and are having an important influence on the schooling process. The reform movement was expected to fail because of strong financial, political, and organizational arguments. Reform initiatives were said to be insufficiently funded, lacking a comprehensive approach, employing inappropriate policy mechanisms and tools, and giving responses that were too indirect to be effective. Professional intransigence, deep-rooted norms in organizational culture, and the institutional, bureaucratic nature of loosely linked systems in schools also contributed to the movement's expected failure. Speculations on reasons for the reform movement's success are: (1) efforts built  improvements on existing organizational structures; (2) changes rendered schools more receptive to reform than in the past; (3) arguments on organizational propositions were incongruent with the current school systems; and (4) shifts in values had redefined the context in which reform was enacted.

To examine variations in current approaches to school administrator training, three questions are addressed: (1) What are the variations in program content and organizational processes among emerging administrator development programs? (2) What can be learned from naturally occurring variations? (3) What are the most likely and promising directions for leadership training programs in the next decade? The implications for programmatic variations in school leader development that occur in organizational context, program governance, development goals, participation mode, and curriculum content are discussed. The most critical factor in  determining the future direction of administrator development will be the general reform impulse and longevity of the state government's centralizing, interventionist role in the work of schools.

Four distinct frames that characterize ways leaders think about and respond to everyday issues and problems are examined: (1) the structural frame; (2) the human resource frame; (3) the political frame; and (4) the symbolic frame. Leaders provided narratives about their experience and, using survey instruments, rated themselves and their colleagues on two dimensions of leadership for each of the four frames. Their responses suggest which frames leaders use; how well frames capture the administrators' thinking; how well the frames predict administrator effectiveness; and how gender relates to leadership orientation. Results show that the variables which predict  effectiveness as a manager are different from those that predict effectiveness as a leader, and that leadership effectiveness is particularly associated with high scores on the symbolic dimensions, but is largely unrelated to the structural frame.

The settings of six high schools that had structured mechanisms for teacher participation in school decisions are described, and problems that emerged during shared decision making processes are presented: (1) conflicts between who participates and who does not; (2) conflicts among participants; and (3) internal conflicts--new and old ideas within the same individual. The problems caused by confusion regarding the locus of final decision authority are reviewed, and the need for teacher training in the content of issues faced by decision making bodies, in the processes of decision making,  and in negotiation skills is explained. Next, the development of a school culture that supports participation and provides a sense of mutual respect and trust is discussed, and one school's collective management procedure is cited as an example.

        "description":"Spanish Harlem's Community District 4, known as one of New York City's most disadvantaged school districts, has developed a system of alternative educational programs, coupled with controlled parental choice. Having begun in 1974 with the creation of a single alternative elementary school, the system now serves about one-fifth of all elementary students and all junior high school students, who attend programs chosen from a selection of alternatives. The development of the District 4 system has challenged many conventional assumptions about school organization and management, including correspondence between buildings and schools and traditional boundaries between administrative and teaching roles. Although the system's effects on student achievement are unclear, there is  substantial evidence that students are receiving considerable individual attention and that alternative programs are highly focused on academic learning for disadvantaged children. However, relations between District 4 and the larger administrative structure of the New York City Public Schools remain uncertain. Also, a substantial portion (80 percent) of elementary students lack access to alternative programs that are the focus of the district's instructional improvement. The creation of new programs is driven by teacher initiative and standards of quality, not by the objective of serving all students. (31 endnotes) (Author/MLH)",

        "description":"Interest in school choice has reached an unprecedented level in the United States. This paper discusses the origins, political context, and controversy surrounding the 1985 Minnesota Postsecondary Enrollment Options Act (PEO), the first state-level school choice initiative and a major catalyst for other states and districts. The first section describes political and historical conditions in Minnesota that hindered widely espoused educational reforms in the mid-1980s, but that contributed to PEO. The climate of fiscal conservatism in Minnesota's legislature, the lack of perceived serious educational problems, and strong local control sentiments were inimical to big top-down reform programs. At the same time, legislators felt politically pressured to support educational reform. A  window of opportunity was created for a previously unsuccessful coterie of school choice advocates. The second section focuses on policy and political outcomes of the PEO law. Student participation and performance data and competitive incentives created by PEO indicate that PEO is achieving its goals. Politically, PEO created turbulence and was opposed by Minnesota education groups. An analysis of the PEO debate's language and tactics suggests that much controversy and opposition stemmed from a struggle over authority and a defense of professional educators' control that is incompatible with school choice goals.

        "description":"Educational clinics, as defined by Washington State law, are private organizations that teach basic academic skills and provide employment orientation in an individualized way to high school dropouts aged 13 to 19. The Educational Clinics Program was authorized by the state legislature in 1977, after extensive lobbying by members of a private firm specializing in academic remediation. The legislation was opposed by established educational interests, including the state superintendent of instruction. The law authorized state financial support for remediation for youth aged 16 through 19 who had either dropped out of school or were academically at risk and were referred by their schools. The law also provided that only state-certified teachers could staff the clinics, that  enrollment in clinics should be limited to a fixed time period, and that payments to clinics should be based on performance. Over time, under heavy state monitoring, the clinics program has demonstrated significant results in both performance and cost. After initial opposition, clinics were incorporated into the state education agency's organization and budget and into local school systems' options for dropouts. (29 endnotes) (Author/MLH)",

        "description":"Controlled educational choice, defined as parental or student choice of educational programs within the public school system that is regulated for public purposes, has become a leading proposal for educational reform. This paper reviews evidence from three working models of choice: the Minnesota Postsecondary Enrollment Options program (PEO), the Washington State Educational Clinics program, and the Community District 4 Alternative School Choice program in New York City. Each program was characterized by early opposition, followed by relatively smooth implementation. All three programs show evidence of positive effects, though none has demonstrated the extent to which choice enhances student or school performance. In none of the models is choice available to, or exercised by, all  the system's intended clients. Introducing controlled choice does not necessarily result in a deregulated system stressing parent and school association around common purposes. In fact, all three choice models are heavily regulated on either the demand side, supply side, or both; this regulation is largely responsible for their effects. The programs demonstrate a wide variety of design issues that interested policy makers must confront, including the degree of regulation on supply and demand, the possible negative effects of choice systems benefiting active or inactive choosers, and the limited effect of choice systems on the broader systems in which they operate.

        "description":"A description of what occurs in the social context of the supervisory conference, based on the concept of conversational inference, a process by which participants assess each others' intentions and make appropriate responses, is presented in this paper. Using the illustration of a supervisor's request for teacher action that occurs in a conference, the paper explores the premise that spoken language is interpretable only in its context. A practical approach is therefore taken to study spoken discourse as a social process, examining the embedded meaning of speech acts and the listener's interpretations. Methodology involved analysis of videotape and interview transcriptions from Grimmett and Crehan's study of supervisory conference interaction. Findings suggest that given a  direct or indirect request for action by the supervisor, the teacher's acceptance or rejection of the \"suggestion\" is partially dependent on the teacher's views of the fit between the suggestion and class needs and his or her ability to enact the suggestion. Failing to address these concerns may preclude translation of the preferred suggestion or discovered solution into action. Further examination of supervisor/teacher interaction demonstrates rules for participation. A discussion of the relevance and applications of discourse analysis for teacher development and improved supervisory practices concludes the paper. (55 references) (LMI)",

Using such an approach to understand the practical problems of communication in supervisory conferences, this paper explores two dimensions of the conference: risk and politeness levels. Level of risk is determined by the degrees of interpersonal power, distance, and threat. Study of the interaction patterns of instructional supervisors as they conducted postobservation conferences with teachers involved analysis of supervisors' written reports and transcriptions of conference videotapes and audiotapes, supplemented by interviews. Rules of interpretation of direct and indirect speech acts were applied to isolate orders, suggestions, requests, and demands. The theory of  face-threatening acts, or FTAs, was then applied to determine the basis of choice of FTAs, to describe strategies elected for performing FTAs, and to describe related positive and negative conference phenomena. Findings indicate that low-risk and high-risk interactions were associated with less politeness and more politeness, respectively, thus confirming politeness theory. Findings also demonstrate ways in which FTAs diminish the instructional improvement potential of the interaction, thus raising questions about supervisor preparation and the value of such conferences.

Staff from six middle schools in Syracuse (New York) enrolling a diverse population of 3,200 students participated throughout the 1988-1991 school years in a series of professional development activities to increase teacher knowledge and use of instructional adaptations for an academically diverse and culturally heterogeneous student population. Three project components to address student needs include  academic engagement, peer support, and individualized support opportunities.

The overall process divides the problem-solving task into smaller questions and offers guidance about when to elicit more general acceptance.

Questionnaires were completed by 352 principals, 14,721 teachers, and 24,874 students from 362 junior and senior high schools in 36 states and Canada. Findings suggest that student and/or teacher climate variables played a significant role in all the analyses. Of the sociodemographic variables, the percentages of students receiving free lunches and the percent of  minority students in the school had the largest and most consistently direct and indirect effects on the outcome variables. Most school input variables' effects on outcomes were mediated by school climate variables.

Discussions include the evolution and growth of middle schools in the United States, differences between middle and junior high schools, and outcomes of middle-grade organization. Two national trends are identified--a reorganization of middle-level schools that favors a 6, 7, 8 grade-span configuration and a replacement of reforms for administrative purposes by those that meet student needs. Findings on different programs' effectiveness in meeting student needs and the relationship between grade organization and educational outcomes are inconclusive. Significant differences are identified in the implementation of various programs across  different grade spans. Four tables and one figure are included. (81 references) (LMI)",

This personal account analyzes the principal's use of corporal punishment, symbolized by the paddle, and positive reinforcement, symbolized by the pencils awarded to good students, to achieve discipline and cultural hegemony in the school. After a narrative description of the principal's interactions with students, staff, and the researcher during a single day, the principal's use of corporal punishment during different years is explored as well as his rationale for using corporal punishment, his negative view of the students and their parents, and his attitude  toward black students. Numerous direct quotes are included. Next, the principal's practice of awarding a pencil to exemplary students is reviewed and the ineffectiveness of the principal's use of \"two pieces of wood,\" the paddle and the pencil, to establish cultural hegemony is analysed.

        "description":"The last 2 decades of curriculum policy in Australia are reviewed in this paper, with a focus on reforms concerned with females and schooling. Two general areas are examined: (1) the theoretical relationship between state power and feminist concerns about schooling; and (2) the progressive direction for schooling. The first section compares two policy frameworks of the mid-1970s and late 1980s, and the second part examines ways in which feminist demands in education are being integrated within Australian state policy. Three themes concerning the state and feminist action are discussed. First, state policy in liberal-democratic societies will continue to modify challenges to power, due to the inherently exclusive nature of conflicting discourse. Second, the state has used feminist  discourse to increase funding of engineering, science, and technology. The field of gender and education is viewed by the government as a problem of women of nontraditional careers. Third, the commitment to equal education has been used to increase centralization of the school system, leading to more control, regulation, and surveillance. Conclusions are that a commitment to different forms of knowledge is in itself a universalizing framework and that vigorous critical engagement with equal education opportunity policies continues to be important.

Indepth personal interviews were conducted with 17 female elementary school principals in British Columbia (Canada), 9 of whom were appointed after September 1987 and 8 of whom were appointed prior to September 1982. Results were categorized according to developmental experiences, career development, administrative beliefs and practices, and assessment of the experience. Findings indicate that recent appointees received greater male support, experienced less explicit sex discrimination and harassment, and possessed greater career initiatives and a more diverse range of teaching and administrative experience. Former appointees tended to accept their marginal  status, but recently hired principals have embraced and accentuated the feminine character of leadership, articulating distinctive values to reshape the context and work of educational administration. Although both groups had to work harder than their male counterparts, they reported high levels of career satisfaction and expressed few regrets. (30 references) (LMI)",

As Canadian schools try to implement CSA prevention programs, changes in the community such as improved child care programs should occur simultaneously. A summary of CSA facts, new initiatives at the national level, and the role of the community, school, and principal in responding to CSA are reviewed. A comprehensive school health program is the most effective means for schools to respond to CSA. Research findings are presented to show the effectiveness of health education and CSA prevention programs. A checklist is provided which lists CSA action goals under the following headings: (1) instruction; (2) health, guidance, student and social services; (3) school climate; and (4) family,  community, media, and policy support. The items under these headings are themselves linked to four main goal categories, namely health program promotion, prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation. Key issues school administrators will face in implementing CSA prevention programs and policies include widespread cultural backlash, unfounded and false allegations and criticisms from the community.

This document draws on study data collected from multiple sources to examine how well the integrated model was being accepted and how the LA teacher's role is changing, particularly with respect to: (1) support to teachers as they cope with an increased workload; (2) integration of the emotional and learning needs of the whole child; and (3) continuing to address specific skill needs. Overall, study  results suggest that LA and regular teachers need support in terms of time for consulting; sharing of ideas, responsibilities, and decisions; and adjusting to new demands and pressures. Ongoing inservice training and recognition of the demanding nature of the teachers' roles were other needs pinpointed. Suggestions for future research on consulting and on the collaborative/consultation model conclude the document. Included are two tables. (14 references) (CLA)",

America 2000 is described as having four major &quot;parts,&quot; and this booklet is organized around those parts: (1) Better and More Accountable Schools (improving the 110,000 existing schools, for today's students); (2) A New Generation of American Schools (bringing 535 new schools into existence by 1996, for tomorrow's students); (3) A Nation of Students (persuading yesterday's students/today's work force, to keep on learning); and (4) Communities Where Learning Can Happen (identifying and designating committed &quot;America 2000 Communities,&quot;  willing to adopt the six national goals, develop a report card to measure their progress, and create and support one of the 535+ &quot;New American Schools&quot;). Some of the specific operational concepts involved in pursuing this strategy are: (1) &quot;New World Standards&quot; for what young Americans need to know, for each of the five core subjects (English, mathematics, science, geography, history); (2) &quot;American Achievement Tests,&quot; a new (voluntary) nationwide examination, based on the five core subjects; (3) &quot;Presidential Citations for Educational Excellence,&quot; awarded to high school students who do well on the achievement tests; (4) &quot;Presidential Achievement Scholarships,&quot; rewarding academic excellence among needy college/university students; (5) &quot;Merit Schools Program,&quot; rewarding schools that make  notable progress toward the six goals; (6) &quot;Governors' Academies for School Leaders&quot;; (7) &quot;Governors' Academies for Teachers&quot;; (8) Alternative Certification Systems for Teachers; (9) &quot;America 2000 Communities,&quot; designated by their governors; and (10) The &quot;New American Schools Development Corporation,&quot; a new nonprofit organization, to be established by the business community, that will award contracts for 3-7 &quot;R&amp;D Teams,&quot; that will help communities create the new schools.

Techniques for constructing group learning activities using cooperative goal structuring are broken down into the following steps: (1) specify group objectives; (2) assign students to groups; (3) arrange the room and distribute materials; (4) introduce the task; (5) observe the students; (6) evaluate the work. The study found that after teachers used this process for 2 weeks (10 45-minute sessions), students without handicaps more often looked at and spoke to their peers with handicaps, and students with handicaps actively participated more often. About 20 recommended resources  are grouped under the following topics: &quot;Integrating Handicapped Students&quot;; &quot;Cooperative Goal Structuring&quot;; &quot;Behavioral Techniques to Promote Integration and Desirable Behaviors&quot;; &quot;Social Skills Training&quot;; &quot;Training Nonhandicapped Students.&quot; (DB)",

It also reports current (June, 1987) variability among states along these same dimensions. The decade saw a decrease of 9.6% in the number of mentally retarded persons in large state-operated institutions as well as a decrease in the rate of placement into all types of residential facilities for this population. Graphs provide detailed statistical data on utilization of various placement options. An increase in the number of small, nonstate, facilities is also noted as is the consistent size of the population served by the residential care system. Considerable progress is noted nationally in securing  relatively small, community-based residential placements for persons with mental retardation. However, this progress was by no means uniformly realized among all states or with all types of facilities. Comments are made on standards for federal policy that would make the official national commitment to community-based services more consistently evident among all the states.

The report examines the project's model, the participating children and families, and evaluative findings regarding its implementation, outcome, and impact. The project served 25 children with a mean age of 18.9 months. All children exhibited severe disabilities. Project outcome data indicated significant gains of almost double the expected developmental rate for Project students including gains in specific skills, gains in developmental age, and gains in developmental quotient. In addition, 56% of the children exiting the project enrolled in more normalized (less restrictive) educational placements. The outcomes also support  the center-based approach of the Project and the social reciprocity model emphasizing parent child interactions. Results suggest that the net savings to society may be as much as $138,000 per child when such severely handicapped children are subsequently able to be placed in less restrictive educational settings.

Kennedy Center for Research on Education and Human Development, on the topics of the utility of dynamic assessment for predicting learning ability, its utility for generating educationally relevant prescriptions, and factors associated with the implementation of dynamic procedures. Following an overview of research issues, a &quot;continuum of assessment services&quot; model is presented. Along the continuum are such forms of dynamic assessment as graduated prompting and mediation assessment. In a discussion of the utility of dynamic assessment for predicting learning ability, static and dynamic assessment are compared, the relation between dynamic assessment and within-and-across-domain transfer is discussed, and  directions for future research are outlined. A section on dynamic assessment and educational prescriptions contains observations of young children's learning and directions for future research. Factors related to the implementation of dynamic assessment are then explored. It is concluded that static and dynamic measures produce different estimates of learning, that dynamic assessment is useful for predicting learning, that mediation assessment is effective for remediating strategies that help children improve their performance, and that dynamic assessments can have important effects on teacher expectations.

The research concerned the dimensions of adaptive behavior, its usefulness in placement and eligibility decisions, and differences between ratings of students' adaptive behavior by persons in various roles. The first group of investigations included: a study of the structure of adaptive behavior as a function of age, developmental level, and type of handicap; and an exploration of the relationships between adaptive behavior, maladaptive behavior, and intellectual/academic ability. Synthesis of these and other studies resulted in the following conclusions: (1) the structure of adaptive behavior appears to be represented by  one to two dimensions--a large general adaptive behavior factor and a second, relatively small factor, which varies with the particular test used; (2) maladaptive behavior is primarily a two-dimensional construct with social and personal dimensions; and (3) the adaptive behavior construct has minimal overlap or redundancy with the construct of intellectual and academic ability. Other studies found a strong correlation between adaptive behavior and special education placement and a tendency for parents to rate their children higher than teachers. Methodological concerns identified included factor analysis interpretation. Contains two references. (DB)",

Carnine. Overall, results indicated that well-designed computer-assisted instruction (CAI) can be an effective instructional medium for students with mild handicaps. Four types of CAI--drill and practice, simulations, tutorials, and videodisc--were investigated within the context of four stages of instruction--introduction, modeling, guided practice, and independent practice. Instructional principles examined included: size of teaching sets, cumulative review, explicit strategy teaching, discrimination practice, and elaborated correction. Among findings of specific studies were:  shorter vocabulary lists led to faster total mastery; computer-based simulations used for review and practice were more effective than conventional instruction in providing students with practice solving health problems; elaborated feedback (showing student all steps necessary to arrive at the correct answer) was more effective than simple corrective feedback in improving generalization and transfer of new knowledge; direct teacher instruction appeared necessary for tasks combining verbal and mathematical reasoning (e.g., math story problems); and videodisc instruction was highly effective in teaching fractions.

Two psychologies of instruction are described for teaching gifted students: behaviorism with its precisely stated, measurable objectives developed prior to teaching, and humanism with possibilities for students to engage in choosing which objectives to attain and  which learning opportunities to pursue.

Section II discusses the roles and structures associated with the application of the concept of therapeutic case advocacy task groups. Section III outlines the components the model uses to affect changes in environments, systems, or people's behavior. These components include case advocacy, interpersonal intervention, and care  management. Each component is guided by certain principles of action and a cluster of skills which are identified.

Activities and exercises are presented for four training goals: (1) understanding emotional disorders; (2) creating the individualized system of care; (3) resource identification and development;  and (4) applying the components of the model.

An introductory chapter discusses the concept of transition and outlines service components. Findings from a national survey of 53 transition programs are then presented. Findings indicated that 60% of the programs offered transition planning. Transition services offered by the majority of programs were, in rank order, independent living skills, career education, interpersonal relationship skills, leisure time training, and vocational training. Over 72% of the programs reported that parents were involved in planning and determining interventions on behalf of their adolescent. Descriptions of the 53 programs are then provided,  categorized into five areas: transition programs integrated within residential treatment settings; hospital-based transition programs; school-based programs; case management programs; and transition programs that are components of multi-service agencies targeting adolescents and young adults. Each program description discusses funding, philosophy, staffing, program components, and services. (Six references) (JDD)",

The conference was organized around four major issues: family support services; access to appropriate educational services; relinquishing custody as a means of obtaining services; and coordination of services at the individual family level (case management). During the conference, parent-professional teams presented information about the themes, convened into working groups to set goals, held sessions on developing parent organizations and building coalitions, and developed strategies to meet  their goals. Participants also discussed establishing a national network to improve services.

The Statewide Parent Organization Demonstration Project (SPODP) has two major goals: to stimulate and support the development of model statewide parent organizations that have the capacity to provide technical assistance, information, support, and networks to parents and parent organizations within states; and to evaluate the conceptualization, implementation, and outcome of these models to inform decision-makers about the most effective approaches in promoting such activity within states. The SPODP funded five extant parent organizations to develop  statewide parent networks and organizational structures, in Hawaii, Minnesota, Montana, Virginia, and Wisconsin. This report describes development of the SPODP and examines the accomplishments of the organizations in the five states selected as demonstration sites. The description of each state's project is followed by a summary of quarterly data submitted by the project. The report concludes with results from a qualitative research study of the five parent organizations' goal attainment and issues and barriers impeding implementation of a statewide parent organization. Results suggest that local groups need 2-3 years and resources of approximately $30,000 per year to establish a strong and well-functioning statewide parent organization. (JDD)",

Data came from the National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education Students (NLTS), representing more than 8,000 students (ages 13-21) enrolled in special education in 1985-86. Data were collected in 1987 from telephone interviews with parents, from school records, and from a survey of educators. Results show that: (1) approximately 14% of out-of-school youth aged 16 or older applied for vocational rehabilitation (VR) services; (2) the young people who applied generally had more severe disabilities and higher socioeconomic status than those who  did not apply; (3) students who attended schools that frequently contacted adult vocational rehabilitation activities in transition activities were more likely to have applied for VR services; (4) 69% of applicants for VR services received services; (5) a more active relationship between schools and VR agencies also appeared to benefit applicants for services in terms of an increased likelihood of receiving services; and (6) examination of rates of application for VR services across the first 4 years after high school showed no significant change in rates over time. Appendices contain an overview of the NLTS and information on variable construction and measurement issues. (Includes seven references.) (JDD)",

Teachers reported receiving a total of 1,125 items consisting of prevocational and vocational, audiovisual, adaptive, and communication-related equipment and materials, as well as computer hardware and software. Staffing was limited by problems in hiring a computer teacher trainer, and other problems occurred in timely identification of students and acquisition of equipment. While respondents overall  were enthusiastic about service received, objectives for student outcomes were not met. Participants were especially enthusiastic about the dysphagia and augmentative communication workshops and the Arts in Residency programs.

Strategies for reading to young deaf children are listed, including: make liberal use of animated signing; overview selected vocabulary prior to reading; read the same book over and over again; associate signs with print; read  at a comfortable pace; help children draw upon their own experiences to understand stories better; allow students to select books they want to have read to them; read what is written; and translate stories to American Sign Language.

The study used a backward mapping approach as it sought to identify best practices/procedures and problems that families and school staff perceived in programs for these two groups. Fifty-four people were interviewed, including representatives of nine school districts, parents, and community agency representatives. In the interviews, concerns were expressed about: (1) screening and assessment of bilingual students (including the use of interpreters in test administration, inadequate training for interpreters); (2) parental involvement  (obtaining informed consent for assessment, individualized education program approval); (3) placement options (lack of bilingual programs, lack of vocational programs, over-referral to special education); and (4) other issues such as drop-out rates, attendance, cultural awareness, funding, communication between tribes and schools, substance abuse, fetal alcohol syndrome, and teenage pregnancy. Appendices present recommendations relating to inservice training in assessment, and preservice training of bilingual/bicultural and Native American staff; special education placement rates by district; a bibliography of over 100 items; a list of other bibliographies and other resources; and interview summaries.

Training in eight vocational areas (building maintenance, mailroom/reprographics, jewelry manufacturing, upholstery, furniture finishing, custodial services, food services, and data entry) was provided to 47 young adults (out of 276 who expressed initial interest). Students also received training in basic literacy and interpersonal skills.  Participants had been out of school a mean of 3 years. Positive change was found using both pre-post tests and periodic competency ratings. Seventy-eight percent of program completers (49% of entrants) obtained competitive skilled jobs, with most earning less than $6 an hour. Issues in providing services to this population are raised concerning recruitment, selection, classroom-based training, and transfer of training.

The monograph is designed to help program makers compare their efforts with others, to provide options for planning additional services or altering services in existing programs, or to develop new programs. Monograph sections cover the following topics: (1) general issues in developing culturally competent programs as they relate to community-based family-centered care; (2) specific issues in policy and practice, such as assessment, outreach, family involvement, staffing, use of  translators, client load, professional-paraprofessional partnerships, and training and support; and (3) descriptions of programs funded by the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health that serve families in several different types of settings.

        "description":"A series of self-study questions is presented to examine policy and practice issues important in developing culturally competent programs for children with special needs and their families. Cultural competence refers to a program's ability to honor and respect the beliefs, interpersonal styles, attitudes, and behaviors both of families who are clients and the multicultural staff who are providing services. The self-study questions are designed to help program staff reflect on their program's decision-making process and examine how cultural issues affecting staff and clients interact with those decisions. The goal of the workbook exercises is to help the program target areas where staff, community, and families can work together to enable the program to become more culturally  competent in the delivery of services to all cultural and ethnic groups within the program's catchment area. Two self-studies are included. The first is intended to be used by programs; it provides an analysis of the type of agency supporting the program; types of services to be offered; policy issues affecting program design; and issues in practice such as assessment, outreach, staffing, client load, and training. The second study guide is intended for larger state organizations or interagency groups and focuses on: definition of target population; assessment; integrated service models, including the provision of case management; outreach and public awareness efforts; central directory, including early intervention services and resources; and personnel development.

The assessment occurs as part of an initial evaluation for eligibility and is usually part of the functional vision observation. The determined mode of reading is to be addressed on the Individual Education Plan (IEP) and reviewed annually as part of the IEP process. This technical assistance paper defines terms related to the concept of reading mode and notes three major factors to be considered in determining the mode of reading: child characteristics; mechanical factors; and social factors. Questions to be considered in these three areas are then outlined, such as whether the medical prognosis of the eye condition is progressive  in nature; whether the student experiences unusual fatigue in reading or writing assignments; and whether the chosen medium meets the needs of the student in terms of portability, availability, and cost. Seven resources useful in student evaluation are listed, along with 12 references for further reading. (JDD)",

Overall, the scores of the learning-disabled group were approximately .5 standard deviations lower than those of nondisabled students for high-school percentile rank, SAT verbal, SAT math, and first year GPA. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that high-school academic achievement was the best predictor of college GPA, with SAT verbal scores also contributing to the prediction. SAT math scores and learning-disabled versus nonlearning-disabled  categorization did not add to the prediction of college academic performance. An additional comparison of high and low academically achieving learning-disabled and nondisabled students found that percentile rank in high school class correctly classified 92% of low academically achieving learning-disabled students but only 28% of the high-achieving students.

The program offered 25 hours of staff development training for SIE teachers and related service providers, and 20 hours of in-service professional development for paraprofessionals. The program allowed personnel to design school-based staff development plans based on participant interest inventories as well as provide district-administered mini-courses in specific areas and a full-day conference. The concept of staff empowerment guided the program. Evaluation of the program planning and implementation process and of the training outcomes resulted  in six recommendations, including: establishment of clear guidelines concerning the roles of the Central Consultation Committee and the Programmatic Consultation Committees; provision of more training activities on weekends in conference form; and provision of workshops addressing the needs of specific groups. Over 3,000 staff members participated in various SIE training activities (i.e., a college course, school-based training, a SIE conference, and mini-courses). The report details the evaluation methodology, findings, conclusions, and recommendations. (DB)",

Analysis indicated a considerable variation among school systems in the distribution of exceptionality types, the proportion of special education students at different age and grade levels, teacher/pupil ratios in special education classes, and the reported need for additional special education teachers. Possible causes for these differences may include random variations, referral patterns, a shortage of well-trained administrators and teachers, community pressures, and discrepancies in classification procedures according to  race. The major demographic correlates of general rates of exceptionality included population growth, employment in selected white-collar occupations, income, and residence in urban locales--all of which were found to be positively associated with both the rate of exceptionality and the teacher/pupil ratio. The proportions of the population classified as &quot;black&quot; or residing in urban areas were also highly correlated with several specific categories of exceptionality. Results have implications for testing procedures and interpretation as well as implementation of policy guidelines for placement of students in special education programs. (DB)",

A needs assessment in 1988 revealed a high incidence of youth problems, multiple agencies working simultaneously with the same clients, and inefficient placements. The overriding mission of the Network is to facilitate the treatment of youth and their family in an effective, coordinated manner, maximizing the resources available from each agency through team assessment, team planning, and team implementation of those plans. The Youth Network interagency consortium consists of six agencies: Public Schools; Public Health; Social Services; Community Services Board; Juvenile Services Bureau; and Court  Services. The Network has two levels--the Norfolk Interagency Consortium, which addresses concerns of mutual interst to Network agencies, and eight Community Assessment Teams which formulate case plans, assign agency responsibility for services, and monitor each case on an ongoing basis. During its first 12 months of operation, 90 new cases and 187 follow-up cases were reviewed. (One case study is included.) The cooperative agreement is appended. Includes four references. (DB)",

A total of 25 participants took part in the inservice training program, which emphasized practical strategies and was given over two weekends. Comparison with nonparticipants suggested that significant changes occurred in teacher  willingness and perceived ability to work with others, reported knowledge of individualized instruction and classroom management, and appreciation of the benefits that derive from collaborating with others. Discussion of issues related to improving building level collaboration includes administrative support, teacher release time, recognition for team participation, and utilization of prereferral or intervention assistance.

Subjects were administered the Questionnaire on Social Support, which examines degree of support and subject satisfaction with degree of support in three areas: intimate relationships; friendships; and community or neighborhood support. A significant correlation was found between satisfaction with intimate support and maternal coping ability, while a weak correlation was exhibited between satisfaction with friendship support and maternal coping ability. No significant correlation existed between satisfaction with community support and maternal coping  ability. Mothers expressing greater satisfaction with intimate and friendship support were more likely to successfully cope with stress. It was concluded that perceptions of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with family resources may exert a considerable influence on the expression of family stress. Includes 19 references. (DB)",

The program's four components are: (1) career orientation; (2) occupational exploration; (3) employment research and experience; and (4) individual cooperative career planning. The involvement of a local corporation has resulted in a jointly developed Business--School Adoption Agreement, a self-esteem group, a scholarship fund, an honor roll incentive program, and  a student-of-the-month program. The program includes individualized instruction, career counseling, job placement, shadowing, and field trips to job sites.

Although Mashud was fluent and skilled in his native Sylheti language, he had a great deal of difficulty learning English. He attempted to spell phonetically and showed little understanding of grammar or punctuation. In writing assignments, Mashud consistently produced formulaic moral tales. Mashud's teacher hypothesized that Sylheti, as an oral language, had emphasized learning moral lessons and formulaic repetition of information rather than creative writing skills. Instead of discouraging his Sylheti-based linguistic attempts, the teacher employed individualized discourse and autobiographical writing tasks to expand Mashud's English knowledge and  writing ability. Mashud showed marked improvement in these areas, illustrating the importance of individualized, whole-language approaches to educating bilingual students. (JL)",

Both program types were established at the University of Illinois during the academic year 1989-90, with similar content, the same number of contact hours, the same instructor, and similar students in terms of first language background (Chinese) and range of English language proficiency. Twelve students participated in the 2-week summer course, and 10 in the 10-week concurrent course. Data were gathered on students' pre- and post-test scores on a language test and on an instrument designed specifically to evaluate the teaching and language skills of ITAs, and departmental evaluations were  obtained. Follow-up observations of course participants were also made. Based on these results and on impressionistic information, it was concluded that given limited resources, the best solution is to provide a concurrent course focusing on pedagogical effectiveness, including language and interaction skills and classroom culture and management. A less intensive summer course might be added, more geared toward social and cultural orientation, to feed into the concurrent course, which could concentrate on classroom communication. (MSE)",

Classroom techniques used included strategies for using the scientific method of investigation, hands-on activities, experiments, music, creative movement done to poetry, and a science fair exhibit. Each LEP student was grouped with at least two bilingual students who spoke both Spanish, the target language group, and English. Provisions were made with bilingual teachers for assessment of those unable to be tested in English. Results indicate that a comprehensive program using bilingual, cooperative learning and active involvement of all students in a wide range of  instructional activities will better meet the needs of students with limited English proficiency.

Participating students received instruction in English as a Second Language (ESL), native language arts (NLA), bilingual/ESL content areas (mathematics, science, and social studies), and business skills. Personal and career counseling, tutoring, and parent involvement activities were also provided. The project achieved its objectives in ESL, business skills, attendance, support services, and staff development.

It measures ability at three levels, is accredited by a board representing academic and business interests, was designed by the University of Jyvaskyla (Finland), and is administered jointly by three agencies, including the university. The test consists of a variety of common and job-specific tasks based on language needs identified by a survey of business and industry. The job-specific components are adjusted based on a questionnaire to which the  prospective examinee responds and can be further specialized by job description. The examination evaluates both written and oral comprehension and production. It takes 4-5 hours, and includes a half-hour of videotaped oral interviews and presentation. The oral testing team, a national network, is trained in workshops and the videotapes are reviewed for improvement of the testing technique. The candidate registers for the test at least one month before administration, and certificates are issued one month after administration.

An introductory chapter provides background information, beginning with the history leading to the test's development and concluding with a description of the test itself. The second chapter describes a survey to establish the job relevance of the test in each of the three teaching areas. The third chapter chronicles the development of the trial form of the TOPT. Chapter four describes the trial process, including the purpose, recruiting examinees, adminstration and  data collection, and the results of examinee data forms and judge sheets. Development of the final form is outlined in chapter five, and content validation is addressed in the sixth chapter. The final chapter describes how passing score standards for the TOPT were set through three separate studies.

In the ten microcomputers available to students, the regular version of the game was replaced with a modified version in which all student key-strokes were recorded automatically. Subjects were anonymous, most likely first-year university students. Data from 790 problems in 100 student sessions were analyzed for use of linguistic-competency-based (CB) and non-competency-based (NCB) strategies for solving the vocabulary puzzles presented. CB strategies included solving a puzzle with no hints; using hints with the result of a correct answer; and in some cases, use of a hint or &quot;See Solution&quot; to avoid hanging. NCB  strategies included use of &quot;See Solution&quot; rather than persevering; abuse of hints; and patterned key-presses. Analysis indicates students used CB strategies to solve about half the words presented to them, while ESL instructors, viewed as &quot;ideal&quot; learners, used CB strategies to solve 92% of the problems presented to them. The students' manner of doing the problems was distinctive, with NCB strategies used at a much higher rate among this group. Recommendations are made for improving the program's instructional effectiveness. (MSE)",

Subjectively, it structures an individual's intentions and thought processes; objectively, it preserves and makes public the store of knowledge of human society. The sharing of language is the basic way in which the objective world becomes part of the individual consciousness. Language gives the individual a way to organize and control phenomena and at the same time, language controls the individual. To classify Bernstein's work as an example of cultural-deficit or educational-disadvantagement explanation of school failure is to ignore the complexity of his formulations and other evidence that suggest he never intended his work to label working-class or  minority culture as deficient. His work illustrates how children come to school with &quot;different language patterns&quot; built on social class and family relationships, but does not indicate what or who needs to change. Bernstein's sociology of language looks for ways to recognize and break the &quot;spell&quot; of the patterns taken for granted in language use. A 72-item bibliography is included. (MSE)",

Because cooperative learning strategies are based on peer interaction and participants contributing to the common goal, the videotaped interactions of four male students during the daily (four days a week) use of CIRC were analyzed to infer and identify teaching and learning strategies that might explain student skill acquisition during CIRC activities. The teaching strategies included were modeling, contingency management, providing feedback, instructing, questioning, and cognitive structuring. The interactions between the two high-reading ability students changed over time;  interaction decreased in quantity, and the students stopped being actively engaged in answering questions and often worked on different questions. Interactions between the lower-reading-ability pair were much more frequent, involved much monitoring and active negotiation of answers, and were characterized by assistance-seeking from a teacher-aide. Both dyads used most of the strategies investigated. It is concluded that more than assisted performance theory is needed to guide analysis of student interactions, because the approach used here is too limited. A 15-item bibliography is included.

        "description":"In choosing to have students use the computer in unstructured writing activities, the instructor may prefer to cover basics during classroom sessions and have students use technological aids to expand on these basics in outside assignments. Out-of-class composition assignments force students to create with these basics on their own. Students use word processing programs rather than \"drill-and-filler\" software; their goal is not to learn the patterns of the target language but to use what they know to create their own meaning. Language teachers have been slow to use the computer in teaching composition and equally slow in reporting the results of their experiences. Observations are presented on the basis of a three-semester project to increase the use of computers in the writing  segments of four intermediate and advanced Spanish classes. It is concluded that the use of the computer in teaching foreign language composition has tremendous advantages, regardless of the content of the course or the way that the composition component is incorporated into the course. There are, however, several factors that will affect the efficacy of computer use. These include: (1) level of class; (2) size of class; (3) nature of assignment; and (4) individual versus group work. (JL)",

        "description":"One theory of second language acquisition argues that children's competence in a second language is a function of the amount of \"comprehensible input\" acquirers receive and understand, without formal instruction in reading or grammar. To examine this hypothesis, this study analyzes whether comprehensible input in the form of captioned television might influence bilingual students' acquisition of vocabulary and conceptual knowledge in science. The 129 bilingual seventh and eighth graders in the study were assigned to one of the following groups: (1) captioned television; (2) traditional television without captioning; (3) reading along and listening to text; and (4) textbook only. Students in these groups either viewed or read 3 units from a science series, twice a week for a  period of 12 weeks. Pretest checklist vocabulary tests and prior knowledge pretests were administered before the study of each unit; vocabulary measures analyzing a continuum of word knowledge of 90 target words were administered, along with a written retelling activity analyzing recall of science information. An analysis of word-related and video-related factors suggested that contexts providing explicit information yielded higher vocabulary gains. Further analysis indicated that those who were more proficient in English learned more words from context than others. These results suggest that along with the development of instructional strategies sensitive to differing levels of bilingualism, comprehensible input may be a key ingredient in language acquisition and reading development.

        "author":["Farrell, Paul"],
        "description":"This report aims to show how an emphasis on vocabulary can contribute to courses in English for Specific Purposes (ESP), using the data from two lexical studies. The first study attempts to discover to what extent there may be a general language of science, or semi-technical vocabulary. This type of vocabulary would seem to offer a useful organizing principle for a lexical syllabus in common core ESP courses, and a role for the ESP teacher who finds difficulty in dealing with technical material. The study is concerned with elaborating a definition of the term semi-technical vocabulary using a combination of subjective and objective data, and by applying these criteria to the word list from the LOB Corpus study of a number of scientific disciplines. The second study examines  lexical characteristics of one special language, electronics English. It is a lexical needs analysis, attempting to give a group of special interest learners words they need. The study is a count of the frequency items in 20,000 words of electronics English in ten 2,000-word samples. The entire corpus is examined, but the study also focuses on the semi-technical vocabulary of electronics, comparing it with the list developed from the first study. (JL)",

The program was devised with the help of the University of Birmingham, England, and ran for three years with English as the language of instruction. The content of the program was based on the needs expressed by language center teachers and on the ideas of a Steering Committee and various experts. A study was carried out by members of the Steering Committee to look at the attitudes of participants concerning their training at the PILC. Subjects were consulted at three stages: before the seminar, during the second seminar, and at the end of the course. For comparative purposes, a questionnaire was mailed to 41 people who had completed one of the earlier PILC programs, and who were  known still to be in the language center system. Respondents were asked for their subjective and retrospective views about PILC and its effects on their teaching and self development. The study concluded that PILC was an overwhelmingly positive experience for those who completed it. The strongest direct effect seemed to be on materials development. On the whole, participant expectations were met and the course was enjoyable and stimulating experience. (JL)",

The environmental context includes historical, political, economic, and demographic factors. These factors explain, at least in part, the wide variance in funding for higher education among the states. Historical traditions, the state's economic climate, and the centralization of the power of higher education within the state's political structure, as well as the aging of the population and the growth of the minority sector all influence the budgeting process. Among the primary elements of the budgeting process (governor, legislature, staffs,  educational community), staffs have become increasingly important. Timing is also critical when budgets are placed in competition with numerous other issues of importance to the state. Major policy concerns in higher education in recent years include: (1) accountability, (2) costs, (3) productivity, (4) quality, (5) affordability, (6) economic development, (7) access for minority and nontraditional students, and (8) equity for independent higher education. The implications of these concerns in the state budgeting process are discussed. Includes two references. (GLR)",

Sixteen employers of Classics graduates from a cross-section of blue-chip organizations in industry, commerce and the public sector were interviewed to describe the qualities they looked for in recruiting Classics graduates. Five specially selected classicists and career advisers were also included to provide further perspectives on the problem area. Findings of the study revealed the following: (1) employers were interested in recruiting graduates from any discipline provided candidates were &quot;bright people&quot; who possessed good oral and written communication,  interpersonal and managerial skills, numeracy skills and commercial flair; (2) personality factors employers required of Classics graduates were drive, determination, tenacity, commitment, energy, adaptability, creativity and common sense; (3) several employers expressed the view that Classics graduates would be particularly good in service industries, especially the computer industry. It was concluded that, although there is competiton from the more vocationally-oriented graduates, Classics graduates can hold their own in the knowledge that their discipline develops many qualities which employers are looking for, and a breadth of view which few other disciplines can provide.

The objective of the project was to assimilate all processes of departmental planning into one comprehensive, systematic construct. Procedures involved: the collection and categorization of sample planning models from seven universities, colleges and organizations; a literature review to identify relevant studies which confirmed the necessity of institutional planning, and suggested formats for planning procedures and helpful models and resources related to the formation of a planning model. The result of the study was the development of a planning model for the Student Development Department. The model was validated and  approved for implementation. It was concluded that the newly developed strategic planning model was appropriate and fundamental to the successful organization of the department and that it could be instrumental in generating greater efficiency and accountability in organizing and implementing departmental duties. It was recommended that the planning model be implemented as part of the departmental planning procedures for the 1991-92 fiscal year, and that an overall institutional planning cycle and schedule be implemented at the Winnipeg Bible College.

In order to achieve those goals, the policy states three program components. The first component is educational and includes plans for an annual drug and alcohol education week, a drug awareness fair, media presentations, campus exhibits, 60-second radio spots on university radio, publication of a drug prevention brochure, and continuous monthly outreach programs in each residence hall. The second section describes the  rehabilitation component of the program including the University Counseling Center, the Student Health Center, and connections to community health services. The section on the third program component, sanctions, covers the individual's responsibility to know the law regarding drug use, the university's procedural guidelines in the event of a violation and the sanctions for those who violate drug use policy. Listed first are sanctions for trafficking in illegal drugs, and second illegal possession of drugs. A section following discusses suspension pending final disposition procedures. The conclusion reiterates the university's commitment to education as a primary tool for combating drug abuse. (JB)",

Subjects (N=593) were undergraduate students at Murray State University in Murray, Kentucky in the fall semester of 1990, subdivided by sex, Greek status (independents, pledges, or actives), and college major. Using a Composite ACT score prerequisite, an F-test was performed on the grade point averages (GPA) of the students. The study hypothesized that college students independent of Greek social organization would perform higher academically than members of Greek social organizations, and that &quot;active&quot; members of the organization would perform higher academically than &quot;pledges&quot; of these Greek  organizations. Results of the study indicated that independents performed higher academically than pledges. Statistical data did not support the hypothesis that independents achieved higher academically than members of Greek organizations. No conclusions could be drawn dealing with actives. However, females in the study did have a significantly higher GPA average than the males. Includes 22 references. (Author/LPT)",

Twenty-four senior architects from Los Angeles architecture firms and 11 professional school deans and faculty members from the Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the School of Architecture at the University of Southern California were interviewed over a 2-month period. Findings indicated uneven congruence between faculty and practioner opinions. Successful practitioners in architecture pointed to the importance of knowledge, skill and work attitude while faculty were adamant that knowledge of field was all that mattered. Faculty felt that  formal education contributed more to professional effectiveness than work or life experience. Practicing architects on the other hand saw the benefit of knowledge, skill and work attitudes combined with work experience as the major contributor to professional effectiveness. Professional school faculty, despite their apparent indifference to job skills, interpersonal skills, and work attitudes as important competencies, perceived the professional school as the place to develop general job skills and interpersonal skills, while practicing architects felt that such competencies could be developed in schools, on the job, and in other life experiences.

The Northern Michigan University (NMU) High School Feedback System was designed to meet the needs expressed by high school personnel in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan for increased frequency, quantity, and quality of feedback about students enrolled from their institutions. The system provides the high schools with feedback for curricular evaluation and more effective academic advising. In its complete form, the model provides a wealth of information to its feeder institutions. A comprehensive feedback report has also been created to provide information on the academic credentials, performance, and graduation of students from those high  schools providing only a few students to NMU. The NMU model provides for the internal routing of data as well as the transmission of a wide variety of evaluatory information directly back to high schools. The feedback system was developed using DataEase. The model represents a formal commitment on the part of one college administration to share systematically with the high schools on which it depends heavily. Included is a detailed discussion on the operation of the NMU feedback system. Appended are illustrated examples of each main component of the NMU High School Feedback System. Includes 7 references.

Barber, summarizes principles identified  by the Whitman Center for the Culture and Politics of Democracy at Rutgers University. The next essay, \"Civic Education, Liberal Education, and Democracy\" (Donald Moon), examines the role of technical expertise, the objectives of liberal education, the nature of democratic discourse, and the content of civic education. \"Education for the Common Good\" (William M. Sullivan), discusses the concept of the common good within the context of civic politics and civic deliberation.

It argues that one can best explain the development of American higher institutions as part of a theory of capitalist development, because higher institutions are generally dependent on external patronage and, therefore, on the capitalist class. Drawing on Aglietta's \"theory of capitalist regulation,\" the paper suggests that the competitive, corporate, and state-capitalist phases of development have each resulted in a different structural form of higher education. Each structural form is characterized by its own types of governance, administration, curriculum, and teaching linked to the economic, cultural, and political interests of an ascendant segment of the  capitalist class.

        "description":"This paper presents the results of a study concerning the impact of changing demographic on curriculum and instruction in higher education and specifically, the impact of the adult student population on Otterbein College, Ohio. The study discusses gender and age considerations in its exploration of the school's student attitudes, teaching practices, goals, and outcomes. The purposes of the study were: (1) to evaluate existing academic services for adult students in terms of their effectiveness, need, and availability as compared with services provided traditional students; (2) to sensitize faculty to existing conditions and encourage careful consideration of instructional alternatives; and (3) to determine the applicability of the project findings to other institutions. The  report discusses results obtained from a student survey in the areas of what students perceived to be significant learning experiences, the learning styles of males versus females, what impact adult students had on the instructional setting, and whether adults were more participatory in mixed-aged classrooms. Results from a faculty questionnaire are also presented, and the educational implications of the findings are discussed. Contains 5 references. (GLR)",

        "description":"This paper is concerned with the teaching of undergraduate university courses on &quot;women and education&quot; or &quot;the sociology of women's education&quot; in the 1990s to pre-service and practicing teachers, some of whom are fearful of, or even hostile to, feminism. The paper consists of four parts: the first part presents the feminist educational theories of a New Zealand sociologist of women's education within the political circumstances of New Zealand and elsewhere from the 1980s to 1990s; the second part positions pedagogical concerns within the international discourses of sociology of education and critical pedagogy, in particular, the politics of the student's and the teacher's &quot;voice&quot;; the third part takes up this issue by using personal texts as a means of demonstrating how, in a  university classroom, feminist teachers and their students can move between personal experiences and sociological analysis; and the fourth part discusses biculturalism, an issue of educational and political concern in New Zealand in the 1990s. It is suggested that the bicultural feminist educational theories which are being developed within the New Zealand situation have a somewhat different emphasis from feminist concerns elsewhere in the western world.

        "description":"This paper discusses whether critical thinking can be taught in the college classroom. It argues that education in general provides the tools for thinking, and therefore, improves the capability for better thinking. The Alverno College faculty, as an example, has improved student critical-thinking ability because the faculty stresses explicitness, multiple opportunities to practice in differing contexts, and the development of student self-awareness and self-assessment. Teaching students to focus on the elements of a problem or to create a schematic or graphic representation are useful first steps to learning how to think. Also, student participation, teacher encouragement, and student-to-student interaction (active practice, motivation, feedback) are positively related to  critical thinking. Courses in logic and laboratory procedures are not very successful in teaching practical reasoning skills, whereas statistics courses have been more useful by helping students to generalize. Three elements of teaching are highlighted as contributing to the improvement of thinking ability: (1) verbalizing methods and strategies to encourage development of learning strategies; (2) student discussion and interaction; and (3) explicit emphasis on problem-solving procedures and methods using varied examples.

Among the beliefs and trends discovered are the following: (1) most commonly reported academic practices for undergraduate educational improvement were faculty recruitment, selection and promotion processes, and academic planning; the least used were student assessment and academic administrative leadership practices; (2) chief academic officers consider faculty recruitment, selection, and promotion practices the most effective practices at their institutions while the least were those related to instructional development; and (3) two-year colleges are more likely to have recently introduced new academic  management practices, comprehensive institutions are more likely to have such practices in place, and four-year institutions are more likely to rate the existing practices as effective. The Academic Management Practices Inventory, developed by the National Center for Research to Improve Postsecondary Teaching and Learning, is noted for providing the means for identifying the extent and effectiveness of academic management practices on individual campuses.

Classroom assessments are defined as efforts to understand learning, not classify the learners as is done through tests and quizzes. Two examples are provided of classroom assessments. The paper concludes by discussing the three major benefits that faculty reported as a result of their involvement in classroom assessment/research: the additional contact with colleagues about teaching and learning; the favorable student responses to the assessment process; and the enjoyment  gained from studying teaching and learning in their disciplines and applying what they learn.

        "description":"This paper reports the results of a study involving over 2,000 college faculty members concerning the course goals they hope their students will achieve as a result of the material taught, the teaching technique, and the general intellectual environment in the classroom. The common interest of most instructors is the desire to develop the student's ability to think independently and critically and to be able to evaluate ideas, issues, and situations. Such goals are viewed as rewarding and involve broadening the student's intellectual vistas, teaching them to organize and clarify their thinking, helping them develop critical-thinking skills, teaching them how to analyze problems and follow logical approaches to situations, and encouraging them to discover and express their own  ideas and thoughts. All disciplines, it is noted, contribute in their unique way to the student's personal growth, but no discipline alone provides all the answers to thinking and problem solving. The study concluded that no matter what the field or discipline, faculty who set personal development goals for their students stress multiple approaches to problem solving and the ability to evaluate, to think critically, and to be open to new possibilities.

Chapter 1 presents an historical overview of proprietary school participation in Title IV student aid programs and Chapter 2 explores the current participation of proprietary school students in Title IV programs, looking at program and student participation data. Chapter 3 discusses the two major concerns relating to proprietary school participation in the Title IV programs: abusive practices and Guaranteed Student Loan defaults. Chapter 4 focuses on six broad issues: the access of vocational students to postsecondary education; the cost of a proprietary school education to the student and to the taxpayer; the use of  Title IV as the major source of federal aid for job training; the protection of the student consumer; the integrity of student financial aid programs; and the use of student aid as a funding mechanism. The final chapter offers some concluding observations on the basic choices concerning proprietary school issues and student aid programs that are available to Congress. Two appendices provide information on the history of proprietary schools' involvement in Title IV, and the types of available aid under Title IV and eligibility requirements for the participation of schools and students.

The data indicated that about one-third of the nation's 2,600 nonspecialized degree-granting institutions had CSAPs in 1990. Among findings were the following: most institutions view their administration as the major force behind assessment; most institutions are addressing a broad range of student learning and development areas; 40% of institutions have established an assessment office; nearly 70% of respondents reported faculty as &quot;moderately&quot; or &quot;strongly&quot; involved in assessment  planning or implementation; assessment leaders come from diverse backgrounds; 62% of respondents reported no detrimental effects or said it was too soon to cite liabilities; problems in implementation were student motivation/participation, financial support, faculty motivation/participation, availability of valid assessment methods, and use of results for program enhancement. Conclusions offer a 9-step CSAP development model based on findings, suggest some unanswered questions, and predict that the next 2 to 5 years will be crucial to the assessment movement.

        "description":"With the goal of providing professional development resources for enhancing faculty research productivity, Washburn University (Kansas), which employs about 250 full-time faculty, developed a program that allocates institutional funds through a peer review process. The fund's peer review process has involved two committees, a Faculty Research Committee (FRC), and a Research Review Committee (RRC). The FRC, an umbrella committee of 10 members responsible for the dispersal of funds, has met monthly to review &quot;small&quot; grant requests (under $2,000) and to review recommendations from the RRC. The RRC has been primarily responsible for reviewing &quot;large&quot; funding requests (over $2,000) and making recommendations regarding those requests to the FRC. Proposal guidelines for small and large  grants have been developed over the lifetime of the fund. Conflicts have developed over the desire for more detail and additional guidelines versus the desire to reduce complexity and paper work. In addition, once the funds are allocated, the recipients have received no further support for coping with institutional personnel and purchasing procedures. Included are program guidelines for both small and large proposals, a five-item bibliography and an appendix containing a major research grant proposal application form. (JB)",

The publication addresses two major goals of the California Education Summit: (1) to increase the percentage of students entering high school who enroll in and earn bachelor's degrees from four-year colleges; and (2) to make it possible for all segments of the school population to achieve at a higher level. The document begins with a listing of essential principles for high schools: make the school accountable; build an academic school culture; make access to college preparatory classes a reality;  provide professional support for staff; include parents as an essential part of the process; provide coordinated student support services; attend to articulation; and make information about colleges available. For each principle implementation suggestions are provided. A further chapter addresses how district and institutions of higher education can support schools' efforts. Appendices provide lists of resources for districts developing college preparatory programs, participants in the symposium, and members of the Advisory Committee on College Preparation of Underrepresented Students.

The study used a four-part survey questionnaire designed to address specific issues related to factors such as behaviors, attitudes, interests, knowledge, and awareness levels. The total number of students returning the questionnaire was 174, a response rate of 89%. Standard analyses were conducted using a statistical package to determine frequency distributions and means. Non-parametric analysis was used to locate any statistically significant differences in responses based on sex, or amount of travel during the  semester. P-values were adjusted using the Bonferroni method. Substantial changes were reported in attitudes, specific knowledge levels, beliefs, values, behaviors, open-mindedness, personal growth, and general appreciation of other cultures. Suggestions are made in terms of implications for further research, development of orientation programs, the relationship between changes in variables and gender, and the relationship between changes in variables and the amount of travel during the semester. The report presents the data in numerous tables and provides 19 references. (JB)",

        "description":"This report presents the findings of a Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) survey of 2,874 colleges on remedial/developmental programs offered during fall 1989. The survey provides national estimates on the following factors: institutions that offered remedial courses; reading, writing, and mathematics remedial courses offered; students enrolled in and passing remedial courses; and faculty teaching remedial courses. It also provides information on characteristics of remedial courses and programs. Data for all institutions are presented by control (public and private), type (2-year and 4-year), geographic region (Northeast, Central, Southeast, and West), enrollment size of institution (less than 1,000; 1,000 to 4,999; and 5,000 or more) and minority status (student body less than  50% white and student body greater than or equal to 50% white). Some of the characteristics are interrelated particularly along the lines of type and control. Survey findings in this report are organized into three main sections. The first section discusses the number of institutions, courses, freshmen, and teachers involved in college-level remedial education; the second describes remedial courses and programs; the third compares data from this survey to data from the 1983-84 survey on this topic. Numerous tables and figures display the data. The report includes a copy of the instrument used. (JB)",

The hearings, taking place over 8 days, involving nearly 50 witnesses, and dealing with the overall GSLP status, were organized around case studies, specifically: The American Career Training Corporation of Pompano Beach, Florida; The Culinary School of Washington, D.C.; and the collapse of the First Independent Trust Company of Sacramento, California. This investigation was prompted by a large volume increase in the program, a  dramatic increase in loan defaults, and reports of waste, fraud and abuse within the GSLP. In four sections the following topics are addressed: the nature and extent of the program (GSLP growth, business over education, industry profits, problem schools, students as victims); the existence of serious problems at all levels (school practices, state licensure, accreditation, financial players); the dismal record of the U.S. Department of Education (failures to monitor eligibility and certification, accrediting agency recognition, financial player regulation/oversight, administration/management, enforcement).

The population for the study was comprised of 166 comprehensive and research-doctoral universities and the time period was the 1982-83 academic year. Since a period longer than one year is needed to produce graduates, cross-sectional data were used. The universities were divided into four types: selective-private, selective-public, less selective-private, and less selective public. Data on several other  variables were collected: inputs and outputs (students, degrees granted, articles published), faculty, departmental and administrative services, library services, and physical plant. Findings indicated, among other things, that students have a negative exchange value, that financial aid programs do not affect the exchange value of the student to the university, and that the universities that publish the most have relatively high marginal exchange values for research. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that universities maximize faculty consumption. They are inconsistent with maximizing prestige, profit, production or with valuing intrinsically academic activities. (JB)",

Using as subjects 150 graduate students (100 female and 50 male) and 100 undergraduate students (75 female and 25 male) from 10 universities in the United States, a field tested questionnaire was sent to 2500 students in all. A response rate of 21% to 55% for undergraduates and 33% to 56% for graduate students was achieved for a sample of 446 graduate students and 313 undergraduates. Analysis involved three comparisons: female and male; women selecting conventional and unconventional fields; and women and men students in unconventional fields. Conclusions were that field study choices develop over time with families, teachers, and schools  playing important roles. In addition, competence in math and science were seen to affect the selection of nontraditional fields. These conclusions suggest that universities might adopt policies to provide more math and science courses, and to become more supportive of women students. Five figures and 80 tables supplement the text. Appendices contain the survey tools and a list of fields of study and rating of conventionality. (JB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to gather information on what the role of university presidential spouses should be as reported by spouses and chairs of boards of trustees at member institutions of the Association of American Universities (AAU). Data were gathered from a survey that was mailed to spouses and trustees during the summer of 1989. At that time, AAU's membership included 55 institution presidents with spouses of whom 85.5 percent returned the survey. Trustee response rate was 57.6 percent. Results revealed two major patterns of response: (1) according to both spouses and trustees, the role of the spouse should be discussed informally among the board, the spouse, and the presidential candidate during the presidential interview process, with the spouse actively  participating in defining the role; (2) the response patterns support the concept that the spouse's involvement with the university should be either as a volunteer or as an employee. Response patterns of spouses from both private and public universities and the response patterns of trustees from public institutions tended to support both types of involvement, while the response patterns of trustees from private universities tended to categorize the role as that of a volunteer. The survey itself is appended. (Includes 7 references) (Author/JB)",

The program was designed to meet both financial and volunteer needs of college students and to encourage children, ages 10-12, to continue their education past high school. Twenty academically talented college students needing financial assistance received stipends of $200 per quarter to be tutor/mentors to 20 disadvantaged children. The children were provided with tutorial enrichment sessions, monthly visits to the college, and field trips to cultural programs in the Atlanta area. External evaluation assessed the program as being very beneficial to the children, college students, and the community. The handbook developed by the program  describes: (1) the program's purpose, assumptions, and objectives; (2) planning activities such as presenting ideas to key personnel, identifying and securing funding sources, and hiring and training staff; (3) guidelines for program activities, covering tutoring/enrichment sessions, campus socialization experiences, cultural awareness trips, the evaluation process, and tips from tutors.

The program serves students majoring in the following fields: anthropology, computer science, economics, history, philosophy, political science, psychology, and sociology. Currently an average of 33 undergraduates per semester elect the alternative courses. The program has involved development of specific core courses, development of courses in the major field programs based on the alternative  core, and preliminary development of entirely new Bachelors programs based on the alternative core. Eight Bachelor of Arts degree programs based on the alternative core are now in place. Recommendations include adding two more Bachelors programs to maintain a critical mass of students and ensure the long term viability of the alternative curriculum. Separate brief reports by faculty participants in each of the new courses are included. (DB)",

The program is intended to allow students to study subjects distant from the requirements of their concentrations. Students present their intellectual ambitions in an application process and are admitted during their second or third year of college, allowing them time to integrate the extra year of courses into their educational planning. Participants are pleased to have the additional time, and faculty endorse the option. The program is particularly attractive to students preparing for scientific and engineering professions where degree requirements leave little time for electives. In the program's 3-year history, 73  applications (out of 160) have been accepted. Thirty-two students have completed their programs and graduated; six have withdrawn; and 35 are still in the process. Male participants predominate. Proposed programs of study must further general educational and not vocational goals; they must be spread throughout the third, fourth, and fifth years; they must have a theme; they must include at least four courses above the introductory level; and they cannot include courses within the student's concentration.

Evaluation methods included a freshman/senior essay, the Academic Profile, the Pace College Student Experiences Questionnaire, and senior interviews. The structured group interview process, developed in the consortium, has proven to be the most productive of the assessment methods. The senior interview involves one faculty member and several students for an intensive 2-hour conversation and has been highly rated by both students and faculty. Over the 3 project years, approximately 250 faculty and about 1260 students have participated in the interviews.  Interviews were analyzed in relation to college goals, and each college was provided a written analysis of interview results. A series of conferences on assessment and general education provided faculty development as well as consortium direction. The consortium also provided a meaningful comparison group of similar institutions for individual colleges. The bulk of the document is made up of five appendixes which provide: the guidelines used in conducting the interviews; a sample transcript and analysis; guidelines for the freshman-senior essays; information on the Assessment Institute; and information on the assessment consortium conferences.

Arguing that this emerging technology can support the concept of a &quot;virtual classroom&quot; at a cost affordable by the average student, the paper then describes two upper division courses on the management of computer and information systems that have been offered through EIES by the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Responses to a survey of student attitudes toward the course and the means of delivery are also reported. The  major findings indicated that: (1) students generally felt comfortable communicating in this medium, although some had reservations about taking an entire course through this medium, and some reported difficulties associated with having only limited typing skills; (2) most of the students who felt they did not learn much through the use of this technology were students with low course grades who perhaps did not have the requisite motivation or talent; and (3) student-teacher interaction using computer conferencing generated more work and time involvement for each instructor on a per student basis. It is noted that this paper is not meant to be a balanced presentation of the pros and cons of this technology, but rather an advocacy of further experimentation with its use in distance  education, including the development of a graphical interface.

The new computer-based audiographic system was tested during the fall semester of 1988 during the delivery of a course in visual literacy. In addition to the computer-based telecommunication system, instructional support for the delivery of the course included print materials, 16mm film, slides, and videotapes, which were mailed to the two sites where classes were held. Course development concerns included: (1) maintaining consistency between on- and off-campus sections of the course; (2) humanizing the delivery system; and (3) dealing  with unique instructional design and delivery demands which emerged from the use of the technologies. Some of the suggestions for the design and development of similar courses using computer-assisted instruction and audiographic telecommunication systems include acknowledging the capabilities and limitations of the delivery system; reducing technophobia; and cautioning the students and teacher of the time, flexibility, and energy demands of the delivery system.

One concern expressed is that little tends to be abandoned in the curriculum, and that usually new topics are simply added on; the analysts feel that it is time instead to change the way some subjects are taught. Implications of technological advancement on the curriculum are briefly discussed, and the launching of the  Las Cruces (New Mexico) Public Schools Environmental Scanning Project is announced. Additional trends and/or events that are noted focus on the implications of changes in the way educators think about learning for the construction of schools, libraries, museums, and public parks; a project to initiate the development of national teaching standards: more international challenges for U.S. schools from proposed new standards for European school systems; the ability of computer users to enter computer-generated worlds called virtual reality; and the current slowing of world population growth.

        "description":"&quot;New Things Considered&quot; reports on emerging trends and issues in education to policymakers and participants in SEDL-SCAN, an emerging issues tracking system being pilot tested by the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory's Policy Information Service and the State of New Mexico. This issue begins with a report on the reactions of educators to Channel One, a daily educational news and current events program which includes 2 minutes of advertising in each 12-minute program. Schools which sign a 3-year contract to have their students watch the program receive in return free satellite and television equipment. The current controversy arises from the inclusion of advertising, even though the commercials are restricted to acceptable products. Many national educational groups have  condemned the programs, and they have been banned by several state boards of education. SEDL-SCAN analysts agree that students need to develop an interest in news and current events, but they warn that the lure of &quot;free gifts&quot; may result in the exploitation of school children. This report concludes with the observations that the commercials could be used in teaching students to analyze advertising and that alternative news programs without commercials are being endorsed by a number of groups. This issue also includes a brief report on the Las Cruces Public Schools Environmental Scanning System and summaries of noteworthy trends, events, and technological developments related to education.

The response argues that, while newer technologies will impact on distance education, they will not be the panacea suggested by Pelton. The response also points out that not all \"new\" technologies are interactive or \"two-way\": but they will impact on both existing and new distance teaching institutions. However, if interactivity is to be maintained, this will be mainly for courses with relatively low numbers for many developing countries. Print-base courses will remain essential, both for economic and quality reasons. Americans need to be aware that \"tele-education\" is not the only, nor even the most effective, form of distance  education. (DB)",

Student and instructor materials were created and tested in small group protocols. It was found that some of the computer graphics and software design of the simulation components were effective even though they were more  complex than traditional modeling techniques, and that existing artificial intelligence models need to be further developed before they can be used in programmed tutoring for science instruction. Videotaped protocols of pairs of students exploring the software using written directions proved to be a valuable formative evaluation techniques. (DB)",

Previously used as an industrial instructional analysis and development tool, IDE has now been used as a tool for teacher training. It uses hypermedia-style representations of subject matter and an instructional design model that students use to develop curriculum and organize courses. The results of using IDE include: (1) students are prompted to follow the instructor's design guidelines and  standards; (2) continual feedback between students and instructor can be provided; (3) participative decision making between students is promoted; (4) reflection among students as to the effects of their decision is promoted; and (5) exploration of subject matter arrangements is possible. Students using IDE for curriculum development in mathematics are willing to explore alternative lesson organizations, have a deeper understanding of the subject matter, and think more about instructional design practice.

David Merrill and colleagues at Utah State University i.e., Merrill's Naming Transaction Shell and Merrill's Checklist Procedures Transaction Shell. The software provided the capability to design, develop, and deliver computer-based instruction for teaching both the parts of a device and simple checklist procedures pertaining to the device. The primary objective of the study was to identify the relevant variables to be used in determining the acceptability, the generalizability, and the  effectiveness of the instructional design software. In an initial study, the Naming Transaction Shell was evaluated by a subject matter expert with no previous computer experience who was an instructor at the U.S. Air Force Academy. A second study conducted with six subject matter experts and the same instructor used two transaction shells--naming the parts and checklist procedures. In each study, subjects had about 30 hours to design and develop a lesson module for one hour of student instruction. In the second study, a simple drawing program was used to create graphics. Both studies indicate that the transaction shells provided a highly cost-effective authoring environment and that this approach has good potential for courseware authoring. (SLD)",

        "description":"Research on the effects of collective bargaining by library clerical workers indicates that effects are often less dramatic than expected, and that there does not appear to be a single \"union effect.\" Although one study found hefty gains for library workers with collective bargaining agreements, other studies have found no significant gains by the same classes on employees in similar libraries. The bulk of the evidence indicates that there are probably some wage advantages that can be attributed to collective bargaining; however, the gains are not nearly as large as those achieved by workers in other occupations. For example, library workers are estimated to gain 4 to 8% wage improvements through unions as compared to 12-15% increases for workers in industrial occupations. While  it is undoubtedly true that unions can slow activities and significantly obstruct progress, several studies have shown that collective bargaining contributes to improved operational efficiency. Increased productivity is thought to result from management's being pressured by a union to be more accountable in a union environment. It is also argued that collective bargaining can improve productivity by opening up communication channels. However, the net effect of collective bargaining on productivity and organizational efficiency is still in doubt. (SD)",

The study targeted both rural library clientele and non-clientele through two questionnaires and telephone surveys to elicit information on: (1) the role and functions of the rural public library; (2) client attitudes about the library; (3) why the majority of library users are female; (4) client information needs; and (5) whether libraries should charge service fees. It is noted that current disuse of a marketing approach to libraries by the typical rural librarian  underlies the entire report. Concluding the report are the research team's conclusions and recommendations, the research team roster, and copies of the survey instruments with tallies of the responses to the individual questions.

        "description":"This paper examines the factors that contribute to a library's decision to become involved in adult literacy and the service roles assumed by a given library. Common library literacy service roles (i.e., collections, services in support of local literacy efforts, and direct instruction) are discussed and profiles of the types of libraries that are involved in literacy education are given. Factors that contribute to a library's level of literacy involvement are then compared and contrasted among public libraries, community college libraries, institutional libraries, school libraries, state library agencies, and university libraries. Similarly, the types of literacy activities in which these libraries are involved are identified. One type of literacy activity, the family literacy  program, is explored in more detail. It is observed that the effectiveness of the family literacy program stems from its holistic approach to literacy, in which both children's and adult services librarians blend their levels of expertise. Several funding sources for literacy education are reviewed, and it is suggested that the library's role as a partner in adult literacy education will continue to grow. (8 references) (MAB)",

The calendar covering 1991 lists 486 international, national, state, regional, and local events. Events are listed chronologically by date and each entry provides, when available, information such as conference dates,  site, sponsor, contact person, registration information, hotel rates, estimated attendance, topics covered, and audience.

Introductory material argues that leadership in management should be defined as a performing art rather than a science. Next, a four-page literature review examines the trend away from a structured, goal-directed approach to management towards a more spiritual, self-reflective one, and contrasts works on traditional and nontraditional approaches to leadership. The case study is then presented in the following sections: (1) The Parable of the Seeds, or the Story of the Access Division; (2) Access Division--History and Achievements, reporting  quantifiable indicators of success on the futures program, academic upgrading, services for the hearing impaired and special needs students, and community outreach; (3) tables examining the Access Division's structure and achievements for 1989-91; (4) an analysis of the case study, using a framework which centers structure, people, politics, and symbols/spirit; and (5) a conclusion, underscoring the importance of the leader's ability to view the organization through multiple lenses.

First, the plan's executive summary lays out recommendations concerning the relocation of the RDV library's collection, the funding of a new learning resources center at RVS over a 5-year period, the development of circulating collections at the off-campus centers, and the use of technology to improve access to all LRS collections. Next, a summary of recommended expenditures for the development of the LRS for Fiscal Year 1989 is presented. A description of LRS at ACC is provided next, focusing  on library and media services, and computer-based instruction. The next section assesses the current status of LRS at the two campuses in terms of the Dynix Automation System which controls the circulation system and public access catalog, and LRS agreements with area libraries. This section also looks at accreditation criteria and results, highlighting the projections, suggestions, and recommendations offered by ACC's accreditation self-study and visitation teams in 1982 and their current status. After restating the LRS Management Team's recommendations, the report presents the development principles underpinning the recommendations, and the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed plan.

An extensive questionnaire was developed and mailed to all 45 chief executive officers (CEOs) systemwide to obtain information related to technology transfer programs, policies, and resources. Key findings, based on a 93% response rate, included the following: (1) nearly all responding colleges offered a wide range of technology transfer products and services, such as technical assistance with current technologies; information and resources for small businesses, entrepreneurs, and  inventors; and customized contract training; (2) a majority of the colleges had formed partnerships with government, business and industry, and/or other educational institutions to facilitate technology transfer; (3) over 75% of the colleges reported that local business and industry had additional technology transfer needs in such areas as basic skills enhancement and advanced manufacturing technology training; (4) over one-half of the colleges regularly evaluated technology transfer programs through informal communications, surveys, or interviews; and (5) over 80% of the colleges provided salary supplements or stipends to full-time faculty participating in technology transfer efforts. Based on survey findings, the ICPCCP offered five recommendations, concerning college and systemwide  administrative policies, partnerships, funding, faculty development, and formal evaluation, for the advancement of the ICCS's technology transfer function.

The purpose of the survey was to investigate the perceptions and opinions of former LCC students concerning their community college and transfer experiences. Major findings, based on a 20% response rate (N=305), included the following: (1) the most frequently cited primary reasons for choosing to attend LCC were cost (31%), location (17%), to gain confidence (11%), and desired courses and programs offered (10%); (2) secondary reasons for choosing to attend UO were the courses and programs offered (41%) and location (32%); (3) the respondents' mean high school grade point average (GPA) was 3.18, while their mean LCC  GPA was 3.42; (4) 81% of the respondents reported that they had not earned a two-year degree before transferring to UO; (5) nearly 30% reported that some of the credits they had earned at LCC were not transferable to UO; (6) 77% were pleased with the academic preparation they had received at LCC and would recommend that a friend attend the college and then transfer to UO; and (7) 55% felt that classes at LCC had been moderately difficult. Common responses to open-ended questions are provided, and the 64-item survey is attached. (JMC)",

Institutional research plays an essential, if not the key, role in enrollment management. This report discusses the types of research questions that must be addressed at each stage of the student college experience; reviews the literature on enrollment management; lists performance monitoring indicators during the recruitment and retention phases and the appropriate collection methods for such data; describes strategies for data management; lists sample student tracking data elements relevant to the entry phase, term-by-term progress assessment, and  follow-up of graduates and leavers; and describes the purposes and uses of regression analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis, and discriminant analysis. The following four principles for data application are also discussed: (1) constructing separate longitudinal files for tracking selected student cohorts; (2) including data elements for analysis of specific student subgroups; (3) conducting survey research to illuminate key student decision points; and (4) examining both the college policy environment, and the views and needs of the student. Data presentation principles are also discussed, including matching format to the analytical sophistication and learning preferences of recipients of the information; avoiding statistical jargon; and using executive summaries, graphics, tables,  analogies, and verbal aids appropriately. Sample reporting tables and graphs, and a 30-item bibliography are included. (PAA)",

        "description":"The Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security (SRKCS) Act, voted into law in late 1990, requires colleges and universities to disclose graduation rates and statistics on campus crime. For institutions offering sub-baccalaureate vocational and technical degrees, the Act supersedes Track Record Disclosure (TRD) Regulations requiring institutions to provide information pertaining to graduation, job placement, and successful completion of licensure and certification tests. Among the problematic aspects of the SRKCS Act are that it does not offer operational definitions of graduation rates, explain how to calculate success rates for incoming transfer students, describe disclosure procedures, or consider the vast research literature on the inputs, processes, and outcomes of the  undergraduate experience. Other concerns about the SRKCS requirements relate to their fairness, usefulness, and costs, and the possibilities for misusing information and overextending a college's capacity to manipulate the required data. In an effort to determine how successfully different institutions handle such legislative requirements, and to shed light on the feasibility of implementing the SRKCS Act, surveys were sent to 320 two-year institutions nationwide requesting information on their responses to the previous TRD Regulations. Usable responses were received from 124 institutions for a 39% response rate. The study found that while 56.8% of the responding institutions stated that they were in compliance with the TRD Regulations, responses to individual survey questions revealed  that only 31% had actually met the requirements of compliance. In addition, the responding institutions that had calculated graduation rates reported a variety of divergent methodological approaches and interpretations of the wording of the TRD Regulations.

UCLA and the participating colleges maintain a set of mutually determined commitments that require the colleges to establish a formal program structure, offer a core of enriched courses, encourage underrepresented minority student participation, and promote relationships with high schools and between university and community college faculty. The TAP curriculum consists of a core of enriched general education courses in which students engage in extensive writing, reading, and research. To evaluate the effectiveness of TAP, questionnaires were administered to TAP and non-TAP faculty and  students, and intensive interviews were conducted with students, administrators, faculty, and counselors. Study findings included the following: (1) TAP faculty showed more concern for the transfer process and engaged in greater experimentation with teaching methods; (2) TAP faculty developed more student-focused classrooms than non-TAP faculty; (3) TAP students demonstrated better class attendance, preparation, and understanding of ideas than non-TAP students; (4) TAP students and faculty reported greater interaction than their non-TAP counterparts; (5) statewide, TAP colleges had higher percentages of students transferring to the University of California than non-TAP colleges; and (6) TAP transfer students had higher grade point averages and persistence rates than non-TAP transfer  students at UCLA. Detailed data tables, a 56-item bibliography, and the survey instruments are included. (PAA)",

        "description":"The California Community Colleges' (CCC) Flexible Calendar Program (FCP) allows districts to allocate up to 15 instructional days from the 175-day academic calendar to engage in staff, student, and instructional improvement activities. The CCC Board of Governors' Task Force on Flexible Calendar, drawing from three sources (i.e., program growth data, the Fund for Instructional Improvement's (FII's) project entitled &quot;Assessment of Flex Calendar,&quot; and staff evaluations) conducted an evaluation of the FCP and proposed changes to Title 5 regulations governing the program's administration. Among the Task Force's findings are the following: (1) since the program's inception, the number of community colleges choosing the flexible calendar option has increased from 8 colleges in 1982-83,  to an estimated 95 colleges in 1991-92; (2) the FII assessment concluded that the FCP is effective in helping deliver faculty and staff development programs; (3) the FII report recommended that FCP, FII, and faculty and staff development efforts be connected, that statewide funding be increased, that more guidance be provided to colleges implementing FCP, and that staff development programs and FCP be fully funded; and (4) staff evaluations of FCP from selected districts showed the program to be effective in providing time for districts to address their staff, student, and instructional improvement needs. The report concludes with major proposed changes in Title 5 regulations, including the creation of one set of consolidated and unduplicated guidelines. Appendixes present the proposed  item-by-item changes to the FCP regulations, a section-by-section analysis of the proposed changes, and a list the names of the Task Force on Flexible Calendar members.

        "author":["Ovando, Martha N."],
        "description":"In-service education that truly contributes to the development of teachers must focus on the individual. The unique characteristics of adult learners (i.e., their experiences, readiness, orientation, and motivation) must also be taken into account in in-service education efforts. When teaching adults, the educator must act as a facilitator of learning, providing support and resources, rather than simply teaching the content of a program. The differentiated approach to in-service education is particularly appropriate for teachers who differ from one another in terms of their psychological, professional, and career cycle development. The competency-based, individualized learning modules (ILM) format addresses the characteristics of adult learners, and the diverse needs of teachers  in particular. Each module addresses specific topics and is designed to achieve one or more independent objectives. The format of the ILM involves eight steps: (1) a self-assessment of needs; (2) content delivery; (3) sources for further investigation; (4) an individual study guide; (5) a collaborative group learning guide; (6) performance products suggestions; (7) a log form; and (8) an evaluation form. Participants in the ILM format select the learning modules considered to meet individual job performance needs, and pursue the successive steps within each module depending on the level of learning they seek for each particular activity. Individualization is the key to the differentiated approach, and should be incorporated into each learning module in terms of content, pacing, depth of  study, and nature of the competency to be developed. Diagrams and 16 references are included. (PAA)",

Chapter 1 discusses the pivotal role peer tutors can play in assisting the large numbers of academically underprepared students who attend &quot;open door&quot; colleges, and provides an overview of JCCC's peer tutor training program. In chapter 2, the literature review is presented, covering the history of peer tutoring, the rationale for tutoring, characteristics of tutor training, specific programs, training techniques, and  evaluation. This chapter concludes with a 78-item bibliography. The LICC study is presented in chapter 3, which examines its purpose, methodology, proposed analysis, survey results and implications, and includes a directory of League peer tutor training programs. The LICC study revealed that although most of the responding colleges (N=23) employed peer tutors as a means to assist the underprepared student, few had training programs for their tutors. In chapter 4, the purpose, methodology, proposed analysis, and survey results of the JCCC study of 21 peer tutors employed by the Math, Academic Achievement, and Writing centers are presented. Key findings reported include: (1) respondents ranked patience, a positive attitude, and understanding as the most important personal qualities a peer  tutor should possess; and (2) the tutors ranked knowledge of subject and interpersonal skills high. Finally, chapter 5 provides a conclusion and proposes a model for peer tutor programs. Appendixes contain the survey instruments, and verbatim comments from responses to the League survey. (JMC)",

Research affirms that a play-oriented approach develops thinking skills, creativity, concept acquisition, and social and emotional development. Basic skills should be taught through a variety of multisensory experiences by means of self-directed activities in a classroom designed from a child's point of view. Such a classroom has maximum flexibility of space and movement. There should be individual, small group, and large group learning experiences each day, at varying levels of  difficulty. Subject areas may overlap and are easily integrated. These areas provide an environment where students can actively explore and interact with other children, adults, and materials. The developmental classroom is a place where each child can learn at his own pace in a noncompetitive, nonthreatening, positive environment. In such a classroom, learning is fun and all children develop academically, socially, emotionally, and physically. (SH)",

Our educational system must be changed so that it places equal priority on education for the child and on academic remediation for the parent. Family intervention programs do not address the undereducation of the parents. In family literacy programs, however, parents and children become teachers and learners. Functional context literacy, that is, relating the content of what is taught to the specific needs and goals of the individual learner, makes learning relevant to the goals of parents and children. The Kenan Trust Family Literacy Project, an outgrowth of the Parent and Child Education (PACE) program in Kentucky,  provides individualized instruction and joint learning in elementary schools to parents and their preschool children. Parents sharpen their skills in reading, math, and language, and receive career counseling, student assessment, and employability skills instruction. Benefits include increased responsibility and improved parenting skills for parents, and increased maturity and cognitive growth for children. The Kenan Project results indicate that disadvantaged children and parents can be helped jointly in intervention programs. (SH)",

Topics include: (1) the role of novelty in art; (2) the creative act as an interaction of individual, product, and culture; and (3) the influences of the teacher on children's creativity. The two children studied were observed in their class weekly over a 6-month period. The attention of the first child, Ingrid, to stories and pictures, and the manner and nature of her artistic creation in response to her experience are described. The learning and social style of the second child, Lincoln, are discussed, and his drawing and painting in response to classroom discussion are  described. The observations of the children support a view of the young child as an artist whose work reflects cognitive and affective development and possesses aesthetic merit. The observations suggest that children experience change in the creative mode in fits and starts. A list of five references, and color prints of the children's artworks, are provided. (BC)",

        "description":"An ethnographic investigation was conducted for the purpose of elucidating the impact of cultural contexts on teachers' values and classroom practices. Data were collected in a classroom in a Head Start center located in a small, economically depressed town in rural, central Pennsylvania. The study focused on the head teacher, the assistant teacher, and the special programs tutor, all of whom were white women from the surrounding community who had varying amounts of Head Start training, but no college degrees. Domains of central interest were the uses of time and space, activities and materials, interactions between teachers and children, and connections between home and school. Questions guiding the study were: (1) What values are promoted by teachers in the center? (2) How are  time, space, materials, activities, and teacher-child interactions used to support these values? (3) Is an orientation toward either self-direction or conformity toward the group evident? (4) Why do the teachers feel it is important to promote certain values? (5) Do the social milieus of the teachers play a role in determining the values that are promoted? Concluding discussion concerns implications of the findings. Appended are the researcher's reflections on herself, life histories of the teachers, and a questionnaire for use in studying teachers' social milieus. (RH)",

Subjects were preschool head teachers and children in 10 preschools. Each classroom was observed during the free play period on five consecutive days. Children's play behaviors were coded according to 12 categories of social-cognitive play. Play areas were coded according to four types and teachers' interventions were categorized into nine types. The most frequent interventions in the social play categories occurred for solitary play. There were no differences between frequency and type of intervention for boys or girls. The most frequent interventions in the cognitive categories occurred for constructive play. Different intervention patterns were used  in each of the four play areas. The teachers intervened in the art play area most often and in dramatic play least often. Results indicated that children's play was influenced by teachers' intervention. To maintain educational play, teachers should seek an optimal level of intervention in children's play. A list of 36 references is provided. (BC)",

        "description":"This report describes the results of three studies of Canadian mothers with preterm infants that support three conclusions about mothers' experiences of preterm birth. The first conclusion is that preterm birth is a very stressful experience, even for mothers with relatively healthy infants. Mothers' major concerns focused on their infants' survival and need for special care, and their own alienation from a sense of being a mother. The second conclusion is that the nature of the stress and the focus of worry changes with the infants' recovery and development. At five months after discharge, the only difference between preterm and full-term mothers on a mood inventory was that preterm mothers saw themselves as less clearheaded than full-term mothers. Interview and questionnaire  data indicated a decrease in stress. Concerns about the infant's survival and the mother's alienation from the maternal role were no longer salient issues. There were no perceived differences between preterm and full-term mothers in the parental role as assessed on the Parenting Stress Index. The third conclusion is that the magnitude of the stresses appears to dissipate over the infant's first year. Preterm mothers in the second study were still worried about their infants' development and recognized the vulnerability of their infants, and thus the ongoing need for special care. The paper also includes discussion of the aims of the neonatal intensive care unit in which the research was conducted. Eight graphs and the maternal discharge questions are attached. (RH)",

        "description":"A new measure of temperament, Rothbart's Children's Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ), was used to compare children with attachments to objects and those without such attachments. Comparisons were used to determine whether temperament differences between children with and without a history of object attachment held for children with and without a history of thumb- and finger-sucking. Findings were expected to improve understanding of the origins of children's self-soothing behaviors. Parents of 86 children of 4, 6, and 8 years of age completed Rothbart's CBQ and the Object Attachment Questionnaire. Comparative analysis of the data indicated that children who were attached to objects more frequently enjoyed gently rhythmic activities, being sung to, snuggling up to a parent, taking  warm baths, sitting quietly in the sunshine, and looking at picture books. There were no interactions between age and object attachment group. Compared to others, children with frequent thumb-sucking were rated as less likely to: (1) become excited about anticipated pleasurable events; (2) enjoy high stimulus intensity events; and (3) smile and laugh in response to changes in stimulus intensity. Findings support suggestions that individual differences in temperament are associated with the development of attachment to objects. Temperament characteristics were related both to whether or not an object attachment developed and the type of self-soothing behavior used. (RH)",

(3) What is the nature of student-to-student interaction during individual task assignments? (4) In what ways do cooperative learning skills affect subsequent work behaviors during non-cooperative learning time? (5) In what ways does a cooperative learning environment affect students' behavior? Subjects were a class of fifth-grade public school students who were placed into  heterogeneous cooperative learning groups based on the variables of student leadership tendencies, academic achievement, and ethnicity. Four social studies learning modules that used the Group Investigation model of cooperative learning were implemented. This methodology and subject area were chosen on the basis of the class's previous successful experiences with this model in the social studies area. Follow-up research was conducted the following year when the subjects were in the sixth grade.

Particular attention was given to potential conflict between the structures that Cummins (1986) recommended for bilingual education and more traditional school structures. Fundamental to the study were Cummins' elements in the organization of schooling that affect the extent to which minority students are empowered or disabled. These elements are: (1) the incorporation of minority students' culture and language; (2) the inclusion of minority communities in the education of their  children; (3) use of a reciprocal interaction model of pedagogy rather than a transmission model; and (4) advocacy in assessment rather than delegitimation. Cummins' writings were reviewed to identify the specific observable behaviors that he recommends, and observations and intervews were conducted in classrooms and schools. Descriptive syntheses of observations and interviews conducted in the three schools are presented. Study findings indicate there are two widely divergent types of implementation of bilingual education in the schools. (RH)",

Behaviors ranged from such ambiguous behaviors as undressing the dolls, looking at and touching dolls' genitals, and avoiding the dolls, to such highly sexualized behaviors as showing vaginal or anal penetration, showing oral-genital or genital-genital contact, and showing fondling or digital penetration. The majority of subjects agreed that overtly sexual behaviors, such as demonstrating oral-genital contact, were abnormal for nonabused childen. For less obvious behaviors, such as  touching the sex parts of dolls, there was considerably less agreement. The ratings of these ambiguous behaviors varied depending on the profession of the subject, sex of the subject, and number of years of experience. Law enforcement professionals, women, and those with the least number of years of experience were more likely than others to view ambiguous behaviors as abnormal.

Data were collected through self-reports, observational measures of work and parenting, and parents' and teachers' ratings of the participating children. Findings indicated that relations between job characteristics and parenting differed substantially according to the gender of the parent and child. Features of fathers' jobs were more strongly associated with parenting than were features of mothers' jobs, and features of parents' jobs were more  strongly linked to the parenting of sons than of daughters. Boys appeared to benefit selectively when parents had higher quality jobs. Parents, especially fathers, behaved more warmly and responsively with sons. They reported a firm but flexible disciplinary orientation: a pattern that did not typically emerge in relation to daughters. These findings survived controls for parental education and other potentially confounding variables. Analyses designed to probe the influence of job characteristics on parenting provided evidence for a mood spillover explanation and a transfer of training explanation. (Author/RH)",

Participants were 297 seventh and eighth graders in junior high schools in small towns or rural areas adjacent to a medium-sized city. Measures obtained in the fall and spring of a school year provided data on students' involvement in school, the frequency with which they were disruptive in class, names of their best friends, and positive and negative features of their friendships. Questions about positive features dealt with the friends' prosocial behavior and emotional support, and the intimacy of the friendships. Questions about negative features dealt with the frequency of conflicts and  rivalry or unpleasant competition between friends. Students' English and mathematics teachers rated their involvement and disruptive behavior. Findings indicated that friends influence one another's attitudes and behavior so that the friends become increasingly similar over time. Adolescents' adjustment to school was affected by the features of their friendships. Correlations based on multiple friendships were often larger than those based on the closest friendship. Findings suggest that measures based on several friendships are more reliable than those based on one friendship, but researchers can expect to get comparable results from both types of measures.

A total of 31 mothers of children between 5 and 12 years of age with externalizing behavior disorders participated. Each mother watched three videotapes of children and completed ratings of the children. In one presentation, the child displayed externalizing behaviors; in a second, the child displayed internalizing behaviors; in a third, the child behaved in a prosocial manner. Mothers also completed several measures of depressive symptomatology. There were significant correlations between a composite measure of maternal depressive symptomatology and negative perceptions of all three child  behavior presentations. Maternal depressive symptomatology was also related to mothers' perceptions of their children, but not to teachers' perceptions of these children. Results suggested that depressive symptomatology makes a small, but significant, contribution to maternal perceptions of child problems. (Author/RH)",

In addition, each child performed a recursive version of each of the tasks (i.e., &quot;Who do you think nominated you?&quot;; &quot;What rating do you think that each classmate gave you?&quot;). Based on peer nominations and ratings, children were grouped into five social status categories: popular, average, neglected, controversial, and rejected. Significant main effects of status were found when actual and expected nominations and ratings were compared. Both ratings and nominations were underestimated by popular children, accurately estimated by average children, and  overestimated by rejected children. Neglected children were accurate in their perceptions of peer ratings but not nominations, whereas controversial children were more accurate on nominations than ratings. Fifth and sixth grade girls were significantly more accurate than any other group, according to results of a signal detection analysis of the nomination data. Rejected boys were significantly less accurate than any other group. It is concluded that social status was related to social recursive thinking ability, and this relationship was the clearest among subjects in the extreme sociometric groups. (Author/RH)",

Parental variables included in the analyses were approval, guidance, motivation setting, noncoercion, synchrony, affection, and miscellaneous behaviors. Findings indicated that several caregiving variables, namely, approval, guidance, motivation setting, noncoercion, and synchrony, significantly predicted absence of externalizing behavior. These variables better predicted absence of externalizing behavior when considered in combination than when considered individually.  Boys' externalizing behavior was more associated with parental responsiveness than was girls'. This was especially the case among preadolescents who were with their mothers. Stronger parent-child associations were found for mothers than for fathers and for grade school children than for preschool children.

        "description":"Piaget (1968) and Michotte (1963) studied children's perception of physical causality. While emphasizing perception, they deemphasized thinking. The present study extends research by these authors by identifying types of verbal thinking in preschoolers on the basis of judgment of three fundamental physical laws: the first law of static, the law of impulse conservation, and the law of the conservation of energy. Viewing either a computer simulation or realia, 75 children between 4 and 6 years of age who were enrolled in a public kindergarten in Moscow watched a series of physical phenomena which either conformed to or broke a physical law. Subjects described and explained what they saw. Findings suggested that children use three types of verbal thinking when they describe physical  laws: play, projective, and scientific thinking. In verbal thinking characterized as play, physical and spatial-temporal relations between objects symbolized and modeled human relations. The projective type of verbal thinking was characterized by: (1) attributing &quot;activity&quot; to one object and &quot;passivity&quot; to others; and (2) the object's activity being determined by its inner state, not by its action. Children's scientific verbal thinking was characterized by equality of physical objects. Results also revealed a developmental shift with age from play to projective interpretation. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Four experiments investigating the effects of physical and social variables on the production of pointing in infants 10 to 18 months old are described. In the first two experiments, which were primarily concerned with the relation between reaching and index finger pointing, physical dimensions such as distance between baby and target objects were manipulated. Vocalization and the social communicative intentions of the pointing babies were measured. The third and fourth experiments concerned the role of the social context on the production of the pointing gesture. The third experiment compared the incidence of pointing in the presence and the absence of the mother in order to determine whether production of the gesture by the infant implies a recipient of the message. The fourth  experiment compared the incidence of pointing in babies when the mother was the partner with the incidence of pointing when another infant was present. Results supported the view that pointing is, from its inception, a form of shared reference. An intrinsically social gesture, it is associated with visual checking with the social partner. It is used in infant-to-infant interaction and is not produced if there is no one around. Findings are discussed in terms of an early capacity of sharing reference and certain aspects of social understanding shown by infants. (RH)",

Another objective was to identify functional socioemotional predictors of changes in children's social adjustment. Data were collected as part of the evaluation of a school-based intervention program designed to enhance students' prosocial development. Subjects were 303 students, primarily Caucasian and middle-class, from 3 elementary schools. A wide range of variables were assessed, many of them repeatedly, by means of a variety of measures and procedures. As expected, children in prosocial, average, and antisocial groups were found to differ  significantly with respect to a large number of measures of social attitudes and values, interpersonal behavior, peer acceptance, school-related attitudes and values, and academic achievement. Curiously, no significant group differences were found for measures of social skill except for perceived social competence. Most differences were found when children were in middle and upper elementary grades. Prosocial children of both sexes, and average girls, improved in adjustment over time, but average boys declined in adjustment. In contrast to the relative stability of antisocial boys, antisocial girls greatly declined in adjustment. (RH)",

        "description":"DiPietro, Larson, and Porges (1987) found behavioral and physiological differences between breast-fed and bottle-fed newborns. It was suggested that breast-feeding is associated with more optimal physiological organization and with increased irritable reactivity early in the neonatal period. The present study investigated whether breast-fed neonates' more optimal physiological organization leads to more optimal development later in infancy. A total of 29 breast-fed and 15 bottle-fed infants who had participated in a newborn study were seen again at 15 months of age. During the assessment of newborns, 10 minutes of heart pattern and respiration data were collected and the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale was administered. At 15 months, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development  and the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire were administered. Findings revealed that breast-fed infants scored significantly higher than bottle-fed infants on the Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) at 15 months of age and tended to be rated as more fussy-difficult-demanding by their parents at 15 months. The decision to breast-feed was related to outcome at both the newborn period and at 15 months of age. Level of parent education and duration of breast-feeding were not related to outcome. It is concluded that, insofar as the predictive influence of feeding style is largely accounted for by neonatal vagal tone, that variable may mediate the observed developmental differences. (RH)",

Positive and negative nominations were obtained in classrooms from several hundred children across a period of two years. Each year rejected children were identified by using the Coie, Dodge, and Copotelli (1982) procedures, resulting in samples of 70 and 108 rejected children for the 2 years. In both samples, the two subgroups emerged from the cluster analyses. A third subgroup, previously unidentified and not well described by the variables measured, was present in both samples and was labeled the low problem group. These children were better accepted and less rejected than  the internalizing and externalizing children. The internalizing subgroups consisted mainly of girls, while the externalizing subgroups were composed primarily of boys. Children in both subgroups were highly likely to remain rejected 1 year later and showed a tendency to remain within their own subgroup. The low problem rejected children tended not to remain rejected after 1 year. (RH)",

This goal is accomplished by funding grants and contracts which are in the aggregate designed to determine how the interaction of biological, psychological, and socioenvironmental factors results in normative development. Processes and behaviors from the perinatal period to the beginning  of adulthood are studied across a wide diversity of mechanisms that range from the molecular to the molar, the basic to the applied and the normal to the pathological. The program is divided into five major elements: (1) behavioral pediatrics; (2) developmental behavioral biology; (3) learning; (4) cognition and social and affective development; and (5) communication. The report also briefly summarizes the workshops and conferences sponsored by the Branch. Requests for proposals issued during fiscal years 1985 through 1987 are also enumerated.

Statistical profiles offer an image of the YUHSD and the migrant student population it serves. The migrant program's goal is to provide the best education possible by supplementing other school programs. Migrant resource centers were opened on each school campus to meet the immediate needs of active migrant students who arrive late and leave early in the school year. Programs for English as a Second Language (ESL) were created and encouraged for limited English proficient students. Subsequently, few ESL students have dropped out of high school. Other programs allow migrant students to receive credits  through correspondence courses or attend extended-day classes to make up deficient credits. Also offered are summer school and counseling services that include bilingual counselors and dropout advisors. The YUHSD migrant program successfully encourages a high degree of parent involvement and teaches parents and students to become better advocates for themselves as they follow seasonal work to other districts.

Leadership style was analyzed in terms of authority and power within  the school organization. Fred used the authority modes identified as charismatic, traditional, expert, and legal in various combinations throughout his school relationships. He preferred to use methods based on trust and expert knowledge, but, with reticent staff members, he used the power devices of \"keeping to the contract\" or \"bestowing of technical resources.\" Leadership workstyles can be divided into four orientations which typify the principal's function in the school organization. Fred exhibited a leadership workstyle and saw himself as a staff motivator. While encouraging exploration of new teaching methods, his focus was not on technical tasks, but on overall performance.

        "description":"In the 1980s the outmigration from rural areas of young and well educated adults was prompted by the decline of rural industries and the resultant economic stress. This paper examines the issue of selective migration during the 1980s by comparing young people who left their hometown to those who stayed behind. Longitudinal survey data collected in the High School and Beyond datafile (1980-86) are used to analyze the individual and community level factors affecting the probability of migration from a hometown. Of the rural youth who were seniors in 1980, 40% had moved at least 50 miles from their hometown by 1986 and had gained advantages in education, income, and occupational status. Comparison of data between these migrants and those who did not migrate indicate that migrants:  (1) continued their formal education at a higher rate than nonmigrants (77% compared to 54%), with 30% completing a four-year college program (compared to 10% of nonmigrants); (2) held professional or managerial jobs at a higher rate than nonmigrants (38% compared to 15%); (3) earned about 10% more than nonmigrants; (4) came from homes with better educated parents (64% compared to 46%); (5) had taken college preparatory classes (45% compared to 23%), and (6) had taken either the SAT or ACT (73% compared to 45%). Separate logistic regression analysis of community factors indicate: (1) youth in the rural Midwest and West are more likely to migrate than those in the South and Northeast; (2) higher average per capita income in the home county decreased the probability of migration; (3) higher  high school expenditures per student increased migration probability; and (4) the greater the distance of the nearest four-year college, the more probable was eventual migration.

The participants represented the experiences of white Appalachians, African-Americans, Native Americans, and rural New Englanders. The report combines the views expressed by participants in the Highlander convocation process with an overview of rural education issues derived from the literature and data sources. It starts with the questions: What is education and Who is it for? The notion that education's primary purpose is to produce informed and empowered citizenry, not merely to produce a workforce, is emphasized. It considers the  issues of curriculum, emphasizing the importance of community involvement in education. The sorting and screening function of schools is examined. School tracking systems and other labeling practices are questioned as reflecting class or racial discrimination. In addressing issues of financing and decision making about school policy, unequal funding of rural, as compared to urban, districts is discussed. The report concludes with accounts of communities that have organized to make changes in how their school systems work.

Of 54 surveyed administrators, 44 percent completed a self-reported descriptive questionnaire and The Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI). Indian and non-Indian administrators were remarkably similar on the descriptive questionnaire. The primary exception was that non-Indians have more teaching and administrative experience. Both groups envisioned themselves as instructional leaders, yet failed to spend an adequate amount of time in this area. Instead, they reported that they were much more involved in time-consuming managerial duties. The LPI yields scores in the areas of challenging, inspiring, enabling,  modeling, and encouraging. Scores indicated that Native American and non-Indian principals were in the high category for inspiring and modeling. Native American administrators scored high in the area of challenging, while non-Indian administrators scored lowest in this area. Challengers seek new opportunities and are risk takers. Educational administrators in BIA and contract schools need to develop skills which empower the teachers and recognize the teachers' achievements (enabling and encouraging). Suggestions include: (1) pre-training and staff development for BIA and contract principals; (2) on-going performance evaluations; and (3) reduction of managerial paperwork. (KS)",

The model, developed in the setting of a rural social work program, emphasizes participatory experience, &quot;learning through writing.&quot; The method is based on the assumption that writing facilitates learning. The major assignment for students in the research class was to complete a proposal for a program evaluation, suitable for inclusion in a program proposal grant application. Students were taught the writing principles of audience identification, microthemes, evaluation criteria, and peer evaluation. Students completed ten microthemes, short essays typed on a five by eight inch note card. The microthemes addressed a specific research concept  presented in class, and were combined to constitute the main body of the proposal. At the beginning of the semester, students were given the criteria that would be used to evaluate the final paper. In the research class, students exchanged drafts of their papers and critiqued the papers using evaluation guidelines. A survey administered at the end of the semester to the social work students (N=34) found 79% of the students indicating the mini assignments &quot;very useful,&quot; and 62% indicating they would be interested in enrolling in further research or statistics courses. In addition, instructors had fewer complaints about grades and received better teaching evaluations. This paper contains 22 references. (KS)",

Priority issues are presented in Chapter 3, for example,\"concentrating on the characteristics of effective schools\" and \"responding to the realities of the information age.\" Chapter 4 considers the criteria that ought to be used in the formulation of a state's strategic policy goals for rural education and the policy instruments available to translate goals into tactical objectives and action plans. A range of policy options identified in Chapter 5 address the new pressures on state systems of elementary-secondary education. Chapter 6 concludes with a brief discussion of the hypothesized effects of the use of each option. This book contains numerous tables and figures, and approximately 200 references. (KS)",

The outcomes of these half-day work sessions were rankings of the 30 needs statements and discussions of each state's ability to address its highest ranked needs along several important dimensions. Across the region, the highest ranked needs dealt with community and financial support  for local schools, recruitment and professional development of teaches and administrators, curriculum and instructional improvement, participative decision making at the school level, and linkages between educational research and development and educational policy formation. Appendices contain the needs statements, state caucus results, regional overall ratings of the needs statements, and lengthy status reports on education in the four states.

        "author":["Loving, Cathleen"],
        "description":"The model developed for use with science teachers--called the Scientific Theory Profile--consists of placing three well-known philosophers of science on a grid, with the x-axis being their methods for judging theories (rational vs. natural) and the y-axis being their views on scientific theories representing the Truth versus mere models of what works best (realism vs. anti-realism). The assumption is that individuals have different degrees of commitment to these views and seeing this range of views would help science teachers develop a balanced philosophy of science. The philosophers selected for detailed analysis who form the &quot;keystone&quot; positions on the Profile are Thomas Kuhn, Carl Hempel, and Sir Karl Popper. Nine other contemporary philosophers, all influenced by the three  originals, are included in brief analyses, with their positions relative to the keystones. Analyses resulted in placement of four Natural Anti-realists, three Rational Anti-realists, four Rational Realists, and one Natural Realist. The Natural Realist, Ronald Giere offers a cognitive approach to explaining theory judgment, which appears particularly useful to science teachers. The Profile then forms the basis for a course in philosophy of science for science teachers, with some objectives and activities suggested. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper explores a teacher's perspective of what successful science instruction is and how these perspectives influence classroom instruction. The data sources for this study include 35 classroom observations and approximately 25 hours of interviews collected over a period of 2 years of a single high school chemistry teacher. During class, extensive field notes were written and for approximately half of these sessions, the teacher was interviewed for about 30 minutes following the lesson. The interviews after class focused on questions of what the purpose of the lesson was, whether it was a success, and how he decided if it was a success. Questions about why specific instructional tasks or chemistry content had been chosen were also asked. This teacher was also interviewed  regarding students' written work, which consisted of tests, lab reports, journals, and a variety of other forms of written work, and how these provided evidence for his assessments of his own instruction. Analysis of the data involved reading the verbatim transcripts of the interviews and the field notes to develop a system of categories that were elaborated and modified with new data. In reflecting back on the successes and failures of several weeks or even an entire year's worth of instruction, the teacher assessed his teaching by referring to whether students had met a large array of goals that were affective, social, cognitive, and skill-based. The ways in which the teacher defines success for his students is then related to what researchers define as success. (KR)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to identify whether the strategy of using hands-on science process skills training in an elementary science methods course was effective in: (1) reducing preservice elementary teachers' (PETs') anxiety about teaching hands-on science activities, and (2) changing PETs' concerns about teaching hands-on science activities from concerns about &quot;self&quot; to concerns about &quot;task&quot; and the &quot;impact&quot; of hands-on science on children. A nonequivalent control group quasi-expermental design was utilized. One independent variable, the method of hands-on science process skills training, was investigated. Two measurement instruments (Stages of Concern Questionnaire and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory)--translated into Chinese--were used to measure the dependent variables.  The sample consisted of 105 PETs enrolled in 4 sections of a science methods course at Taiwan Provincial Taichung Teachers' College, Republic of China. The experimental group (n=54) received training in hands-on science activities for a period of 6 weeks, while the control group (n=51) received regular class lectures without hands-on science activities. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) results indicated that hands-on science process training was significant (P&lt;.05) in reducing PETs' anxiety about teaching hands-on science activities and significant (P&lt;.05) in changing PETs' concerns about teaching hands-on science activities. However, further descriptive analysis of the data indicated that PETs' concerns about &quot;self&quot; failed to show a decrease; concerns about the &quot;impact&quot; of an innovation  showed a slight increasing pattern in the experimental group.

        "description":"Research on teacher education has been shifting from the emphasis on changing teachers' behaviors to investigating how teachers' mental thinking influences their teaching behaviors. Teachers' beliefs and planning are two important components among teacher thinking research. The purposes of this study are to uncover preservice secondary science teachers' beliefs about science and pedagogy and to investigate how preservice science teachers' beliefs about science and pedagogy influence their planning and teaching. This study used qualitative methods such as participation observation, field notes and in-depth interviews. Topics discussed in the interviews included the ways informants planned their lessons, the considerations during their planning, the resources they used in planning,  and the reflection on their teaching performance. An open-coding system was generated to analyze data and the data were categorized. The study suggests that although so many preservice teachers articulate similar bliefs, their underlying context may be quite different. Therefore, the best way for science educators to introduce learning theories to their students is for them to explain what they mean by providing substantial reasoning for their responses. Self-reflection on one's action could help these preservice teachers to be aware of their own thinking and performance. (KR)",

        "description":"This study examines the status of and outlook for nuclear engineering (NE) in the United States. The study resulted from a concern about the downward trends in student enrollments in NE, in both graduate and undergraduate programs. Concerns have also been expressed about the declining number of U.S. university NE departments and programs, the aging of their facilities, and appropriateness of their curricula and research funding for industry and government needs, the availability of scholarships and research funding, and the increasing ratio of foreign to U.S. graduate students. A committee representing universities, laboratories, government agencies, and corporations studied the current status of NE education in the United States, estimated the supply and demand for undergraduate  and graduate nuclear engineers in the United States over the near- to mid-term, addressed the spectrum of material that the nuclear engineering curriculum should cover and how it should relate to allied disciplines, and recommended appropriate actions to ensure that the nation's needs for competent nuclear engineers are satisfied over the near- and mid-term. Since the responsibility for a viable NE education system is shared by the Federal Government, private industry, and the academic community, recommendations were split into these sectors: (1) Federal Government should increase funding for traineeship and fellowship programs, provide additional research funds to support reactors, enhance programs to attract women and minorities into the field, assess supporting the access, for  educational purposes, of NE departments to research reactors, etc.; (2) Industry such as electric utilities should increase their participation and support of training programs and continue working with the American Nuclear Society to support its advocacy of NE education; (3) Universities should continue to have broad based NE curricula, have more research programs with more research in reactor-oriented areas, develop and support research related to power reactor, nuclear waste management, and environmental remediation, and seek a means for partial or phased retirement of older faculty so junior faculty may be added.

        "description":"Elementary school teacher candidates typically enter their professional training with deficiencies in their conceptual understanding of the topics of elementary school mathematics and with a reliance upon procedural (algorithmic) approaches to the solutions of mathematical problems. If elementary school teacher candidates are expected to teach mathematics in a manner conducive to student conceptual development, then it is critical for the individual candidate to possess personal meanings for the topics of elementary school mathematics and to develop an understanding of the processes involved in student conceptual development. This report describes the pedagogy common to two mathematics methods courses designed to help teacher education students actively restructure their existing  mathematical knowledge and expand their views of what understanding mathematics might involve. The teacher candidates are given the opportunity to restructure their own content knowledge using curriculum and instructional approaches similar to those which they will later hopefully use in their own classrooms. Data on mathematical content understandings (rational numbers, fractions, area, volume) and behavioral perceptions (anxiety, confidence, and justification patterns) were gathered from four undergraduate sections and one graduate section of the methods courses. These data indicate significant changes in candidates' mathematical understandings and views of pedagogy. Item analysis of content responses using Student-Problem Curve Theory shows that the candidates' conceptualization of  content improves in focus over the course of the class, indicating a deeper level of knowledge structure. Preliminary analysis of structured interviews shows significant shifts in teacher candidates' conceptions of what mathematics is, their view of potential roles in instruction, and methods for evaluating students' success in mathematics relative to their original pre-class positions. A copy of the pretest is included. (37 references) (Author/JJK)",

Subjects were 199 students (114 females, 85 males) enrolled in the second semester of a freshman chemistry course for non-science majors at a private university in New York State. Instruments used included seven subscales of the Approaches to Studying Inventory, the Attitude Toward Chemistry Questionnaire, and the Test of Logical Thinking (TOLT). The students' grades on an hour-long exam early in the semester were used as measures of the students' prior knowledge, while the semester cumulative final examination scores were  used as measures of achievement in chemistry. Students in this study had slightly higher scores on reproducing orientation than on meaning orientation, a pattern that confirms Entwistle and Ramsden's (1983) findings with a similar group of non-science majors. The results of a stepwise multiple regression showed that prior knowledge, TOLT scores, and meaning orientation accounted for 32% of the variance on the final examination scores.

        "description":"An attempt is made to synthesize the diverse perspectives on the teaching of thinking, especially in the area of social studies. A conception is developed that incorporates major theoretical orientations as well as the views of teachers. The conception emphasizes interpretation, analysis, and manipulation of information to solve problems that cannot be solved by routine application of previously acquired knowledge. Five main challenges emerged when the problems that social studies teachers who emphasized thinking wanted students to confront were considered: (1) empathy, (2) abstraction, (3) inference, (4) evaluation-advocacy, and (5) critical discourse. To promote thinking along these lines, the curriculum should stress a combination of in-depth content, skill-directed  activities, and the reinforcement of thoughtful dispositions. Pedagogy should provide extensive student practice in problem solving, guided by substantial teacher feedback on students' work, along with increased student interaction with one another and community study. To support this, organizational changes such as reduced teacher load and more flexible scheduling are necessary. Ultimately, the successful promotion of higher order thinking in social studies will depend on increased opportunities for teachers to study and to discuss with colleagues the conceptualization of thinking, its application to social studies, conflicting priorities, and other obstacles that inhibit thoughtfulness. If decisions about specific pedagogy grow out of teachers' collaborative consideration of these  issues, higher order thinking in social studies has a chance. (JB)",

        "description":"Bar foundations and bar association staff members involved in law-related education (LRE) have taken a number of different approaches to working with school districts, boards of education, teachers, and administrators. This bulletin looks at three of the approaches. One approach is networking with schools and enthusiastic resource people who can be counted on to maintain a high level of interest in the program. Examples are drawn from seven states where this approach is used: Michigan, Arizona, New York, Missouri, Kansas, Texas, and Washington. A second approach is building upon a strong teacher or groups of teachers who can be counted on to breathe life into a new program and eventually become trainers of other teachers. Examples of this approach are taken from three states:  Idaho, North Dakota, and South Carolina. The final method is that followed in Alaska where the geographic area is large and the population small. Sub-committees were set up in each area of the state to see that LRE programs were implemented in the districts. A state steering committee and the Anchorage and the Alaska Bar Associations served as the coordinators. The examples indicate a variety of ways in which LRE programs can be implemented and maintained. (JB)",

        "description":"Twenty-five years ago a small volume of essays entitled &quot;Crisis in the Humanities&quot; was published containing an ominous message: namely, that the humanistic disciplines had arrived at a crossroad--a turning point at which a decisive change for better or worse was imminent. Humanistic scholarship appears to have declined since that crossroad was reached, and the reason may be that as pursued at present in many areas, it produces knowledge that is of little intrinsic interest and relevance. This essay formulates and addresses the question of how the humanities can be revitalized and vindicated. There are no simple solutions to this problem; what is needed is a new working concept on which humanistic scholarship can be based. Of theories put forward recently as conceptual frameworks  for humanistic scholarship, none is more helpful than Karl Popper's proposition of a world of encoded or &quot;objective&quot; knowledge. Popper's proposition as it can be applied to humanistic scholarship is discussed with great optimism. Comments on the main essay by two other scholars, Michael T. Ryan and Thomas F. Staley, also are included in this volume. (DB)",

        "description":"The findings of a qualitative study of migrant graduate students from India who now reside in the United State is presented. Through a series of interviews with students attending three U.S. universities, a model of the migratory process was developed. Much recent work on migratory theory has focused on the lack of opportunities in the students' home country (&quot;push&quot; factors) and the greater opportunities afforded by industrializated nations (&quot;pull&quot; factors). The model developed in this study argues that it is necessary to look beyond push and pull factors to cultural conditions--of both the student's home country and the &quot;world-student&quot; culture--as creating a field of norms and identities that shapes student actions. The relationship between the world-student culture and  world-system structures is examined, with the result being a unique description of the so-called &quot;brain drain&quot; phenomena.

        "description":"This report summarizes and compares the views of six experts in music education concerned with teaching music for students' conceptual understanding at the elementary level. Three music professors and three public school music teachers teaching at the elementary level engaged in comprehensive written exercises and extensive interviews with researchers to address issues related to curriculum, teaching, and evaluation in music education. In this report, experts examined the above issues from the perspective of the \"ideal,\" that is, what curriculum, teaching, and learning ought to be in elementary music. They identified, described, critiqued, and discussed features of an ideal curriculum, goals in music education, key concepts and ideas in music, how these are related, and how to  organize and sequence these ideas with sample lessons in an effort to develop students' understanding in music. The report presents a comparative and contrastive analysis of the experts' responses on the above dimensions as well as their expressed or implicit views of music as a discipline and what it means to understand music. The findings then are summarized and discussed in light of their implications for music education and teacher education. (Author)",

By 1989 there were 1,836 school districts enrolled in DEEP, covering some 39 percent of the precollege student population. This book tells the story of DEEP, an effort to improve the economics education curriculum by involving teachers, administrators, universities, and businesses in a curriculum change partnership. This current look at the DEEP experience is divided into five major parts. Part I consists of four chapters that give a rationale for economic education and explain in more detail the features of the DEEP model. Part II focuses on the research and evaluation that have been conducted over the 25-year  history of DEEP and on related studies of economic understanding among students in secondary and elementary grades. The next two parts offer case studies of how DEEP works. Part III looks at DEEP operations and issues in four diverse states. Part IV shows how the DEEP process works in six different school districts. In part V the focus shifts from the present to the future; these chapters discuss the future of DEEP in the context of educational reform, requirements for new curriculum materials, needs of school districts, and leadership from the Joint Council on Economic Education.

Several data sets are analyzed to examine the effects of the number of children on school participation and labor participation in urban Pakistan. Other data are utilized to examine the effects of children on savings in urban and rural areas. Results show that the number of children negatively affects the schooling of girls, but not boys. The number of boys and girls in the household have differential effects on women's labor participation while female children, but not males, affect adult male's participation. Children, ages 6-15, have negative effects on rural savings, but less effect in urban areas. In general, the effects of high fertility for households in Pakistan seem more  negative than in many countries. This may explain the high proportion of women who say they want no more children. Why so few of these women use contraception is more difficult to explain. (Author)",

Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., the document presents a teaching package about Islamic art during the late 16th-early 17th century. Themes in Islamic art addressed included the use of brilliant color, intricate details, pattern, modular structure in composition, and successive combinations of units. Slides and discussion questions show students how Islamic books, called albums, were made. Four student activities are outlined: (1) Islamic motifs and patterns that show how intricate abstract designs were made by combining squares, rectangles, triangles, and circles; (2) how to create albums; (3) using  calligraphy to write words and sentences that also form a picture; and 4) an exercise to help identify the main characteristics of Islamic poetry. The section on background information for teachers describes the five pillars of Islam, how Islamic art is defined, the importance of calligraphy, and how books have always been held in high esteem. The final section is a list of resources for obtaining further information, and programs about the Islamic world, and a suggested reading list for teachers. (KM)",

The tools used to create these works are also on slides and their functions are described. The lesson plan section provides background information on Chinese literati education including: who was educated; the importance of education; the curriculum and teaching methods; and the lifestyles of the students when preparing for the civil service examinations. The curriculum consisted of five Chinese classics, four books that  provided the moral rationale for an educated elite, and a set of personal values that at the same time justified the political system. One lesson describes the lifestyles of the literati after they passed the examination. Questions follow each lesson to help students discuss what they have read and to compare the Chinese literati education and lifestyle with their own.

A major benefit for practitioners appears to be the opportunity to redefine the curriculum and guide instruction. Benefits for students include the opportunity to engage in authentic work and receive feedback that speaks directly to their capabilities. This newsletter presents stories of practitioners at two suburban schools who decided to change their curricular and assessment practices to encompass authentic assessment and authentic instruction. Instruction in both schools had to be shifted from curricular practices that emphasized coverage of large amounts of material within a prescribed time frame, to in-depth  situations in which students are encouraged to develop problem-solving and higher-order thinking abilities. An example of revised assessment criteria is included: \"Scoring System for Fifth Grade Performance Assessment at Mark Twain Elementary School, Littleton, Colorado.\" Selected criteria which guide school staff planning of authentic curriculum units at Urbandale High School in Urbandale, Iowa, are also included.

A case study of Marilyn, a 45-year-old beginning teacher, guided the research, along with observation, interviews, journal writing, and autobiographical information. Marilyn viewed herself as a rescuer and the classroom as a haven. She had no image of herself as a classroom manager and disciplinarian. During student teaching, she failed to learn the importance of classroom management and effective, consistent rules. During her first year of teaching, Marilyn was not able to cope with discipline and adopted the conservative, custodial norms of the school rather than her preferred humanistic approach. She completed her first year  confused, frustrated, anxious, lost, discouraged, and perplexed. The implications of this study for teacher education programs are: to strengthen a novice's role identity as a disciplinarian, and to expose preservice teachers to classroom situations in which they learn to identify with firm classroom management. Beginning teachers with classroom discipline problems will more likely burn out and leave the profession than those of their peers with instructional or curriculum concerns. (LL)",

The research has demonstrated that cooperative learning groups can lead to improved achievement and more positive attitudes. The time-on-task research has suggested that increasing the time a student interacts with information or materials increases the amount a student is likely to learn. The present study demonstrated that a cooperative goal structure facilitates verbal interactions and appropriate behavioral interactions. Undergraduate educational psychology students (N=44) were involved in small group work using case studies. The usual rewrite option for assignments was changed to create differing goal structures. The students either: rewrote the assignment after the  small group time (individual), rewrote the assignment together as a small group (cooperative), or discussed the assignment without a rewrite option. The cooperative groups demonstrated more appropriate behaviors and more verbal behaviors. However, the effects of the cooperative goal structure did not appear to be maintained into the discussion group, which demonstrates that the effects of a cooperative goal structure are not maintained when the goal structure changes.

        "description":"The interplay of institutional reform efforts and the role of external actors (public officials and agencies, private sector entities) have brought about changes in teacher education programs, e.g., fifth-year program innovations. A naturalistic case study approach was used to investigate structural and substantive changes in four extended teacher education programs that had made structural changes in the past 5-17 years. Each program moved from a 4- to a 5-year plan, increased academic requirements and field experiences, and made stronger connections to the client schools. From analysis of the data some generalizations can be made: (1) those programs that have changed and prevailed have demonstrated change in curriculum grounded on a well articulated knowledge base; and (2) the  curriculum changes reflect a major change in priorities due to an interaction of internal and external actors and circumstances. The results of the case studies demonstrate that the impetus for change comes from a change in priorities, but that the interrelationships between the various publics may ultimately predict the direction of teacher education in a given institution. Five graphs and a bibliography are attached. (AMH)",

The purpose of the survey is to provide Colorado institutions of higher education and the Colorado State Board of Education with information for the continued improvement of teacher education programs. Teachers rated components of their programs on a 5-point scale according to importance for effective teaching and adequacy of preparation. Supervisors rated their teachers' performance of these components based on requirements of the district standards. The components rated were: knowledge of subject matter, knowledge and utilization of teaching/learning theories, planning and organization of  curriculum and instruction, classroom management, teaching techniques and communication of instructional material, assessment, communication and cooperation with parents and office staff, professionalism and management of general responsibilities, and communication with students. Over 90 percent of rated teachers met district standards in each area with the exception of classroom management and relationship with students. Teachers, too, felt that preparation in these domains was inadequate.

An inservice course on student discipline entitled &quot;Managing Student Behavior: A Whole School Approach to Discipline&quot; (MSB) was offered at two secondary schools in Perth, Australia. The course, based on the premise that students are to take responsibility for their own behavior, focused on the enhancement of teacher strategies and skills necessary for the development of students' rights and responsibilities. Such techniques as student participation in the formulation of rules, and sanctions connected with violations were stressed. The 27 subjects of the study were  interviewed, before and after attending the MSB class, about 4 hypothetical school discipline incidents. It was determined that teachers' moral judgment was related to various aspects of discipline and, therefore, that more attention needs to be paid to the development of teachers' moral judgment during education courses. The educational program could include the presentation and discussion of theories of moral development, challenging teachers to address the moral issues inherent in the teaching/learning environment.

The study reported in these two volumes evaluated program effectiveness and the extent of goal attainment. Participants in the study were 336 mentors and their principals in 240 schools, and 638 of their mentees; l8 directors of elementary and secondary instruction; and 46 retirees in the Priority Staffing Program serving 46 schools. Data were collected through the use of questionnaires and personnel records. Volume 1 reports the answers to 6 of 7 research questions dealing with number of mentor transfers,  retention rates, MTP services, district personnel attitudes, program participants' rating of MTP assistance, and matching of mentors and mentees. Volume 2 answers question 7 on retention rates of MTP participants and nonparticipants. Volume 1 concludes that the majority of teachers who have participated in the MTP since spring l984 have remained in the teaching profession and in LAUSD. Volume 2 suggests a high rate of teacher retention in both participating and nonparticipating groups. Gender did not play a major role in retention rates but ethnicity did. The goals of the program were met, but there is still room for improvement. Volume 1 appendixes provide participants' comments and the survey instruments. Volume 2 appendixes present guidelines for making adjustments to mentor teacher  program implementation, as well as 15 data tables. (LL)",

Fifteen teachers were interviewed to understand how teachers modify cooperative learning to fit their existing beliefs about pedagogy; how teachers interact with this innovation to reconstruct their assumptions about teaching and learning; and how these reconstructions affect certain pedagogical themes which emerged from them. Themes which emerged were: conceptions of their role, their sense of authority and locus of control, their notions of the nature of knowing and knowledge, their conceptions of their  decision-making, their understanding of cooperative learning, and their resolution of the dilemmas of practice which emerge for them in the process. Using a model which defined three broad epistemological orientations, or meaning systems, operating on a continuum from &quot;transmission&quot; to &quot;transaction&quot; to &quot;transformation,&quot; which cast educational practices as systems of belief, the mainstream models of cooperative learning were analyzed for their fundamental assumptions regarding these themes.

In order to nurture a culturally informed teaching force, preservice teachers must be prepared more effectively to teach students from diverse backgrounds.

It emphasizes the need for furthering the cause of professionalism among teachers through the acquisition of knowledge, skills, attitudes, beliefs, and orientations of a profession, a process referred to as a socialization system. The publication offers a statement of intent, along with three chapters which present a general description of socialization subsystems, discussing the important characteristics of each and detailing the implications for teacher education. Chapter 1 covers the recruitment and selection subsystem and includes criteria for recruitment, degree of selectivity, sponsorship, prior commitment, and implications for teacher education. Chapter 2 discusses the induction  subsystem, covering the meaning of induction; conditions of admission; status systems; rituals, ceremonies, and celebrations; and implications for teacher education. Chapter 3, on the normative subsystem, discusses the nature and types of norms, characteristics of normative systems, the liberal arts academy or professional school, professional preparation programs, the issue of purpose, a common language, and performance visibility and intensity of communication.

It also gives some attention to written and student-generated questions. The purpose is to provide teachers with knowledge to assist them in making decisions about improving classroom instruction. The monograph examines past and current research related to teachers' questioning practices and the impact of those questioning practices on student thinking, achievement, and attitudes. It reviews research related to questioning techniques and strategies and approaches to analyzing classroom questions. It examines the role of questioning within the broader context of classroom interaction, with a particular focus on recitation and discussion. Finally it presents an approach  teachers can use to gather information on their own classroom questioning behaviors. Two analysis forms, \"Question Levels\" and \"Questioning Techniques\" are provided for the purpose. A bibliography containing 138 references is included. (IAH)",

Each of these strands is discussed in this paper, and connections with invitational education and cooperative learning are explored. Similarities between these three perspectives on education exist, including similar implementation problems. Resistance from teachers and students may be among these problems. In addition to cooperative learning and invitational education, other perspectives on education may be compatible with feminist pedagogy. Feminist pedagogy helps educators to see problems, such as  hierarchical classrooms, a ban on the subjective, and a lack of context, from a fresh perspective.

This study describes the attitudes toward mainstreaming held by undergraduate education students and assesses attitude changes related to knowledge about handicapping conditions and the field of education as well as classroom teaching experience. The Attitudes Toward Mainstreaming Scale (ATMS) was administered to 233 undergraduate education majors; 110 students participated in a follow-up study. In general, education students favor the idea of mainstreaming and are willing to teach in regular classes those students whose handicaps do not inhibit their own learning or the learning of others. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data indicated that advanced  students held more positive attitudes toward mainstreaming than beginning students and there was a trend toward reporting more favorable attitudes toward mainstreaming during professional preparation prior to student teaching. Following student teaching, however, there was a significant decline in the favorability of students' attitudes toward mainstreaming. Use of the ATMS and implications of the findings of the survey for teacher training are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"School districts considering a mentoring program need to consider four things: (1) the reasons for a teacher mentor program; (2) how to start such a program; (3) administrative support needed for a successful program; and (4) pitfalls to avoid. The reasons for having a mentor program are that it benefits the new teacher, the mentor, and the school. The new teacher's opportunities to exchange views with an experienced teacher is a distinct benefit to him/her. The mentor benefits also, however, because of the opportunity to share views, experiences, and strategies. The improved teaching that usually results is an asset to the school. Starting a program involves six stages: establishing a rationale, setting criteria for the selection of mentors, defining roles, inviting the mentors,  training the mentors, and evaluating the program. To be successful, the program must have administrative support from the board of education, the superintendent, the central office staff, the teacher union, and the principal. As with any new program, anticipating problems can help to avoid them. Some pitfalls are: overdependence on the part of the protege, ego problems on the part of the mentor, and the evaluation dilemna arising from the mentor's dual role of confidant and evaluator. Mentorship programs promote professionalism by providing continuous staff development during the first year of teaching. (AMH)",

Structural equation modeling using the LISREL computer program was used. The presented model put the motivational constructs of intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy as temporally preceding self-regulated learning (defined as a behavioral constellation of monitoring, elaboration, and effort management strategies). Intrinsic motivation at the beginning of a college semester (Time 1) was conceptualized as directing behaviors and sense of efficacy; strategic behaviors were considered to influence both motivational constructs at the end of a college semester (Time 2). The results of a study with 367 college students who completed  measures of motivational beliefs and strategies (the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire) indicate that intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy had substantial effects on self-regulated learning, and intrinsic motivation had a strong effect on self-efficacy. While self-regulated learning at Time 1 had a small positive effect on intrinsic motivation at Time 2, self-regulated learning had no effect on self-efficacy at Time 2. The results suggest that an orientation to learning and mastery results in higher levels of efficacy and deeper cognitive engagement. A subject's belief in his or her capabilities was more likely to lead to higher levels of self-regulated learning. Four tables and one figure illustrate the discussion. (Author/SLD)",

PA for individual teachers who should integrate their assessments with their instruction; PA as a supplement to more traditional examinations for licensure decisions; and some limited, experimental tryouts of PA for other accountability purposes are supported. The anti-MCT demagogues, and making PA the latest fad are not supported. Reasons for PA's popularity include: old (but inaccurate) criticisms of MCTs in terms of bias, irrelevant content, and measurement of only recognition; cognitive psychologists' belief that many parameters that they want to study require formats other than MCT questions; increased concern that MCTs delimit the  domains that should be assessed; wide publicity of the Lake Wobegon effect of teaching too closely to MCTs; and claims that teaching to MCT formats has deleterious instructional/learning effects. PA problems vary depending on several dimensions, such as secure versus non-secure assessments, matrix versus every student assessment, and accountability versus instruction. PAs have difficulty meeting the five \"apple\" criteria required of high-stakes tests used for accountability purposes: administrative feasibility, professional credibility, public acceptability, legal defensibility, and economical affordability. It is concluded that MCTs measure some things very well and efficiently; however, they do not measure everything and their use can be overemphasized. PAs can measure important  objectives that cannot easily be measured by MCTs. A 52-item list of references is included. (RLC)",

Assessment was made on four general dimensions of teaching: content knowledge; content pedagogy; knowledge of students; and basic communications. Four specific tasks were used: (1) organizing a unit; (2) organizing a lesson; (3) alternative mathematical approaches; and (4) evaluating student error patterns. The scoring system also evaluated the interview as a whole. The data  analysis focused on the reliability of the ratings and the validity of the assessment. The results of a pilot study conducted with 13 interviewers, 10 candidates, and 20 raters suggest that the scoring approach was viable for new assessment instruments to measure the complexity of effective teaching.

Five research questions were addressed: (1) whether or not ADA is defined by state law; (2) the number of days in the school year used in the ADA calculation; (3) how attendance is counted and how state aggregate data are calculated; (4) whether or not other variations in state ADA affect comparability; and (5) how summer school figures are handled. Data for the study were derived from state-provided documentation. Seven states  reported legislation prescribing data collection methods for the 1985-86 school year. A variety of prescribed school days (ranging from 170 to 180) were identified. Five distinct patterns for state data collection and aggregation ADAs were apparent. Other variations in procedures did affect comparability. However, it was not possible to estimate the effects of summer school attendance reporting, with only 13 states reporting summer school data. Four tables contain study data. (SLD)",

This paper focuses on one such algorithm, which was developed by R. M. Luecht and T. M. Hirsch. Unidimensional item parameter estimates were obtained by calibrating response data generated from two-dimensional item parameters. Using these unidimensional estimates, three sets of test items from a pool of 200 multidimensional items were selected for each of two different test lengths for three differently shaped target information functions. The item  parameter estimates were obtained by calibrating five forms of the EAAP Mathematics usage test using the multidimensional IRT calibration program NOHARM. Response data were generated for 2,000 abilities. Observed score differences for each triad, based on the multidimensional item parameters, were then compared. Despite the multidimensionality of the selected items, the created forms appear to be quite parallel both unidimensionally and multidimensionally. Two tables and seven figures are included. (SLD)",

        "description":"Many researchers have suggested that the main cause of item bias is the misspecification of the latent ability space. That is, items that measure multiple abilities are scored as though they are measuring a single ability. If two different groups of examinees have different underlying multidimensional ability distributions and the test items are sensitive to these differences, any scoring scheme that does not reflect all of the skills in the interaction of the items and examinees (the complete latent space) will likely produce item bias. Insight is offered the testing practitioner concerning the difference between item bias and item impact and how each relates to item validity. These concepts are addressed from a multidimensional item response theory perspective. Two detection  procedures, the Mantel-Haenszel (as modified by P. W. Holland and D. T. Thayer) and the Simultaneous Item Bias procedure of R. Shealy and W. Stout are used to illustrate the detection of item bias. It is concluded that empirically, two or more items will always produce multidimensionality, and as such, their parameters need to be estimated using multidimensional models. One table and 12 figures illustrate the discussion. (SLD)",

        "description":"An adaptive test can usually match or exceed the measurement precision of conventional tests several times its length. This increased efficiency is not without costs, however, as the models underlying adaptive testing make strong assumptions about examinees and items. Most troublesome is the assumption that item pools are unidimensional. Truly unidimensional item pools are the exception rather than the rule, so procedures have been established for handling multidimensional pools. One option is to insure that every adaptive test measures the same composite of the multiple abilities represented in the item pool. However, this approach forfeits the multidimensional structure of the item pool. The alternative is to retain this structure by splitting the item pool into more  unidimensional subsets and administering each separately. This approach, however, increases testing time. A third approach is proposed--concurrent adaptive measurement. In this approach collateral information--information that an item provides about a secondary ability--is used to update ability estimates obtained from adaptive tests administered in separate content areas. A study is reviewed, which evaluated the effectiveness of the concurrent adaptive measurement procedure using unidimensional estimates of two two-dimensional item pools of 200 items each. The results indicate that both bias and the standard error of the estimated ability decrease when collateral information is used. As the correlation between the latent skills increases, the standard error drops slightly. Six tables and  four figures are included. (SLD)",

Subjects providing responses to CPM items were 269 children aged 2 years 9 months to 11 years 8 months, most of whom were referred for testing as potentially gifted. A second sample containing 147 seventh-grade students, drawn from J. K. Gallini's study in 1983, was used to assess the utility of the equation developed using the first item sample. CPM item characteristics were defined and rated. Rasch item difficulties were used as the dependent variable with misfitting items omitted. All 15 item characteristics were entered in a regression equation using forced entry (multiple &quot;R&quot; of 0.90) and stepwise entry  (multiple &quot;R&quot; of 0.88). When the same predictors were used with SPM items, the multiple &quot;R&quot; was 0.69. The poorest prediction occurred for items containing characteristics (such as line thickness) that were not captured by the coding system. The best prediction occurred for items in which the orientation of the figure or options was a crucial feature. Results are discussed with regard to psychological processes and use of item characteristics to create new test items. Two sample test items are included, and two tables and an appendix present data on item difficulties. (SLD)",

The focus was on the performance of children in grades 3, 6, and 8 in the school years from 1985-86 through 1988-89 in 16 CDP units. Performance data were also analyzed for students in 15 matched units not participating in the CDP in order to isolate patterns in performance data that could not be attributed to chance or other reform efforts. When student achievement in CDP units was examined, the general tendency was toward improvement. Fewer CDP units in grades 3 and 8 scored below the national median in 1989 than in 1986. In the group of matched units, the same trend  was apparent only for grade 3. Improvement was more likely for CDP units than for non-CDP units. In grade 3, 13 CDP and six non-CDP units improved; in grade 6, 12 CDP units improved or showed no change and eight non-CDP units improved; and in grade 8, 13 CDP and eight non-CDP units improved. Some of this improvement can be attributed to the CDP, although it is not clear how much gain in achievement can be allotted to CDP participation. Sixteen tables present achievement data.

During the 1989-90 school year, 134 school districts developed responses to the SIAA, and all included differentiated teacher salary/pay plans. These pay plans are analyzed, and several generalizations are drawn. Six models for salary differentiation are described: certification, special assignment, task differentiation, merit, incentive, and school/student outcomes. It is contended that most of the pay plans did not demonstrate any virtue beyond acceptability; pay plans were largely characterized by an inability to differentiate among teachers. Plans were generally short-term and supportive of current practice, with a limited focus on  potential revision. For school improvement to take place, districts need to: (1) commit to improvement; (2) focus on inputs or outputs; (3) analyze changes expected for the next year; (4) identify accountability and the role of evaluation; and (5) study long-term projections. Two tables and one flowchart complement the text. A 30-item list of references is included.

The CINEG design calls for two groups of examinees to respond to a set of common items that is included in two examinations. In practice, this rule has been extended to include the order in which options appear in the two examinations. The performance of a common set of items in which the order of options for one test form was experimentally manipulated was examined to determine if reordering multiple-choice item options resulted in any significant effect on item difficulty. Data from 759 subjects (graduates of medical specialty residency training programs) were gathered as part of  the annual administration of a certification examination in a medical specialty area. Each subject responded to 20 multiple-choice items with a projected visual as the stimulus for each item. Examinees had to select from about 30 choices the option that correctly identified the projected visual. Two response booklet forms, differing only in that the position of the 20 options was scrambled, were used. A total of 380 examinees responded to Booklet A, and 379 examinees responded to Booklet B. One examinee was randomly excluded from the analyses for Booklet A. It was found that reordering items often has significant but unpredictable effects on item performance. A linkage is made to previous research on the &quot;response set&quot; construction, and cautions are suggested regarding the effect of  reordering options. (SLD)",

In addition, both students and teachers completed the School Attitude Survey (SAS). Achievement data yielded inconclusive results in that standardized test scores and grade point averages were not consistent across assessment measures. The SAS revealed that students' attitudes about the change were generally more favorable than were those of teachers. In the second year of the investigation, teacher attitudes improved slightly. One positive finding was a decrease in dropout rate after the change. Implications of the findings for educational change are discussed. (SLD)",

A developmental sampling for time of testing x cohort x grade research plan of testing is used to illustrate this point. K. W. Schaie's (1965) proposed set of solutions addressing the developmental models of age, period, and cohort is considered. While the model is logically a three-way situation, computational/logical difficulties led to analyzing three two-way analyses, initially avoiding the use of missing cells and subsequently including missing cells. A model for time of testing x cohort x grade (age) research designs is proposed that  follows the full three-way model. After a synthetic data set for grade, cohort, and period for standardized scores is constructed, linear models in a regression solution are applied. To analyze the data for cell, grade, cohort, and period, the sets of two-way design are addressed. The issue of the subjects effect is addressed after the two-way layouts are completed. The problem can then be viewed as a: (1) cohort x time of testing design, (2) grade x time of testing design, and (3) grade x cohort design. The issue of partial repeated measures and consideration of only the repeated measures are discussed. Alternative hypotheses are evaluated, including a time of testing x cohort x grade design with partial subject control with weighted and unweighted means hypotheses.

Seven data sets were simulated, three unidimensional and four two-dimensional, all with 2,000 examinees. Two levels of correlation between abilities were considered. Eight different real test data sets were used: four were unidimensional, and four were two-dimensional. Real data came from the National Assessment of Educational Progress tests for U.S. history and literature for grade 11 and from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery for  grade 10 for arithmetic reasoning and general science. Findings suggest that, while linear factor analysis overestimated the number of underlying dimensions, the other three methods correctly confirmed unidimensionality but differed in their ability to detect a lack of dimensionality. Stout's procedure showed excellent power in detecting a lack of unidimensionality. Holland and Rosenbaum's procedure and the non-linear factor analysis approach showed good power provided the correlation between abilities was low. A 40-item list of references is included.

It was hypothesized that theater buffs would represent an intermediate stage on the path to developing expertise in judging acting ability. The judge sample (N=27) included nine experts, nine theatre buffs, and nine novices, with each expert being matched with a theatre buff and novice of the same sex and approximately the same age and level of education. All of the judges viewed eight high school students' videotaped performances of 2-minute long monologues twice, rated the videotapes, and completed the 36-item Judging Acting Ability Inventory developed for this  study. One month later, each judge viewed the same eight videotapes of the student performances twice, and again completed the rating and sorting tasks. Theater buffs did represent an intermediate stage in the development of expertise in judging acting. Their measures of contestant ability were significantly different than those of the experts and novices, with more similarities to the ratings of experts. Theatre buffs were also better at replicating their results at a second session than were novices, but they did not perform as well as did the experts.

        "description":"The aesthetic judgments of experts (casting directors and high school drama teachers), theater buffs, and novices were compared as they rated the videotaped performances of high school students performing Shakespearean monologues. Focus was on going beyond the determination of between-judge agreement to determine whether there were objective criteria that could differentiate the group ratings of the students. Three questions were posed: (1) whether the item calibrations for the experts, theatre buffs, and novices were significantly different; (2) whether the contestant ratings differed; and (3) whether the groups differed in the harshness with which they rated abilities. The judge sample (N=27) included nine experts, nine theatre buffs, and nine novices, with each expert being  matched with a theatre buff and novice of the same sex and approximately the same age and level of education. All of the judges viewed eight high school students' videotaped performances of 2-minute long monologues twice, rated the videotapes, and completed the 36-item Judging Acting Ability Inventory developed for this study. One month later, each judge viewed the same eight videotapes of the student performances twice, and again completed the rating and sorting tasks. With a few exceptions, theatre buffs and novices were as capable as experts in using the rating standards when they were explicit and in comprehensible language. Experts did rate some performances differently, showing evidence of multiple criteria for judging a performance. Experts also rated performers more harshly,  suggesting the application of more professional standards. Implications for the study of expertise in aesthetic judgment are discussed. Eight tables and four graphs illustrate the study. (SLD)",

        "description":"Some item response theory (IRT) techniques work in applications even though the usual structural IRT assumptions, and local independence (LI) in particular, do not hold. When the departure from LI is too great, traditional procedures will break down. Although violations of strictly unidimensional, monotone, locally independent latent structure can sometimes be modeled and exploited, many situations call for a unidimensional approach that is tolerant of minor violations of strict unidimensionality. Departures from strict unidimensionality can be detected, and the influence of these departures on a variety of LI-based ability estimators can be measured. A convenient universe of models near the LI model in which to investigate structural robustness issues is provided by the  essential unidimensionality modeling approach of W. F. Stout (1990). Theoretical results underpinning the approach are surveyed. Work in progress to apply these results in practical settings is described; the goal is to develop guidelines for the detection of departures from unidimensionality. Three data tables and 10 figures illustrate the discussion. A 33-item list of references is included. (Author/SLD)",

The ECC was developed in response to the Kellogg Foundation's need to categorize community-initiated funding proposals. As a classification tool, it facilitates proposal analysis and is comprehensive in encompassing the array of what normally would be windows of opportunity for interventions to benefit youth. The three-dimensional logical structure considers projects by: (1) age; (2) developmental area; and (3) community system providing the service. There are nine age categories and seven developmental domains. The community systems dimension contains eight sub-dimensions: (1) religious; (2) education; (3) justice; (4) public  works; (5) economic development; (6) health services; (7) social services; and (8) housing. The ECC represents the first step in needs assessment, information dissemination regarding existing community based programs, and analysis of newspaper coverage of youth programs. It provides an easily understood graphic depiction of beneficiaries of foundation funding, and it may provide a model for other organizations evaluating programs. The ECC is illustrated in figure 1.

        "description":"The perceptions of testing directors, school principals, teacher supervisors, and classroom teachers concerning the actual purposes of public school standardized group testing programs were studied. Surveys were mailed to superintendents in 97 randomly selected public school districts. The superintendents forwarded survey packets to selected principals and supervisors; standardized testing program directors; and elementary school and secondary school principals, who forwarded survey packets to selected classroom teachers. A total of 505 respondents from non-vocational public schools (82 testing directors, 48 teacher supervisors, 157 building principals, and 218 elementary school and secondary school classroom teachers) rank ordered statements describing the purposes of their  school testing programs. In contrast to the results of previous research findings, it was found that most educators appropriately perceive the primary purpose of testing programs to be for classroom instructional use. Additionally, it was found that: teacher supervisors' perceptions of the importance of various purposes of testing programs differed sharply from other educators' perceptions and appeared to be in direct conflict with their role as instructional leaders; elementary school and secondary school educators' perceptions of testing purposes sharply differed from each other; and testing directors' perceptions of testing program purposes varied with the extent and nature of their training in testing and evaluation.

Problems involved in the evaluation of the performance of disadvantaged students are examined, including: evaluation purposes (direction, motivation, certification, and selection) that are in conflict, task assignments that are overly routine, criteria that are unclear and narrow, standards that deny disadvantaged students the feeling of competence, testing practices that provide limited information on SP, appraisals that limit teacher discretion, feedback that is too limited, and the absence of planning for the improvement of SP. Elements of a more responsive evaluation  system for at-risk students include: attention to the purposes of direction and motivation; consideration of tasks prior to developing the evaluation process; broad criteria tapping multiple abilities, processes, and non-academic domains; standards that are challenging yet attainable; a broader range of information and more varied collection techniques; more efficient methods of collecting information on SP; appraisals that involve teacher discretion and broader teacher participation; more detailed feedback; new ways of presenting certification/selection information to students and new ways of presenting direction/motivation to others; and improvement plans that offer opportunities and resources.

        "description":"This paper explores a logistic regression procedure for estimating item parameters in the Rasch model and testing the hypothesis of item parameter invariance across several groups/populations. Rather than using item responses directly, the procedure relies on &quot;pseudo-paired comparisons&quot; (PC) statistics defined over all possible pairs of items. Methods of computing the PC statistics in non-independent and independent fashions are described. Two simulation studies were conducted. Both studies used a 2 x 2 factorial design in which the number of items (6 or 11) and the number of subjects (100 or 500) varied. There were 100 replications in each cell of the design, and for each replication, two samples of ability parameters were randomly drawn from a standard normal distribution. In  the first study, the PCs were computed in a non-independent fashion. In the second study, the PCs were computed in an independent fashion; however, only the two cells involving 500 subjects had been analyzed to date. The results of these studies suggest that the procedure yields negligibly biased estimates of item difficulty parameters even with small numbers of items. The simulation data were used to compare the distribution of observed test statistics under the null hypothesis of invariant item parameters across groups to the theoretical Student's t-distribution and the theoretical chi-square distribution. An application to sixth-grade mathematics achievement data for 178 fall mathematics test takers and 153 spring mathematics test takers is presented.

        "description":"Descriptive data were collected from male and female students in grades 7, 9, and 11 on five learner attributes commonly reported as influencing student learning and/or motivation: desire for approval of others, attribution of success or failure, desire for challenge in academic settings, perceived self-competence in school settings, and locus of control for learning activities. A 55-item 4-point Likert-type scale was developed--the Student School and Work Survey (SSWS). The SSWS was administered to 93 males and 106 females in grade 7, 96 males and 128 females in grade 9, and 105 males and 104 females in grade 11 at a high school in a large southwestern suburban school district. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients were computed for the 15 questions (3 per attribute)  contained in the learner attribute section of the SSWS. These inter-item correlations revealed that, with one exception, correlations among pairs of items within a particular learner attribute were consistently significant beyond the 0.001 level and were consistently higher than were correlations with items assessing the other attributes. Females showed a higher desire than males for approval and challenge in school-related tasks. Data for males and females concerning attribution did not differ significantly, but reflected higher internal than external attribution for success in school. Relatively high levels of self-competence on school tasks and locus of control were found for both sexes. Compared to younger students, older students take less responsibility for their learning, desire  less personal challenge, care less about the approval of others, and feel less school-related competence. Three data tables, two graphs, and a 20-item list of references are included. (RLC)",

Forer and others (1987) records the degree of disability of rehabilitation patients between &quot;Total Dependence&quot; and &quot;Complete Independence.&quot; Using the FIM, ratings on a seven-point scale are made by therapists and other expert care-providers at the time of patient admission to rehabilitation, at the time of patient discharge from rehabilitation, and at a follow-up assessment several weeks after patient discharge. The effectiveness of the rehabilitation program is measured by comparing the FIM scores for a patient at admission and at discharge. Rasch analysis of the admission or discharge FIM ratings of a sample of 33,646 patients shows that the 18 items of the FIM do not define a single statistical variable. Analysis highlights two  statistically and substantively different variables: (1) disability in motor functions; and (2) disability in cognitive functions. Separate Rasch analysis of these two variables confirms this conclusion and suggests further refinements that would increase FIM usefulness. Three tables contain study data. The FIM is presented.

        "description":"Studies of differential item functioning (DIF) under item response theory require that item parameter estimates be placed on the same metric before comparisons can be made. Evidence that methods for linking metrics may be influenced by the presence of differentially functioning items has been inconsistent. The effects of three methods for linking metrics on detection of DIF were studied. The methods included: (1) a weighted mean and sigma method; (2) the test characteristic curve method; and (3) the minimum chi-square method. Both iterative and non-iterative linking procedures were compared for each method. A two-parameter logistic item characteristic model was used to generate eight simulated data sets. A 60-item test and sample sizes of 300 and 600 were generated for each data  set. Results indicate that detection of DIF following linking via the test characteristic curve method gave the most accurate results when the sample size was small. When the sample size was large, results for the three methods were essentially the same. Iterative linking provided a substantial improvement in detection of DIF over non-iterative linking. A 28-item list of references is included. Seven tables present study findings, and an appendix summarizes the three methods. (Author/SLD)",

At the junior high school level (13 year olds), it was apparent that achievement in mathematics and science lags behind some  other countries. At the high school level, few students demonstrated high levels of performance. More associate's and bachelor's degrees were awarded in 1988 than in 1978, but fewer master's degrees were granted.

        "description":"This 60-item annotated bibliography focuses on case management as it relates to welfare, Medicaid, and/or the Family Support Act of 1988. While specific definitions, types of practice, and goals of case management vary greatly, the term here refers to a strategy of coordinating or integrating services for a client or group of clients in the social services and/or health arenas, e.g., maternal and child health, family support, and early childhood care and education. Section 1, &quot;Overviews of Case Management,&quot; includes general discussions. Section 2, &quot;Medicaid and Case Management,&quot; reflects the &quot;managed care&quot; or &quot;gatekeeper&quot; model of case management, stressing primary care and control of utilization and costs. Section 3, &quot;Welfare Reform and Case Management,&quot; includes some of the  newest perspectives on case management as a strategy for helping families become independent of welfare. Section 4, &quot;Other Applications of Case Management,&quot; includes miscellaneous applications of case management to a variety of social and health services. All materials listed in this bibliography were published during or after 1985. Complete price and ordering information appears whenever available and appropriate. All of the publications are available to the public at the library of the National Center for Children in Poverty (New York, New York). (FMW)",

The sample for the study was comprised of 160 three- , four- , and five-year-old children and their families, roughly half of whom were recruited from New York City emergency shelter facilities and half of whom were situated in some kind of permanent housing but depended on public assistance. Findings indicated few differences between homeless families living in shelters and hotels and low-income families in terms of child and family outcomes.

        "description":"High schools serving disadvantaged students typically lack the requisite information on students and their performance to identify and meet their needs. Most studies on the use of information by district-level administrators, principals, teachers, and other school staff are descriptive and focus on the thought processes of individuals or groups as they perform routine educational tasks, solve problems, and make decisions. Almost no studies have examined the relationship between information use and student outcomes. Educators appear to cope with imperfect data and time constraints by developing short-cuts to obtaining and interpreting information, or by making decisions based on outdated information. Innovative approaches to improving the gathering and use of information have  emphasized the use of student assessment information to modify instructional techniques, the systematic examination of program characteristics and outcomes to solve problems, and the implementation of integrated computerized databases to organize information and make it accessible for analysis. The following guidelines for developing effective school information systems are offered: (1) the system must be closely linked to the various alternative courses of action that educators might pursue in their work; (2) the system must be based on the work roles of the school personnel who will use it; and (3) the resistance to accompanying changes in work roles must be overcome by integrating the new system into a broader goal, such as school restructuring.

Several of the proposals merit consideration, but the overall impact of the budget would continue to favor upper-income individuals and place lower-income individuals increasingly at risk. The following findings are highlighted: (1) the budget as a whole would transfer resources up the income scale and widen disparities between low-income and high-income groups that are already greater than at any time since the end of World War II; (2) the budget does not respond to the current recession by improving unemployment benefits or assisting the victims of the recession; (3) the budget's overall treatment of programs for low-income groups is mixed, however,  with the number of programs receiving decreases being greater than the number receiving increases; (4) new budget procedures constrain Congress's ability to reshape budget priorities; and (5) the proposal to combine $15 billion in domestic programs into a massive block grant to states places many poverty programs at risk.

        "description":"This national survey of 2,299 elderly Hispanic Americans found that a great number face a daily struggle, living on limited incomes and coping with poor health. Problems in later years are the result of immigration patterns, low educational attainment, and limited English proficiency that have resulted in a lifetime of low income, no pension, and no health insurance benefits. Many must live with relatives or other people because their incomes are so low or their health and functional status is so poor that they are unable to cope without assistance. Elderly Hispanic Americans are more dependent on Supplemental Security Income (SSI), yet less than half of those who qualify for SSI actually participate. Elderly Hispanic Americans are also more likely than other elderly to be in  fair or poor health and to need medical services. Despite these greater health care needs, they are less adequately insured than the general elderly population. In addition to being in poorer health and using more acute care services, elderly Hispanic Americans need more long-term care services than other elderly people, and rely heavily on family members. Policy formation must take into consideration the different needs of Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other Hispanic subgroups, including those from South and Central America, the Caribbean, and Europe. Statistical data are presented in four tables and 15 graphs. A list of 12 references and an explanation of the survey methodology are appended. (FMW)",

The training program was adapted to school teachers, a population already identified as a high-risk group because of the frequency and unpredictability of the intercultural interactions likely to occur in schools. Moreover, teachers are agents of the socialization process for young people. The 91 participants in the study, all university students, were required to engage in triad group work as they discussed hypothetical incidents illustrating cultural conflict around themes such as individualism versus collectivism. Each member of the triad played a specific role, switching roles with each new problem. The  summarizer rephrased the material in his or her own words. The elaborator provided additional, related material. The monitor made sure that the summary and elaboration were accurate. Compared to a control group that participated in unrelated activities, training significantly increased participants' ability to recognize and analyze intercultural conflict in their own lives and to select correct responses and provide accurate analyses for posttest problems. The control group engaged in training later and training effects were replicated. An 8-week follow-up demonstrated retention of learning. Participants also rated training as interesting, beneficial, and enjoyable. Five tables, two appendixes, and a list of 30 references are included. (CJS)",

        "description":"This paper describes a study of at-risk secondary school students and the outcomes of the school-based interventions they were involved with. Information was gathered from 28 Black, Hispanic, and White students through field notes and audio recordings. The students came from homes with a low-average educational attainment and themselves had identifiable literacy problems. Many had a long history of behavioral problems both inside and outside the classroom, as well. The common risk intervention activities serving this population were as follows: (1) literacy programs before school, after school, or pullout; (2) teacher mentors and community or business mentors to encourage positive adult role models; (3) private business and industry contributing technology and work-study  programs; and (4) appointment of at-risk program coordinators within school districts and at-risk counselors for individual campuses. These case studies illustrate the complexity of the problems and solutions as well as the excitement and frustration encountered in attempting to discourage students from dropping out. At-risk programs such as these appear to address the students' needs, but fail to take into account their environment and values and what role school plays therein. As a result, the programs may be inadequate in effecting long-term behavioral changes. A developed, systematic theory for understanding student engagement and disengagement is needed.

        "description":"Schools cannot approach the problem of street gangs with the same strategies as law enforcement agencies, but rather must create a nurturing environment for all students, where success in school and life becomes the only attractive option for gang members. Street gangs represent the racial, cultural, and economic diversity of American society. Gangs are similar to other organizations in that they have a name, claim territory, have a continuous membership, and distinguish themselves from other groups. However, to qualify as a gang, the organization must be involved in criminal activity. Gang involvement can range from simple admiration or identification with someone who is in a gang to classification by a law enforcement agency as a documented full-participant. The following  factors contribute to gang involvement: (1) power; (2) pride; (3) prestige; (4) peer pressure; (5) adventure; (6) self-preservation; (7) money; and (8) limited life options. Schools must avoid the unproductive approach of attempting to identify and discipline gang members based on stereotyped behaviors. A positive educational approach to preventing gang involvement should include the following components: (1) staff development; (2) values education; (3) school climate; (4) cultural inclusion; and (5) community involvement.

The following factors make female Hispanic Americans the most at-risk of all students: (1) low grades and disciplinary problems; (2) lack of role models; (3) disproportionate levels of referrals to special education classes; (4) low teacher expectations; (5) lack of adequate vocational and career counseling; (6) stereotypical portrayals in the curriculum; (7) weak educational support at home; and (8) mothers with low educational attainment and low educational expectations for their daughters. The Mother-Daughter Program is a  collaborative program involving the University of Texas, the YWCA, and three El Paso (Texas) school districts. The program targets Hispanic American female students in grade 6 and their mothers from low-income families in which no member has graduated from college. Mothers are a central focus of the program, because their expectations, involvement, and role-modeling have a lasting impact on their daughters' educational development. Participants engage in a variety of activities on local college campuses and in community service programs. Hispanic American college women who serve as role models are a vital component of the program. Mothers and daughters participating in the program report increased career awareness, self-confidence, and educational aspirations. A list of 20 references is  appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"This paper reports the opinions of urban mathematics teachers concerning five areas of school mathematics: mathematics, mathematics teaching, recommended changes in mathematics education, mathematics education, and schooling. Of the 490 secondary mathematics teachers surveyed, 47 percent were frequent participants in the Urban Mathematics Collaborative (UMC), 41 percent were occasional participants, and 8 percent had never participated. An additional group of 40 UMC teachers were asked to respond to corresponding items on the Diary of Professional Relationships survey to provide more personalized and diverse information and to validate findings from group data. Responses indicate that teachers view mathematics primarily as thinking. They want their students to think critically,  to understand and use mathematics effectively, and to appreciate the value and beauty of mathematics. Most teachers seemed to hold an eclectic view of mathematics, although one cluster group viewed it as dynamic and changing, while another group viewed it more as a fixed body of skills and rules. These conceptions of mathematics related to the teachers' conceptions of mathematics teaching, recommended changes, mathematics education, and schooling. Frequent participants in the UMC held more favorable views toward recommended changes in mathematics education than the others. The results of this survey are discussed in relation to the UMC's efforts to empower teachers and reduce their feelings of isolation and burnout. Results of the survey are summarized in three tables and one figure.  Forty-one references and seven appendixes (with over 100 tables) are included. (CJS)",

The goal of the UMC is to improve mathematics education in urban schools and to identify new models for meeting the professional needs of high school teachers by exposing them to new trends in the field, and by fostering a sense of collegiality with mathematicians in business and universities. The following findings are discussed: (1) the high proportion of female and minority group member participants reflected the local population; (2) participants had an average of 14 years of teaching experience; (3) participants appeared to be exceptionally well qualified to teach, but they may not have had as much exposure  to mathematics as other mathematics teachers; (4) participants seemed to be exceptionally involved in professional enrichment and staff development; (5) involvement with other teachers was cited as the most important strategy for improving instruction; (6) participants cited absenteeism, low reading ability, and poor motivation as serious problems in their schools; (7) computers were not generally available for use by the majority of participants; and (8) participants placed heavy emphasis on developing students' knowledge of mathematical facts and principles and their approach to systematic problem-solving.

        "description":"This paper describes the implementation of an innovative integrated approach to the delivery of services for disadvantaged youth in Massachusetts, and examines the fiscal, political, and organizational factors that led to its subsequent demise. Massachusetts was one of the first states to envision and implement a statewide system of coordinated services for disadvantaged youth funded under the Federal Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 (JTPA). A state Youth Coordinating Council (YCC) was formed in 1983 to create ongoing collaboration among youth-serving groups, to eliminate needless service duplication, and to bridge gaps in programs available to troubled youth. Despite problems, the YCC succeeded in encouraging interagency coordination during the mid- to late-1980s in the  areas of vocational education, job training, adult literacy, early parenthood, and substance abuse. Efforts peaked with the creation of Commonwealth Futures, a dropout prevention initiative. Economic recession and the departure of key state personnel began to severely weaken the coordination effort in 1988. Public education, the core of the youth-serving system, was ravaged by budget cuts begun in 1989. Support for Commonwealth Futures was withdrawn at the local level and most of the collaborative activity came to a halt. In 1991, the bulk of funding was shifted away from integrated-services dropout prevention programs. Organizational and funding recommendations for protecting such initiatives in the future are made.

The program emphasizes learning through field experience and close collaboration between participating universities and local school administrative systems. Experienced administrators are chosen to serve as mentors for candidates in the administrative preservice training program. Mentors receive special training to prepare minority group candidates. Mentors are selected on the basis of recommendations of district superintendents and are matched with proteges regardless of sex or race. Mentors and proteges are administered the Alleman Mentoring Scales Questionnaire, the Mentoring Styles Indicator for Educational Administrators, and the Protege Needs Survey as  pre- and post-training assessment. Mentors and proteges are familiarized with the techniques of mentoring and the overall goals of the mentoring program during a training workshop. The development of both mentors and proteges is tracked throughout the program using structured interviews and journals. The following results are reported: (1) mentor behaviors identified by proteges; (2) descriptions of mentoring relationships by proteges; (3) descriptions of proteges by mentors; and (4) descriptions of struggling with mentors and developing informal mentoring relationships by proteges.

This report reviews programs funded by the EIEA and provides information for Congress to consider at the next program reauthorization deliberations. The review determined the following: (1) how school districts use EIEA funds; (2) how many districts have EIEA-eligible immigrant students but receive no EIEA funds; (3) how many EIEA students participate in other Federally funded education programs. Information was obtained by surveying 529 school districts that received EIEA funds during the 1989-90 school year and a sample of districts not receiving funds. To provide  examples of how school districts use the funds, reviews were made of the programs administered by the school district with the most EIEA students in each of the five states receiving the most EIEA funds: Los Angeles (California), Dade County (Florida), Chicago (Illinois), Houston (Texas), and New York (New York). To qualify for EIEA funding, a school district must have at least 500 immigrant students or these students must represent at least three percent of its total enrollment. The report estimates that in 1989-90 700,000 immigrant students met the EIEA criteria, about 85 percent of whom were in school districts receiving EIEA funds. Less than one-third of EIEA students participated in the other Federally-funded programs reviewed. During 1989-90, about 80 percent of EIEA funds were used  to pay for academic instructional programs. Ten tables and 10 appendices are included. (CJS)",

The response rate was 84 percent. Responses to open-ended questions on about one-third of those questionnaires were analyzed to determine the significant phenomena in students' experiences of OU study. The subject that most occupied students' minds was tutors and tutorials. Well over one-third mentioned that the decrease in the number of tutors and the inaccessible locations of tutorials had hindered them. Students indicated that the quality of tutors varied from excellent to appalling; the quality of OU material compared very favorably with other academic institutions; and OU study had contributed to their change and  development. Most comments about assessment were in the form of suggestions for change. The major concern regarding courses was the number that had been dropped from OU's offerings or postponed. Criticisms about books were that there were too many, they were too expensive, or they were not relevant. Criticisms about administration included increased fees and poor course guides. The critical feedback about summer schools focused on poor quality, expense, disruption to family arrangements, and the fact that they were not optional. Students suggested that OU might economize by scrapping television and radio. (YLB)",

Planning and organizing learning initiatives, recruiting participants, developing options and opportunities for improving skills, training volunteers, and evaluating the effectiveness of an approach are addressed in the second section. In addition, some misconceptions about people with reading difficulties are addressed. Profiles of adult learners are included as well as approaches suitable  for facilitating adult learning. An overview of the planning, organizing, and implementing process is provided. A range of options to take advantage of learning opportunities is discussed: peer learning, learning with computers, family involvement, and learning through oral stories.

        "description":"The trait-state model, a framework for understanding adult literacy, draws heavily on the social psychological literature. Allport (1961) first proposed the notion of trait. The overriding characteristics of focus on trait is the individual's possession of language control. Cattell (1950, 1979) emphasized the notion of state in relation to trait and indicated that one should never try to predict behavior from traits without considering the state of the individual. Focus on literacy as state concentrates on the actual functions and uses of literacy in the environment. A trait-state model helps one to understand the relationship between an individual's needs, which involve literacy and the pressure of the situation, as well as contexts that may appear to be literacy-based but in  which meeting literacy needs is peripheral to other values. Research shows that competency in trait aspects of literacy does not always transfer to various states. Under the assumptions of a trait-state model of literacy, (1) learners should develop more realistic concepts as to what constitutes reading, writing, and literacy; (2) assessment must consider the individual as a person and take into account trait and state; (3) interpersonal relations are important; and (4) the overlap of the concepts of adaptation and empowerment must be addressed.

        "description":"Literacy for participation in the economy has been promoted through legislation providing for adult education upgrading programs in the United States and Canada. More recently, publications and organizations have expressed concern for lack of participation in the economy by many adults who lack the necessary literacy skills. Although few doubt the relationship between literacy levels and ability to function in work-related literacy tasks, the level or degree of such literacy requirements is not known. Research has shown that the level of literacy in the workplace is not determined by a grade equivalent but by the literacy needs of the workplace. Furthermore, the nature of literacy in the workplace is different from school-based literacy. Researchers see little relationship  between the manner in which literacy is presently developed and power or mobility. Admission to the workplace through testing may be in conflict with approaches to literacy development and with a person's legal rights. Successful literacy programs have tended to be those that have been developed in a particular domain or situation. Literacy programs integrated with job development have resulted in significant gains in job-related reading. Literacy for participation in the economy must also be seen in terms of producers (workers) and consumers. (19 references)",

        "author":["Fagan, William T."],
        "description":"Although the emphasis on adult literacy/basic education is increasing, the high dropout rate from programs in these areas is a concern. Why learners choose to participate or not to participate in such programs can be understood in terms of three sets of factors. Learner-inherent factors include self-evaluation, goals, and capabilities. Life factors include the conditions and circumstances surrounding an individual that affect enrollment and participation in adult education programs; three such factors are information, transitions, and barriers. Program factors, the nature of the educational programs available to adults, include organization, content, procedures, and personnel. It is not enough to understand these separately and independently. A more complete understanding of  participation/nonparticipation is reached by applying Bateson's (1958) model of differentiation/congruency in examining how these three sets of factors interact. Devising and implementing an adult education program is both a complex and complicated task. The program must provide for interaction between instructor and students, students must understand how what they are learning relates to their life goals, and provision must be made for involvement of the learners in their learning.

Specific objectives of the study were to examine the relationship between grade in student teaching and the summative evaluation and determine the amount of variance in the final student teaching grade. The population for the study was all agricultural education graduates who completed student teaching at Ohio State University between 1980 and 1986 (N=283). The Inventory of Student Teacher Traits was completed by cooperating teachers as a summative evaluation of their respective student teachers. The Likert-type instrument included 14 traits rated by the cooperating teachers.  Descriptive statistics were used to summarize and analyze the data. Analysis revealed that student teachers attended regularly, were conscientious about learning, and were knowledgeable in safety aspects but not in work knowledge. Of the 14 traits listed, student teachers were rated high on all items. Cooperating teacher evaluations were valued by teacher educators when determining students' final grades. The performance component was more meaningful than the quality component in determining grades. (29 references) (NLA)",

        "description":"An intergenerational literacy program designed to help adults learn to read to their children or grandchildren, called PACT (Parent and Child Together), was conducted by the Scotland County (North Carolina) Memorial Library. The project trained two tutors in the storybook method of teaching reading and also gave the essentials of the method to two other volunteers. A public awareness campaign was conducted to recruit students. However, during the year-long project, the amount of time needed for developing public awareness and recruiting students was found to be longer than anticipated. The project was revised so that the project director worked with students at the local literacy council using the storybook approach. Books were provided for the students to take home to read to  their children or grandchildren. The 10 students served liked the approach, and some who had not learned to read using phonics read a book for the first time. A computer was purchased and proved popular with students at a low reading level. (Appendixes to the report include a brochure describing the program, which was disseminated to all North Carolina libraries and literacy groups; copies of local newspaper articles about the program; a flier cooperatively produced with local groups; a list of suggested books for an intergenerational literacy project; and examples of some of the types of recruitment used.)

An ongoing process for interesting community businesses in literacy education has been initiated. In addition, other human  service agencies have been involved, creating linkages that have been very important to the literacy program.

        "description":"The Boulder Public Library offered a one-to-one free literacy program aimed at middle-class nonreaders. During the fiscal year October 1988 to September 1989, the program matched 60 new students with volunteer tutors; of these, 52 enrolled, boosting enrollment to 90 students. The program also conducted assessment tests on 72 students and implemented a program of retesting after about 50 hours of tutoring. Testing showed that developmentally disabled students improved about one-half grade level after 50 hours, and nondevelopmentally disabled students improved 1.3 grade levels on word recognition and 1.3 grade levels on comprehension. The program also conducted four 12-hour tutor training sessions and five tutor inservice workshops. Two pilot student support group meetings were  held and were well received. The program also raised local funds from corporations and other donors, participated in a walk-a-thon, and conducted many community outreach and networking efforts. Recommendations for improvement included more involvement with the business community, increased emphasis on workplace literacy, and increased services to jail inmates.

HELP was a cooperative effort of community service agencies, church and civic groups, and interested individuals to provide free reading instruction. During Phase 3, 60 tutors were certified in the Laubach method; over 45 were paired with students. Literacy Volunteers of America methods and various computer software courses supplemented the Laubach basal reader. A team of apprentice trainers was trained, three of whom became certified by Laubach Literacy Action. HELP also served as host agency to train volunteers from other communities wanting to develop a literacy  program. During Phase 3, an advisory board, including both students and tutors, assisted in grant application, adopted goals, and proposed guidelines of operation. Tutors reported quarterly on student progress and number of hours served. Other evaluation methods included participant evaluation of each tutor training session, placement of inventory evaluation and check-ups at the end of each student's skill book, and a volunteer survey questionnaire for suggestions and input. Findings indicated that teaching students the basics of one grade level of reading could be achieved per 3 months of instruction. (YLB)",

Numerous community-based projects were completed. Upon  completion of the preapprenticeship training, trainees were tested on subject materials and acquired skills and placed with employers for a 4-year apprenticeship program. When completed, the 8,000-hour on-the-job program would qualify the apprentice for journeyworker status.

Both of the targeted groups underwent assessment and upgrading coordinated through the college's SUCCESS (Skill Upgrading for College and Careers Ensuring Student Success) center. The women participated in a program to obtain a High Technology diploma with studies primarily in the areas of personal computers, both hardware and software. The building trades component consisted of two segments. The first segment provided electronics and related courses to develop minimum competencies for coping with the installation and maintenance training  offered in the second segment. The second segment included a laser course. These courses were conducted on Fridays and Saturdays and were attended mostly by employed people. As a result of the program, 28 women completed upgrade classes and 13 completed the High Technology program. Ten students completed upgrade classes and five completed the training program for the building trades component. Evaluation of the project showed that fewer students than anticipated were served, probably because of the extensive time commitments required during the 13-month components. Recommendations were made to incorporate the program components into the regular curriculum as 2-year courses.

A perspective paper, titled &quot;Continuing Education as a Vehicle for Economic Development and/or Recovery&quot; (Phillip Speegle), looks at the role of continuing education in the next decade. &quot;The Humanities in Texas Continuing Education&quot; (Mary McIntire) is the President's Award paper. Based on a survey of 67 TACSCE institutions (32 responses), it takes the position that humanities programs are worth doing; public humanities programming is alive and well, though not necessarily in university and college continuing education; humanities programming can succeed in  urban and rural areas; and TACSCE should assume a leadership role in humanities public programming in Texas. The runner-up President's Award paper is &quot;An Exploratory Study of Nonparticipation by Older Adults in Organized Educational Activities&quot; (Allan Pevoto). It reports a study to identify the reasons for nonparticipation through interviews with 33 older adult nonparticipants. Two major categories are suggested as describing the basis for nonparticipation: a negative self-image and lack of interest in courses offered. &quot;1989 Personnel Profile/Salary Survey and Institutional Profile&quot; (Howard Smith et al.) presents results of a comprehensive survey of 281 institutions regarding continuing education personnel, salaries, and programming.

        "description":"Social class and ethnic group differences in college students' career maturity were investigated. Participants were 401 undergraduates (250 females, 151 males) attending California State Univesity, Long Beach. Quantitative measurements included: (1) the Duncan Index of social class; (2) Career Maturity Inventory-Attitude Scale; (3) the Vocational Preference Inventory and coding of a subject's career aspiration to determine vocational congruence; (4) the Career Development Inventory's University and College Form (to measure career decision-making ability); and (5) grade point average (GPA). One-third (n=128) of the sample participated in the survey and interview phases; the other two-thirds participated only in the survey. Quantitative analyses did not reveal significant social  class differences in career maturity. Various ethnic group differences were observed in regard to career mature attitudes, vocational congruence, and GPA. In terms of career mature attitudes, Caucasian-Americans exhibited significantly greater career maturity than did Filipino and Asian-American students. Filipino students reported a significantly lower mean vocational congruence than all other ethnic groups. Findings suggested that current theories of career development and career counseling were lacking in their application to today's ethnically diverse college population. (33 references) (YLB)",

        "description":"Two innovations have developed in response to economic and educational concerns--the demand for workers who will be able to contribute productively in the workplaces of the coming decade and the pedagogical movement toward a closer integration of clasroom and work-based learning. One such innovation, called Tech Prep, has been incorporated into the 1990 Carl Perkins Act. This initiative, promoted by the U.S. Department of Education, links the last 2 years of high school with the first 2 years of postsecondary learning in a sequence that is coordinated with and leads to either an associate degree or certification of occupational skills in a specific career area. The second innovative program, called youth apprenticeship or work-based learning, was influenced by European  apprenticeship systems. Youth apprenticeship programs meld Tech Prep-style coordination of secondary and postsecondary learning with paid work experience beginning in the last 2 years of high school, providing the context for both classroom and work-based learning. These two models are seen as competing solutions to the same problem: one is driven by labor market concerns, the other by educational concerns. The differences between the two will narrow in the coming years. (NLA)",

In Part II, the interrelated processes of evaluation planning and management are discussed, and evaluation planning and management approaches are explained and demonstrated. Parts III, IV, and V focus on the three components of the evaluation management approach discussed in Part II: management information systems (MIS), naturalistic evaluation (NE), and rationalistic evaluation (RE). Chapters in these parts cover: (1) theory, questions, and design of an MIS,  NE, or RE; (2) writing a proposal for an MIS or for an evaluation study in the naturalistic or rationalistic mode; (3) tools and techniques of the three approaches; and (4) writing periodical and special reports. Part VI discusses the politics of evaluation, the need to establish evaluation standards for meta-evaluations, and the related question of evaluators' training. A glossary is appended. (YLB)",

        "description":"Strategies for integrating academic and vocational skill have been the focus of increasing attention in recent years. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of 1990 mandates that state and local education agencies integrate these programs so students achieve both academic and vocational competencies. Implementation of this mandate presents major challenges. One such challenge is the development of curricula that acknowledge program goals and the environment in which they are implemented. Eight models have been identified for integrating academic and vocational programs: (1) incorporate academic competencies into vocational courses; (2) combine the efforts of academic and vocational teachers to incorporate academic competencies into vocational courses;  (3) make academic curricula more vocationally relevant; (4) modify both academic and vocational curricula to be more compatible with each other; (5) use academies--schools within schools; (6) develop departments organized around occupational clusters; (7) encourage single-occupation institutions to focus integration efforts; and (8) maintain conventional departments. Through maximizing success, implementing integration efforts, using an accommodation team, more effective accommodation outcomes and strategies designed to help a wide array of learners can be achieved.

Data were collected using surveys, structured interviews, the critical incident technique, and documentation analysis. Respondents included 29 students from 6 countries, 20 instructors, 1 educational technologist, and 2 administrators. The most critical conditions were cultural values and language factors. The most effective methods were micro-strategies, management strategies, and delivery strategies. The most important traits brought to training by international students were value differences, language, and  vocabulary difficulty. The most frequently mentioned value differences were about education and authority. The other two top ranked differences were motivation and group orientation. Language difficulty limited achievement of course objectives. Training designed for international students should ameliorate cultural and language factors through appropriate instructional strategies. (NLA)",

        "description":"In the new context of economic recovery, employment creation, new technologies, and labor shortages in some sectors, France cannot sustain a systematic policy of rejecting aging workers. This policy has led gradually to the recognition that early retirement was merely an easy way out of the problem that has many substantially adverse effects on the economic, political, and social spheres. A new consensus on age management has three aspects: older workers in the workplace, older workers' layoffs, and reemployment of the older unemployed. In the workplace, stereotypes should be eliminated; enterprises should invest in massive, diversified, and integrated training programs; and forward-looking personnel management should be used. Adjustment initiatives for retirees could be made  more attractive, and fewer, more selective, and more rigorously negotiated early retirement agreements are required. The implementation of an appropriate policy for reemployment of older workers implies action in five directions: (1) change in employment practices and behaviors; (2) emphasis on job placement; (3) expansion of sources of employment; (4) targeted, motivating training in an individualized program; and (5) local management based on partnership. A proactive policy must guide the public authorities, enterprises, unions, and workers. (A glossary of French terms is appended.) (YLB)",

        "description":"Leadership may be defined as both a process and a property. Research shows that some attributes common to successful leaders (characteristics, knowledge, and skills) can be significantly influenced by planned education or training. In the process of developing a leadership assessment instrument, a study specified four broad tasks that leaders are expected to perform and identified 37 attributes hypothesized to be most likely to predispose desirable leadership behaviors. The 37 attributes were assembled into the Leader Attributes Inventory (LAI). Three forms are available: (1) an other-rating form to assess an individual's perception of the extent to which she or he believes some other individual possesses each leader attribute; (2) a self-rating form to assess an individual's  perception of the extent to which she or he currently possesses each attribute; and (3) a retrospective self-rating form. Studies have been conducted that provide evidence about LAI's usefulness in assessing leadership development. The consistency of LAI scores has been satisfactory. The LAI is suggested for evaluation of leadership development programs and for individual diagnosis. (29 references) (YLB)",

        "description":"The role of the top human resources executive in major corporations has changed during the past decade into a directly involved business advisor, strategist, and implementer of business objectives. Intense competition has overridden previous human resources concerns and forced priorities toward internal, business-driven issues. Since cost-cutting and restructuring became the watchwords of the 1980s, personnel cutbacks and reorganization have occupied increasing proportions of the human resources executive's time. Nevertheless, all of the prior responsibilities, such as employee welfare, personnel administration, union relations, government regulation, and community concerns, are still human resources staff responsibilities. With the increasing dominance of business needs in the  human resources function, there is some feeling that the top human resources position is becoming a general management job. In such a changing environment, training for the top human resources position becomes uncertain. A developing issue is whether there is a clear-cut human resources professional career and the specific content of such a career. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A study surveyed 139 individuals to determine if differences in the way they approached the physical attributes of various learning environments could be attributed to either gender or age. Participants were Montana State University graduate students in education; adult basic education students in Bozeman, Montana; adult basic education faculty and students in Ayer, Massachusetts; graduate students in adult and technological education in Knoxville, Tennessee; staff of a community college from California; and 100 randomly selected individuals in Washington, D.C. In all, 136 usable surveys were returned. Participants completed up to four instruments in three administrations. Instruments used were the Physical Environment Survey (PES), Oddi Continuing Learning Inventory (OCLI), and  Environmental Response Inventory (ERI). Mean adaptive response scores were calculated for males and females. Respondents were divided into four age groupings: those born before 1940, those born between 1940 and 1949, those born between 1950 and 1959, and those born after 1960. Mean adaptive response scores were calculated for each age group. T tests showed no significant difference between genders or among the four age groups on the PES. Analysis of the scores on the OCLI and the PES for the graduate students showed no correlation. Variability was found in the responses of individuals on the PES. Neither variable was significant in determining if an individual was primarily adaptive or adoptive in dealing with the physical environment. (The PES is appended.) (YLB)",

The program is organized in seven parts, following an introduction that defines LEP and provides information on the need for programs for this population. Part I focuses on recruitment, emphasizing that a targeted recruiting effort helps LEP persons gain access to career-vocational programs. Part II emphasizes that assessment should not be used to exclude LEP persons from career-vocational programs and illustrates formal and informal  methods of assessment. Part III describes and illustrates more than 15 ways for English-speaking career-vocational teachers to provide bilingual or multilingual instruction and to simplify and clarify their English for LEP students. Part IV describes vocational English as a second language (VESL), VESL lesson development, and techniques for teaching VESL. Part V emphasizes the role of counseling in programs for LEP students, and part VI provides suggestions for job placement for them. The final part explains the importance of a coordinator for the multiple facets of an LEP program. Recommendations for conducting the training workshop also are made. (KC)",

The North Clackamas (Oregon) School District's Owen Sabin Occupational Skills Center prepares students for entry into high  technology fields. The CTU program links vocational-technical education and the private sector for high technology training. Due to local labor shortages, three clusters were included in the program: advanced information systems, graphic technology, and health occupations. Successful implementation or replication of a demonstration project mandates that the skills and support needed for project implementation are present. In addition, successful program management involves cooperative partnerships between education and training organizations and business/industry. (NLA)",

        "description":"Projects funded during the first year of operation of the National Workplace Literacy Program were examined. Activities included a review of research literature, analyses of data from 29 of the 37 first-year projects, and site visits to 6 projects. The research literature suggested the following elements of successful workplace literacy programs: a close and collaborative relationship between workplace literacy partners; employee involvement; a literacy task analysis; clear and objective program goals; linking of workplace literacy instruction with job tasks; and instructors with experience teaching adults. Information from site visits identified four components associated with effective workplace literacy projects: (1) active involvement by project partners, such as businesses  and unions, in project planning, design, and operation; (2) active and ongoing employee involvement in conducting literacy task analyses and determining worker literacy levels; (3) systematic analysis of on-the-job literacy requirements; and (4) development of instructional materials related to literacy skills required on the job. Five recommendations to improve program effectiveness were offered: (1) require workplace literacy projects to collect data; (2) lengthen the grant period; (3) develop procedures for disseminating information about successful projects; (4) require projects to evaluate effectiveness; and (5) support development of instruments to assess participant literacy levels geared for the workplace.

        "description":"Reasons for occupational mobility are imperfect occupational matching, search, exogenous changes in the market or in the person, and movement along a career path. A positive or negative relationship between the level of schooling and occupational mobility depends on the type of mobility involved. Higher levels of schooling lead to careers comprised of a smaller number of occupations, thus reducing the probability of other types of mobility. This negative effect of schooling decreases with time in the labor market. Schooling also has a negative effect on the probability of upward mobility. However, when a control for the occupation of origin is performed, it is found that among workers in the same occupational group, the more educated are more likely to move up. The schooling  effect is much stronger on intra-firm career mobility (\"promotion\") than on inter-firm career mobility. Given job turnover, more educated workers are also more likely to move up. This observation is partially explained by the fact that among those who leave the firm, the ratio of quits to layoffs increases with the level of schooling and also by the fact that among workers who are laid off, the more educated are more likely to move up. In addition, if the returns to schooling (in terms of wages) are lower while working in a specific occupation, the effect of schooling on the probability of being promoted from that occupation will be higher.

        "description":"Using information on time costs of training and gains in wages attributable to training, rates of return on training investments were compared. The range of estimates based on several data sets generally exceeds the magnitude of rates of return usually observed for schooling investments. It is not clear, however, that the difference represents underinvestment in job training. Two methods were used to estimate total annual costs of job training in the U.S. economy for 1958, 1976, and 1987. The &quot;direct&quot; calculation uses information on time spent in training and on wages. For 1976, costs so calculated amounted to 11.2 percent of Total Employment Compensation, which is about half of the costs of school education. In the &quot;indirect&quot; method, training costs were estimated from wage  functions fitted to Michigan's Panel Study of Income Dynamics data. In 1976 the direct estimate amounted to between 65 percent and 80 percent of the indirect estimate based on the wage profile. The result provides strong support for the human capital interpretation of wage profiles. The estimates indicate a slower growth of training than of school expenditures in the past decades. Substitution of schooling for job training is a likely cause. (Twenty-eight references and five tables are included.) (Author/NLA)",

        "description":"A case study of on-the-job training in a factory stockroom took a close look at the working milieu, the way experienced people did their jobs within it, and the means used to induct (train) newcomers into work activities. Stockroom work and stockroom training were considered to represent two different activity systems; the interplay of these two activities in the work environment was explored. The training study was conducted at a manufacturing plant that produced radio-frequency connectors and that had implemented a computerized inventory and production control system known as Manufacturing Resource Planning. As new persons were hired, they were assigned to experienced workers who took on the responsibility for their training. Training was a subsidiary to work and a dynamic  construction into which these factors entered: supervisors' views of how to train; level of management implementing the training; composition of the stockroom work force; and union policies. Training was not planned but &quot;took shape.&quot; Since training was assimilated into ongoing work practices, trainees were exposed only to routine work events. Analysis of the technical and communicative processes that structured training-and-work within training dyads showed that trainers incorporated talk into the training process and explained the work as it was done. Talk and work performance went on in tandem. (70 references) (Author/YLB)",

        "description":"The history of vocational education in the United States from 1860-1930 is seen from a different perspective than that in existing accounts of the rise of mass vocational education. In this perspective, vocational education is defined broadly as encompassing professional training, including training for professions that emerged in that era (such as accounting), and evening and extension classes of colleges and universities. Although most advocates of vocational education in the public schools focused on \"industrial\" education--education for factory work--the demand for commerce-oriented vocational courses exceeded that for industrial courses. A major role was played by proprietary (profit venture) schools, especially correspondence schools, which enrolled an astounding number of  students during this period. The majority of students who took vocational courses between 1890 and 1930 did so not as teenagers in public high schools but as adults who had already commenced their working careers. During this time, however, prominent educators such as John Dewey called for a kind of vocational education relating job skills and underlying sciences, aimed at preparation for a mobile career, and taking place in full-time institutions. Starting in the 1920s and continuing into the 1930s, the model of full-time, school-based vocational training began to replace prior models of evening classes. (103 reference notes) (KC)",

        "description":"A project conducted a needs assessment and developed a proposal to address the needs of Minnesota's bilingual, bicultural workers in refugee-focused programs for additional education and training. A review of the literature found few published works directly related to the needs of bilingual refugee workers. Data were gathered from refugee program experts, Minnesota Department of Human Service records, bilingual workers, agency personnel, representatives of educational institutions, and published funding information. A small number of active programs engaged in training bilingual workers were identified. Most were affiliated with an institution of higher education and some granted college credit. Focus groups indicated a need for training and credentials, identified money as the  foremost barrier to pursuing further education, and saw language as a serious obstacle for some. According to bilingual workers, English as a Second Language (ESL) was not the primary hurdle to returning to school. The two major hindrances were money and time issues. Representatives of the public school system and social service and health care agencies were interviewed concerning the demand for services of bilingual staff members. Their greatest concern was written language skills of these employees. Postsecondary institutions had developed a solid core of ESL classes and English support services.

Telephone interviews were completed for 157 graduates in 51 randomly selected Kentucky high schools. Two somewhat comparable interview schedule forms consisted of questions concerning demographic variables, graduates' real life experiences, and graduates' behavior in relation to three areas of home economics subject matter: foods/nutrition; consumer education/resource development; and parenting/child development. The sample population came from a variety of community, school, and home economics programs. Most were female, Caucasian, and lived at home with parents. Ninety-six percent said they would definitely recommend that a  student take home economics in high school. Mean scores were calculated for each content item and subscale. Data showed that graduates were using the information taught in CHE courses. Significant differences among total scores were found for these variables: community size, enrollment in home economics, class rank, where the graduate was living, education/work status, and insurance. Research recommendations included a longitudinal follow-up study, focus on behaviors in other content areas, and comparison with non-CHE students.

A questionnaire received 594 responses (a 50% response rate). Teachers reported their perceptions regarding their skills in seven categories: teaching; curriculum development; determining clients needs and industrial liaison; management/administration; updating own subject; workplace context; and general personal qualities. A two-stage Delphi survey of experts identified teacher skills and competencies for the 1990s. Results from all research techniques indicated that teaching-related skills featured very prominently but  that the gap between present and future required skills was small. Curriculum development areas identified as becoming prominent were those that showed large skill shortfalls. The gap between future requirements and current expertise in determining client needs and industry liaison was the largest among the seven categories of skills. Teachers undertook considerable administrative tasks and expected this area to require a higher level of skills. Updating vocational and practical expertise was a high priority for TAFE teachers. The extent and importance of workplace-related knowledge was emphasized. The category of personal qualities showed not only the highest perceived level of current skills but also the highest level of required skills for the 1990s. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study for the South Australian Government gathered data on student enrollment and graduation rates in Diploma and Associate Diploma courses; documented initiatives for multiple entry and exit structures; proposed other possible approaches, using selected courses as case studies; investigated problems associated with providing multiple entry and exit points in such courses; and suggested possible solutions. Information was gathered from the following sources: interviews with South Australian education officials, a literature review, analysis of curriculum documents for a range of Associate Diplomas and Diplomas, analysis of student records and other data, and interviews of students. Some of the findings were that graduation rates for all programs were low, attrition from  technical courses was higher than from less technical ones, and retention based on &quot;student hours&quot; data was high for all programs, with retention increasing over time. The study also found that students who did withdraw tended to do so early in the program, primarily due to course difficulty or money problems. Students saw merit in introducing courses with more flexible entry and exit points. Recommendations were made to gather more information on students' previous study and their courses and to develop methods for creating more flexible course work, in light of training requirements. Emphasis was also placed on articulation measures to help students keep from repeating prior work. (The report includes 29 references and 3 appendixes: the original project brief, a description of major and  minor streams in curricula, and a listing of current Associate and Diploma programs offered in South Australia.)

Fleximode, as practiced in Australia, was adapted from a mode of study pioneered in England. It offered students the independence of off-campus study in combination with access to college resources and interaction with college staff and students. Six projects were selected for fleximode delivery for the first semester, 1989. Four programs were delivered as variations from traditional face-to-face delivery: accounting 1A, associate diploma of social science (child care), motorcycle mechanic apprenticeship stage 2A, and petrol fuel injection. Two programs adapted from correspondence delivery were studied: commercial pilot  license and diploma in local government. The following types of comparisons were made to evaluate program costs and benefits: students' final examination results, retention rates, teacher's perceptions, students' perceptions, and financial costs. Comparisons made between the fleximode programs and traditional delivery methods revealed no significant differences in educational efficiency as indicated by students' retention rate and examination results. A number of qualitative differences were found between the programs, such as learner satisfaction, and these differed between individuals within programs.

        "description":"A study investigated the human and physical resources implications of award restructuring in the textiles and metals industries for the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) system in Australia. (Award restructuring is based on union/employer cooperation in a process of negotiation and compromise between employers committed to increased productivity and efficiency and a work force seeking improved skills, responsibility, and working conditions.) Information was obtained through case studies of the two industries and of several companies in each industry. Qualitative research methods such as site visits, interviews, work observation, and document analysis were used to gather data for the case studies. Some of the key implications that were identified were the following: (1) TAFE  colleges need to adapt more quickly and realistically by providing both site-specific and off-the-job training in subject areas identified by companies as being their most pressing needs; (2) TAFE training needs to reflect the impacts of award restructuring upon a company's operating processes; (3) TAFE needs to recognize the internal labor markets being created by award restructuring within companies; (4) greater emphasis needs to be placed on the implications for TAFE of skills, competencies, assessment procedures, and accreditation; (5) TAFE educational institutions should not give priorities to the production of commercially useful knowledge while neglecting the lifelong learning process; and (6) a redirected curriculum focus is needed, integrating vocational education and training  systems.

The competency-based approach brings flexibility to a training and education system. It allows the development of a continuum of competence statements from basic to complex. The most important element of a competency-based system of training is the final decision-making process--that is, whether the competence can be inferred from the performance evidence collected. The decision to recognize a performance as satisfactory and to infer competence is the basis for the success of the system. The standards specified when describing the competence must be validly assessed. Competence is based on matching the  necessary level of knowledge with an appropriate performance. (NLA)",

How do the elements compare to those found in other settings? What implications do the findings have for further study? Several issues are identified: (1) the \"unattended\" issue (how vocational education was ignored in national reform reports); (2) a model for excellence; (3) outcome factors; (4) institutional variables; (5) organizational structure of the system; (6)  personnel qualifications; (7) curriculum development; and (8) program access. In the study of excellence in public education, several topics are identified: (1) structural variables; (2) schools in transition; (3) changes occurring in education; and (4) themes of excellence.

History shows that the natural basis of changes in every society tends to be objective technological revolutions. The first technological revolution was agrarian. The second was industrial. The third revolution, the scientific and technological revolution, took place mostly in highly developed capitalist countries. The first aspect of perestroika in Soviet society is dissatisfaction with the state's power and a striving to adopt democratic governing. The second aspect of perestroika is the economy and financing. Economic reconstruction is complicated by the monopoly of central ministries, strict centralization in  national economy management and its branches, lack of production material and equipment for free trading at the market, and a financial system in disarray caused by the partial transition to market relations and cooperatives. Reconstruction of the ideology in the Communist Party is also hinted at. The main trends of reforms in education are decentralization of management and differentiation of education. New concepts in vocational training include new curricula and programs and differentiation of subjects regarding professions. One way to reconstruct vocational training is by &quot;de-ideologization&quot; of education, democratic reform, and priority in financing. (YLB)",

General secondary school graduates with no preliminary vocational education become engineers. Secondary vocational graduates lack the opportunity to continue their education in the high technical schools. Perestroika of high, vocational, and secondary general education demands the foundation of a flexible system of vocational training, related to the requirements of the society, for specialists in different occupational areas. A pedagogical system based on research would prevent a situation in which the system of training lags behind the technical and technological development. The main goal of such research  is to solve complex problems using systematic principles. The city of Tomsk (U.S.S.R.) is leading the way in the vocational reform movement. New forms of intensive vocational education and training have been worked out and approved. Curricula of general, vocational, and high schools are linked through flexible programs. Experimental research has focused on problems associated with intensive training of specialists under the present conditions of cooperation and interaction among schools and business. The need to strengthen the polytechnical content of general subjects and to improve the preparation of teachers has been noted. (YLB)",

Separate aspects of the new economy are elaborated in five parts. Part I presents the competitive standards that provide the cornerstone for the new economic reality: robust productivity, flexible volumes, speed, affordable quality, and customer focus. Part II assesses the role of technology, especially information technology, in the new economy. Part III explains how the orderly cycles of economic change have been transformed in the new environment. Parts IV, V, and VI discuss the impact of new competitive standards, technologies, and the radical alteration caused by economic change on organizations, jobs, and  skills respectively. Part IV discusses mass production structures; services, independent crafts, and professions; and examples of industries' diverse responses to organizational demands. Part V addresses how the new economy has affected jobs in three ways: quantity, distribution, and quality. Part VI discusses factors affecting skill requirements and elaborates on the skills needed in the new economy. A list of 138 references is appended. (YLB)",

        "description":"Addressing the changing needs of new college student clientele and meeting campus demands of the upcoming decades calls for an interactive teaching approach, one that meshes theory and research with practicality and relevance, and addresses environmental press, the student socialization process, and problem-solving through the diverse techniques of field-based exercises, speaker-practitioners, simulation, role play, case study, computer application, personal reflection, critique, and discussion. Therefore, student affairs professionals need a conceptual framework; a theoretical base; an historical perspective; a knowledge of the jargon; and skill in technology, needs assessment, group dynamics, and program evaluation. Students can interact with proper role models, observe  undergraduate behavior in its natural setting, and hone skills needed to fulfill professional roles. This paper chronicles the events and exercises of an interactive masters and doctoral level student personnel administration course that attempts to mesh theory, research, and practicality. Various sections of the paper examine course goals, course objectives, the course content, and observations about the course. (33 references) (Author/NB)",

        "description":"There is considerable awareness among Israeli mental health workers and citizens of the importance of differentiating between acute or chronic reactions to severely stressful life situations and manifestations of mental illness and anxiety, or developmental and adjustment disorders. Israeli mental health workers have become expert and are heavily committed to treating stress-related phenomena. While manuals are available for dealing with stress reactions in school children, teachers, and mental health personnel themselves, these manuals present little systematic data on the pervasiveness of stress reactions. In spite of the ubiquitous nature of war stress-related phenomena in Israeli society, there have been no large-scale epidemiological studies of stress-related reactions and  disorders in Israeli children and youth for any decade. Two major reviews of the clinical studies in the field cite data on anxiety levels in children as a function of the ideological and ecological features of their community, demographic variables, and the degree of traumatization they have faced. Ideological biases of both the investigator and the clients can determine what is attended to and how it is interpreted and treated. The ideological bias of the investigator can cause researchers to diagnose stress-related psychopathlogy in children where it does not exist or to avoid seeing it where it does. Such ideological biases complicate the process of identifying and treating Israeli children who may suffer from war-related posttraumatic stress disorders. The same caveats may also apply  to working with Palestinian children. (NB)",

Preventing youth from smoking, drinking, and using drugs must be a collaborative effort, jointly undertaken by the school, community, and youths themselves. This guide was developed to explain the partnerships that schools and communities can create to share the responsibilities of planning, funding, and implementing preventive strategies and programs. The first section presents a conceptual framework for planning by reviewing the extent of the substance abuse problem among youth, identifying misconceptions that lead to ineffective programs, defining drug use as a behavioral problem determined by many systems of  influence, exploring the need for an integrated approach to prevention, identifying both risk and protective factors within students' influence groups, formulating a new definition of prevention, and introducing a comprehensive health approach to drug prevention. The next section develops a leadership role for schools, explaining how to build a partnership among schools, law enforcement, and the community; identifying the planning steps; recommending a comprehensive program for the school site; considering community- and school-based program strategies; and listing criteria for preventive programs and curricula. The final three sections of the guide look briefly at the intervention plan, school policy, and program support. Relevant sections of California legal codes, resources, and  references are appended.

        "author":["Benton, Carol L."],
        "description":"Performance terminology can be applied as a form of analysis to evoke unique understandings of the identity of adult children of alcoholics (ACoA). By observing ACoA meetings, one can see members relying on positive reinforcement, validation perceptions, rewriting and visualizing healthy parenting skills, and rehearsing more functional alternative behavior. It appears that creation and acknowledgement of inner selves become the primary means by which members construct identity. It is the inner child who can begin to show the individual how to take care of and parent the adolescent and young adult parts of the self. Members' descriptions of and scripting and rehearsing with these inner selves suggests a dynamic, performance approach to recovery. Identity for the adult child, then,  may be a complex and creative reworking of the crisis of addiction into the drama of recovery. For some adult children of alcoholics in recovery, support groups can aid the individual in learning how to rewrite the past and practice healthier possibilities for the future. Some members of mutual self-help groups imagine dialogues with and take on the roles of child, adolescent, and young adult as a part of recovery work. Understanding these unique parts of the self is key to working through dysfunction and synthesizing the inner selves into a functional, recovering whole. These strategies provide hope and health to individuals who come from alcoholic homes as well as other children of trauma. (NB)",

        "description":"For the adult survivor of incest, the evolution from victim to survivor occurs in complex and creative ways. Often journal writing can be a means of exposing and exploring past abuse. The process of journal writing is special in that it allows the adult survivor to break the silence and shame imposed by the perpetrator while remaining essentially invisible and safe. The journal text is a private, reconstructed world in which the text's speaker is also its audience. The act of writing in a journal is essentially performative because of this audience. This paper relies on a textual analysis of selected published journal excerpts to explicate the implied audience embedded in survivors' journals. An examination of implied audience is meaningful to initially understand how survivors  thematize, contextualize, and work through past abuse. (37 references) (NB)",

        "description":"Previous research has demonstrated an association between locus of control in adolescence and a successful transition to adulthood. Having an external locus of control has been implicated as an important factor in adolescent behaviors such as teenage pregnancy and delinquency, and has been found to be negatively related to school achievement. This study was conducted to assess factors predicting adolescent locus of control, including parent-adolescent communication, the adolescent's satisfaction with social support, and life stress. Possible effects of locus of control on other key variables which may affect issues related to adolescent development were also examined, including school achievement, antisocial influences, and depression. Self-report questionnaires were completed by  1,264 ninth graders. The findings revealed that mother-adolescent communication and life stress had both direct and indirect effects on locus of control. Locus of control was found to be critical only in predicting depression and grade point average, not antisocial influences. Other variables in combination with locus of control determined grade point average, antisocial influences, and depression. All but one of the interactions tested were significant. Locus of control interacted with life stress to affect antisocial influences, while mother-adolescent communication interacted with life stress to predict depression. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"It was hypothesized that antisocial behavior and deviant peer involvement assessed prior to puberty, at grade four, would predict initiation of sexual intercourse by grade nine. The hypotheses were tested on a sample of 201 boys who were at risk for delinquency. The subjects participated in an extensive multiple method/agent assessment for both parents and the boy including interviews, home observations, questionnaires, test data, telephone interviews, school questionnaires and records, and court data. The multiple regression analysis showed that deviant peer association and antisocial behavior along with anxiety, assessed at grade four, and pubertal maturation assessed at grade 6, were significant predictors of initiation of sexual intercourse by grade nine. The results revealed  that characteristics of the boy at grade four were more powerfully predictive of initiation of sexual intercourse by grade nine than were the family management constructs of supervision and discipline. The process was hypothesized to progress from poor family management to antisocial child behavior, involvement with a deviant peer group, and early sexual intercourse. (NB)",

This study used a mass screening concept as a pre-test identifier of at risk clients for suicide ideation and depressions; development of a competency-based prevention group treatment program, and the post-testing of the identified at-risk population to empirically evaluate the group treatment program for its effectiveness in reducing suicidal ideation and depressive symptomatology. Subjects (N=109) were ninth grade students who completed the Suicide Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ) and the Reynold's Adolescent Depression Survey (RADS). Students who scored on or above the test manual cutoff scores were identified as \"at risk-needing treatment.\" The identified students (N=21) were  offered an 8-week group treatment program. Pre- and post-test data were analyzed for frequencies of responses on the inventories and for gender differences. Treatment (N=11) and non-treatment (N=10) group differences were analyzed. A significant difference was found between pre- and post-test RADS scores of the total population, while a trend toward significance was found in the SIQ total population sample. In spite of the small sample size, graphic representations of pre- and post-test means support the hypothesis that the treatment group would improve at a higher degree than the non-treatment group. It was concluded that the mass screening is one tool useful for early identification of at-risk youth. (Author/NB)",

College students (N=85) completed six questionnaires: a global self-esteem scale, a mother's nurturance scale, a father's nurturance scale, a mother's authority questionnaire, a father's authority questionnaire, and a demographic information sheet. Mothers and fathers of the students  completed the Hostility Scale. Several inverse relationships were found between Ho scores and adolescent self-esteem and adolescent perception of their parental nurturance and authority. The magnitude of these effects was consistently greater for fathers' Ho than for mothers' Ho, adding support to the hypothesis that the behavioral and emotional consequences of Ho are different for men and women.

It summarizes the law on how the authority for adolescent health care  decisionmaking is allocated, common law rule, exceptions to the common law rule, positions of health care provider organizations on adolescent health care decisionmaking, and the research literature on adolescents making health care decisions on their own. Chapter 18 addresses the health issues and barriers to effective and appropriate health services that are faced by selected groups of adolescents (those living in poverty, members of racial or ethnic minorities, and residents of rural areas) and reviews knowledge on interventions to increase access to health services among these adolescents. Chapter 19 provides an overview of the federal role in adolescent health. (NB)",

        "description":"Research has consistently found that health care providers report having negative attitudes and perceptions toward Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) patients. This study was conducted to examine the independent and joint influences of a patient's mode of acquisition of illness (blood transfusion versus sexual promiscuity), patient blame (self-blame versus chance-blame), and patient sexual orientation (homosexual versus heterosexual) on medical students' attitudes toward and willingness to treat AIDS patients. Medical students in either their first year of training (N=74) or their fourth or internship year (N=44) were randomly assigned to read case vignettes which described an AIDS patient. The cases varied as a function of the crossing of the three factors under study. A  consistency bias between attribution of blame and mode of disease acquisition was found to strongly influence perceptions. More positive attributions were made when such a consistency was perceived: a sexually promiscuous patient was seen as more sociable when he blamed himself for acquiring his disease than when he blamed chance and a patient who acquired AIDS via a blood transfusion was deemed more psychologically well-adjusted when he blamed chance for the acquisition of his illness rather than himself. Furthermore, the sexual orientation of the patient and general attitudes of AIDS patients influenced the providers' willingness to treat an AIDS patient. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Residential relocation during the early adolescent years can make numerous adaptational demands during a developmentally sensitive period. This study was conducted to determine the range and prevalence of adolescent concerns related to relocation; to assess the congruence between adolescent-reported concerns and parental perceptions of the adolescents' concerns; and to examine the relationship between congruence in this specific context and intimacy in the mother-adolescent relationship. Home-based interview and questionnaire sessions were conducted with 71 seventh- and eighth-graders and their parents. All students began the school year in a new school due to an intercommunity change in residence. Responses yielded 11 categories of concerns. The most frequently cited pre-move  worry was \"leaving old friends,\" while the adolescents' biggest struggles in September were \"making new friends\" and \"academic achievement in the new schools.\" The percentage of adolescents and parents reporting each of the 11 types of difficulties was similar, suggesting that the mothers were knowledgeable about problems their teenagers were likely to encounter following relocation. However, mothers frequently failed to recognize some of their adolescent's specific concerns, and often reported concerns that their adolescent did not cite. Other findings suggest that intimacy between mothers and daughters play an important role in accruate maternal identification of their daughters' concerns during the transition. For boys, self-reported intimacy with their mothers seemed to tell little  about accurate maternal identification of concerns. (NB)",

        "description":"The retention of older respondents in a longitudinal study is of important concern to data quality and representativeness of the target population. Participant non-response has been considered a more serious problem among older persons than among younger ones, since dropouts in longitudinal studies of older adults have been reported to be less healthy, more intellectually impaired, and of lower economic status than continuing respondents. There is concern that the sample of the continuing participants might be biased toward the more functional elderly and may lead researchers to underestimate the mental and physical needs of the general population of the aged. In this study, use of a carefully designed refusal conversion protocol at first follow-up in a longitudinal study of a  representative sample of over 4,000 older persons was investigated. Respondents who refused initially did not differ from respondents by age or gender, but were more functionally independent, citing disinterest more frequently as the reason for refusal. The protocol was successful in convincing 43% of these initial refusals to continue participation, but less successful with proxy respondents (27% converted). The findings suggest that most refusals can be converted by telephone at minimal cost, and that it is possible to retain the very old and disabled in longitudinal studies given appropriate field methods.

This study investigated differences between Anglo- and Mexican-American college students on the PSI, controlling for the Mexican-Americans' acculturation level as acculturation has been shown to covary with psychosocial variables. Based on data from 105 Anglo-American and 107 Mexican-American college students, it was found that Anglo-American subjects had lower PSI scores on the Alienation and Defensiveness subscales and higher scores on the  Social Nonconformity and Expression subscales than did Mexican-American subjects. However, when Anglo-Americans were compared with high acculturated Mexican-Americans, differences only on the Alienation subscale persisted between the two ethnic groups, suggesting acculturation level modifies PSI results.

To document industry expenditures and justifications for motor sports sponsorship, trade journals and newsletters (N=25) and other public documents were examined. A research team attended 14 motor sports events sponsored by the beer industry in Northern California over a 6-month period during 1989 to gather evidence of how the events forge a link between fast cars and beer. Finally, using standard focus group methods, more than 60 students from a nearby high school were interviewed about their attendance at motor sports events, and their attitudes toward motor sports, cars  in general, and drinking and driving. Findings showed that of all industry sponsors, brewers were second only to the tobacco industry in amount spent; sports received the largest share of sponsorship dollars; motor sports received the most sponsorship money of all types of sports; the brewing industry spent more than $180 million during 1987 on sports sponsorship; and the annual growth of sponsorship was expected to be triple that of advertising.

Thirty principals, single parents, and experts were interviewed; their opinions suggested questions for a survey that was mailed to principals (N=391) and single parents (N=253). The findings indicated that principals and single parents agreed single-parent children have special needs that affect their performance at school. These special needs included: (1) the need for stability and structure; (2) the need to feel accepted by teachers and peers; (3) the need for parental involvement in academic and non-academic areas; and (4) the need for extra time with adults talking abouth their feelings as they adjust to being members of single-parent families.  Specific school responses to special needs mentioned included better communication between parents and schools; counseling with counselors or social workers or talk with sympathetic teachers; supervised study and recreational time; and cooperation with agencies in provision of services to single-parent families. Specific approaches are needed for single-parent children which address the structure of single-parent families, the role of the school, and home-school communications.

The model entails four interfacing components: (1) steering and development of case management; (2) generic case management functions including accessing and assessing students, advocacy, developing a service plan, brokering services, implementing a service plan, mentoring, and evaluation and tracking; (3) special implementation considerations which pertain to program quality, equity and  comprehensiveness; and (4) a university interdisciplinary team that provides technical assistance, training and other support. Training workshops assist steering groups to plan for interprofessional case management and prepare newly formed school-site teams to develop the basic functions of case management and to develop specialized competencies. Good case evaluation is the basic unit of good program evaluation. The Self-Analysis Checklist, the Monthly Student Progress Update, the Individual Service Plan/Checklist, and Targeted Student's Record are four evaluation instruments used in the evaluation.

The primary aim of the study was to follow the students from the time they entered high school until they left, either by graduation, transferal, or termination. The specific cohort in the study was the 1986-87 sophomore class scheduled to be the graduating class of 1989. Of the student cohort, 55.6% graduated; 22% transferred; and 16.3% dropped out. Males tended to drop out at a higher rate than did females. Students age 17 and 18 tended to graduate while those who were older tended to drop out or seek alternate education, such as adult education. These findings imply not only revisiting retention policies, but emphasizing programs designed to help such students keep up with their peers. The  main reasons cited for dropping out were related to non-attendance. Female and Hispanic students tended to go to adult education rather than drop out. A small percentage of the original cohort was still enrolled in the school system at the end of the study. This finding not only supports the rationale of extending the time frame of the study but also points out that, for some students, the value of a high school diploma is worth remaining in school even though their age peers have left.

The following hypotheses were posed: (1) only children will demonstrate higher degrees of interpersonal trust than firstborn children; (2) only children will show higher degrees of androgyny than firstborns; and (3) female only children will show higher degrees of androgyny than male only children. A demographics questionnaire, the Bem Sex Role Inventory, and the Rotter Interpersonal Trust Scale were administered to 128 undergraduate students. The hypothesis that female only children are more androgynous than male only children received significant statistical support. The hypothesis that only children are more androgynous than  firstborn children was not supported. Additionally, female only children approached significance on being more androgynous than female firstborns. The hypothesis that only children are more trusting than firstborn children did not receive any statistical support. Birth order effects do appear to exist, but in conjunction with gender effects. Female only children were the only group found to vary significantly from other groups on sex role orientation. This group warrants further investigation, especially in terms of their stereotypic feminine behaviors. These women differed significantly because they had high femininity scores, while the other three groups did not. Gender research may need to focus more on the predictive power of stereotypic feminine behavior on personality.  (LLL)",

U.S. subjects expressed significantly greater satisfaction with their housing, income, leisure, jobs, their lives as a whole, and had more optimistic views of their futures than did Japanese subjects. Given the downward trend of the U.S. economy compared  to the relative stability of the Japanese economy, these are particularly interesting findings. However, one must be cautious when comparing personal ratings across cultures. Terms like &quot;satisfaction&quot; may have different meanings in the U.S. and Japan. Also, the difficulty in inferring private beliefs from public statements in Japan must be taken into account in the present results. It might be argued that the Japanese were simply attempting to present themselves as humble about their lives. It appears clear from the present data that personal satisfaction in Japan has not kept pace with the economic achievements of the nation. (LLL)",

        "description":"Each generation of adolescents is exposed to a wider array of stressors and environmental deficits. Use, abuse, and dependence on alcohol and other drugs greatly impairs youths' ability to develop fully, and exacerbates and compounds other biopsychosocial problems. Physiologically, the onset of secondary sex characteristics, the growth spurt, final development of the central nervous system, as well as hormonal, neurotransmitter, and biochemical changes occur during adolescence. Mood altering chemicals alter human physiology including neurotransmitters. Young people who use chemicals also have a more difficult time with psychological tasks, such as individuation, emancipation, and separation. Their relationships with families tend to be marked by conflict and polarized feelings.  Adolescence is also a period of development of a gender role identity or integrating sexual impulses into self concept. Young people who use chemicals are more likely to have difficulty controlling impulses and have high rates of promiscuity and prostitution. Another developmental area common to adolescence is the development of a moral code. Young people who use chemicals tend to become involved in behaviors viewed as anti-social, including theft, selling chemicals, and sexual misadventure. Career choice is another developmental area of concern. Because prospects for well paying jobs are limited as compared to the past, some young people take a fatalistic approach toward their education. The progression of chemical use, risk factors, and an overview of evaluation and intervention  techniques and strategies are presented. (LLL)",

Types of family violence include spouse abuse; elder abuse and neglect; child abuse and neglect; parent abuse; and sibling abuse. There are three types of spouse abuse: physical abuse, sexual violence, and psychological/emotional abuse. These often occur in combination, and although either partner may be the victim, most victims are women. Among the many factors that may contribute to the occurrence of spouse abuse are learned behavior, trial-and-error learning, and substance abuse. Abused and neglected elderly persons are among the most isolated victims of family violence. They are maltreated by their spouses, adult children, or other relatives. There are four types  of elder abuse: physical, psychological/emotional, material exploitation, and violation of rights. Causes of elder abuse range from seemingly deliberate abuse of older persons by spouses and adult children, to unintentional cases of neglect related to the frailty of the older person, to the pressures that can result from caregiving. There are four types of child maltreatment: physical abuse, neglect, sexual abuse, and mental injury. Although any of the types of child maltreatment may be found alone, one often finds them occurring in combination. Parent and sibling abuse; the effects of family violence; and federal, state, and local response to family violence are discussed. (LLL)",

A questionnaire covering test use patterns, test administration, selection and interpretation practices, and acquaintance with test use guidelines was completed by 672 counselors. Counselors adhered to many important test use guidelines. When selecting tests, most read test manuals or publisher's information. When administering tests, most explained the reason for giving the test, and how the results would be used. When interpreting tests, most of those surveyed said they seldom or never use a  test in a way not specified in the manual. In interpreting test results, many reported reading the manual to find out the limitations of the test. However, many counselors reported no efforts to modify test administration procedures to allow for differences for minority and disabled individuals. Counselors' use of computer-generated test interpretations also raises some concerns. This is a relatively new aspect of test use and many counselors are uncertain about how to proceed. A final area of concern comes from the tendency of some counselors to use test scores alone in decision-making rather than seeking out other information to provide a more complete picture of the individual.

        "description":"Research has shown that for teachers, job satisfaction is related more to intrinsic rewards than to the external conditions of their employment. However, the coping strategies for teachers' stress and recommendations for reforms in education address the teachers' external environment and offer extrinsic rewards. Positive mental health variables such as positive affect, dispositional optimism, and self-esteem have been shown to be related to intrinsic motivation, coping with unavoidable stress, and increased job involvement. Positive affect is related to extraversion, satisfaction, and subjective well-being. Individuals high in positive affect tend to form positive impressions of others and to make positive judgments about others. For individuals high in positive affect, increases  in stress do not necessarily diminish feelings of energy, excitement, and enthusiasm. Dispositional optimism promotes problem focused coping and the seeking of social support, which buffers the effects of stress. Teachers high in self-esteem have high aspirations and expectations for themselves and their students. Some researchers feel that high levels of self-esteem are a basic requirement for effective teaching. Recent studies revealed that self-esteem provides an internal source that helps the individual cope with stress, and suggests that the life affirming constructs can be developed and enhanced in individuals.

        "description":"This investigation revives direct impact explanations of single-parent effects on student performance by further disagreggation by sex of the student. The effect of living in a single-parent household on the standardized test scores of students was estimated separately for males and females through analyses of data from the High School and Beyond national survey. Results showed that most of the negative effect of mother-absence continued to be absorbed by the introduction of the additional independent variables; however, in cases involving father-absence, the introduction of the control variables left the direct effect of father-absence with a positive coeffiecient, in some cases highly significant. Additionally, it was found that the science test scores of girls and the  vocabulary test scores of boys tended to &quot;benefit&quot; most from the direct impact of father-absence. It appears that higher science scores for girls may be accounted for by traditional sex-role stereotypes being least reinforced for girls living with their mothers as contrasted to girls living with their fathers or two parents. Surprisingly, the effect of economic variables contributed very little to these regressions. Taken together, these findings contribute additional documentation of how living with one parent is associated with student outcomes. Of equal importance, this research yields a fuller understanding of those conditions which are virtually unaffected by living with one parent. (Author/LLL)",

However, a product called crack cocaine may come as an opaque crystal similar in size and shape to rock salt. A third form of cocaine is known as coca paste, which is an intermediate step in the production of cocaine. Cocaine is highly water and fat soluble and, therefore, it is readily absorbed and distributed throughout the body. Route of administration seems to be more important in determining cocaine's absorption rather than dose. It is believed that cocaine produces such a powerful and rapid dependency because it directly stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain responsible for the reinforcing  properties of food, water and sex. Intranasal users do not seem to be as prone to addiction in the classic sense of the term as are those who smoke cocaine. However, they may develop a very rapid and profound psychological dependence on the drug which is just as intense as addiction to opiates or alcohol. Any user, regardless of the intensity of the use or the route of administration, is at risk of developing a problem with cocaine which may require treatment. Evaluation of cocaine abuse treatment has been sparse and no consensus exists regarding optimal treatment strategies. (LLL)",

Many times \"good\" questions are seen as the property of the teacher or the textbook. Real questions (often charged with personal energy) retain for the students a sense of ownership. Maintaining the spark while widening the scope of the question can sometimes change a real question into a good question that is still real, still infused with ownership. Both good and real questions are scaffolded through the use of reading response logs and Book Groups in which students write a book review and then field questions from their classmates.  In this manner, students are given several opportunities to reflect on work they have completed and then ask questions and make comments about their work with one another. (RS)",

Data concerning post-secondary enrollment patterns, curriculum, planning, and remedial and developmental studies were gathered from a number of sources. Extensive results included the following: (1) statewide, 77% of public high school juniors planned to enroll in some type of post-secondary institution immediately after high school; (2) state high school graduation requirements fall far below the preparation that most four-year Minnesota colleges expect but that only the University of Minnesota and some liberal arts colleges require; (3) students' opportunities for post-secondary planning depend on the  secondary schools in which they are enrolled; (4) just over 15% of all community college students in a year are enrolled in courses that community colleges term remedial/developmental; and (5) many students, including some who had opportunities, are attending college without sufficient preparation to do the work required there. (Five tables, eight figures, and three maps of data are included; five maps of post-secondary system attendance rates by school district and an appendix containing remedial/developmental course descriptions of the state university system are attached.)

        "description":"Evidence from children's performance in a variety of tasks suggests a change in the kinds of similarities children notice and use. Children tend to focus on literal similarity and then shift to the use of common objects, followed by common relations between objects, and finally relations between relations. Research from a variety of different domains and tasks supports this &quot;career of similarity,&quot; and the shift in similarity use appears to be learning based, not maturational, since it occurs at different ages in different domains. Finally, it seems that two processes act to change the representations within a domain so that relations come to be represented more uniformly within the domain. These processes are: (1) carrying out other similarity comparisons in which the alignment  of two representations promotes further commonalities; and (2) learning and applying relational labels.

The paper points out that from a theoretical point of view advocates of literature-based reading instruction draw upon the whole language philosophy, psycholinguistics, and cognitive psychology. It notes that proponents of literature-based reading instruction propose that reading should develop naturally and functionally. The paper concludes that instruction should be guided by the needs and interests of learners, beginning with real literature and meaningful print rather than with fragmented language or language constructed for instructional purposes. Although varied studies are  reported that support a holistic literature-based approach to reading instruction, the paper suggests that more studies are needed relative to the implementation of literature-based reading programs.

Subjects, about 300 students in three classes from each of the three levels of Swedish comprehensive schools (grades one through three, four through six, and seven through nine), learned how to read and developed their reading skills over a two-year period by making use of a daily supply of three of Stockholm's major newspapers as their only reading texts. Results from the experimental group were compared to the results from 7,515 pupils in grades one through nine who had received analytic reading instruction but who used conventional reading materials.  Results indicated that: (1) the newspaper group underwent a better and faster development so that by the end of the study's second year, the second grade subjects were reading at a level 2 to 2.5 years above grade level; (2) students demonstrated a genuine interest in reading; (3) most medium and some poor readers mustered a good enough preunderstanding to allow for the genesis of an inner dialogue between the reading child and his/her own reactions to the text; (4) subjects divided their time between skimming and reading in-depth; (5) younger children showed a faster reading development than did older children who seemed hampered by their earlier training in the conventional methods of being taught to read; (6) at no level did the main results appear until teachers understood the real  essence of the program; (7) subjects increased their spelling ability and wrote better essays; and (8) parents demonstrated new and genuine interest in their children's schoolwork.

        "description":"In the course of a longitudinal study that addressed the questions of how children learn to comprehend what they read and how they learn science concepts, many other research questions emerged. The original longitudinal study investigated how children learn to comprehend what they read. Three school districts with fairly stable student populations, reputations for overall high student achievement, and a willingness to commit fully to the 6-year project, participated in the study. Analysis was completed on two cohorts of children (approximately 625 students) assigned to about 40 teachers. Fourteen different research questions emerged in the kindergarten through second-grade work. Among the surprising answers to these questions are the following: (1) the length of the school day  did not predict kindergarten children's school achievement; (2) individual teachers' behaviors were quite stable both from morning to afternoon and from year to year; (3) whole-class reading instruction produced the greatest gains in student achievement in reading; (4) teachers' instructional practices mediated children's performance on criterion-referenced measures; and (5) elementary-grade science textbooks were quite considerate to students.

        "description":"A study used a primed lexical decision task to explore readers' use of &quot;onset&quot; and &quot;rime&quot; units in processing words. Onset segments include the initial consonant or consonant cluster of a syllable, while rime segments consist of the pronounced vowel group and any final consonants. Subjects were 32 fifth graders and 27 college students. Words or word fragments having three relationships to the targets (matching the initial consonants and the vowels, matching the &quot;rime,&quot; or unrelated) were used to prime word and nonword targets. Results indicated that: (1) in adults, fragments matching the &quot;rime&quot; facilitated processing while word primes that matched the target in any way interfered with processing; (2) fifth graders showed a similar pattern of facilitation for &quot;rime&quot; fragments but  not for &quot;rime&quot; matching words; and (3) fifth graders showed facilitation for word fragments that matched the initial consonants and vowels. Findings suggest that for adults the &quot;onset&quot;/&quot;rime&quot; division is a natural one used in reading and that facilitation from &quot;rime&quot; fragment primes was not caused by a lexical analogy mechanism. Findings also suggest that fifth graders were using units smaller than the &quot;onset&quot; and &quot;rime&quot; or that they are inconsistent in their division of the syllable into subunits.

        "author":["Hollingsworth, Sandra",
          "And Others"],
        "description":"A case study showed how a third-year teacher modified the socialized culture of literature-based literacy instruction she found in her second-grade classroom and teacher education program to reach particular children who were having difficulty learning to read and write. Aaron, the subject of the case study, was a second-grade African-American student who could neither read nor write at the beginning of the study. At the start of the school year, the teacher incorporated a program for systematic, whole-class phonics/spelling instruction. She insisted that the children take responsibility for their own learning, for sharing their knowledge with others in cooperative tasks, for resolving conflicts, and for organizing and helping her run the classroom. Still, Aaron's &quot;voice&quot; could  not be heard in the classroom. As a result of discussion with peers, the teacher included supplemental systematic instruction in linguistic analyses and phonemic awareness, in groups small enough to command teacher attention to individual children. At the end of the year, Aaron was promoted to the third grade, saw himself as successful, was anxious to tackle new material, felt his depression lifted, experienced less conflictive situations with his peers, and was able to read and write full, large letters and stories. Findings suggest that, regardless of socialized norms, the ethics of teaching require providing all children with the means of accessing literature independently.

A patterns philosophy should be emphasized for learners who might benefit from structure and order in studying words, sentences, and paragraphs. A library book's philosophy should be utilized where learners desire holism and benefit from reading entire stories and poems. Diacritical marking systems philosophies may be emphasized in initial reading instruction for those who need  guidance to deal with irregular spelling of words, such as irregularity in silent letters, combinations of letters making a single sound, and/or long vowel sounds. The use of special alphabet systems, such as the Initial Teaching Alphabet (ITA), in teaching reading is not recommended.

In a study, all of the fiction and poetry of three of the children were gathered, as were teachers' descriptive records and examples of the children's drawings. It can be concluded from a study of the randomly selected children that young writers express their personal perspectives and concerns in their writing. It is necessary for a teacher or researcher to read a child's story in the context of the child's other writing, and his or her whole school life. No work of art, fiction, poetry, or personal narrative is created in a vacuum. It seems entirely inappropriate to present a single story and discuss it in isolation from the author's life and other works. The  knowledge gained through careful reading of children's fiction and poetry can be useful to classroom teachers. Such works are both aesthetic and expressive, and show the child's style of interacting with the world. Teachers can learn more about students by: (1) encouraging their imaginings; (2) maintaining observational journals; (3) maintaining student portfolios; (4) adapting curricula and expectations; and (5) publishing student fiction. More research should be conducted into the meanings children create in their fiction and poetry. (Three illustrations are included.) (SG)",

        "author":["Widdicombe, Richard Toby"],
        "description":"Measuring the effects of computer-managed instruction (CMI) on the teaching of and student writing about literature involves more than having students write and then evaluating their performance. Measurement is made difficult by the fact that the computer technology used in instruction is in a state of flux. Variation of computer technology, whether in the form of the operating system, platform, or instructional software, is profitable for its designers. The use of computers in literature instruction can mean: (1) greater creativity, because instruction is freed from the two-dimensional text; (2) more interconnectivity to the text, as a result of greater accessibility; (3) closer analysis of the text, as the mechanics of textual analysis are simpler; and (4) greater fluency in  the manipulation of symbols. Many different types of assessment can be applied over a period of years. Teachers can use &quot;process logs&quot; to track student interaction with literature and the new technology. The &quot;blind&quot; reading of student essays can be replaced by a consensual assessment model, by which multiple scorers/readers assess a given essay simultaneously and anonymously. Among the dangers of CMI are that the technology will overshadow the writing and that the system will aggravate the inability of many students to concentrate. (SG)",

        "description":"Much revisionist scholarship has focused on sophistic epistemology and its relationship to the current revival of epistemic rhetoric in the academy. However, few scholars have recognized the sensuous substance of words as sounds, and the role it played in sophistic philosophy and rhetoric. Before the invention of the Greek alphabet, poetry was central to Greek education and culture. Rhythm and meter served to fix knowledge in the memory through its pleasurable affiliation with music and the somatic response of motor reflexes. The orality of speech, not the visuality of text was the ontological basis of the sophistic philosophy of knowledge. Gorgias, like many sophists, rejected the Platonic realm of ideal Forms, in favor of a view of knowledge based upon speech. For Gorgias,  there was no necessary correspondence between language and reality, so valid contradictory statements about phenomena were possible. It was the unity of thought and language, though uncertain, that made knowledge possible. Cicero, like the sophists, saw language and thought as inextricably bound. He further conceived of oratory style and delivery in terms of music. The ancient Greeks recognized hearing as the most emotional of the senses. Today, some scholars see a connection between emotion, thought, and language, and it is held that this connection has implications for the teaching of writing. (Twenty-two references are attached.)

As a student she learned, over time, to do more writing in class, rather than in solitude. Time, topic, and structure limits came to be seen as liberating. The writing course encompassed not only conferences and full-class workshops, but reading groups, writing groups, a research project, oral presentations, debate, student-led exercises, responses to conferences, responses to groups, responses to collaborative projects, and double-entry journals. While one instructor developed the research project more fully, others worked to incorporate more reading into their classes. The faculty realized that while students had free choice regarding writing topics,  readings were assigned. From then on, students were allowed to select readings and share them with the class. They also wrote five pages per week. The department community respects good writing and good teaching, so there is room for growth. (SG)",

        "description":"A college educator (trained in composition) encountered some problems when he began teaching an introductory literature course. In the first year of the course, he used a fiction anthology as his textbook. The class examined one story at a time, and attempts to compare readings seemed forced. The teacher realized that anthologies are narrow in scope, including few women writers, African-American writers, experimental writers, etc., and usually only contain one or two pieces by each author. Eventually, the instructor began to use single author collections. While students could then explore fewer cultures and historical periods, they could examine each author more deeply and with more context. Using stories that were less familiar than those commonly found in anthologies allowed  the teacher to imagine student questions more easily and to have more meaningful dialogue with students. The reading of single-author collections enabled students to make connections between works of the same author. Students also become more able to describe relationships between authors. If educators want students to continue reading, more interesting, challenging, and vital issues of literary study must be introduced. Teachers must reconsider the kinds of texts that are typically used in introductory literature courses. (SG)",

In the first section, the multigenre research paper is defined as a work that combines poems, monologues, character sketches, photographs, drawings, songs, newspaper interviews, narratives, stream-of-consciousness, and fiction generated from biographical fact. In addition, the paper asserts that a multigenre research paper not only allows the student to become a better writer, but illuminates for both the teacher and student the processes of thinking, writing, and learning. The second, third and fourth sections of the paper discuss the way  portfolios can be used as a vital component in learning, and describe how this student compiled a portfolio that contained a sampling of writing representing her process of creation, her best work, her near misses or unsatisfactory pieces, and a portfolio cover letter explaining the meaning of these artifacts. The fifth section of the paper illustrates how a final interview allowed the student to reflect further, so that the teacher could learn about the student's learning, and the student could learn about her own learning process. The final sections discuss the importance of projects, and offer more evaluation of projects, portfolios, and teacher support of student learning. (Twenty-nine references are included.) (PRA)",

Writing instructors should use images and metaphors to help students heighten their perception of themselves as organizers, to assist them in getting from one place to another within their material, and to offer analogies for the shape of the texts which emerge. In addition, it is important to encourage students to freely cut and paste ideas, to restructure sentences rather than to stay bound to an original thought or form. Instructors should give students a guided, hands-on tour of the rhetorical kitchen, demonstrating the value of some standard forms, and allowing time for practice with them. If students are taught that they are already strategists in everyday life, they can  learn to create their own analogies for catching readers' attention, for linking ideas, for reaching rhetorical destinations.

        "description":"A study examined the basic patterns of oral discourse in five lower-track, high school English classrooms, and the purposes driving the activity from teachers' and students' perspectives. Five experienced literature teacher-researchers each studied one teacher as that teacher taught an instructional unit on literary text. Results showed that: (1) teachers dominated the discussions; (2) teachers used their turns largely to inform, question, and respond; (3) the kinds of informative remarks made by students reflected almost exactly the kinds of questions their teachers asked them; and (4) teachers responded to their students' contributions most often by restating what had been said. Students in lower-track classrooms seemed to require more supportive information and response from  their teachers than students in non lower-track classrooms. These results suggest that teachers should do more to involve their students in classroom talk, but that the problems and patterns observed were actually due to larger social and cultural forces that seemed to resist teachers' strategies and theories. Results showed that a teacher's challenge is to remember that school is only part of a larger culture, and that the larger culture will always find a way to enter the classrooms.

        "description":"After establishing a theoretical depiction of the domain of literature learning, a study developed test packages which examined: (1) the relationship among multiple choice, short open-ended, and long open-ended responses; (2) whether there would be differences according to the genres; (3) the relationship between literary and non-literary texts, both with respect to practice and with respect to aesthetic judgment; and (4) the concern about the scoring of open-ended responses, and whether the quality of writing could be distinguished from the quality of the understanding of the text. Tests were administered to a sample of tenth, eleventh, and twelfth graders in New York State. Results tended to validate the model that knowledge, practice, and preference are related but not highly  interrelated aspects of the construct of literature learning, and that a comprehensive measure of student performance should address each of these three areas. It appears that within the knowledge domain, textual knowledge and knowledge of critical terms are distinct, particularly in their relationship to the practice of reading and responding. Within the domain of practice, more than one passage is needed to get some estimate of a student's performance across text-types. It seems to make little difference whether open-ended or multiple choice questions are used, but open-ended questions probably present somewhat more of a challenge to students than do multiple choice questions.

        "description":"Assessors of literature learning have long been concerned with the issue of difficulty and the fundamental contradictions in the term &quot;examination of literary understanding.&quot; An alternate view of literature is that although texts are finally indeterminate, a group of them has been set aside by communities as forming a part of the communal experience. Communities have selected them to be read aesthetically, and so the texts have developed a set of associations with each other. Subsequent writers acculturated into this &quot;tradition&quot; produce texts which are highly allusive to this communal set of literature. Literature curriculum, therefore, has the function of bringing the individual into the community, and appears to be aimed at providing the student with the requisite knowledge of  the communal canon, as well as with the ways of reading that preserve the appropriate view of the functions of texts in the community. It follows that the difficulty of text is only partially determined by various characteristics of the text itself. A text's difficulty actually depends on the nature of the understanding expected. From this revised view of the curriculum in literature and of difficulty, those concerned with assessment can derive a set of principles by which to select texts, questions concerning texts, and criteria for judging answers to the questions.

        "description":"The notion of literature's difficulty must have begun with its first interpreter. Biblical readings sometimes allegorized scripture into moral precept, while occult readings (i.e., Gnostic writings) often carried an implication that such texts are either for an elite readership or represent the essence of a tradition of spiritual truth under threat of extinction by modern materialism and science. The difficulty of difficulty is not that it is difficult, but that people do not face difficulty soon enough. Two problems arise as a result. First, the opportunity to take advantage of the fascination of difficulty itself is lost, and second, to put off difficulty is to increase difficulty in the same way that the difficulty of learning a foreign language is increased immeasurably when  delayed past the earliest grades. In reading, it is beneficial to offer students a puzzle, and engage them in the dialectic of convention and variation or revolt. Extreme texts, not at the periphery but in the center, and therefore strange, are actually quite useful for this endeavor. Students need to come to understand that to read a text is never a terminal event like the placement of the last jigsaw piece. To learn this and be able to live with it and be satisfied with it is itself a solution. With literature, the process of reading is more important than the destination.

Ordinary spoken language is the easiest kind to produce and understand, while writing is a relatively new development. On thoughtful inspection, the readability of writing has shown itself to be a complex topic requiring insights from many academic disciplines and research techniques that are still not well developed. It would be wrong to conclude that writing is easiest to process when it is most like ordinary spoken language, or that more easily processed writing is &quot;better&quot; than more difficult language. A comparison of a passage from Henry James'&quot;The Ambassadors&quot; with one from Edith Wharton's &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; serves to illustrate some differences between written and spoken language. For example,  differences in language and culture can hinder a reader's efforts to decipher a written text, as can unclear verbal references, insertion of new information, and negation. A listener's or reader's interest in a piece of language can be heightened through involvement (causing the listener or reader to feel caught up in what is expressed) and detachment (shifting attention from the actor to the object being acted upon). The arrangement and structure of paragraphs affects comprehension. Because writing can serve different purposes, it would be wrong to assign an absolute scale of values to the features that affect message processing. (Nineteen references are attached.) (SG)",

        "description":"American education has long equated reading with the narrower notion of literacy. Such an approach bypasses the concept of &quot;difficulty,&quot; or the placing of ideas into question. The educational system has resisted adoption of a broader view of reading, because: (1) anything difficult is viewed as elitist and undemocratic; and (2) the concept of &quot;difficulty&quot; arises from such &quot;alien&quot; disciplines as philosophy and psychoanalysis. The idea of reading as an interpretive activity removes the interdisciplinary boundaries. Poetry, for example, inhabits a space where logic and clarity do not hold sway, where language opens up strange paths that defy all intellectual classifications and attempts at possession. Radical questioning of the legitimacy of knowledge and the function of the  university has been resisted by both academia and marginalized groups. Problematization, or the bringing of an issue to difficulty, defers solution and closure. Traditional feminist and minority discourse become the representation of the culture, without either &quot;literature&quot; or &quot;culture&quot; being put into question. Newer approaches to criticism reject the possibility of metatheory which classifies the &quot;whole&quot; from a privileged point of view and identifies reading with estrangement and difficulty. If the work of theory is the problematizing of reading, theory stands in opposition to the institution. Theory ultimately puts the institution's role, organization, and relation to knowledge into question. While the sciences fit in well in the academy, the humanities' role is to problematize method  and engage the classroom and the university in difficulty. (Twenty-two references are attached.) (SG)",

Sometimes, however, the emotional impact makes it easier for some readers with some texts to see and understand the meaning of some literary texts. Research from the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) suggests that differences in comprehension between high- and low-achieving students are much less in literature than in reading comprehension. Other studies showing declines in reading comprehension over time do not indicate corresponding declines in results for literature. A student may be aware that a literary work has affected him or her emotionally in some way,  but may not be able to say how. The student's understanding of the text has been achieved through a synthetic, seemingly effortless grasp of the words' impact, rather than through an analytic approach. Studies suggest that despite age, education, and reading experience differences, differing groups of readers have similar abilities to create meanings early in the reading process, and to organize and observe these meanings. But groups differ when asked to describe or interpret literary works. Synthetic and incompletely verbalized understandings run the risk of being overlooked in teaching and in research.

Conceptions of reading have changed from a largely cognitive process of print decoding to a socially situated one of understanding and appropriating a variety of discourse and text conventions. &quot;Difficulty&quot; is the result of the similarity or disparity between the text and the socially imbedded and motivated interpretive processes of particular readers. Students must learn to become comfortable with complexity and ambiguity in the presence of teacher messages that reward simple solutions. The literary &quot;transaction&quot; of reading involves several kinds of understandings: (1) self-understanding; (2) social understanding; (3) literary understanding; and (4) aesthetic  understanding. Literary reading cannot be easily measured or defined, or developed discretely as a set of skills. The interpretive culture created by teachers' questions can stifle the multiple, complex understandings necessary to the literary experience, potentially compounding the difficulty of literary texts. Teachers' questions should guide students as they move toward their own interpretive horizons. In questioning and sharing experience, students and teachers become empowered to embrace the difficulties unique to literary reading. (Forty references are attached.) (SG)",

Each of the three has been involved with pedagogical reforms within French cultural institutions: Derrida with the teaching of philosophy, Lacan with psychoanalytical training, and Barthes with literature teaching. In Barthes' view, reading should not be constrained by literary convention or equated with the consumption of writing, and writing should not be confined to professional writers, teachers, and intellectuals. Lacan applied Freudian principles to communication, and introduced the notion of the text as a chain of signifiers. The &quot;true&quot; meaning of a text, Lacan believed, was to  be found in gaps in the text, which interpretation would fill. To Derrida, there is no non-metaphorical standpoint from which to perceive the order and the demarcation of the metaphorical field. Derrida's deconstruction explodes the opposition of the metaphoric and the proper in a text, so that reading requires a double reading of the text. Barthes concluded that reading could still be taught in the schools, if the function of the institutional codes was clearly identified and the accomplishments of liberal secular schooling was maintained but directed toward deciphering codes.

Data were reexamined for instructional correlates of difficulty of recall and difficulty of depth of understanding. Subjects, 1,041 students in 58 eight-grade English classes in 16 midwestern urban, suburban, and rural schools, took a test consisting of a set of increasingly more probing questions concerning five literature titles they had studied in class that year. Additional data included teacher and student questionnaires concerning instructional practices and student backgrounds, and class observations. Control measures included a brief personal essay and a multiple-choice test and a written response to two brief stories and  one poem from the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The study was also controlled for race, ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, and grade level, since a few schools included seventh-grade students in eighth grade classes. Results indicated that: (1) curriculum and instruction significantly affected the difficulty or ease that students experienced with literature; (2) the absence of frequent, extensive writing was by far the most significant factor in handicapping students' recall and understanding; and (3) different instructional practices potentially complicate literature in different ways.

A promising new metaphor for professional educators is that of teacher as explorer, the leader of an expedition into unfamiliar territory. The image of explorer changes the perspective on teaching goals and roles and frees instructors to consider new alternatives and traditions which promote exciting practices in the classroom. A classroom illustration demonstrates the theoretical underpinnings and practical possibilities of the &quot;explorer&quot; metaphor. In this classroom students first wrote with a partner about a main character in &quot;Dear Mr. Henshaw&quot; to describe what they thought she was like and to jot down questions they had about her. Following that  activity, students reflected independently on the written conversation process, noting what they had learned, questions they still had, and general reactions to the experience. By validating and extending student responses, the teacher can increase their sophistication with language and literature, and make the journey into literature an exploration of life itself.

        "description":"Many treatments of teacher questioning in reading and literature have defined teacher questioning as a cognitive process. Emanating from a reading comprehension perspective, this view of questioning argues that asking a variety of higher level questions will lead students from literal to more inferential levels of text understanding. Approaches to literature teaching based solely on taxonomies or reading levels, however, may not be entirely appropriate for explaining what happens when readers understand and interpret literary, as opposed to non-literary texts. From a sociolinguistic perspective, teachers' questions have also been envisioned as part of a social interaction, in which learning experiences evolve out of the mutual participation of teachers and students. This  perspective can be somewhat limited, however, when it deals only with the surface dimensions of classroom interactions. In order to fully understand the dynamics of their questioning practices, teachers must learn to view them as part of a cultural event, where the very identities of each participant as student, teacher, learner, or interpreter are shaped and defined. In understanding the cognitive, social, and cultural dimensions of the questions they ask, teachers can not only begin to ask more challenging questions of their students, but also begin to challenge the underlying assumptions behind the questions they ask, as well as the very predominance of questioning as an instructional technique.

        "description":"Teaching models, derived from theory and research, are static, and lack responsibility. Models substitute an abstracted notion for teachers. Literature can be viewed as a field of play, where meaning opens, rather than as a body of knowledge. The teacher's challenge consists of posing questions that allow students to formulate their takes on a text, constructing opportunities for students to critically exchange their takes, and posing questions that encourage self-reflexive readings of the offered takes. In one 12-week sequence of assignments, students worked from two short stories and an interview and completed four writing assignments (plus two revisions for each writing assignment). The sequence was designed to let students share interpretations from challenging readings and  take a critical stance towards the readings and interpretations. Some examples from the students' writings show their struggles with their close readings. The use of multiple texts and assignments allows students to posit meaning in a continuous but bounded field of play. By contrast, teaching models treat knowledge as objects rather than discursive practices, and turn discussions of theory and practice into debates over which is the right or true pedagogical model.

        "description":"The reading of a literary work can give rise to five different kinds of literary knowing: (1) knowing about self; (2) knowing about others; (3) knowing about texts; (4) knowing about contexts; and (5) knowing about processes of making meaning. A literary work can prompt a reader to reflect upon aspects of his or her own life. Concentrating upon individual responses to texts allows students to see and learn from similarities and differences among classmates. A text also provides an opportunity for taking pleasure in the writer's artistry. Making meaning depends in part upon the context in which the reader and the text come together. Students can learn something about their own processes of making meaning from texts. Journals and reading logs can be designed to initiate exchanges  between students as to how text readings can differ. Such approaches suggest that the expository, analytical essay is not to be over-emphasized. Other genres can also be suitable for the classroom. There should be a correlation between what students go through as they grow up and what great writers have written about. It may be possible to find organizing principles in the transactions between writer and text. The next step is to redesign the curriculum into a structure that respects the uniqueness of the reader.

English faculty at Missouri Western State College conducted a composition assessment project in which they used timed holistically scored writing as a means of placing students. Results were overwhelmingly negative. After three years of using the Writing Placement Exam (WPE), however, valuable modifications have been made, including streamlining the administration of the WPE. It has been argued that the greater the consequences of error in assessment, the greater the responsibility of assessors to be humane, fair, and effective. With this in mind, great caution must be exercised when viewing  holistically scored timed writing as a curriculum evaluation tool. Timed holistically scored writing shows the greatest promise as a placement instrument. If used wisely, it could produce benefits for faculty, students and education that outweigh the negative aspects. (PRA)",

        "description":"The connection of feminism and ecology into ecofeminism has important congruencies with the teaching of writing and literacy, creating an important web of influence between language, politics, and planet. The four central claims of ecofeminism are: (1) there is a connection between the exploitation of the environment and the exploitation of women; (2) the reason for the connection of ecology and feminism is the objectification of nature and women; (3) science and technology are a tool of patriarchal dominance; and (4) nature and women must be revalued. Parallels to ecofeminism are suggested in the writing workshop classroom, where peer groups respond to drafts, the teacher confers with writers, and everyone writes the stories and arguments important to them. Recent theoretical  understandings of text and readers/writers have moved in a direction congruent with ecofeminism, as recent literary theory attempts to restore subjectivity to its rightful place in the action of reading literature, and sociopsycholinguistics portrays readers and writers as actively making meaning, not taking meaning from some pre-existent objective text. The move in research methodology has been from patriarchal sci-tech to naturalistic and organic designs. Classroom practice also shows parallels to ecofeminism, by forming communities of readers, reading from a non-hierarchical canon, giving students ownership and authorship, and valuing diversity and connectedness.

In the typical 15-week term, the module begins with a four-week look at the traditional rhetorical patterns employed in business communication in the United States. It then moves into a four-week block of rhetorical strategies common to business communication (positive, negative, and persuasive letter and memo writing) in some sample countries. In this manner the business communication international module works back from the surface organization of letters to the cultural assumptions underlying the letters. The formulas for presenting positive, negative, persuasive and mixed information are then seen as  relative to audiences themselves, not as rules that must be followed but as guidelines that must be constantly questioned for applicability within a certain discourse community. The following three weeks are devoted to the formal report, in which students target a cultural group or national group and study aspects of the culture and how they affect business. Finally, in a three-week block, students present the information they have gathered to the class. The international material and assignments are thus presented with the traditional United States material and assignments rather than in isolation. (PRA)",

        "description":"Teachers at both college and pre-college levels have long realized that collaborative writing is an effective learning tool for beginning writers. Many have pointed out that collaboration in writing groups properly shifts the focus from the teacher to the student, and allows writers to take more responsibility for their own composing processes. Such group activity works wonders in giving confidence to beginning writers who don't trust their own voices and want to be told how to write. But collaboration is more than just a heuristic for beginning writers' invention. For mature writers, collaborative writing: (1) functions as a heuristic for discovery both of ideas and of organizing principles; (2) focuses on writing as problem solving; (3) gives writers a sense of audience early  in the process; (4) allows writers to see that finding a voice depends on understanding the social milieu in which they write; (5) allows for editing intervention early in the process; and (6) parallels the way writing is done in the professional world. Collaborative writing's success as demonstrated in six instances of actual practice is the strongest argument for an adjusted view of the subject. Whether or not a strict definition for advanced composition emerges, writing instructors should be aware that collaboration is an essential part of all composing processes, and should be included in classroom exercises.

        "description":"The time has come to re-evaluate the metaphors used when people think about composition. Such a re-evaluation is under way and may affect composition theory, research models, and classroom practice well into the future. Robert Zoellner rejected the prevailing metaphor for teaching writing which equates the act of thinking with the act of writing. Instead, he proposed a metaphor that treats writing as a form of behavior, and developed a pedagogy based on this theoretical model, finding the &quot;rodential&quot; model of the behavioral psychologists consonant with his assumptions. Linda Flower and John Hayes, on the other hand, based their model on cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence research. The cognitive model classifies writing as a type of problem-solving thinking, and so  Flower and Hayes equate writing with thinking. There are a number of reasons for rejecting their metaphor: (1) it is not useful in conducting research, as it defies observation; (2) the think-write metaphor often produces circular reasoning; and (3) treating writing as a type of thinking encourages a simplistic view of signification. The propensity to borrow theories from other disciplines has turned composition studies into a theoretical crazy quilt. For composition studies to become established as a discipline, teachers and researchers must pay more attention to basic theoretical questions, questions about the nature of writing, language, and signification. The first step towards answering these questions lies in rejecting the assumption that writing is thinking, and turning to writing  as signifying act. (PRA)",

The essay the subject finally produced concerning the rhetorical features in a technical engineering paper extended the claim she made at the beginning of the study: the text of the engineering report was devoid of rhetorical nuance--to an outsider it was opaque, and to an insider it was transparent. The subject already had a detailed knowledge of the social context in which the technical paper was written: her problem came in trying to write about her profession to nonspecialists. The subject never took up the rhetorical approach to language advocated by the instructor. What she did do, though, was explore how to  represent her intellectual experience to outsiders. To the extent that students at the sophomore level or higher are &quot;advantaged&quot; writers (demonstrating competence in very limited writing assignments in their major), the advantage of a general writing course is difficult for them to see. It is up to composition teachers to help them find that value, and to do so, teachers need to immerse themselves in students' academic experience, seen from their own point of view, and to entice them to extend their intellectual projects to the point where they confront challenges of literacy.

        "description":"The uncritical acceptance of Plato's treatment of sophistic doctrines (specifically in Plato's dialogue the &quot;Gorgias&quot;) in the university has resulted in an impoverished contemporary view of sophistic rhetoric. Since Socrates' foundational epistemology allows for the knowledge of immutable truth and Gorgias' relativistic epistemology does not, there is a differend between them. Had Plato presented Gorgias' epistemology and methodology accurately, as he does Socrates's, most fourth century B.C. Athenian citizens would have preferred Gorgias' arguments, since democracy depends on the ability to change the opinions of others and the willingness to allow personal own opinions to be changed. For the Athenian citizens to admit to the possibility of perfect knowledge--attainable only  through the Platonic negative dialectic--would require them also to deny the validity of their own democratic power structure. Thus, in order to gain the approval of his democratic Athenian audience at a time when the Athenian democracy was in an unstable condition from struggles against bloody oligarchic tyrannies, Plato was forced to (mis)represent Gorgias' epistemology as allowing for the possibility of certain knowledge. Plato, therefore, creates a Gorgias with a foundational epistemology and an empirical, &quot;doxa&quot;-governed methodology, making Gorgias appear not only irrational, but also absurd. It is important to keep in mind that all of Plato's claims against Gorgias and rhetoric are mere fictions created by Plato for the purpose of controlling the differend between Socrates and  Gorgias.

All selections in all 42 volumes were analyzed to develop a portrait of the content of literature courses as represented by the popular anthology series.

Results indicated that: (1) anthologies have narrowed their focus, presumably to place more emphasis on works of merit; (2) volumes for use in grades 7 through 10 broadened their selections to include a wider representation (though still very small) of works by women and of works from alternative literary traditions; (3)  volumes intended for American or British literature courses remain quite narrow in their representation both of women and nonwhite authors; (4) the instructional apparatus that surrounds the anthology selections was overwhelmingly text and content centered, with little attention paid to the development of students' abilities to think on their own; and (5) there is little connection among the activities that accompany a given selection, indicating an assumption that students build understanding out of individual details, rather than from some cumulative understanding of an evolving text. Findings suggest that while many of the selections seem capable of promoting worthwhile discussion, the instructional apparatus that surrounds the selection does not. (Twenty-seven tables of data are  included; 27 references and a list of the anthology series are appended, as well as lists of the most frequently anthologized poems, short fiction, and overall selections by grade level.)

        "description":"A naturalistic case study, involving a 2-year collaboration between 14 classroom teachers and eight university researchers studying 250 middle and high school students, examined the types of principles underlying effective literature instruction that emphasizes the development of students' reasoning abilities in the context of their understanding of literature. Case study methodology was used, tracing, across one entire school year, the interactions among the participants (teachers and students), the instructional content (the expectations, activities, artifacts, and attitudes), and the ways in which students reacted to and interpreted classroom activities. Findings indicated a number of characteristics common to classrooms which expected the active thought and participation of  each student, including: envisionment-building through discussion and writing; a primary instructional focus on the exploration of possibilities rather than maintaining a point of reference; social contexts which taught students ways to discuss and ways to think about literature; and small group activities in which students could use their new knowledge and strategies on their own. Findings also indicated six principles of instruction that seem to underlie such classrooms: (1) students as active makers of meaning; (2) literature reading as question-generating; (3) student knowledge taps (teachers' questions about content focusing on what the students understood about that content, with no predetermined right answer); (4) class meetings as time to develop understandings; (5) instruction as  scaffolding the process of understanding; and (6) transfer of control from teacher to student.

        "description":"A study analyzed how teachers evaluate and keep track of students' literacy development, particularly as it relates to the reading of literature. Fifty-one teachers from a range of school contexts were interviewed for descriptions of students' literacy development, teachers' knowledge of literature, classroom literacy teaching practice and priorities, and classroom evaluation practice and priorities. Findings indicated that teachers' evaluative descriptions of students' development in literacy differed in sheer quantity of information and in the extent to which their descriptions featured students' knowledge of, and preference in, literature, and the extent of &quot;personal&quot; as opposed to &quot;objective&quot; knowledge. Furthermore, these differences were influenced by the extent of teachers'  knowledge about literature and the conditions under which they taught. In general, elementary school teachers knew more about students than did high school teachers, because of sheer numbers of student charges and time spent with them. However, the descriptions of students' development given by those elementary teachers who were strictly required to use a basal reading program and under heavy threat of accountability testing, did not reflect the extent of the teachers' knowledge of literature. The language of teachers' descriptions also differed depending on whether they were describing a more or less able student. (Author/SR)",

An explanation of the need for and rationale behind an integrated approach is presented first, followed by a series of developmental strategies for moving from a teacher directed to a student initiated method of responding to literature. The article proposes a five-phase instructional process for integrating these strategies, and demonstrates how discussion, guides, and writing fit into the five-phase instructional approach by providing concrete examples drawn from specific literary works.

The intention of the writing teachers was to emphasize the role that invention and planning play in writing, to highlight the social aspect of writing, and to make collaboration more meaningful. Students read three books, wrote four formal papers, and kept a journal. Existing computer technology on the two campuses, while not ideal, proved manageable. Towards the end of the course, students not only reported feeling more comfortable with computers, but attending more to style so that readers could understand their work. They also said that they were rewriting  more, and were feeling more comfortable and fluent as writers. One commonly reported problem, however, was that although the students quickly learned how to send each other messages, the comments were often pedestrian. It is possible that the students were paying more attention to the technology than to the substance, that they missed the non-verbal and verbal signals exchanged in usual class conferences, and that reading from the computer screen tended to emphasize spelling errors rather than organization, use of evidence, and creativity. Ideas for future classes included BITNET and INTERNET connections with students hundreds of miles away or in other countries, as well as collaborations between high school and college students.

The teacher used literature to connect reading and writing in her lessons and conducted individual writing conferences with students. Students kept notebooks of their personal experiences and reflections and then selected from those to turn their writing into a project for a larger audience. Anthony, a middle-class Hispanic boy, had a successful conference with the teacher where they talked about organization and description. He appropriated the classroom dialogue which focused on imagery and figurative language and transformed it to use in his own text about his grandmother and in the writing conference he conducted with a first  grader. In contrast, Anita, a working class, African-American girl, wrote an &quot;oral&quot; narrative that did not match the teacher's conception of good writing. Neither her text nor her conference with a younger student reflected the classroom dialogue. Instead, Anita chose to focus on mechanics and grammar, safe topics with which she felt comfortable. The study raises questions about the teacher's responses to cultural differences and the match between the teacher's images of good writing and those of the students. (Author/SR)",

One possible approach to utilize in the teaching of empathic listening is to begin a general unit on &quot;Communication and Feelings.&quot; In designing such a unit, teachers should use activities which promote students getting in touch with themselves, develop exercises which push students to locate the &quot;feeling source,&quot; and make important points about feelings during these exercises. Teachers should provide students with basic guidelines about the nature of emotions: (1) emotions serve as a monitoring system; (2) locating the feeling  source is helpful in finding solutions; (3) feelings are not good or bad--they just are; (4) feelings are present in all transactions--work on listening for them; (5) the way people think results in feelings; (6) the student should own and trust his/her feelings; (7) the student should report feelings rather than act them out or hold them in; (8) most people need to increase their &quot;feeling word&quot; vocabulary; (9) the student should acknowledge the content and feelings of his or her partner.

The paper first builds a rationale for teaching empathic listening in a communication curriculum, and then discusses some approaches for teaching it which combine theoretical constructs with skill development. The paper explores some theoretical foundations that should be established for any unit, section, or course devoted to empathic listening. Next, the paper examines some implementation procedures which can be used as general guidelines.  Finally, the paper provides a number of suggestions for possible approaches, methods, and exercises, which include using Robert Carkhuff's model, a &quot;communication and feelings&quot; approach, and other approaches and exercises.

Properly prepared poster presentations not only provide an excellent format for communicating innovative ideas or research results, but also allow for individual communication between the presenter(s) and interested individuals. Furthermore, poster session programs allow participants to survey many presentations and focus on those of specific interest. Poster presentations (with their emphasis on modern graphics) do require more time to prepare than traditional paper presentations, however, and are more difficult to transport. Since this format of information exchange can accommodate a number of presenters and a variety of topics, professional organizations are likely to continue using poster sessions  as a part of their professional meetings.

        "description":"Despite widespread calls for moves toward a student-centered instruction and activity, educators have produced few structural models for teaching that empowers learners. Several teaching approaches have been offered that are said to offer socially generative, student-centered learning. Among these is oral history. Because oral history often seeks to include the voices of groups that do not leave documentary records, its subjects can be seen as disenfranchised. Oral history becomes an empowering context for such groups. When oral history work is used as a learning context, the issues of students as researchers and teachers as co-researchers and project directors came into play. The products of oral history are subject to multiple interpretations. Because the interviewer affects  the content of an oral history, the issues involved in conducting research should be included as part of the curriculum in an oral history course. Interviewers must realize that the remembering of oral histories is imperfect and that the researcher's own biases operate heavily. Oral history can empower students, but it can also be a teacher-controlled unit plan. One is critical pedagogy, the other is not. Teachers and researchers must keep such issues in mind when reflecting upon oral history. (Twenty-five references are attached.) (SG)",

        "description":"A study examined the impact on newspaper managers of three emerging technologies: videotex, personal computer networks, and pagination. The study predicted that: (1) the greater the relative advantage and compatibility of a technology, the less likely will the manager need to pursue motivational and controlling measures in getting subordinates to adopt the technology; and (2) the greater the technology's relative advantage and compatibility, the more the newspaper's content will be perceived to have improved. Results showed that: (1) the technology creates managerial, journalistic, environmental and cumulative impacts; (2) technology's varying functions correlate with varying results; (3) the technology-employee-management-environment theoretical quadrangle must be refined; (4)  technology's adoption depends both on its nature and on the management's response and initiative; (5) the concept of motivation must be researched further; (6) relative advantage and compatibility, when combined, seem to act as a type of regulatory mechanism in the area of control, whether it be operational or editorial; (7) technology changes the nature of work for the manager, and the editor's approach in dealing with certain issues, but does not always change organizational priorities; (8) technology forces editors to become more adept at motivational strategies, and to become better intermediate-range planners; (9) technology has no adverse effect on editor-reporter or editor-copy editor relations, gives greater control over some aspects of the product, and makes the editor a better  recruiter; (10) managers need to become more flexible; and (11) managers viewed the technology as a technical rather than a sociological concern. Studies like these at the intersection of journalism and newspaper management are on the cutting edge of journalism education.

Examining its comprehensive offerings (Master of Arts in Media Studies, Certificate in Film  Production, the On-Line Program, Adult Education Course Offerings, and Special Events) demonstrates that the department needs: (1) to offer curricula, events, and programs which foster an understanding of the dynamics of human communication in the development and transformation of the culture in which they live, and in the cultures of others with whom they come into contact; (2) to provide an aid to analyzing the role of contemporary mass media through comprehension of the history, ethics, and political economy of the media industries; and (3) to train students in general (communication) and specific (vocational) skills which may lead to further education, to promotion and/or advancement within the media industries.

Results indicated that while the students expressed changes in their communication skills and comprehension of a course topic as a result of their class participation, their perceived participation in class discussions was  related significantly to communication apprehension. The teacher's interactional style and the structured course exercises had no significant impact on class participation. Findings suggest the importance of communication apprehension in the college classroom environment, but do not clearly reveal the roles of the teacher and the course structure.

        "description":"What is the value and what are the consequences of students gaining access to &quot;critical&quot; academic discourses about the media? Ideally, the acquisition of an academic discourse should make it possible for students to reflect on their own experience in a systematic and rigorous way. Nevertheless, a critical discourse about the media may sanction a rationalistic approach to popular culture, which fails to engage with children's subcultural experiences and their emotional engagement with the media. It may result in a superficial irony, or indeed a contempt for popular pleasures, which is merely complacent. In Great Britain, the implications of this debate in terms of developing a critical pedagogy in media education remain to be explored. The Vygotskyan perspective may offer a  productive alternative to the rather sterile opposition between advocates of progressive and conservative approaches to critical pedagogy. While acknowledging the central importance of children's existing knowledge and the need for active learning, it also stresses the necessity of students acquiring and participating in dominant academic discourses. While it is true that giving children access to privileged discourses is vital, it is equally important that they should learn to interrogate them. The claim that academic discourse is inherently scientific and thus superior to the ideology of popular discourse must be open to question. The concepts and methods of analysis that teachers introduce to students must be seen, not as neutral tools for the acquisition of knowledge, but as  themselves ideological.

This can be illustrated by a case study in which a commercial metals company was wrongly accused of improperly disposing of toxic waste at a particular site. To counter the bad publicity that followed the accusation and the investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the company worked with a public relations firm in a process of inquiry to locate and define the problem, discover its extent, and define possible solutions. They then sent press releases that indicated no wrongdoing and that the company fully intended to defend that position to the local and national press. On the heels of the news release an advertisement was  placed in the local paper which addressed several questions of inquiry in an open and honest manner. The ad focused on the nature and extent of the problem while allowing the reader to explore the problem with the company, and while pledging honesty, cooperation, and environmentally safe action. As a result of the ad much of the news coverage became more favorable toward the company, the local Chamber of Commerce came to their aid, and business returned to levels approaching normal. Later, a jury cleared the company of wrongdoing. This case provides students with an opportunity to see questions of inquiry eliminating hundreds of needless contentions before corporate advocacy began. It also illustrates that it is time to re-establish inquiry as an inherent part of argumentation.  (PRA)",

        "description":"There are two categories of children's television in Kenya: television &quot;for&quot; children, most of which is imported, and television &quot;by&quot; children, all of which is produced in Kenya. Most of the television by children is produced and broadcast by Voice of Kenya television, much of it made up of programs growing out of extra-curricular activities at primary and secondary schools, where students put together programs of songs, poetry, recitation, riddles, skits, and plays, often dealing with contemporary issues. In the process of putting together such shows, children: (1) learned their nation's history from the legends and stories gathered from their elders; (2) discussed contemporary problems and considered how to handle them; (3) learned how to express themselves; (4) practiced  English and Swahili, languages studied in school, but not necessarily spoken at home; and (5) learned that a successful project requires individual responsibility and group cooperation. In addition, the programming helped to build a national culture as children of different ethnic backgrounds could learn that they spoke a common language and shared common aspirations. Centralized production facilities and lack of equipment and transportation meant that programs tended to reflect the interests of urban, rather than rural, youth. It would be interesting to find out how widespread the phenomenon of television by children is, and whether it is typically found in association with particular kinds of political ideology or economic circumstances. In addition, researchers could explore the  relationship between television by children and dominant national ideologies, to see whether the material reinforces or challenges dominant attitudes and values.

Human resource executives surveyed in 1990 were concerned about (1) the ability to motivate diverse groups of employees; (2) differences in values and cultural norms among employees; and (3) the challenge of communicating when employees speak different languages and have different cultural assumptions. At the present, time organizations attempt to fit everyone who enters the workforce into a preexisting vision of corporate culture. A multicultural organizational discourse would invite everyone to participate in the dialogue in their genuine voices.  Conceputalizing and creating such a discourse, however, is not easy. In conversations between privileged and non-privileged participants, the privileged voices dominate the discourse. Resisting privileged discourse, however, is a necessary prerequisite to creating harmonic discourse. White male discourse needs to move out of the center of the conversation. Once people learn ways to resist privilege, either asserting their own or allowing others to assert theirs, pragmatic considerations will force the creation of harmonic discourse, a discourse in which all voices retain their individual integrity yet combine to form a whole discourse that is orderly and congruous, in much the same way that musicians create harmony through the combination of simultaneous notes to form chords.

The key question is whether the imposition of court mandated speech forces those convicted of a crime to spread an ideological message against their will, contrary to the free speech rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Several instances from around the United States demonstrate how court mandated speech has been used in drunken driving sentences. Examination of preliminary court decisions shows that societal interest takes priority over individual speech rights,  and court mandated &quot;punitive speech&quot; has been established as a precedent. There may be potential dangers, however, in this judicial precedent in terms of the erosion of free speech rights.

Conducted in May-June 1990, the study received 48 responses from 33 institutions (a 72% return rate). Extensive results included that: (1) of approximately 600 full-time staff teaching Communication Studies, 68% are male and 32% are female; (2) over 26,000 undergraduate students are studying in the field, with most (76%) taking Bachelor of Arts courses; (3) there are more than 1400 postgraduate students with 64% undertaking a graduate diploma; and (4) student numbers have increased substantially since 1988, particularly at postgraduate levels. Further, more than 50 subjects were identified as being located within  Communication Studies, and were arranged into seven major subject categories for more detailed analysis. Findings suggest that Communication Studies in Australia is a large and rapidly expanding field of study in terms of student numbers and institutions offering courses, with a wide variety of subject areas offered, high student demand for courses, and a potential oversupply of graduates in certain areas, such as journalism.

This approach has allowed the professional industry to operate for too long under three gross and inaccurate assumptions: (1) that educators have little sense of what best prepares students for the industry; (2) that higher education is responsible for generating their entry-level job pool; and (3) that trade skills and vocational training are parts of the university's mission. Mass communication educators must quickly and convincingly deal with these misdirections, and establish clear reasoning for a new agenda for the mass communication discipline in the academy. The politics  and finances of today's university may be the catalyst for media education to establish its position where it rightfully belongs anyway: in the liberal arts. Media courses should be designed to contribute to a student's ability to express ideas in speaking and writing, to reason, to organize, and to have a wider understanding of society. Viable for major and non-majors, courses should focus on the &quot;why&quot; of media processes, rather than on the &quot;how to.&quot; To implement the redirection of media study, the discipline must redefine its educational objectives in structure and curriculum, and in faculty hiring. Beyond the department, professionals can provide their real world expertise to students through a variety of non-classroom avenues that can generate potential practitioners. (PRA)",

First, the paper provides a historical perspective on how people's theater evolved in Europe and the United States. The paper then investigates the rise of people's theater in such Latin American countries as Nicaragua and Mexico, and in the Asian nations of the Philippines and India. A theoretical framework for the role of people's theater in social change is developed in the paper, using A. Gramsci's idea of subalternity, P. Freire's concept of &quot;conscientization&quot;, J. L. Moreno's notion of &quot;socio-drama,&quot; and A. Boal's concept of &quot;poetics of the oppressed.&quot; The paper provides theoretical signposts to serve at nodal points for further scholarly  discussion and study on people's theater.

        "description":"Message processing literature could conceptualize process in one of two distinct ways: a single over-time process as described by J. N. Cappella, versus several processes as described by D. K. Berlo. An examination of literature finds that theories are based on both forms of these over-time processes. However, operationalization rarely measures either type of process over time. That is, process approaches are more common in theory than in measurement. A breakdown of the dimensions of time appropriate to over-time research yields five specific dimensions: (1) the time-frame of the study; (2) the time-lag over which effects are measured; (3) the duration of the independent variable; (4) the duration of the dependent variable; and (5) the effect span. In order to improve scholarly  research attempts at exploring over-time processes, the two distinct theories of process should be carefully considered, and these time-based dimensions should be carefully used.

One school from each of the following states--Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana--participated in the project. Extreme diversity characterized the schools in terms of population density, minority populations, climate and topography, natural resources, and economies. Quantitative data analysis examined reading, mathematics, and language arts test scores. Qualitative analysis developed contextual indicators, or criteria for improvement, unique to each school. Each school developed its own set of contextual indicators and demonstrated significant changes in school climate.  Three schools reported significant improvements in test scores. Findings indicate that two sets of school improvement standards exist: universal ones for student achievement outcomes and those unique to a school's goals and objectives. Recommendations are made for the consideration of the whole school context in assessing school effectiveness and for measuring school improvement in a variety of ways. Four tables are included.

New methods are suggested that involve the whole community in defining and improving the system to ensure greater student success. Section 1 is a philosophical framework that reviews previous publications; considers the cultural misalignment between the community, the home, and the school; examines the failure of past reforms; and discusses shifts in the  paradigms that shape the organizational structure of schools. Section 2 presents the practical application of the process and also contains an illustration of a new decision-making paradigm in action with examples from a gorup of Texas educators. The workbook included at the end of this section suggests one possible strategy for changing the system based on community beliefs and values.

Chapter 2, &quot;Elements of School Effectiveness,&quot; maintains that culture is a major factor when examining the characteristics of effective schools.  Chapter 3, &quot;New Perspectives on School Organization,&quot; suggests that the organizational structure of public schools requires rethinking. Chapter 4, &quot;Self-Management in Schools,&quot; discusses a shift of the authority to make decisions. Chapter 5, &quot;Professionalizing Education,&quot; discusses the ramifications of the fact that teaching is not a full-fledged profession.

Methodology involved document analysis of written plans and interviews with 30 Maine superintendents and assistant superintendents who were identified as successful developers of school improvement plans in large, midsize, and small districts. Findings indicate that the ways in which managers interpret and analyze the environment affect strategic outcomes and that responses are reshaped by unique contexts characterized by uncertainty. Although district size influenced superintendents' strategies, the ways in which they coped with perceived uncertainties had greater impact on program effectiveness. Based on the Daft and Weick  (1984) model, the superintendents can be characterized overall as &quot;prospectors,&quot; preferring external and personal sources of information, active engagement, and relying upon an incremental trial and error decision-making process. They managed uncertainty by synchronizing their strategic behaviors with the unpredictable nature of their environment, and the most effective emphasized process over outcome.

This paper's objectives are to argue the necessity of fundamental changes in the patterns of schooling (the \"whys\") and to present a conceptual model of an instructionally effective school. This model contains two elements (the \"whats\" and the \"hows\") essential for creating schools that will ensure optimal effectiveness for all students. The imperative for school reform is grounded in three perspectives: economic, sociopolitical, and moral. The instructionally effective school model is driven by the central shared belief that all children can learn. Around this belief (mission),  as a chart illustrates, are four domains of knowledge: (1) the design, implementation, and evaluation of the curriculum; (2) instructional strategies; (3) effective schools research; and (4) theories of change. Surrounding the knowledge domains are the processes empowering educators to transform goals and beliefs into reality, including collaborative decision-making models, effective interpersonal communication skills, problem-solving strategies, conflict management strategies, and caring for each other as adults. The interrelationships of these components, as well as barriers to collaborative processes in schools, are discussed in detail. (37 references) (MLH)",

The objective was to emphasize task over performance in each school, which involved a qualitative change in the nature of the learning environment. Although school staffs' impatience for immediate action and results created tension between researchers and site staff, project outcomes suggest the feasibility of using a model based on a  goal theory framework for organizational change.

        "description":"To assist the transition from novice teacher to skilled, experienced teacher, mentorship programs are being developed and refined. One such program has been developed and is currently being implemented and evaluated through the collaborative efforts of teacher educators from the University of St. Thomas, St. Paul, Minnesota, and staff from a suburban district in Bloomington, Minnesota. The program, one of 11 sites funded in 1988 by the Minnesota State Department of Education, provides for specific training, support, and frequent formal and informal contacts that stimulate professional growth and have positive effects on the learning environment. In January 1989, 26 mentors and 29 mentees were surveyed regarding the program's effects on the learning environment. All respondents  agreed that the program has positively affected the learning environment. Both mentors and mentees indicated an increase in the use of new teaching technologies, increased positive self-image, greater awareness of students' learning, development of motivational techniques, and more effective use of classroom management techniques. Other improvements included increased use of enrichment activities, enhanced professionalism, improved classroom communication, and overall use of better instructional practices.

        "description":"Employing multiple case study analysis methods, the attitudes and actions of superintendents in three school districts with improving basic skills test performance were compared with those of superintendents of three nonimproving districts to determine if patterns of difference existed. Contextual variations and superintendents' priorities were explored as antecedents to actions and outcomes. Four contextual variables were identified as potentially relevant to superintendent behavior, including superintendent and principal tenure, community climate, grade configuration and dispersion of attendance centers, and district financial condition. Superintendent's actions were classified under the nine control functions identified by Murphy and associates: supervision, selection,  socialization, evaluation, rewards and sanctions, goals, resource allocation, monitoring, and behavior control. In improving districts, there was greater principal awareness of superintendents' goals and priorities; greater evidence of shared superintendent-principal control; a higher priority for teacher evaluation and/or supervision; and more attention paid to analyzing test results. Caution is needed in adopting a single set of practices at the district level to improve student outcomes. Comparisons of test and nontest indicators of student outcomes in the six districts illustrated the complexity and ambiguity of classifying districts as improving or nonimproving on the basis of multiple outcome or single indicators.

The use of school improvement teams and feedback to foster program implementation is described along with numerous measures used to assess program implementation. Program results indicate that the strength and fidelity of implementation varied considerably from school to school and were tied to the level of administrator support for the program.

        "description":"To lead the continuing renewal of the nation's institutions, boost U.S. economic competitiveness, and promote responsible citizenship, American education must itself be renewed and restructured. All educators must be committed to providing a high quality education for all students that results in critical and creative thinking, cooperative problem-solving, reasoned and ethical analysis, responsible and moral action, and a lifelong disposition for thinking and learning. Higher-order thinking is complex, yields multiple solutions, requires interpretation and the use of multiple criteria, involves uncertainty, demands self-regulation of thinking processes, and requires considerable mental effort. Principles to support restructured learning include: (1) ensuring that all students  receive an educational program supporting higher learning; (2) acknowledging different rates of development and learning; (3) stressing the teaching of higher-order thinking across all grade levels; (4) providing appropriate classroom environments; (5) ensuring diverse instructional approaches and appropriate student assessment measures; (6) providing relevant professional development opportunities; and (7) communicating higher learning expectations to families and the community. Implementation strategies stress the necessity for providing adequate resources; appropriately designed curricula, textbooks, assessments, and professional development activities; and opportunities for parental and community engagement in the planning, implementation, and evaluation processes.

These reports were issued by the State Department of Public Instruction, the Task Force on Excellence in Education, the Middle Grades Task Force, the Tar Heel Association of Principals/Assistant Principals, the Governor's Commission on Workforce Preparedness, North Carolina Citizens for Business and Industry, the Public School Forum of North Carolina Rural Initiative Study Group, and the North Carolina Association of School Administrators Division of Superintendents. Although the reports differ, two themes predominate: (1) there should be high expectations of all students, accompanied by a strenghtened curriculum; and (2) there should be a focus on student outcomes as a means of  evaluating the state's educational system and becoming accountable to the public. Other emergent themes include decentralized decision making and the flexibility to achieve it, closer school-business-parent partnerships, and increased investment in staff through better salaries and training. Recommended policy changes range from changes in certification standards to changes in school finance designed to ensure a basic education for every child.

The ethnographic methodology included participant observation; interviews with teachers, administrators, and students; and document analysis. Participants' viewpoints are presented in samples of field notes made by the researcher, teachers and student teachers, and students. Findings indicate that students, as active participants, have learned values and how to set priorities for their lives. Gaining real experience in problem  solving has contributed to increased self-esteem and initiative-taking. The program's focus on real experiences expands students' learning by addressing their aesthetic, moral, physical, and spiritual needs. Finally, both teacher and students learn in such a program.

The school's community setting, use of curriculum guides, and initial use of curriculum packages that supply objectives, methods of presentation, and evaluations are described. Next, curriculum changes initiated in the 1983-84 school year by a new superintendent are presented. These include the development of: (1) an organized set of student curriculum goals; (2) a common set of curriculum materials; (3) student evaluation tools to be submitted to the district; and (4) a teacher evaluation program. School observations and  interviews with teachers, administrators, and students were conducted during the 1988-89 school year. Teacher responses indicate that the loss of freedom, decreased opportunity for creativity, and need to test frequently or cover large amounts of material left many teachers feeling dissatisfied, frustrated, and pressured. The teachers' use and preparation of the new curriculum is described, and the increased separation of teachers from the knowledge selection, organization, and implementation is explored along with changes in both the role of teachers and the skills required of them.

This paper summarizes a study exploring whether there is a direct relationship between: (1) locus of control and teacher burnout; (2) pupil control ideology and teacher burnout; and (3) locus of control and pupil control ideology. To test these hypotheses, operational measures such as the Pupil Control Ideology, the Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, and Maslach Burnout Inventory were used. The study sample consisted of 191 public school teachers from 13 schools located in a large Midwestern city. The schools are interracial and cross-cultural centers employing primarily  Afro-American, Caucasian, and Hispanic teachers serving students of similar ethnic backgrounds. Results supported the first hypothesis that described individuals with an external locus of control as probably having fewer coping strategies than those with an internal locus of control. Findings also supported the second hypothesis; teachers who have a custodial pupil control ideology will most likely also experience more emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a lack of personal accomplishment. The third hypothesis was also supported; teachers with a custodial pupil control ideology appear to have an external locus of control. (46 references) (MLH)",

        "author":["Riddle, Wayne Clifton"],
        "description":"In almost all states, there is substantial local variation in per pupil expenditures for public elementary and secondary education. This results from the mix of state, local, and federal revenues received by most local educational agencies (LEAs), local variations in student needs, cost of providing services, and ability and willingness to raise local revenues. National interest in such variations is increasing, due to several state supreme court decisions regarding the constitutionality of state school financing systems. Also, the ability of LEAs to pay for mandated reforms has been questioned. A bill (H.R. 3850) has been introduced in the 101st Congress providing federal support for greater equalization of state school finance programs. Problems arise concerning the definition  of \"equal spending per pupil.\" State school finance programs frequently distribute aid in proportion to each LEA's number of \"high cost\" pupils, rather than in proportion to total enrollment. Another important factor is differences in taxable resources per pupil--the ability to pay for education. A major barrier to analyzing expenditure variations is lack of a reliable national data source. The Census Bureau's 1986-87 survey of school finances is the most current source, but the quality of data for individual LEAs is questionable. In this report, two measures of expenditure disparity are calculated for each state: the range of expenditures between the 10 highest and 10 lowest spending LEAs in the state; and the coefficient of variation from the mean. The analysis proved inconclusive  regarding local causality factors influencing per pupil expenditure variations. (Author/MLH)",

The first section discusses the management of quality in educational systems and identifies the general functions of performance indicators as quality assurance, development, and accountability. Indicator systems are discussed in the following sections, and the relationships among indicators, development, and accountability are addressed in the context of the South Australian educational review system. The primary purpose of the review is to report on performance with respect to specific practices across the system as a whole. Effective practice reviews are conducted in four domains: teaching and learning; organization and management; ethos and culture; and social justice.  The final sections discuss the use of performance indicators for development and quality management purposes as part of a broad framework for monitoring educational quality. An educational review program based on group discussion, interviews, and observation assessed teaching and learning in 80 classrooms and management and organization in 17 schools. Findings indicate that the teaching and learning practices were stronger than those for management and organization. The recommendation is made for strengthening curriculum aspects of schooling, particularly planning, development, and review; delivery strategies; staff development; and management and review of development.

Recent changes in public-sector organizational management include the development of strategies for the management of change itself and the changing role of the public sector. A trend within the public sector is an increase in the level of devolution of authority and responsibility in public-sector organizations. A theoretical framework based on two different perspectives--the assurance of quality and a multilevel systems perspective--is presented. The quality management process used by the South Australian Education Department is described. The process assesses four domains of effective practice indicators: teaching and learning; management and organization; ethos  and culture; and social justice. A conclusion is that the convergence of perspectives on corporate quality management with those on the organization of school systems offers a powerful approach for the assurance of educational quality.

Two research focuses include an assessment of the status quo of women in educational administration in the United States, United Kingdom, and the Republic of South Africa and an assessment of current academic and professional educational administration training and development programs for women in those countries. Questionnaires were mailed to a random sample of 46 respondents, 60 percent male and 40 percent female, from 26 academic and professional education institutions in those three countries. Findings indicate that gender role stereotyping is the major factor  affecting the status quo of women in educational administration. A model is proposed for the South African Women Into Educational Management program (SAIWEM), which addresses the unique needs of female educational administrators in three areas: the reduction of internal and external barriers and the provision of professional development opportunities.

Social control communication was categorized into two factors--motivation and orientation. As a replication of a study conducted in Washington State, 399 teachers and 20 principals from 20 public schools in the Province of Alberta were surveyed to determine how teachers experienced their principal during communication episodes when the principal expressed expectations. Ten principals, 5 male and 5 female, were &quot;shadowed&quot; for a day to gather field data through observation, interviews, and document analysis. The findings indicated the existence of a cross-gender effect on teacher and  principal communication. Teachers experienced female principals as being more positive communicators than male principals, using extrinsic and intrinsic reward structures. Male teachers did not perceive female principals to use threats or sanctions as often as did male principals. Compared with previous literature findings, the results demonstrate the existence and importance of separate gender realities. The recommendation is made for better understanding the differences between male and female experiences. One figure and four tables are included. (14 references) (LMI)",

Surveys were administered to 319 K-12 teachers in 19 Washington State schools and to 19 principals. Onsite interviews were also conducted with five principals. Findings from the field and statistical data indicate the existence of cross-gender effects on communication. Female teachers experienced male principals as significantly more discouraging, manipulating, and isolating than female principals. Female teachers experienced principal communication differently than did their male counterparts, which suggests gender-related differences. Implications are that effective communication occurs consistently at all  levels of orientation--personal, official, and structural--and that the appropriate use of different types of communication is dependent upon the situation.

Complex relationships among personality variables and problem-solving behaviors were identified.

        "description":"A search for patterns in grade retention rates across grades 1-12 to construct simulation research models is described in this paper. Aggregate data from Shepard and Smith (1989) on grade retention rates from 12 American states for the year 1979-80 and from 11 states for 1985-86 were examined for across-grade patterns, supplemented by Dade County School District data for 4 consecutive years, 1982-83 through 1985-86. First, the elementary level pattern is explored. A process to explain the pattern is described and a mathematical function derived from the explanation is proposed to fit the data. Next, a pattern is sought for the highest magnitudes of retention rates, and the elementary grade function is extended to provide a proposed comprehensive fit. Fluctuations in the states'  data are accounted for, enhancing the model's credibility. Finally, median summaries of the data by grade are presented and compared to an across-grade model. Findings are as follows: (1) the pattern of the rate magnitude distribution in grades 1-6 suggests a negative exponential function as the target population is depleted across the grades; (2) the retention rate magnitudes show a pronounced tendency to peak at the beginning of each grade level; (3) this finding is supported by shifts in the magnitude of the peaks following the move from a junior high to middle school configuration; and (4) simple equations fit the patterns logically and empirically. A conclusion is that the simulation approach offers an unobtrusive way to investigate patterns of different populations in the retention  pool. Five figures are included. (6 references) (LMI)",

McKinney Homeless Assistance Act are reviewed and analyzed in this report. Specifically, the act requires that states designate agency authorization for a child's educational placement, procedures for placement dispute resolution, assurances for enrollment in students'\"best interests,\" and provisions for equal educational quality and transfer of student records. Findings indicate that states generally: (1) authorized education officials to make placement decisions; (2) created or adopted dispute resolution mechanisms but failed to specify child placement, time limits, and due process protections; (3) recommended flexible district records transfer policies; and (4)  encountered difficulty in planning for homeless student transportation. The study advocates that states adopt more expansive definitions of \"homeless\" students, grant placement power to parents, implement more efficient dispute resolution mechanisms, specify local district responsibility in service provision and records transfer, and meet student transportation needs. The U.S. Department of Education is encouraged to assume a strong leadership role. Ten tables outline provisions of the 35 state plans. (LMI)",

Despite the lack of conformity in case outcomes and no consistent explanation for the pattern of court decisions, information about current debates is provided. Conclusions are that the theory of \"municipal overburden\" has had limited success; courts recognize the link between available money and educational quality; and the real issue appears to be the definition of local control. Variable decisions were  handed down on the relationship between dollars spent and the quality of education, the role of the court, and the definition of and provisions for equal opportunity. A conclusion is that the current political climate of state-based reform and the role of state courts as a vehicle for law reform is conducive to challenges to unequal school systems.

Although all 50 states and the District of Columbia have laws that require educators to report cases in which they have knowledge or reasonable cause to suspect child abuse, passage of legislation does not always lead to compliance. Reasons for administrators' failure to report include fear of damage to school-family relations and of legal ramifications, preferences for internal resolution and personal investigation, unclear definitions of abuse, perceptions of futility, and animosity toward some government agencies. Suggestions for dealing with abuse cases involving school employees are discussed, which include establishing a school policy for reporting that is  consistent with state laws, providing staff training and proactive leadership, and generating community awareness. A conclusion is that educators have ethical, moral, and legal responsibilities to report suspected cases of child abuse. Examples from a survey of teachers' intentions to report are included.

        "description":"Evaluation findings on the effectiveness of Chapter 2-assisted programs in Delaware are summarized in this report. The first section provides a financial overview of 1988-89 programs, comparing the proposed budget with actual expenditures. The second section focuses on the use of state &quot;set-aside&quot; funds, identifying those allocated for special projects and describing the Chapter 2-supported functions and activities of the Department of Public Instruction. Program operation and management are summarized by school district in the third section. Data sources include fiscal year 1989 Chapter 2 applications, responses to a previous survey, and conversations with program directors. Five areas are examined: consultation, needs assessment, program description, evaluation, and general  program statements. Section 4 summarizes the use of funds in each district and reviews two sample district programs. The conclusion is that funds were used to meet diverse local needs such as improving parent, teacher, administrator, and private school participation and reducing paperwork. A small portion of state &quot;set-aside&quot; funds were used for program administration, but most were used to support statewide initiatives, for technical assistance, and for general support activities of the Department of Public Instruction. Three figures and seven tables are included. (LMI)",

Eco-map assessment is then described as a visual drawing of all resources available in the family system, indicating relationships between the client and the various resources or people affecting the client's life.  Instructions are offered for constructing an eco-map. Information is then offered to assist in developing staff members' interviewing and communication skills during assessment.

        "description":"This research project sought to identify, at a local community level, the needs and concerns of American Indians with disabilities. The selected target community was Denver, Colorado, and its surrounding metropolitan area. Data were collected through 100 face-to-face interviews with a volunteer population of American Indians with disabilities. The interviews covered general information, disability information, services information (formal support systems), consumer concerns, educational information, social information (informal support systems), and employment information. A wide range of disabling conditions was reported, including arthritis, diabetes, substance abuse, visual impairment, heart problems, orthopedic disorders, and emotional disorders. Only 25% of the survey  population was employed. Access to transportation, affordable housing, and medical care were viewed as problems. Lack of outreach from social service agencies was of primary concern. Less than half of those surveyed felt satisfied that social agencies treated them with respect and dignity, and only a third were satisfied with advocacy efforts in the community. This final report of the research project describes the people involved in the study, development of the survey instrument using the Concerns Report Method, implementation of the survey, results, conclusions, and recommendations. Appendices, which comprise over half of the report, contain administrative correspondence, a training agenda, job description of the on-site coordinator, interviewer project evaluation, information on  outreach to minorities with developmental disabilities, and other administrative materials.

An introductory chapter examines the pattern of migration (both nationally and in Arizona), reasons for migration, the federal policy of relocation, and the relocation of American Indians with disabilities. Information was collected on 947 cases of American Indian vocational rehabilitation clients who were served by Navajo and Arizona vocational rehabilitation programs during 1984-1987; this group included a relocation sample of 76 Native Americans. The relocation sample is compared to control groups and described in terms of such service outcomes as personal factors, agency factor, public support, economic factor, disability  factor, service factor, case history, and case closure. Factors associated with favorable rehabilitation outcome included living with a small number of people, completing more than 10 years of formal education, participating in a variety of activities, and having a source of support other than public assistance. Interviews conducted with 21 of the relocated subjects found that the majority felt that their quality of life was good to very good, even though many of them were unemployed, and that their quality of life changed for the better after VR.

Detailed analysis of the drawings of the child artist from the ages of 2 through 6 lead to the conclusion that even a precociously gifted child artist does not really skip stages or phases in his graphic development. The idea that drawings  employ an arbitrary system of convention-based graphic symbols was not supported. The existence of an intrinsic logic that guides the child's motivated invention of drawing systems was supported. The drawings are attached. (14 references.) (DB)",

The nature of instruction and educational placement of these students should be based on the degree of disability, level of language proficiency in both English and the primary language, and intellectual capacity. Placement decisions should consider such factors as level of adaptive behavior, social maturity, ambulation or mobility, amount and type of language input received in the home environment, and success in past and present placements. Operationalizing bilingual special education requires the creation of an instructional social system that involves active teaching of cognitive skills and includes the development of language skills while focusing on the acquisition  of English. The digest lists nine basic elements of an individualized education program for exceptional bilingual students, nine steps in developing a comprehensive curriculum, 10 considerations in selecting materials for bilingual exceptional children, and 11 guidelines for adapting instructional materials.

It examines the context of special education in terms of civil rights, advocacy, and individual versus system needs. The question of runaway costs in special education is addressed and supported with data from the fiscal year 1991 Special Education Service Plan. The report concludes that schools can bring about some fundamental changes in the manner in which children with disabilities are served and bring special education costs into reasonable alignment with general education costs. Recommendations include: (1) improve coordination of special, compensatory, and regular education services; (2) clearly articulate the purposes and parameters of special  education; (3) prepare all educators to work effectively with students who have special needs; (4) provide special education only for those students who have a clear and compelling need for specially designed instruction and related educational services; (5) continue the commitment to early intervention; (6) develop service delivery models that achieve maximum cost-effectiveness while appropriately meeting students' needs; (7) keep the public well informed about special education costs; and (8) closely monitor implementation of the special education formula. School district reports of unmet needs in special education are summarized, focusing on the statewide need for an additional 85 specialists. (JDD)",

Three sets of perceptions regarding social relationships were investigated: participation, relatedness, and perceived social competence. The Social Activity Scale was administered to 84 mainstreamed hearing-impaired adolescents in secondary schools and further education programs in England. Correlations indicated that students varied in terms of their social orientation toward hearing or hearing-impaired peers. Perceived social competence was positively related to emotional security and to one measure of participation for hearing peers, but was not related to any measures pertaining to hearing-impaired peers. Further, students rated themselves as interacting more frequently with  hearing peers than with hearing-impaired ones in the classroom and in outside-of-school activities. As mainstreaming increased, ratings of participation with hearing peers rose while those regarding hearing-impaired peers decreased. In contrast to results for participation, students indicated that they were more emotionally secure in relationships with other hearing-impaired peers than with hearing peers. There was no evidence that increased mainstreaming promoted identification and relational bonds with hearing peers. (23 references) (JDD)",

        "description":"This newsletter issue focuses on the educational and civil rights of children and youth with disabilities, through the age of 21. The primary focus is on the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (Public Law 94-142), its subsequent amendments (Public Law 98-199 and Public Law 99-457). In October, 1990, this law was amended by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Public Law 101-476). Additional federal laws, including Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Public Law 93-112) and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act (Public Law 98-524), are described to explain the full range of potential services and rights available. The paper emphasizes that most laws providing for public education are generally state and local laws rather than federal laws. An  annotated list of 17 key federal statutes affecting the education and civil rights of children and youth with disabilities is presented. A 19-item bibliography and a list of 18 clearinghouses, information centers, and government agencies are provided. Also supplied are descriptions of programs for Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Developmental Disabilities and Persons with Mental Illness and a map showing locations of federally funded Parent Training and Information projects of the Technical Assistance for Parent Programs Network.

        "description":"The study surveyed the informational needs of parents (N=367) of children, ages birth to 8 years, with disabilities and developmental delay. The questionnaire used, revised for this study, attempted to determine information needs by asking about interests and problems in child rearing through the use of \"titles\" of articles. It also surveyed attitudes and demographic information. Results are summarized for interests, problems, and preferred sources of information by the following categories: fathers and mothers combined; mothers versus fathers; mothers' level of education; mothers' race; mothers' marital status; age of child; gender of child; number of children; child rearing attitudes. Over half the parents expressed a strong concern over whether they could help their children  reach their full potential. High readership ratings were given to titles about helping their special needs child adjust, building their child's self-confidence, enhancing learning and academic skills, developing imagination, and discipline. Strong interest was expressed in learning how to deal with the emotional highs and lows of parenting a child with special needs. Mothers with less than a high school education differed from other groups in preferring to get child rearing information from family and friends. In general, parents preferred different sources for information on different parenting topics. The questionnaire is appended. (Includes 33 references.) (DB)",

Covered are: (1) personal consciousness raising about women and disability; (2) professional consciousness raising about women and disability; (3) independent living (considers how physical limitations compound developmental issues around independence); (4) career exploration (explores how gender and disability stereotypes limit career choices and develops strategies to expand options); (5)  sexuality (overviews how disability affects sexuality); and (6) role models (offers strategies for incorporating disabled female role models into agency programs). Each training module contains two to four group discussion exercises. Also listed are a variety of resources including: materials developed by the Networking Project for Disabled Women and Girls; books by and about the lives of disabled women; training materials on issues of women and disability; and materials on accessibility, employment, sexuality, independent living, and mainstreaming.

Among conclusions were: some SLI children may manifest developmental stages characteristic of normally developing children; these children may go through the same developmental stages but at later ages; longer time intervals are required for change and response patterns may be unstable for this population; for some SLI children, mixed and unclassifiable response patterns may persist into early childhood; and there is a need for a large scale study  of SLI children's interpretation of PRO.

Study findings suggest that the skin care educational program was successful in changing patients' thinking about self-care, as evidenced by significant changes in self-care behaviors and improvements in skin care. A multidimensional model of motivation which involves establishing appropriate patterns of thinking in five areas (affective, conceptual, purposive, instrumental, and evaluative) was used as the basis for the six-session program with 22 subjects. Control subjects (N=20) participated in a 10-session series of information about skin care and  other topics of SCI management. Although treatment subjects had significantly more pressure sores initially, both groups had excellent skin care outcomes following the programs. Programs were not differentially effective for paraplegics and quadraplegics. Treatment group patients practiced self-care pressure relief behaviors at a higher rate than did control patients.

Block that postulates that gender differences in personality and cognitive functioning are closely linked, both arising from the same sex-differentiated socialization experiences. This study tested the theory as it applies to creativity in children. Subjects were 244 children in grades 4-8 attending Montreal-area summer schools for gifted children. Two divergent thinking tests, each with a familiar and an unfamiliar item, were used to test cognitive style. Other measures were used to evaluate independence and social orientation. No sex differences were found in personality or in cognitive style and no significant association was found between measures of cognitive style and personality scores. Results are discussed in  light of the moderating influence of sex-role flexibility and the relative freedom boys and girls experience in peer groups and play. Includes 45 references. (DB)",

Specific sections of the monograph address the following areas: long-term life adjustment; transition studies; vocational assessment; social skills training for obtaining a job; social skills training for the workplace; necessary directions for social skills training; model programs (the Sprague Program and the Career Ladder Program); and key elements of transition programs. Recommendations are included. The report concludes that a comprehensive vocational assessment should identify pupil preferences, abilities, motivational characteristics, and instructional designs. A  longitudinal vocational program should be designed to include a postschool, vocational safety net of services. The vocational education program should include a series of community-based work experiences in which general work skills are mastered. The program should also mainstream the student with disabilities into appropriate occupational training courses. Necessary academic skills must be infused into vocational activities. A career education curriculum should focus on job-search and job-keeping skills, and particular attention should be given to social skills relevant to the workplace. Vocational programs must be coordinated with, if not initiated by, the business community in order to engender substantive jobs for career ladders. (Includes 140 references.) (DB)",

In Part I, Robert A. Gable and Virginia K. Laycock offer practical advice on how principals, other administrators, and program coordinators can facilitate the integration of students with behavioral disorders. Chapters cover: establishing guidelines for integration; skills needed in regular classes; transition planning; cooperative planning; and enhancing understanding of regular teachers. A conservative approach is proposed which stresses the matching of student capabilities with the setting's demands. In Part II, Sharon A. Maroney and Carl R. Smith consider  the teacher's responsibility to provide high-quality instruction, in chapters which address: teachers as advocates; evaluating student progress; generalizing skills; communicating clearly; preparing students for life outside the classroom; strategies that work; teaching responsibility to students; teaching social skills; and improving the quality of life.

The instructional program: used a cognitively based curriculum; included labs, lectures, and field experiences; promoted one-to-one interaction; required active learning; and included the topics of the scientific method, the ethics of science, and career awareness. Students and staff were interviewed, pre- and post-attitude questionnaires were completed, and participant observation was conducted. Results are reported for recruitment and selection, instructional methods, affective objectives, project management and staffing, and adequacy of facilities. Generally, the  students' affective response to the program was positive, with the academic and nonacademic programs both considered to be very strong. Student and staff recommendations for program improvement were used as the basis of a set of 50 guidelines, including: start recruitment early; use active learning and small group exercises; find deaf professionals to serve as role models; get captioned films and videotapes; provide a variety of well-organized and pre-planned recreational activities; and provide ongoing feedback to the director through an independent evaluator.

A survey conducted on 114 LEAs in England and Wales (55 returned completed questionnaires) gathered data on the scope and organization of support services, the role and function of support services, the response to budget reductions, staff training and support, multidisciplinary consultations, support for non-statemented children with special needs, and support for newly integrated children. It is concluded that LEAs wish to retain support services as a central resource,  available to all schools and able not only to assist existing integrated children with special education needs but also able to respond to any increase or change in demand. LEAs felt that the maintenance and development of these services would be seriously jeopardized if they were forced to devolve an increased proportion of their General Schools Budget to individual schools, as called for in recently implemented educational policy.

This report presents the results of this effort and offers recommendations to the General Assembly regarding the type of legal zoning treatment for Illinois communities to adopt to regulate community residences for individuals with disabilities. The report discusses group homes and their impact on property values, property turnover, and neighborhood safety. It discusses federal and Illinois legislation relating to housing for individuals with disabilities and analyzes specific zoning restrictions on community residences  to determine their level of compliance with the legislation. The report's findings note that, of the 110 home rule municipalities in Illinois, 99 submitted a plan to the Illinois Planning Council on Developmental Disabilities as required by the CRLPA. Of the 99 plans, 81 were considered to be adequate while the remaining 18 plans contained questionable provisions or substantial violations of fair housing requirements. Appendices contain a copy of the Community Residence Location Planning Act, a sample plan review form, citations of statewide zoning laws for group homes, a summary of a study on the impacts of group homes on property values and safety, and a 20-item bibliography.

This study was designed to investigate mirror movements in a sample of 23 very poor readers, ages 11-13, with learning disabilities, and in a control group of 48 normal readers, matched for age, sex, and handedness. Five rapid repetitive movements and eight slow finger-displacement movements were studied, and overflow to the opposite hand was quantified. A significant interaction of reading ability with type of movement was observed, with reading-impaired children making more mirror movements during slow finger displacements (but not during rapid repetitive movements) than normal readers.  Reading-impaired children showed greater left-hand overflow and normal control children showed greater right-hand overflow overall. The two groups were differentiated by the pattern of overflow rather than the overall amount. It is concluded that dyslexic children were more likely than normal children to co-activate the left hemisphere whenever the left hand was used, and dyslexic children activated both hemispheres in circumstances where normal children did not.

Nineteen subjects used computer-assisted instruction modules for seven half-hour lessons on various educational psychology concepts. The majority of the students had positive reactions to the quality of the lessons, the computer feedback, the time allowed to complete the lesson, and the teacher's instruction. Using the Computer Attitude Scale, it was determined that students' attitudes toward computers changed in terms of reduced anxiety and greater confidence in using computers. Students' knowledge of educational psychology concepts increased after completion of  each lesson. The results provide support that, if the nature of the students' computer experience is positive, then attitudes can be positively impacted. (Includes 23 references.) (JDD)",

        "description":"The Print and Computer Enlargement (PACE) System is being designed as a portable computerized reading and writing system that enables a low-vision person to read regular print and then create and edit text using large-print computerized output. The design goal was to develop a system that: weighed no more than 12 pounds so it could be easily carried by students from class to class; would be operable for over 8 hours on internal rechargeable batteries; and would sell for under $3,500. The system design utilizes a hand-held optical scanner, a portable laptop personal computer running the MS-DOS operating system, a &quot;screen catcher&quot; circuit board, and software to generate large print. PACE would produce large print for any printed material scanned by the optical scanner and for any  application program that runs on the operating system. Efforts in creating PACE involved the following objectives: select laptop computers; locate hand-held optical scanner; design and test screen catcher circuit board; create optical scanner large-print software; create large-print characters from computer; create the user interface module; field test PACE; and create a national marketing plan for PACE. The project was partially successful, in that it developed and implemented all PACE functions on a MS-DOS compatible desk top computer, but was unable to implement the design on a portable laptop computer.

Potential access problems may exist in the areas of input, output, environment, and documentation/support/training. Five checklists are provided that focus on generic strategies to fully or partially cover the needs of the majority of users with disabilities. The first checklist covers team preparation for development of campus adaptive computing services, while the other four cover different levels of implementation (low cost/short implementation time measures, moderate cost/moderate implementation time measures, annual budget measures, and long-term planning measures). For students requiring equipment that is highly individualized and specialized,  it is recommended that a contingency fund be created to acquire necessary adaptations and that funds be pooled among a number of institutions and equipment acquired be made available to each institution.

        "description":"This paper examines graphic computing environments, identifies potential problems in providing access to blind people, and describes programs and strategies being developed to provide this access. The paper begins with an explanation of how graphic user interfaces differ from character-based systems in their use of pixels, visual metaphors such as icons and windows, locational and contextual information, and mouse-controlled interaction and random access. The paper then analyzes how much of the benefits of the graphic user interface are shared by blind users. Three stages of access to the graphic user interface are described: (1) the customizing stage; (2) the ssingle-sensory mouseless strategy for providing access to standard text, icons and simple graphics, standard graphical  structures, and navigation and control; (3) the multisensory approach with a resurrected mouse, designed to extend compatibility across applications and operating systems and extend access to complex graphics and other benefits. The paper concludes that, as problems are overcome, the resulting computer access systems will provide persons who are blind with new capabilities that were not possible with earlier character-based systems.

A questionnaire was developed which included items about societal factors related to suicide, warning signs of suicide, general knowledge of and attitudes about suicide, personal knowledge about suicide, and the intervention strategy or action an adolescent might take if a friend confided a suicidal intent. In general, gifted students did not appear to have more knowledge about suicide and had similar attitudes to other students. Gifted students, however, were more likely to indicate that self would be the primary intervention person, whereas the unselected students ranked themselves as the fifth choice in providing intervention. The responses of the 12 students who  had actually attempted suicide were not significantly different from those of their respective groups. Other findings included: more than 50% of both groups knew someone who had attempted suicide; more than 20% had seriously considered suicide themselves; major reasons suggested for attempted suicide were problems at home and drugs and alcohol; over 70% believed that depression, withdrawal, and giving away possessions were signs of pre-suicidal behavior; about 90% believed loneliness increases suicide risk; and no students indicated they would take no action if a friend confided suicidal intentions.

Two sample Individualized Transition Plans (ITPs) are given to illustrate the process involved in transition planning and the roles played by adult service providers, school personnel, and family members. In one case, Joanna, who is 20, is about to enter her last year of school so transition planning focuses upon setting up  arrangements for adult services and activities that can be continued after Joanna exits from the school system. In the other case, that of 18-year-old Robert, transition planning includes both exploration of adult options and school activities to support his movement into appropriate, least restrictive adult options. Discussed for each case are vocational placements, living arrangements, income, medical care, recreation and leisure, transportation, and family support. General planning suggestions are also offered to agencies. Appendices provide a list of resources for volunteer support, guidelines for interagency councils, and a list of products and catalogs.

Introductory sections describe the handbook and identify goals. The first major section examines the parent's role as children approach adulthood and covers sharing information and participating in goal selection, selection of learning experiences and skills to be developed, exploration of post-school options, and development of more appropriate options. The  transition process is explained next, which includes the transition planning team, Individualized Education Programs and Transition Plans, the transition planning meeting, areas for transition planning, and a transition planning form. The last section identifies issues in planning for adulthood including: working with state agencies; vocational options; living arrangements; financial planning; travel; recreation and leisure; family support; legal services; and advocacy.

Among findings were the following: parents were recruited for the ICC from such sources as agency recommendations and state parent groups; special attempts were made to recruit minority representation in most states; parents' participation was often financially assisted; half of the states allow families themselves to identify who is a family member; various methods are used to  access services; informal interviews are most often used to identify family needs; families can usually bring others to the IFSP meeting; monitoring is the function of various entities including state or local lead agencies and case managers. It is concluded that, although few policies have been fully implemented yet, most states are making a &quot;good faith&quot; effort to meet the law's legal requirements.

Among findings were the following: 37 states are currently developing policy for the selection of the case manager; 72% plan for the primary case manager to be assigned by the Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) team with considerable input from parents; 23 states plan to select the case manager exclusively from the discipline most closely related to the child's or family's need; Desired competencies for case managers include knowledge of local  resources, of state and federal laws, of interagency collaboration, of typical and atypical child development, and of assessment procedures and family dynamics. Twelve states plan for case managers to be monitored at the regional level with eight states planning to monitor managers at the local level. Half of the states plan to incorporate Medicaid as one funding source for case management; 29 states plan to use state funds; and 17 states plan to use Part H funds.

        "description":"This report is one of three resulting from a 50-state survey on the development of family policies through the implementation of Public Law 99-457 (Part H) and presents first year findings on policy development in six states. The ongoing 3-year case studies are intended to examine those factors that influence progress in the stages of policy implementation of Part H. Noted are four variables important in policy implementation identified in the literature: (1) characteristics of the policy and its goals; (2) characteristics of implementing agencies; (3) beliefs and attitudes of key policy actors; and (4) variations in administrative and governmental processes. The study is examining the implementation process in terms of three major phases: policy development, policy approval, and  policy application. Enabling factors in policy development were identified and include historical factors related to children with handicaps, key persons, a shared vision of the desired service system, a suitable governmental structure, a political climate of agency cooperation, adequate resources, and previous existence of compatible policies. Major barriers to policy development include: a tradition of local autonomy in policymaking; a government structure requiring many clearances for policy approval; a political climate of local autonomy; inadequate resources; a lack of supportive key persons; and an absence of enabling factors.

Graduates were asked questions pertaining to their labor force participation, continuing education activities, occupations, income, and job satisfaction. Among findings were the following: deaf women complete postsecondary programs as often as deaf males (less than half the rate of hearing peers) and usually earn subbaccalaureate degrees; more females than males earn master's level degrees, but females earn doctorates one fourth as often as males; most of the degrees earned by deaf females are in Business and Office programs; without postsecondary education, deaf youth experience  high unemployment rates; females, with or without subbaccalaureate degrees, continue to suffer high unemployment rates beyond age 35; deaf women with baccalaureate degrees are usually professionally employed but earn lower salaries than deaf males and similarly employed hearing persons. Deaf women with or without subbaccalaureate degrees are typically employed in clerical positions (especially in medical records), or as semiskilled or unskilled laborers. A listing of postsecondary instructional programs of currently enrolled respondents is appended. (Includes 39 references.) (DB)",

        "description":"This study used data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education Students to examine whether social activities had an impact on the academic performance of 832 youth with learning disabilities. More than one-third of the high-school youth were reported to see friends outside of school 6 or 7 days a week. These students had higher absenteeism from school and were more likely to have received a failing grade than did students who were less actively involved with friends outside of school. High absenteeism and grade failure were among the strongest predictors of youth dropping out of school. In contrast, students who were engaged in school or community groups had significantly lower school absenteeism and better grade performance. Findings suggest that  students who bonded with school, whose friendships did not overly compete with the time needed to meet school responsibilities, were better students. Schools are encouraged to provide opportunities for students with varying interests to find social memberships and help parents set guidelines for appropriate out-of-school social activities. (DB)",

In general, all school-age children who have handicaps are entitled to FAPE. Characteristics of an appropriate education include educational services to meet individual needs, education with nonhandicapped students, nondiscriminatory evaluation and placement, and provision of due process procedures for the review of evaluation and placement decisions. Financial responsibilities of the school district include either providing an appropriate educational program or placing the  student in an appropriate private program.

Common themes include more active involvement of the disabled themselves and their families in the planning, delivery, and evaluation of state services; the need for a coordinated interagency planning and implementation process; and an emphasis on people rather than programs. Each issue is examined in terms of a vision or goal, issue definition, background, issue analysis, a proposed new model, and recommendations. The following issues are addressed: (1) a common philosophical and value base for all state services and planning; (2) development of common interagency  assessment strategies and functional categorization; (3) development of a common statewide information and data base; (4) development of common interagency geographic boundaries; (5) a single interagency consumer-based planning and advisory body with subgroups for each state agency; (6) avoidance/alleviation of duplication of services; (7) coordination of staff development and training among state and community agencies providing services; (8) development of a common interagency life-span case coordination system; (9) development of state office complexes at the community level; and (10) development of significant legislation to implement the interagency strategic plan and other interagency relationships.

In education, the greatest challenge is providing sufficient English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) instruction to meet the expanding demand, particularly after many years in which English was not taught widely in Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. High pedagogical standards are being challenged by serious shortages of well-trained ESL teachers and materials. In some cases, teachers weak in English language skills or lacking language teacher training are being hired to fill the gaps. Native English-speaking English language training professionals can make a substantial contribution during this time of expansion, but collaboration with local experts will be important to ensure that the methodologies and  materials that are developed are appropriate to local cultures and expectations. There are many challenges and difficulties to overcome. Response to these needs in the next few years will lay the groundwork for the future of English language development in the region. (MSE)",

Most were successfully implemented before inclusion in the collection. While the reports and plans are language-specific, the activities can be adapted for any modern language. Strategies on which the lessons are built include confidence-building,  student-centered communication, use of audio-visual materials, development of oral/aural skills, increasing motivation, introducing and stimulating cultural awareness and appreciation, and evaluating skill development.

All were learning English and had native-language support. In the study's first phase, the language of five children was audiotaped during play time. In the second phase, the whole class, then each target child individually, were taught strategies for interacting more frequently and more optimally with second-language learners (L2s): initiation, reinitiation, slower rate of speech, better enunciation, requesting clarification, and recasting and expansion. In the third phase, language data from the original five children were collected and coded. Results indicate that while all target children interacted more frequently  after the intervention, one child, Tiffany, far exceeded the others in quantity and quality of interactions with L2s. She greatly increased the proportion of time spent with them, initiated conversations more frequently, and took more turns talking to them than others did. She spent much of her time assuming a teaching role with Khmer-speaking girls, using known-answer questions and organizational comments while directing their play schedules. The findings indicate the potential of introducing such communication interventions in multicultural classrooms. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"Big books, magnified or enlarged versions of children's books, are recommended for use in the English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) classroom. The big book approach is based on the idea that shared reading and enlarged texts support joint adult-child participation in the reading process and emphasizes reading for meaning and enjoyment rather than accurate decoding. Big books are a rich source of activities that promote reading and meet curriculum objectives, including activating prior knowledge, modelling the thinking process, tracking print, encouraging prediction skills, and providing varied linguistic and creative activities. A natural extension of using the books is having students make them in a collaborative effort. Big books have several advantages over normal-sized story  books by allowing the child to see the print and focus on specific parts of the text, facilitating use of certain reading strategies (e.g., thinking aloud), promoting awareness of the conventions of print language, and being inherently interesting because of their size. Most of the big book approach can be used readily in ESL instruction, with some modification. Accuracy and English language use should be de-emphasized in favor of participation. (MSE)",

Cognitively simple and complex tasks were distinguished based on text type (narrative versus expository). Subjects read one narrative and one expository text in separate sessions, then wrote about the texts (short-term recall), had an unrelated conversation, and were asked to reproduce the texts orally. Three types of measure were used: fluency measures (pause length, phonation time, speech rate, articulation, phrase length), proposition recall measures (recall of simple propositions in the text in question), and reading time. Results indicate that the native English speakers (L1s) recalled an equal percentage of propositions  on both text types, and the non-native speakers (L2s) recalled a higher proportion of propositions in the narrative text, suggesting that cognitive complexity has a more robust effect on L2s than L1s. In addition, it was found that fluency (speech rate and phrase length) varied significantly for both L1s and L2s across text types, while articulation rate varied for L2s only. A subtle effect appeared in the interaction between phonation time and the number of propositions reproduced in both groups. Subjects' private speech emerged as a significant factor. (MSE)",

While research has provided some insight, there is no clear consensus as to what the practicum's objectives should be. Moreover, the student clientele of MATESOL programs is extremely heterogeneous with respect to such factors as nationality, career goals, previous professional preparation, and prior teaching experience. Given the absence of uniform program objectives and the wide range of student needs, abilities, and goals, MATESOL practicum objectives should be based as much on student needs as on program philosophy. The setting of practicum objectives should be seen as a dynamic, ongoing process in  which goals may change from semester to semester and from student to student. (23 references) (MSE)",

Within each language area, levels of development would be identified and defined by observable language behavior, which could then be tested by a variety of test types. Assessment would be done by teachers in schools using standard assessment tasks, then interpreted according to descriptions provided for each level of proficiency. A project to develop such a test for first language proficiency consisted of workshops with classroom teachers to identify observable behaviors as criteria, intensive observation of students for validation, creation of an initial development scale, field testing of the scales, and establishment of norms. A language proficiency  assessment system that similarly uses standard assessment tasks and common subject profile reporting could meet several important criteria: it would be analytical, diagnostic, and criterion-referenced; enable interpretation that is progressive, developmental, and cumulative; use consensus moderation and empirical calibration; be teacher-controlled and developed; be flexible; be reliable and valid; and describe student behavior in terms communicable to parents. What is needed is considerable development work, careful explanation to schools and community, technical assistance for districts, and resources to develop, implement, and maintain the system.

Beginners must learn to listen for sense from the start and focus less on the exact words used. At first, interpreters will spend too much time listening, most of the remainder processing, and then have to make do with speaking only a few words. Rather than process and speak all of the discourse, part of it incorrectly, they need to learn to say nothing. The only exception to this is when they have begun a phrase they don't understand; at that point they should finish the phrase well, soon, and  non-committally. No interpreter can translate what he or she cannot understand, but a good interpreter will manage to convey the sense without repeating each phrase. (MSE)",

Subjects were 8 native English-speaking students, 8 native Hebrew-speaking students, and 12 professional translators, all native English-speakers. At the workshops' beginning, the subjects were presented with a Hebrew text incorporating 10 strings for which the unmarked English equivalent was a single word. Verbosity in translating and selection of single-word equivalents were then discussed, and subjects were asked to translate the passage into English. At year's end, the subjects were asked to translate a Hebrew text in which there were 18  Hebrew strings for which the unmarked English equivalent was a lexicalized form. The professional translators had taken part in the initial discussion but had not been exposed to any of the pedagogy during the year. Analysis of the results indicates that an overall increase in lexicalization occurred for all three subject groups for both low- and high-frequency equivalents, but the change was nonsignificant. Verbosity was lowest among professionals; reduction of verbosity was greatest among the native English-speakers. (MSE)",

Most are self-made, having acquired technique and applied it to languages already known. However, there is now enough known about mediated interlingual communication to teach translators and interpreters how to be successful practitioners. Training should include the following: the general theory of language, including universal principles of human communication, linguistic communication, oral vs. written communication, and mediated interlingual communication; and discourse analysis, including quantity, cooperation, idiomaticity, and situationality. Arguments against teaching theory to translators and interpreters include that they are arts  requiring natural talent that can not be taught, and that writing and speaking are natural, not scientific, pursuits. The intellectual process of translation must be the focus of translator training, which should use practical models emphasizing deverbalization and theoretical conceptualization. Students should also be encouraged to broaden their knowledge base. Interpreter training should focus on the uses of oral language, maximizing extra-linguistic cues, and intelligibility. In addition, typology of oral texts, anatomy of the phonatory organs, and practical experience are essential. It is time for the translating and interpreting professions to develop professional training. (MSE)",

The entire kindergarten class participated in the method, but only nine students were selected on the basis of their score on the Brigance Test. Four major instructional centers were used: handwriting; teacher-directed instruction; follow-up activities; and independent activities. The program used manipulative materials and game-like instructional situations, ESL teaching techniques, cooperative learning, and critical thinking skill development. Activity modification and parent-teacher conferences permitted individualized instruction. The nine students increased their overall  achievement by a minimum of 10 points as measured by the Brigance Test. The approach is seen as effective and adaptable to other grade levels and subject areas. Appended materials include forms used in the study, a classroom floor plan, chart of center usage, and a comparison of pre- and post-test scores. A 15-item bibliography is included. (MSE)",

It is not a static set of rules or procedures, lesson plans, or materials. The best curriculum responds effectively to student needs as a result of close cooperation between curriculum developer and classroom teachers. A complete curriculum development process involves several elements, including: philosophy reflecting program vision or direction; goals, objectives, and intended outcomes; assessment of student needs; subject-specific or general instructional approaches, methods, and techniques; a syllabus; lesson plans; materials and documents; and student progress assessment.  Without curriculum development in an adult education program, very little education can take place except what can be provided by the individual teacher operating alone, frequently without training or much support. With a curriculum that is well-developed and constantly revised, teachers, students, scholars, and community members can work together for the benefit of all.

        "description":"A Toronto (Canada) study explored how low levels of schooling and literacy affected access of Latin-American adults to aspects of everyday life. Subjects were nine Spanish-speaking men and women, most with little or no formal schooling and varying levels of Spanish literacy. Analysis of data gathered in interviews revealed that the individuals managed to operate effectively in most commonly-encountered domains (home, streets, shops, offices, less-desirable work settings) and ineffectively in some others (desirable work settings, classrooms, church). Literacy management strategies used effectively include the following: finding helpers to act as scribes for reading and writing in Spanish and English, and occasionally to speak in English; using limited forms of literacy such as  simple numeracy skills, slashes or other marks on paper, using individual letters of the alphabet rather than words, and recognizing logos; and learning by experimenting with behaviors and products. Obstacles to learning cited include a lack of various kinds of knowledge obtained simply as a result of going to school (e.g., dictionary use, understanding of grammatical concepts); forms of exclusion from or within the classroom. Feelings of inadequacy and great desire to succeed also emerged. (MSE) (Adjunct ERIC Clearinghouse on Literacy Education)",

A sample of 367 students (a 73% response) completed surveys (62% were from males) containing 19 questions classified in non-academic and academic categories. The three academic questions focused on amounts of time related to number of credits, amount of time dedicated to study, and number of hours spent at the library. The sixteen non-academic questions focused on time related to employment, religious service, volunteer activities, intramural sports, shopping, personal care, talking with friends, dating, cultural events, and time away from the university community. Among the results were the following: (1) 82% of the students reported  spending twenty or fewer hours per week on study; (2) 25% of the students spent no time in the library; (3) males tended to enroll for more credits than females; (4) 47% reported watching television five or fewer hours per week and 15% watched no television; (5) 43% worked, and 86% of those reported working 20 or fewer hours per week; (6) 39% participated in intramural sports with 66% spending two or fewer hours per week in intramural sports; and (7) 38% spent one to three hours per week dating.

        "description":"This paper reports on the results of a survey of remedial programs at public and private colleges and universities in the southern region of the United States and highlights remedial education patterns by state, race, and gender. Responses were received from 606 of the 826 institutions surveyed (73%). Among the report's findings are the following: (1) remedial enrollment at private institutions in the region (32%) is only slightly lower than the rate at public institutions (36%); (2) states that have mandatory testing and placement policies tend to have higher percentages of freshmen in remedial courses; (3) remedial enrollment rates for Blacks and Hispanics are consistently one and one-half to two times that of White students; (4) 38.5% of entering freshmen need remedial  assistance in mathematics; and (5) remedial enrollment at most public and private institutions has increased since 1984; two-year colleges had the most increase, doctoral institutions had the least, but an average 25% of freshmen at doctoral institutions needed at least one remedial course. The report explores the implications that high levels of underpreparation present among Black and Hispanic students, as well as ethical questions raised by having college-level remedial programs. It is suggested that colleges and universities closely examine their expectations for remedial students and the institution's willingness to invest in the quality of program necessary to get students ready for full-time college work.

        "description":"This research report focuses on identifying different phases of organizational mentorship, or examining how mentorship might differ for men and women, and compares informal (spontaneous and unstructured) and formal (organizationally arranged and structured) mentorships. Surveys were mailed to 158 individuals (43 surveys were eventually used) from nine graduating classes (between 1952 and 1989) of Michigan State University. The survey contained several scales to measure mentorship functions, job satisfaction, and organizational socialization. Also, open-ended exploratory questions were employed which required participants to describe the formation of the mentorship as well as the benefits and negative side-effects. Among the study's conclusions were the following: (1) mentors do  influence the protege's intrinsic job satisfaction and organizational socialization; (2) the majority of the formal proteges (83%) indicated that the mentors had no choice or that they were unaware of the factors involved in establishing the relationship, the opposite of the informal proteges; and (3) similarity of goals and interests between the protege and mentor was cited by more informal proteges than formal proteges. The study results suggest that, although the benefits for a formal mentorship can be substantial, organizations must allow time for potential mentors and proteges to self-select themselves into a mentorship relationship.

Three distinct policy questions are addressed: (1) how can assessment focus attention on what college graduates in a democratic society should know and be able to do? (2) what assessment information is useful for making sure that the curriculum provides the necessary skills and content? and (3) how can assessment support departments and disciplines in assuming collective responsibility for the outcomes of college curricula? Next, assessment and its impact on improving teaching is discussed. This discussion asks how assessment can help to inform the teaching and learning process within the classroom, how  assessment can be used in designing state policies that support good college teaching, and how assessment can be linked to the institutional reward structure to support good teaching. Finally, the paper examines resource allocation in the assessment process in order to make assessments viable policy tools for improvement. This discussion asks how assessment can be related to the determination of resource needs, how assessment can help to inform the allocation of resources, and how assessment can be used to examine and increase the \"return on investment\" of public resources in higher education.

        "description":"This testimony before the House Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education addresses the need for improving student financial aid programs administered by the Department of Education, and in particular, the Stafford Student Loan Programs. The testimony begins with a brief review of the default problems involving student loans. Next, an examination is provided of the Congressional, Department of Education, and General Accounting Office efforts in addressing student loan defaults. The improvements needed to correct vulnerabilities in the Stafford Program are addressed, followed by a discussion of the procedures for determining school eligibility that put the Government and the student at risk. Next, several recommendations are presented for solving or lessening the occurrence of  default problems in student loan programs. It is noted in the testimony that many of the vulnerabilities and weaknesses in federal student aid programs are related to the Department of Education's administration of the programs, as well as to provisions of the Higher Education Act. An attachment provides a list of selected General Accounting Office reports on higher education issues since 1986. (GLR)",

        "description":"Among the many reasons why college and university costs are rising are factors internal to the institutions which hold down productivity. Most efforts to improve productivity usually fail because they do not introduce new energy or information from the outside. In order to improve productivity, formal, non-quantitative evaluation should include a process-by-function matrix where function refers to activities generally associated with an organizational unit. A next step includes process flowcharts for the processes in the previous matrix (e.g., information on the order in which activities are typically or necessarily performed). Next the process must diagnose by examining the importance, reliability, and redundancy of each element of each flowchart. Once satisfied that only  essential tasks are being performed, the next step is to determine whether they can be performed more efficiently using automation and information technology. Finally, the effort must optimize staff allocations by substituting less expert and hence less costly people for those with higher levels of expertise. However, despite the understanding derived from evaluation, direct management intervention is required to remove the impediments and unleash the forces that will enhance productivity and allow more resources to flow to academic operations.

Referring to the 16 content classifications used in &quot;PsycLit&quot; (the CD-ROM version of &quot;Psychological Abstracts&quot;), as well as a list of 70 leading institutions, a computer search was executed for the number of articles published by faculty associated with each institution. Since medical school contributions are significant for some institutions, those numbers are included. The study found that University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) is the most productive institution with Pittsburgh second. Five other institutions had the most publications in an area: Illinois, University of California (Davis), Indiana, University  of California (Berkeley), and Minnesota. The importance of medical school contributions was clear in the case of Pittsburgh (46 percent of publications coming from medical school sources) and other institutions. In addition, the data indicate that the strength of a school's reputation may rest on a very focused area of research. It is noted that an institution may be predominant in a particular specialty but not stand out in studies using broad subject category rankings such as this one.

The 45 full- and part-time faculty received the questionnaire. Among those, 34 faculty, or 76 percent returned the survey. Results indicated that there is a high degree of faculty involvement in experiential learning, as 151 courses, over 80 percent, offered experiential learning. Analysis of the data indicated that faculty involvement is primarily the result of the effort of individual faculty members who have a special commitment to the practice and educational philosophy of experiential learning and not due to support from the  college. The study results also suggest that experiential learning opportunities are an integral part of Unity College. However, there is a need for a more focused commitment from the administration in order to strongly support experiential learning at Unity College.

There follows a description of the methodology for the current study: deans, department chairs and faculty were surveyed in nine disciplines within a national sample of colleges and universities; the study used a sample of 453 institutions and sent surveys to deans, departments chairs and faculty with 54 percent of deans and department chairs and 38 percent of faculty returning the survey (the final total was 142 deans, 392 chairs,  and 1,172 faculty). In addition, to permit the testing of theories about differences among the disciplines, three disciplines were selected from each of the following areas: (1) the physical sciences (biology, chemistry, mathematics); (2) the social sciences (political science, psychology, sociology); and (3) the humanities (English, history, music).

        "description":"A prototype model was developed to estimate the effect of various variables on the internal rate of return to starting college. The model arose out of observations that there is a nonlinear relationship between education and earnings, that many students who begin college never finish, that there are large differences across fields of specialization in the earnings differential between college and high school graduates, and that many high school and family background characteristics appear to affect earnings. The model was then applied to data from the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972. Results found that black males have a lower rate of return on one year of college than white males (5.4 percent versus 5.9 percent) which appears, however, to be due not  to race but to other characteristics. Females also had a lower rate of return than men. It was noted that none of these differences are explained by differences in the observed characteristics of males and females. Other research using this model has shown a higher return on college attendance for women over men. It is suggested that further research and refinement of the model is necessary before strong conclusions can be developed. The study includes one table displaying results and nine references. (JB)",

Among the court cases that are reviewed are the following: (1) Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), which ruled that expressions not inciting unlawful behavior may not be subject to government restraint; (2) Healy v. James (1972) and Wood v. Davison (1972), which ruled that First Amendment rights of freedom of association applied to students, and as a result, official university recognition was necessary to protect that right; (3) Gay Students Organization of the University of New Hampshire v.

Georgetown University (1987), a nearly decade long struggle which culminated in the decision that the Catholic university had denied recognition of the association based on the groups' sexual orientation, not just because the groups' purposes and activities conflicted with Catholic doctrine. It is concluded that, based on these court cases and others, the courts will not allow college and university administrators to control the philosophical nature of student organizations nor the lifestyles of those individuals with whose ideas they disagree.

        "description":"This paper examines whether failure to control for family background, aptitude, high school quality, high school curriculum, and community characteristics leads to bias in estimates of the economic return resulting from postsecondary education. High school specific fixed effects were used to control for all observed and unobserved characteristics common to students from a given high school and an instrumental variables procedure was used to deal with measurement error in reported education. The estimation was conducted using panel data on several persons from each of a large number of high schools sampled in the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972. Controlling for family background and aptitude and achievement measures led to a substantial reduction in  estimates of the rate of return to education. Measurement error was not responsible for the reduction. However, the use of fixed effects to control for high school and community characteristics had only a modest effect on estimates of the rate of return to education, and controlling for high school curriculum made little difference. It is noted that this is an important finding because few data sets permit researchers to control for these factors when estimating the effect of education on wages.

The next group of papers describe alternative delivery systems such as various computer based methods, videotaped programs, and televised instruction. Assessment of prior learning and program assessment is considered in six papers which look at assessment methods, 2-year and 4-year college cooperation, and work autobiographies.  Consortial, cooperative and collaborative programs are the subject of several papers which describe corporate-university partnerships, an interdisciplinary approach for soldiers and sailors, how to link the needs of industry and business with the educational approach, and developing effective communication for non-native employees. Four papers address philosophical issues in non-traditional and interdisciplinary education. The next five papers treat the recruitment and retention of special students and faculty through marketing, service management, commitment and other approaches.

It addresses trends in college student enrollment patterns with an emphasis on behavior underlying student choice of college. Demographic changes and cuts in important sources of student financial aid brought significant enrollment declines to higher education in the 1980s. Colleges responded by engaging in market oriented activities intended to attract students while students became more like academic shoppers, preferring vocational, occupational, or professional courses over courses in the traditional arts and sciences. Understanding these student choice behaviors are important so that institutions can enhance their enrollment planning activities and student marketing and recruitment  activities. Researchers in psychology, sociology, and economics have done most studies of enrollment behavior. Enrollment effects of changes in the economy are often complex with different results for different levels of society. Understanding individual enrollment behavior can help enrollment managers tailor and target their college's marketing mix of programs, prices, and places. The college search and application phase is important because it is in this phase that students eliminate most colleges from consideration. Colleges can better manage enrollment in the selection and attendance phase by recruiting students consistent with the characteristics of the college or by adjusting the college characteristics to match the characteristics of the desired students.

Then, the conceptual foundations for the study of college choice behavior (psychology, sociology, economics) are discussed, followed by an explanation of why it is important to understand what determines enrollment fluctuations, such as an increasing job market or economic recession. Micro-level studies of college choice behavior, which are used to estimate the effects  of institutional and student characteristics on the probability that a particular individual will choose a particular college, are examined. Finally, information related to the following questions is presented and discussed: (1) \"what factors are important to students of nontraditional age in making college decisions?\" (2) \"what are the phases of the college choice process?\" (3) \"what factors are important in creating a desire to attend college?\" (4) \"why is the college search and application phase so important?\" and (5) \"how can an institution more effectively manage enrollment in the selection and attendance phase?\" Contains an index and 227 references.

        "description":"This study examined the constructs of a study skill--highlighting--to determine whether the constructs for highlighting in a paper mode would be the same as highlighting in a computer mode. Constructs are defined as the underlying processes that are elicited in an experimental setting and that provide a basis for explaining the relations among the outcomes which are dependent upon subjects, stimulus materials, administration procedures, and scoring procedures and criteria. Two passages originally used by Messick (1989), one causal (rhetorical units) and one collection (idea units), were used in this experiment. The subjects, 120 undergraduate and graduate students (55% male and 45% female) enrolled in summer classes at a large university, were divided into four groups of 30. Two  groups highlighted the causal type passage and two groups the collection type passage from either the computer or paper presentation. All four groups were administered the &quot;Computer Readiness Index,&quot; and the two computer groups were given additional prior training to familiarize them with highlighting using the computer keyboard. A significant main effect was found for the paper presentation groups, who highlighted a significantly greater number of units than the computer groups. It is suggested that: (1) the computer groups may have had a more systematic approach to highlighting because of their prior training; (2) spreading-activation may have caused the subjects using pencil and marker to highlight clusters of units where the computer groups were more task-oriented; and (3) the use of  highlighting text brings into play a different set of constructs when the material is presented via paper as compared to computer.

        "description":"Since the fall of 1985, teacher education students in the state of Texas have been required to take a computer literacy course as part of their certification requirements. Since 1986, students entering into Texas Tech University's College of Education's computer literacy course (EDIT 2318) have been surveyed each fall semester. The purpose of this study was to examine the survey results for trends. The major findings of the study were an increase in the positive attitude among the students toward computers and a corresponding increase in their perception of their own computer-related skills. However, a significant correlation was found between gender and computer-related skills and attitudes toward computers, and it was recommended that an attempt be made to incorporate  strategies to alleviate this difference in the course. A copy of the survey questionnaire is appended. (18 charts, 21 references) (Author/BBM)",

        "description":"As a collaborative effort between Brown University (Rhode Island) and three secondary schools, an instructional hypermedia research project called ACCESS (American Culture in Context: Enrichment for Secondary Schools) has created a corpus for use at the high school level which contains a substantial amount of textual, pictorial, audio, and video materials. These materials are intended to supplement traditional courses in American history, literature, and American Studies. The goals have been to provide students with information and materials that will help integrate the three disciplines and give students a broader perspective on American culture and a structure that will encourage their active participation in the learning process. Students interact with the system through a  mouse-driven interface and are able to take notes electronically as they use the system. Two studies have been conducted to identify educational and cognitive outcomes resulting from the use of hypermedia instructional environments, the basic cognitive mechanisms underlying the acquisition of expertise in non-rule-based but richly linked domains such as history and literature, and the basic principles that should underlie the construction of such a system. An underlying cognitive construct has been postulated, i.e., the conceptual neighborhood, which consists of a cluster of related facts and/or instances and the relationships between them. Systematic documentation of the relationship between students' interactions with a large hypermedia corpus and their conceptual representations  derived from it has begun to show that hypermedia is an effective tool for conveying complex interrelationships between ideas for the vast majority of students.

        "description":"Part of the always-changing field of microcomputers is the growing use of electronic mail/message systems (EMMS), a general term for describing the transmission of messages using computers and telecommunications facilities. As a result of these advances, it is possible for administrators, teachers, staff, and students to have immediate access to personal messages, educational resources, information services, and each other--even when they are separated by great distances. Some varieties of EMMS include message distribution services, voice mail, document and picture transmission or fax, and computer teleconferencing. EMMS may be used to record student grades, send memos, access databases, enhance communication between faculties, allow cooperative research, enhance subject-specific  student projects, and promote excellence in extracurricular activities. Some problems to be aware of in EMMS include cost effectiveness, maintenance, training, access, and supervision. In the future, however, international cooperative networks may be used to share educational information, and develop multicultural curricula. A list of EMMS resources includes eight journals, five associations, four online sources, and three resource centers. (DB)",

Howard for the National Agricultural Library. The program focused on a number of issues, including: new roles of services envisioned for the national libraries; enhancing access by the U.S. research community to foreign information products and services; dissemination of U.S. government information;  how technology can enhance access and resource sharing; financing library programs, including fees/user charges to recover costs and supplement appropriations; licensing as a mechanism to control secondary uses of information products or services developed by these libraries; the evolving National Research and Education Network; and preservation strategies. Following each presentation, a panel of ARL directors posed questions leading to general discussion of the ideas and concerns raised. After the final program session, the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health hosted a series of information technology demonstrations designed to illustrate the types of applications that result from collaboration among scientists and librarians, as well as to encourage  discussion on the potential for similar partnerships with other members of the academic community.

        "description":"This paper considers discourse models of knowledge and use and social problem solving that revive the tradition of dialectical reasoning (the broader term) or rhetoric, i.e., the art of using language, in speaking or writing, to convince others that something is true, right, or better. Discourse models of knowledge use allow taking the context-bound, tentative nature of research knowledge, as well as the beliefs and purposes of clients and patrons, into consideration. Problems derive from a failure to meet such empirical preconditions (e.g., social organization of discourse), and from the fact that such empirical preconditions pre-suppose concepts of knowledge with an egalitarian rather than an authoritative cast. Where people do not appeal to such standards, discourse may simply  reinforce existing inequalities. Social reform and educational change depend in part on a rejection of the dialectical tradition insofar as it involves the language of persuasion rather than that of experiments. These problems are illustrated by looking at pre-suppositions and limitations of argument as a discourse model of knowledge use. In conclusion, argument is contrasted with conversation, and conversation itself is considered as a concept of education. (Author/JD)",

It is argued that the personal commitments of teachers, common sense, and normative requirements can also be valid bases for action. The author points out that an over-reliance on research knowledge is unwarranted, for it is time-bound, theory-dependent, and selective. It is suggested that the question of knowledge use in teacher education and teaching can be addressed in its proper context, namely, the striving for practical wisdom. Practical decisions, however, are stated to have a necessary element of arbitrariness, and this arbitrariness that affects teaching practice calls for thought--observation,  reflection, experiment, and revision. It is posited that the science of research is organized for the discipline of second thoughts and the quickening of new ones; it is concluded that the quest for knowledge utilization misreads the intelligence of research. The value of research knowledge to teachers and teacher educators, it is stated, lies primarily in the scientific ethos and in processes of inquiry, and only secondarily in the facts researchers lay claim to.

The intent of the study was to determine the validity of three types of research used in exploring the judgment process: (1) policy capturing analysis; (2) process tracing analysis; and (3) analysis of teachers' self-reports of their judgment processes. Among conclusions reached were the following:  (1) Teachers as judges may have better insight into their own decision processes than researchers usually give them credit for. Closer attention should be paid to differences in language and level of detail offered by the various methods and to what kind of data is used to evaluate the validity of verbal reports. (2) Better models of the tasks in which judgment is being examined should be developed. (3) More should be known about how experience influences judgment.

        "description":"Competing norms for justifying actions and decisions in teaching and their effects on the curriculum and teacher learning are discussed. Interpreting teaching as a moral action, this paper argues that a personal orientation (personal practice, feeling, or beliefs) removes teacher action and decisions from the realm of objective and professional criteria for judging appropriateness. Personal reasons carry little weight in considering the wisdom of teacher actions and decisions. In teaching, appropriate actions or decisions are tied to the public realm, constrained by both facts and collective norms. Role orientation can be defined as endorsing and using collective criteria or justifying teacher actions and decisions by reference to larger contexts--colleagues, curriculum,  accountability, and teacher ideas of effective practice that recognize publicly accepted criteria. Excerpts from interviews with 20 elementary school teachers are analyzed to identify teacher orientations (personal versus role) and justifications (emphasis on the teacher, the student, or the curriculum). Studies are reviewed that show the problematic effects of a personal orientation in teaching on the curriculum and teacher learning. It is suggested that a personal orientation cuts teaching off from its moral roots, affecting both teacher and student learning adversely. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"One of the main advantages of the naturalistic approach to classroom research is that the observations are of natural phenomena, occuring in circumstances which the researcher ultimately hopes to generalize. Some problem areas are associated with this approach, however. Observers must obtain complete and accurate records of classroom activities and teacher and student behavior. They must also maintain objectivity in their narrative records. The difficulty also exists that the presence of the observer may intrude or interfere with normal classroom functioning. This paper presents some of the considerations made and techniques used to select and train observers for a major naturalistic classroom observation study, the Junior High Classroom Organization Study. Priorities used for  selecting observers are described, including classroom experience, either as a teacher or observer, and writing skills. A description is given of the activities which were engaged in during the training week. It is reported that each of the three problem areas that are associated with naturalistic studies was dealt with and some success was achieved in ameliorating them. It is pointed out that it is necessary to choose observers carefully, train them extensively, and supervise them closely. (JD)",

        "description":"Year-long observations of 51 teachers in 11 junior high schools resulted in identification of 2 groups of teachers who were rated as either more or less effective in classroom management during the year. Subsequently, these groups were observed and comparisons were made of their behaviors and activities during the first three weeks of school. After examining narrative and observational data, several broad themes or clusters of variables emerged to differentiate the more and less effective managers.

Sense of efficacy was initially defined as a student's perception of personal control over and responsibility for classroom learning experiences. This was construed as a dynamic process involving interactions among motivational and achievement characteristics of the learning environment. Measures of both personal characteristics and classroom characteristics were included. The study explored linkages among different motivational theories and conceptualized motivation as influenced both by person and  situation characteristics. Study results are presented in three parts. First, results of analyses of interrelationships among student motivational and achievement variables are summarized. Second, the results of analyses of the classroom data set alone are presented, and third, findings regarding the relationships between student and classroom characteristics are listed.

Data of several types are analyzed and interrelated: teacher communication about the content of student role; student perceptions of that role; the impact of structural variables like openness of classroom on both teacher talk and student thought; the impact of children's demographic characteristics on both; and the interrelationships between teacher talk and student thought. Three broad patterns emerge from these data: (1) Teachers play a managerial role and students respond in ways reminiscent  of workers rather than learners; (2) Of demographic differences among children, grade level stands out as having dominant impact; and (3) Teacher communication has a differential impact upon the audience, and the meaning of teacher messages is not always clear without knowing the recipient.

The review is grounded on the assumptions that both positive and negative stress are an integral part of human experiences, varying across individuals, and can be best understood within the context of how individuals cope with it. Based on this review, the report moves to an analysis of the literature on stress in teaching, focusing on the work-related variables of student concerns and issues in administrative policy and practice. Literature on teacher stress is examined in relation to the broader body of literature on occupational stress in general. Emerging from the analysis as important issues are social support, role factors in the workplace, and person-environment fit.  The consequences of stress are examined with reference to occupations in general and teaching in particular. Coping literature is analyzed, with particular reference to personal factors affecting coping. Personal resources and social support, particularly from co-workers, are reported as emerging as significant factors. The report concludes with observations and recommendations based on the analysis.

The Square Dance evolved in the Appalachians, which were settled by people from Northern England and the lowlands of Scotland. A history is given of the evolution of the American Square Dance. The contents of the Congressional designation of the Square Dance as the National Folk Dance of America is presented, and it is noted that this resolution is ample  justification for inclusion of contemporary square dance in the school curriculum.

In comparisons of teachers with those electing leisure, significant differences were observed in four categories: importance of religion, importance of television, importance of new experiences, and importance of sexual relationships. Leisure advocates' values were higher only in the television category. In the secondary comparisons (males/females), three significant differences were observed: importance of non-work activities,  importance of literature, and importance of the outdoors. Males leaned toward the importance of the outdoors. The results of the life satisfaction scale found no significant differences in comparisons between teachers/leisure, males/females, female teachers/male teachers, and leisure females/leisure males.

The project design involves participating teachers in three &quot;phases&quot; of staff/curriculum development over a period of three years or more. The three overlapping but sequential phases are: (1) graduate course work in curriculum development and  basic skills instruction; (2) classroom implementation of individually prepared curriculum plans; and (3) extension activities depending upon individual personal and professional needs, strengths, and preferences. Project THISTLE was initially conceived by Montclair State College (New Jersey) faculty and planned as a cooperative higher education/local education agency venture involving the college and the Newark (New Jersey) public schools.

The basic elements of cooperative goal structure are positive interdependence, individual accountability, face-to-face interaction, and cooperative skills. The teacher's role in structuring cooperative learning situations involves clearly specifying lesson objectives, placing students in productive learning groups and providing appropriate materials, clearly explaining the cooperative goal structure, monitoring students, and evaluating performance. For cooperative learning groups to be productive, students must be able to engage in the needed collaborative skills. Cooperative skills and academic skills can be taught simultaneously. The implementation of cooperative  learning needs to be coupled with the implementation of collaborative professional support groups among educators. Both the success of implementation efforts and the quality of life within most schools depend on teachers and other staff members cooperating with each other. Support for the program takes as careful structuring and monitoring as does cooperative learning. (JD)",

College-aged men (n=128) from two large health education classes at a mid-western university were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. The first group (control) received an educational program consisting of exposure to pamphlets addressing testicular cancer and testicular self-examination. The second group (experimental) received exposure to an educational program facilitated by an individual who had a history of testicular cancer. At the conclusion of each treatment, subjects responded to an inventory which assessed knowledge and attitudes toward cancer and toward self-examination  procedures. Three months later, a questionnaire was sent to each participant requesting information about self-examination behavior subsequent to participation in the program. Conclusions of this study indicate that neither of the treatments is advantageous to the acquisition of knowledge; however, the use of a facilitator with a history of cancer in a cancer education program can influence selected attitudes and improve self-examination behavior.

A study compared pamphlets with alternative methods of information delivery about BSE and TSE. Subjects were 219 females and 157 males enrolled in a health science course at a midwestern university. Female subjects were randomly assigned to BSE pamphlet, modeling, or modeling with guided practice groups. Male subjects were randomly assigned to TSE pamphlet group or to one of two alternative facilitator-conducted groups. Knowledge and attitudes about BSE and TSE were post-tested upon completion  of the 60-minute programs. Groups did not differ with respect to knowledge about the respective early detection procedures, but more favorable responses in the facilitator-conducted programs did occur among groups in both BSE and TSE programs regarding selected attitudes. It was concluded that pamphlets may be the simplest, most cost-effective information delivery mode when knowledge gain is the sole educational program objective. However, attitudinal change may require that more person-oriented approaches be taken by health professionals in educational roles. (Author/JMK)",

As defined in this paper, an effective teacher is one who can engage students in the learning processes, minimize disruptive behavior, and produce desired learning in a large number of students. In the first section, four generalizations about what teachers do as effective managers of student learners are discussed. These dimensions of classroom mangement include implementing a workable set of rules, structuring and monitoring activities to minimize disruptions, quick and consistent response to misbehavior, and responding to inappropriate behavior without denigrating the student involved. The second section presents eight  dimensions of effective teaching, or management of student learning, including: (1) \"knowing\" students; (2) assigning appropriate tasks; (3) orienting students; (4) monitoring students; (5) relating teaching and testing; (6) involving students in learning; (7) providing continuity; and (8) correcting errors and misunderstandings. In the final section, a discussion is offered on the interrelationships among these dimensions and the complexity of implementing effective teacher behaviors. (JD)",

Medley, in \"An Overview of Research on Classroom Teaching,\" identifies three variables which consistently differentiate between effective and ineffective teachers: learning environment, use of pupil time, and quality of instruction. Inconsistencies between these research findings, educational theory, and common sense are noted. In \"Implications of Research for Adaptive Teacher Preparations,\" Robert S. Soar separates four domains of the learning environment--emotional climate, student behavior, learning tasks, and thinking processes. Soar's research indicates conflicts with  accepted educational practice and theory. In \"Using Feedback to Change Teacher Behavior,\" Frederick J. McDonald addresses the issues of transferring research results into practical applications. He asserts that it is the researchers' responsibility to develop a more simplified system for conceptualizing teacher performance, observing teacher behavior, and providing feedback to change teacher behavior. Several suggestions are offered to enhance the effectiveness of inservice training for teachers. (JD)",

Questions asked by researchers included: (1) If performance evaluations are used, will teachers seek participation in staff employment and assessment decisions? and (2) Will teachers pressure administrators to apply seniority rather than performance criteria? The study investigated teacher preferences on these matters by following a sample of more than 80 schools in 16 Massachusetts school districts. Data were gathered from surveys and interviews with administrators and teachers, supplemented by district documents, local news reports, and personal observation of school board meetings. This paper is divided into three separate parts: (1) &quot;Staff Reductions  and Teacher Preferences for Participation in Personnel Decisions&quot;; (2) &quot;Colleague Evaluation and Staff Contraction&quot;; and (3) &quot;Staffing Policies in Times of Retrenchment: Teacher Opinions.&quot; Appendices include sampling procedures, survey and interview procedures, and the teacher survey.

Accompanying tables list the papers and classify them according to the test used, models used, test length and type, sample size and type, method of assessment, equating design, and kinds of comparisons made. A majority of the equating research has focused on the Rasch, or one parameter logistic, model. Initial Studies using the Rasch model investigated the invariance properties of the model: person-free item calibration and item-free person measurement. With tests of similar difficulty and samples of comparable ability, the research suggests that Rasch horizontal equating provides reasonable results. Research on other IRT models  has focused on comparing different strategies using the same data set. With regard to vertical equating, most of the research has demonstrated the superiority of the three-parameter model over the Rasch model. Additional equating studies using Monte Carlo methods are reviewed. Finally, four issues relevant to test equating are discussed: assessing the adequacy of equating, sources of equating error, multidimensionality, and out-of-level testing. (PN)",

The introductory chapter describes the background and methods of the project which led to the handbook, discusses the major forms and functions of evaluation, and reviews the multiple purposes of program evaluations. Chapter 2 discusses the nature of moral education and presents various types of programs. Chapter 3 offers guidelines for designing evaluations of moral education programs. Chapter 4 then takes up the complex issues of specifying goals for moral education programs and identifying  indicators of goal attainment. Chapter 5 addresses questions of data analysis. Following some final comments on the question of whether a school should introduce a moral education program, the volume concludes with several appendices: brief descriptions of four prototypes of moral education programs, a 20-page annotated bibliography of relevant literature, and additional sources of information concerning the development and evaluation of moral education programs.

At the graduate level, six academic disciplines with relatively high numbers of non-native students were surveyed: business management, civil and electrical engineering, psychology, chemistry, and computer science. Undergraduate English departments were chosen to document the skills needed by undergraduate students. The faculty members surveyed appear to view the written communicative competencies of their students predominantly from the perspective of sociolinguistic competence, placing considerably  less emphasis on grammatical competence. Although some important common elements among the different departments were reported, the survey data distinctly indicate that different disciplines do not uniformly agree on the writing task demands and on a single preferred mode of discourse for evaluating entering undergraduate and graduate students.

The outcome showed that three items in Harris' system (item #9 - nose; item #30 - arm; item #46 - trunk) differentiated these two extreme groups and that by confining the scoring of additional protocols of the Draw-A-Man Test to these three items alone, an improvement over Harris' 73-item scale in predicting school achievement was obtained. However, since further evidence indicated that these three key items lose their predictive potential  by the end of the kindergarten, it is strongly recommended that the use of this greatly abbreviated scoring system be limited to drawings made near the start of the kindergarten year.

Possible variables which can be evaluated include teacher background and organizational skills, communication ability, classroom product in the form of student achievement, ability to instigate meaningful and focused work in the classroom, and use of those affective components which reinforce teaching effectiveness. In the light of present knowledge, the evaluator should resort to a holistic method, rather than dissecting these variables into small components. Second,  how and when can these variables be evaluated? The first phase of teacher evaluation must occur before entry into the profession. The evaluation of professional teachers should include the establishment of objectives, the choice of methods for assessing objectives, and the adaptation of evaluation time frames. Third, who should evaluate teachers? Some possibilities include school administrators, other teachers, the teacher being evaluated (self-evaluation), and students and parents.

        "description":"This is a report about the first two stages of a four-stage project designed to develop procedures to assess the accomplishments of applicants to graduate school. In the first stage, trial instruments were developed after thoroughly reviewing other attempts at assessing accomplishments and carefully considering the issues involved. Three prototypes were developed based on three approaches: a checklist approach, a semi-documented approach, and an open-ended portfolio approach. In the second stage, an instrument was developed that was designed to meet the operational and conceptual requirements of an inventory of documented accomplishments for graduate selection using as many of the positive features of earlier approaches in as simple a format as possible. The inventory, included  in this document, contains items on the student's background, writing and publishing activities, contests and public performances, artistic or scientific objects produced, jobs, volunteer work, military activities, and three specific accomplishments.

        "description":"This report cumulates the results of 515 validation studies carried out over a 45-year period by the United States Employment Service, and relates these findings to five systems of job classification and job analysis. Correction for sampling error shows that general cognitive, perceptual, and psychomotor ability are valid predictors of job proficiency for all jobs, though there is considerable variation in validity across jobs. Correction for sampling error shows that cognitive and perceptual ability are valid predictors of training success for all jobs and that psychomotor ability is a valid predictor for all but a few high-complexity jobs. The relevant information in each of the five job analysis systems turned out to be the same dimension: job complexity. This dimension has  been assessed for all 12,000 jobs in the &quot;Dictionary of Occupational Titles&quot; and the validity generalization analysis performed here thus extends to all jobs in the current volume. Cognitive ability increases in validity as job complexity increases while psychomotor ability increases in validity as complexity decreases. Thus a shift in weight from cognitive ability to psychomotor ability across categories of job complexity produces average multivariate validity ranging from .49 to .59 for job proficiency and from .59 to .65 for training success.

This forum featured a major presentation by Joseph Adelson. Focusing his presentation on the cognitive growth in adolescence, he reported on two major investigations of young people--a cross-national project and a study of an American urban population--both of which involved in-depth interviews of teenage subjects and a major analysis of findings. Reporting to educators concerned with effective schools, he highlights five topics that are involved in the teenager's readiness to think fruitfully about social and humanistic matters: (1) the community, (2) the law,  (3) principles, (4) grasp of psychology, and (5) understanding the social order. Four speakers commented on Adelson's presentation: David Elkin (a Piagetian by training and conception), Allan Glatthorn (a specialist in curriculum development), Ione Vargas (a dean of the School of Social Administration at Temple University), and Frederick McDonald (a senior research psychologist at Educational Testing Service). The papers of these five presenters are contained in this document and provide perspectives on adolescence and information for further educational thought. (PN)",

        "description":"A two-stage study was conducted to compare the ability estimates yielded by tailored testing procedures based on the one-parameter logistic (1PL) and three-parameter logistic (3PL) models. The first stage of the study employed real data, while the second stage employed simulated data. In the first stage, response data for 3,000 examinees were obtained for the 40 item ACT Assessment Mathematics Usage subtest. The first 2,000 cases were used to obtain item parameter estimates for both models. Using these estimates, 1PL and 3PL tailored tests were simulated using the response data for the remaining 1,000 cases. Both tailored testing procedures employed maximum likelihood ability estimation and maximum information item selection procedures. The two sets of ability estimates were then  compared. In the second stage, response data for 3,000 cases were simulated using the 3PL item parameter estimates from the first stage as true parameters. True abilities were selected from the standard normal distribution. The first 2,000 cases were used for 1PL and 3PL calibration of the items, and the remaining 1,000 cases were used to simulate 1PL and 3PL tailored tests. The two sets of ability estimates were compared to each other and to the true ability parameters. Results of both stages of the study indicated that the 1PL and 3PL tailored tests yielded highly correlated ability estimates, and there was no apparent advantage in terms of ability estimation to using one of the models over the other. Because the 1PL procedure was less expensive to use, it was the recommended model for  this application. (Author)",

However, most of the IRT models that have been proposed, and all of the models commonly used, require the assumption of unidimensionality, which prevents their application to a wide range of tests.

The purpose of this report is to present a model for use with multidimensional data and to discuss some of its characteristics.

Studies of the \"mutual adaptation\" of development products undercut this view of development and suggest that it should be seen as a two-way street that takes into account the practical knowledge of teachers and administrators. A participant observer study of two efforts at \"collaborative\" development in the fields of basic skills and career preparation illustrate the kinds of practical knowledge that practitioners bring to the process and the changes in development processes that result. The study concludes that the practical knowledge of practitioners, linking agents, and developers all contribute to the development process. In addition, development products need  to provide enough flexibility to encourage intelligent local adaptation, but enough guidance to really provide educators with new knowledge. (Author/PN)",

The results are based on 32 studies of knowledge utilization, and the report describes the various types of research designs and their strengths and weaknesses. Survey research methods are appropriate for dealing with either of two aspects of a qualitative research topic: issues of frequency, and issues of perception and attitude. Beyond these issues, survey strategies have limited applications in qualitative research. The case study was the most common research strategy used in these 32 studies. Although multiple-case studies are able to deal with the entire knowledge utilization process in an explanatory manner, they are not good tools for establishing the frequency or extensiveness of  a particular phenomenon. Mixed designs are those in which a single investigation relies on both the survey and case study strategies. In general, these designs offer advantages that neither the survey alone nor the case study alone can provide. Four types of project management issues can affect the research design: project staff skills, project organization, resources available, and reporting requirements. Potential implications of these findings are discussed. (BW)",

        "description":"This report presents the results of a survey of large school systems conducted between 1977-80. The purpose of the survey was to identify schools with promising programs and developments, especially those with the possibility of system-wide application. A total of 33 public school systems with 599 programs were studied. In the report, research procedures are briefly summarized, and some of the most successful programs are identified and described. Factors considered most crucial to program success are reported to have been: (1) strong commitment on the part of program staff and school principals; (2) local initiative and entrepreneurship in developing and sustaining the programs (largely funded through Federal sources); (3) continuous program evaluation leading to on-going staff  development and adaption to student needs; and (4) significant departures from traditional schooling in order to adapt to individual needs in a pluralistic society. Characteristics of effective schools are summarized, with career centers and alternative schools given particular attention. Examples of school-community interaction are cited, and several of the more promising approaches to continuing education and increased professional competence such as teacher centers and management academies are described. New developments in the vital areas of systematic planning, management, and evaluation are reviewed, and elements necessary for system-wide renewal are summarized. (CJM)",

        "description":"In order to test the effects of financial subsidies on employment for disadvantaged youth, two experimental situations were set up: (1) a worker subsidy operating in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and (2) an employer subsidy operating in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The first project, the Cambridge Job Factory Voucher Experiment, tested a voucher payment directly to youth combined with a job search assistance program. In order to separate the effects of these two treatments, two experimental groups (full-treatment and voucher only) and a control group were used. The second project, the Wilkes-Barre Job Search Voucher Experiment, tested the impact of making wage vouchers or tax subsidies available to employers hiring disadvantaged youth. To distinguish the new experimental vouchers from  the Target Job Tax Credit (TJTC) already available to firms hiring 18-24 year olds, the new voucher was given only to firms hiring 16-17 year olds. The experimental design was set up in such a way that the new voucher could be compared with TJTC. The findings from the study suggest that employee wage subsidies do raise the employment prospects of disadvantaged youth. Wage subsidies paid directly to youth are more effective than wage subsidies combined with other services such as job search assistance. The study finds no evidence to support the policy of employer-based wage subsidies for hiring disadvantaged youth, either in the form of vouchers or TJTC. (Author/CMG)",

Chapter 2 deals directly with CETA's formula-funded titles and asks whether the CETA system overall has worked for disadvantaged youngsters. Chapter 3 examines Federal efforts to help youth through intensive skill-training, and Chapters 4 and 5 cover work experience for out-of-school youth and in-school youth, respectively. Chapter 6 deals with efforts to help youth in the summer; Chapter 7 reviews efforts to assist disadvantaged youth through  counseling with intensive placement, self-directed job search assistance, and school-to-work transition programs; and Chapter 8 synthesizes the evidence on work attitudes and knowledge areas. Chapter 9 considers the demand-side of the labor market by reviewing job creation strategies for youth. Finally, Chapter 10 reviews efforts to help poor youth through new institutional arrangements with the private sector, schools, and community groups. (Author/CMG)",

        "description":"Black undergraduate students' educational characteristics, experiences, and outcomes at six predominantly white, State-supported universities were examined in this study. Data were collected from 695 undergraduates by means of questionnaires. Findings show that black students in the study came from high schools where blacks were in the majority, and entered college with established histories of academic achievement. The majority were doing relatively well academically, although their grades were lower than in high school. Frequent exposure to racial discrimination was reported. Many students characterized general relationships between black students and white faculty and staff as negative. However, personal relationships with white faculty, staff, and students were rated good to  excellent. Black students also reported that white faculty had difficulty relating to them and tended to avoid interaction with them outside of class. Most students believed white faculty to be concerned about their success but felt that they sometimes evaluated black academic performance unfairly. Socially, black students were at a severe disadvantage. Even though black organizations sponsored activities, over half the students reported infrequent participation in such activities. Most students were reasonably satisfied with the amount of financial aid they received. Finally, despite obvious problems, black students clearly possessed high perceptions of self. (CMG)",

        "description":"A recent ruling in the Baby Jane Doe case held that as parents are ultimately responsible for a child, and as in this case, the parents were not recipients of Federal assistance, neither they nor the hospital following their instructions to withhold treatment from their handicapped newborn are subject to Federal provisions about discrimination on the basis of handicap (Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act). This argument is seriously flawed. Although our laws recognize that children's rights are generally best safeguarded by parents, these rights are independently protected by Federal constitutional and statutory guarantees. State child neglect and abuse laws also recognize that parents' and children's rights are not always coterminous and provide for governmental and  judicial intervention in certain circumstances. The law extends these protections on an equal basis to &quot;individuals&quot; without reference to age, infirmity, or incapacity. Thus, a hospital cannot use the excuse of parental non-consent, but has a legal responsibility to initiate appropriate action to override parental authority in certain circumstances. Furthermore, a hospital and its staff can effectively discriminate against a handicapped child throught the advice and information given to the parents concerning the child's condition and prognosis. Given this reality, Federal access to hospital records is the absolute minimum protection due to the handicapped infant under Section 504. (CMG)",

Chapter 1 reviews some of the major factors (low educational attainment, language problems, influx of foreign workers, cultural problems, and discrimination) that have been suggested as reasons for the economically disadvantaged status of Hispanics. Chapter 2 provides a socioeconomic and demographic profile of Hispanic youth, and Chapter 3 presents labor force participation rates, unemployment rates, and employment/population ratios relative to other groups and among Hispanics themselves. Chapter 4 examines the various dimensions of unemployment among Hispanics, including financial hardship, job search  methods, types of jobs sought, and length of time required to find work. Chapter 5 provides a profile of employed Hispanics, while Chapter 6 summarizes government sponsored employment and training for youth. Chapter 7 focuses on attitudes toward work and military service, as well as delinquent behavior by Hispanic youth. The last chapter explores the need for specific employment policies directed toward Hispanic youth. Options outlined include the human capital approach, the market approach, the special youth characteristics approach, and the affirmative action approach. The report concludes that early intervention into the employment problems of young Hispanic workers will produce important social benefits. (CJM)",

Personality characteristics were assessed at intake. At follow-up, personality characteristics, employment and schooling status, and self-reported police contacts were measured. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses controlling for previously measured personality suggest that employment has no effect on \"psychological health\" or \"interpersonal competency.\" One of the five measures of employment status (fulltime work in the last six months) explained a significant 2 percent of the variance in \"rebellious autonomy\" at follow-up. Return to school had significant negative effects on  psychological health and interpersonal competency for this dropout sample. Self-reported arrests were associated with age, gender, and interpersonal competency; there was no relationship between employment and delinquency in these data. These results have implications in terms of options available to dropout youth. (Author)",

        "description":"It is a truism of research on social stratification that the effects of socioeconomic or family background on educational attainment lead to biases in the simple regression of occupational status (or other putative outcomes of schooling) on educational attainment. Using a structural equation model of sibling resemblance in educational attainment and occupational status, Hauser and Mossel have found minimal evidence of family bias in the effects of postsecondary schooling on occupational status in a sample of Wisconsin brothers. In order to resolve this seemingly anomalous finding, the present analysis compares the Hauser-Mossel findings with those in larger samples of sibling pairs of the same and of mixed sex in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and with pairs of brothers in  Olneck's Kalamazoo study. In the course of the analysis, some methodological problems in cross-population comparisons of structural equation models are solved. The comparative analysis shows that family bias in the effects of schooling on occupational status may be much less than is commonly believed and that very large samples may be needed to measure it reliably. Moreover, the analysis suggests that estimates of family bias are very sensitive to the specification of response variability in schooling. (Author)",

In this paper, the association of birth order with educational attainment is examined among 9,000 Wisconsin high school graduates of 1957 and among their full sibships, including more than 30,000 men and women. Whether selection within the sample of high school graduates, post-secondary educational attainments of those graduates, or educational attainments within full sibships are considered, there are no significant or systematic effects of birth order on educational attainment when other relevant variables have been controlled. Educational attainment appears to increase with  birth order when family size is controlled, but this happens because secular increases in schooling have occurred within as well as across families.

A theory of motivation is proposed which has two components: motives, generalized dispositions to approach or avoid a class of incentives, and expectancies, an individual's assessments of the chances that his or her own performance will lead to a desired outcome. A positive motive, need for achievement, and a negative motive, fear of failure, are investigated. Generalized expectancies are measured by a personal efficacy index. Future orientation is also measured. An intergenerational analysis of the data focuses on whether motivational deficits among poor parents cause their children to remain at a low level of economic  attainment, while an intragenerational analysis examines whether motivational deficits are responsible for poor adults remaining poor. Findings show modest or insignificant effects of motives on economic outcomes and, with one exception, no consistent effects of expectancies on outcome (the exception being an intergenerational one in which parental expectancies are important for young white women). Appended to the narrative are extensive tabular data and descriptions of the study methodology and variables. (CMG)",

Section One describes writing in the lives of adolescents as viewed within the home, community, noninstitutional, and broader sociopolitical settings. Particular emphasis is given to ethnographic data collected and used to identify and describe sociocultural factors affecting students' writing both in the community and in the school. Themes related to literacy, such as bilingualism, bidialectalism, informal language, and the role of writing in the workplace, are also discussed. Section Two focuses on writing in the classroom as it is viewed by educators. Educational strategies that were developed and employed  to teach functional writing to urban students are detailed. The introduction of music to the writing curriculum is described as one of the major strategies implemented. Other ways that ethnographers can share their complementary approaches to develop and enhance students' literacy skills are stressed. The report's conclusion focuses on the integration of school and social relationships in the successful development of writing and all learning skills. The text is followed by an extensive bibliography; several case studies of Anglo, Black, and Hispanic learners/writers; and samples of writing from community and school contexts. (CJM)",

Background is provided on the defense industrial base, the extent of the projected expenditures for defense and for the procurement portion of the defense budget, and the expected employment effects of these expenditures. Five strategies accompanied by 30 suggested procedures for their implementation are presented for consideration by states as they initiate or increase their training response to the skill needs of firms within the defensive industrial base. They are (1) to develop awareness and commitment, (2) to develop needed collaborative arrangements, (3) to plan to  respond, (4) to implement a response, and (5) to continue to strengthen vocational education's ability to respond. These findings are reported: (1) few state vocational education agencies give priority to skill needs of firms doing defense work; (2) employment information to convince agency staff to prepare workers is lacking; (3) state vocational education agencies need to be able to identify firms doing defense work; and (4) the Congress and Departments of Defense and Education believe the defensive industrial base is ailing.

It follows the struggle through its nine year history (1972-1981) and ends with the final split that gave the community center independence at a cost of more than $250,000 in annual public funding. According to the history, the center today operates a program that simultaneously provides adult literacy and general education together with political, economic, and cultural empowerment. The history states that, in the struggle for the center's independence, the  colleges were adversaries of learners seeking and attaining control over their lives and their communities. It describes factors that it says mitigate against our nation's efforts to eliminate illiteracy and that, in part, account for the failures of public education. The report is indexed by names and by historical materials relating to Universidad Popular. (KC)",

This included a literature review, interviews with local representatives of employment training systems, and a questionnaire mailed to representatives of the seven major employment training systems. These systems were the military, Job Training Partnership Act, business and industry, apprenticeships, universities, public vocational education, and proprietary schools. The major findings were that (1) employed adults have the greatest numbers of options for training; youth have the least; (2) the delivery systems would maintain and develop the services they currently provide; (3) CETA and community colleges have  established the greatest number of cooperative efforts; (4) CETA, proprietary schools, public vocational education, and universities indicated the strongest possibility and desirability to cooperate with other delivery systems; (5) barriers were inadequate communication, turf protection, role incongruence/confusion, confusing rules, and planning-cycle problems; (6) incentives include better resource utilization, service evaluation, and development of a master plan for cooperation; and (7) most conducted internal and external evaluations. Recommendations were made for reducing competition among employment training providers; ensuring training quality, relevance, accessibility, and availability; increasing training efficiency; and ensuring ongoing planning and evaluation.

        "description":"In June 1980, about 285 severely handicapped people had learned to become business application programmers as a result of the IBM Project to Train the Handicapped. The program consists of 17 different projects sponsored by vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies in 16 states. Designed to enable students to perform competitively as entry-level business application programmers, the typical project is a cooperative effort involving the joint efforts of the state VR agency, a business advisory committee, and a local training activity site staffed by a qualified programming instructor. Despite the fact that these training courses will last for only nine or ten months, those individuals participating in them should gain skills that are commensurate with those of individuals graduating  with degrees in computer science. The reason behind the effectiveness of the IBM program is the fact that the individual projects are staffed by a community-based group of people, representing usually unrelated fields of activity, who form a team in which each member provides his or her expertise to make a unique contribution to the provision of job-oriented training for severely handicapped individuals.

Results were based on a 59 percent return (2,669 persons) from selected area vocational-technical schools. The data were collected by mail from October 1982 to January 1983. Some of the findings were the following: (1) the unemployment rate for vocational completers was about one-fourth less than the rate for similar age group persons in the state in 1982; (2) about 25 percent of the completers are enrolled or have taken postsecondary training; about half of the training was related to the secondary vocational field of study; (3) most completers were employed close to where they were trained; (4) more than three-fourths of completers  employed in their field of training felt their high school vocational programs gave them good to excellent preparation for their current jobs; (5) more than half of the completers were employed in jobs related to their fields of study and one-half of those who are employed in nonrelated jobs held a job in their field at one time; (6) high rates of placement in fields of study were related to extensive on-the-job training and apprenticeship opportunities; and (7) male vocational completers earn about $4,000 more per year than female completers. Graduates recommended strongly that high school programs be strengthened to include more practical job training, better job placement, more cooperative programs, and better counseling before course selection.

        "description":"A study examined the employment qualifications, job content, training, and training needs of ambulance service and rescue squad workers in Nebraska. Based on the 268 mail questionnaires that were completed and returned out of a total of 338 sent out, it was concluded that the strengths of the various ambulance and rescue services vary widely. The majority of the services had 75 percent or more of their driver and attendant personnel certified, but only about 41 percent had all certified personnel. Reports of the average amount of training and handling of chemical trauma and pesticide poisoning cases ranged from none to three or four hours. The certification training program available for these workers covers poisonings of all types in approximately three hours. More than  one-third of all respondents reported no inservice training on chemical trauma and pesticide poisonings in the past three years. A substantial majority of the respondents did say that their personnel would be likely to participate in such an inservice training program if it were available. Based on these findings, recommendations were made calling for the Nebraska State Department of Health to work together with the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the Cooperative Extension Service to develop an inservice program for rescue squad workers dealing with chemical trauma and pesticide poisoning emergencies.

Persons may know phonics and be able to decode simple readings perfectly; they may even know the meaning of many vocabulary words, but they still may be culturally illiterate. Cultural literacy demands more than mere linguistic skills; it demands participation in and knowledge about a shared body of knowledge, a knowledge of the culture of the country. Knowledge of this body of ideas and history is assumed by writers of everything from training manuals to newspapers, yet many adults do not possess this knowledge. At present, teaching this information is not easy, because there is no national consensus on what the shared body of knowledge, the shared cultural background, should contain.  Therefore, raising the level of adult literacy requires more than money and teaching skills. It requires decisive leadership that will define what every adult should know so the information can be taught. When the cultural content is determined, when we have decided what a citizen has to know to be literate in the 1980s, then adult literacy, &quot;cultural literacy,&quot; can be achieved. (KC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the state of the art in adult basic educational programs funded by the state-administered programs of the Adult Education Act (Public Law 91-230). Data for the study were gathered through mail surveys of state educational agency directors of adult education (100 percent), a random sample of 420 local directors of adult education, plus on-site visits to randomly selected local projects that included interviews with project directors, randomly selected teachers, representatives of community agencies, and students. The study clarified the fact that the act supports not a single, uniform program but three distinct programs: adult basic education (ABE), adult secondary education (ASE), and English as a second language (ESL). The study found that  adults who participated in adult basic education were relatively young with diverse ethnicity and that women outnumbered men. Students were most likely to be seeking a secondary school equivalency degree or proficiency in the English language. The study also found that programs cover diverse subjects and use a vast array of learning formats, methods, and techniques. Individualized instruction was the dominant approach in adult basic and secondary education, while a combination of group and individualized instruction was dominant in English-as-a-second-language programs. Competency-based educational techniques were also popular. The study found that about 40,000 instructors taught adult education, most of them part-time and that most of them had more than three years of experience in  teaching adults. The study concluded that the projects had been successful and that, for the future, programs should be more clearly targeted for helping local projects serve the population groups. (KC)",

The first is effective schooling research and the second concerns principles used by successful businesses in the United States. An examination of some of the major effective school research studies conducted in the past four years suggests a number of possibilities for similar research in the area of vocational education. For example, researchers could design effective school studies to identify the differences in educational practices that account for differences in observed outcomes. Also in need of examination are students' attitudes towards vocational and academic  curricula. A third broad feature related to studies of effective schools is the emphasis on collecting and applying research findings to help districts and schools improve their effectiveness. Also supplying proposed future directions for research to improve vocational education are principles of excellence that have recently been identified in a multi-year study focusing on 62 of America's best-run companies. Included among these principles are the following: willingness to experiment and take risks, attention to customer needs, autonomy to foster innovation, productivity through people, flexible staffing with flatter hierarchies, and coexistence of central direction and maximum autonomy of work units.

These same employers were less satisfied with employees who had vocational training from high schools and private vocational schools. Included among the  common problems of new employees that were mentioned by the employers were weaknesses in the basic skills, poor work habits, and a lack of understanding of the world of business. The employers felt that vocational students need additional training in computer literacy, preparation for lifelong learning, basic economics, and time management.

The earliest form of collective arguments for technological literacy stemmed from the industrial arts profession. Educational legislation and the recent series of reports focusing on the improvement of education, however, fail to include any systematic effort to incorporate technological literacy into the mainstream of educational programming. Few models exist that clearly define technological literacy. A comprehensive thrust toward technological literacy will involve the schools, other educational  institutions, and the cooperation of radio and television networks, museums, libraries, and other public resources as well as collaborative efforts with the private sector. Educators at all grade levels must alter their curricula to include technological literacy in the curricula for English, mathematics, science, social studies, and the practical arts. It is also necessary to properly address the needs for technological literacy in such support services as personnel development, teacher education, curriculum development, public information, and information networking.

        "description":"Three questions were addressed in a Navy experiment in which subjects followed instructions to complete tasks involving several pieces of electronic equipment. First, two instructional formats were compared; a hierarchical menu format containing natural chunks of instruction was not superior overall to a simple step-by-step instructional format. The menu format was superior only if the subject was familiar with the type of device and was sometimes substantially inferior otherwise. Second, experts were compared to nonexperts, found to be faster overall, and able to operate equipment with fewer instructions in the menu condition. They were also faster when complex physical actions were involved. Thus, there were both specific and general effects of expertise. Finally, evidence was  sought that knowledge of how to operate equipment was schematic. It was expected that, when subjects in the menu format condition operated a device without selecting any instructions to read, their sequence of action should correspond to stereotyped schema-like patterns. This occurred only weakly, suggesting that even experts operate everyday devices in a problem-solving mode, rather than by retrieved complete procedures. (Author/KC)",

To accomplish these objectives, test scores on the New Jersey College Basic Skills Placement Test were obtained for full-time vocational education students entering the college in the fall 1980. Progress of those students through remedial and vocational courses was monitored by reviewing course completion rates and grades. In addition, grades  for students who did and did not enroll in basic skills courses before enrolling in vocational courses were compared. The study found that grades were higher for students not needing remediation compared with those who did need remediation, pointing to the need for students requiring remediation to be identified and advised to enroll in appropriate course levels. The study also found that skill levels needed for various courses were higher than basic skills, emphasizing the need to enforce college policies calling for skill upgrading prior to entry into courses requiring a specific skill level. Finally, entry-level basic competencies for selected vocational courses were established and appropriate course sequences for remedial and vocational preparation were set. (Author/KC)",

Findings are based on postprogram experience of individuals enrolled in the Job Corps in 1977, compared to a group of disadvantaged youth not in the program. The first three chapters introduce the report, review the Job Corps program and the evaluation, and discuss the estimation procedures used in the data analysis underlying subsequent chapters. Chapters 4 through 7 present the empirical findings on whether Job Corps is successful in (1) increasing employment and earnings; (2) improving future labor market opportunities through higher education, military training, and other human capital activities; (3) reducing  dependence on welfare assistance and other public transfers; and (4) reducing criminality among former Corps members. The comparative evaluation of Job Corps benefits and costs is summarized in chapter 8. Chapter 9 examines issues pertaining to drawing general inferences about Job Corps from the existing data and discusses the generalizability of the findings. Chapter 10 offers some concluding remarks. It confirms that Job Corps had a positive and sizable impact on participants and that its economic benefits for society are greater than its costs. (YLB)",

The chapters correspond to the four bodies of literature concerning job searches that were reviewed. The chapter on the theoretical literature of the scholarly journals examines the basic model of job search, trade-off between leisure and wage, unemployment insurance, the link to macroeconomic theory, current model limitations, and models and public policy. The review of the empirical literature addressed to the testing of various theoretical hypotheses considers job searching methods, method efficiency, searching intensity, differences by subpopulations, recruitment and selection studies, interview preparation, and job searching assistance. The chapter  dealing with the commercial literature of the private professional teachers of techniques of self-directed job search focuses on the authors, the addressee, perceptions of the fundamental problem, the goal, the assumptions about the job market, and the strategies. Chapter IV analyzes the program literature used in job searching workshops. The type of information and the presentation are discussed. Each chapter concludes with a discussion of lessons for job search training programs. A 300-item annotated bibliography is attached. (YLB)",

An introductory chapter defines JST, provides a brief history of JST development, and assesses the adequacy of research and development on this intervention. Chapter II briefly describes JST as it exists in each of the major employment and training settings. It then deals with critical administrative issues such as problems surrounding outcome and cost accounting in JST programs. The focus of chapter III is on how JST group sessions are conducted, the main actors (group leaders and participants), the methods used by leaders, and  the general flavor of the experience. The two chapters that follow deal with the curriculum. They divide the content between pre-search preparation and orientation of the job seekers and the instructions and training provided for the actual job search. The final chapter synthesizes findings representing the most minimal needs, gaps, and unanswered questions found in this study. An appendix contains the methodology and a description of the selected sites. (YLB)",

Each learning experience consists of an enabling objective, activities, a self-check, and feedback. The first learning experience provides information that teachers need to assess student progress, such as how to modify assessment techniques, minimize fear of  testing, and use of an appropriate feedback and grading system. Sample tests and record forms are provided. The second learning experience contains three case studies of teacher assessment of special students, while the final learning experience calls for students to practice assessment procedures in an actual teaching situation to the satisfaction of a resource person.

Students completed instruments that measured energy conservation attitudes, behaviors, and levels of attitudinal quality specified as affective, cognitive, and direct experience. Demographic data were also collected. Multiple regression analysis was applied to the data to determine sources of significant variance on the consistency score. Further treatment of the data to determine significant differences between selected demographic variables and the consistency score was performed using t-tests and analysis of variance. Differences in the consistency  of attitude and behavior were found to be associated using both sex and employment status. No significant differences in attitude-behavior consistency were associated with the other demographic variables measured.

        "description":"A study examined the actual and projected impact of automation on employment between 1963 and 2000. Utilizing a fully integrated, dynamic input-output model that was designed for this study, the researchers analyzed a large body of quantitative information from diverse, especially technical, sources. This effort resulted in the development of a detailed model of the probable effects of automation on the demand for labor services in 53 occupations. According to this model, the intensive use of automation over the next 20 years will make it possible to conserve about 10 percent of the labor that would have been required to produce the same bills of goods in the absence of increased automation. The impact of automation is specific to different types of work and will involve a  significant increase in professionals as a proportion of the labor force and a steep decline in the relative number of clerical workers. Because the direct displacement of production workers by specific items of automated equipment will, at least in the initial stages, be offset by increased investment demand for capital goods, production workers can be expected to maintain their share of the labor force.

        "description":"The need for a national policy for the development and use of human resources is evident. One part of the human resource development issue centers around the needs of adult workers who are unemployed or threatended with unemployment because of structural changes in the labor market. The issue of retraining adult workers was examined in detail in response to the problem of the high rate of structural unemployment. Two alternatives, both using vocational education money directed at postsecondary institutions, were examined for their ability to retrain dislocated workers. A third alternative examined the effectiveness of comprehensive career counseling and information services for dealing with dislocated adults. The fourth alternative reviewed the impact that entrepreneurial skill  building and economic development might have on the high rate of structural unemployment. The alternative estimated to have the greatest impact on dislocated workers is the thid one, calling for the provision of comprehensive career counseling and information services. Entrepreneurial and economic development also appears to be a promising alternative. These alternatives, combined with existing training and employment efforts, would address the issue of structural unemployment on multiple fronts. Dialogue is occurring in Congress and in state legislatures that may lead to more help for structurally unemployed workers. (KC)",

Its purpose is to assist program planners in the U.S. Department of Education to make more informed decisions concerning the federal role in the use of educational technology. Five questions are addressed. General findings include the following: (1) technology producers and the public are leading the movement for educational technology, but no coherent federal policy exists regarding educational technology; (2) educational technology, particularly software, is not at present cost-effective; (3) educational technology is not necessarily more effective than conventional educational techniques; (4) educational technology is used more for &quot;value-added&quot; instruction that has a  positive effect on students; although it is difficult to measure, its future use may best be to extend instruction to groups who are underserved now; and (5) vocational education uses mainly simple technology; computer applications to training and retraining are limited. Given the uncertain role of the federal government, restrictions on budgets, and limitations on the effective use of educational technology, any policy initiative probably should be modest.

        "description":"This policy analysis focuses on identifying optimal federal fiscal policies for achieving desired programmatic and student outcomes on behalf of special populations in vocational education (i.e., disadvantaged, limited-English-proficient, and handicapped persons, and students interested in nontraditional careers). The present status of unserved special population students, enrollment patterns, and state and local funding suggests a critical need for the development and refinement of effective federal fiscal policy. A series of four major policy goals should be set; they include: improving access to programs and services, enhancing equity, stimulating program improvement, and strengthening interagency collaboration. In order to meet these goals, four major policy alternatives can  be suggested: (1) direct federal grants to eligible recipients, (2) student incentive grants, (3) categorical state grants (setaside model) or (4) categorical state grants (separate title). Pupil-weighing formula and ability-to-pay factors are possible options for allocating funds within states. The most promising alternative for the short run appears to be the categorical state grant for vocational education; however, additional fiscal policy research that examines the full range of fiscal policy alternatives is needed.

The result of a lack of national policy in this area has been a leadership void, and the efforts that have been made in personnel preparation and professional development have been piecemeal and token. Ten alternative solutions to the problem have been proposed and analyzed. Based on the comparisons of advantages and disadvantages, the policy alternatives determined to be the most effective for improving personnel preparation are the following: (1) the U.S. Department of Education should mandate statewide  comprehensive programs of personnel development, including a system for preservice, graduate, and inservice activities for teachers and administrators who work with minority and handicapped students; (2) a fixed percentage of each state's basic grant should be designed for professional development and personnel preparation; (3) the Congress and U.S. Department of Education should make grants through state agencies to provide opportunities to update the competencies of vocational education personnel who serve special populations; and (4) the Congress and U.S. Department of Education should reestablish the Leadership Development Program to train administrators and to retrain personnel from other fields to work with special populations in vocational education.

The report is organized into five chapters. In the first chapter, the dimensions of excellence are examined with a focus on values, the atmosphere of crisis engendered in part by a multitide of reports critical of our educational system, and questions about who should receive the rewards of education. The second chapter provides background information about the forces at work in educational philosophy, such as the classical tradition, separations between education and training, and the American structure of long and short education with higher status attributed to longer education. Two sources of policy  problems--multiple policies and uncertain purposes--are described in the third chapter. Finally, the last two chapters present some policy alternatives and recommendations. Policy alternatives include the choice between a strong or weak federal role, the definition of excellence, the form of the policy initiatives, and the alternatives for structural change. Policy recommendations include emphasis on a strong federal role, the development of policies to encourage excellence, abandoning compliance approaches, and increasing the educational opportunities of disadvantaged persons.

        "description":"Since vocational education is part of the secondary educational system, a system that is presently under close scrutiny and looking for ways to improve, it is appropriate to determine what the federal role might be in helping to achieve excellence in secondary vocational education. Federal policy has helped to shape secondary vocational education since the first legislation in 1917, the Smith-Hughes Act, mandated programs for students not well-served by a college oriented academic program. Although this mission is still important to vocational education, more program areas are federally funded today with an increasing emphasis on services to special populations. To achieve excellence in vocational education, four policy alternatives are suggested: (1) productivity enhancement,  (2) integration of vocational and academic programs, (3) allocation of funds to special needs populations, and (4) modification and continuation of the present pattern. The preferred alternative is to integrate vocational and academic programs. This policy option, addressing directly the imperative for excellence in secondary vocational education, provides career exploration and employability for all students, yet retains the opportunity for employment preparation during the later years of secondary education.

The discussion next focuses on selected aspects of planning that enable project staff to identify and prevent potential obstacles to participation among prospective trainees and on mechanisms and procedures for identifying obstacles during outreach, screening, and recruitment; during intake; in the classroom or on the work site; and through trainee  counseling. These attendance obstacles are cited and resolutions for each are presented: personal and family problems, health problems, transportation problems, lack of housing, and lack of financial resources. Discussion follows of these instructional obstacles and available resolutions: adapting instruction to trainees' levels, difficulties resulting from absences, adapting to styles of trainee participation, inappropriateness of instructional materials, trainees' anxieties about training, and inappropriate behavior. Suggestions are made for mechanisms and procedures to identify, prevent, and resolve obstacles to participation on a systematic basis. Appendixes include project descriptions and a bibliography.

Focuses of the investigation were the degree of leader-follower compatibility, Vertical Dyad Linkage (VDL) versus the Average Leadership Style analysis of leader behavior, and the general problem of assessing leader behavior on the basis of subordinate description. Eighty male college students were assigned roles as supervisors and workers in a bogus company and performed experimental tasks. Subjects were divided into 15 work groups in which low-moderate-high leader-follower compatibility was attained. Measures of leader behavior, follower performance, job satisfaction, and attitude similarity were obtained. Increased performance was related to  increases in the degree of compatibility between the followers and leaders only when subjective estimates of performance from the leader were used. Data strongly supported the hypothesis that leader-follower compatibility is related to follower satisfaction with the work environment. Moderate statistical support was shown for the superiority of the VDL approach to understanding leader behavior effects on member responses. Individual members of the group generally did not provide valid ratings of the leader's behavior toward individual subordinates.

Demographic and military characteristics and indices of commitment to continuation in the Army were gathered from 10 percent of the enlisted personnel and 30 percent of the officers serving at Fort Lewis and Madigan Army Medical Center in Washington, District of Columbia. Data from the two rank groups were analyzed separately by means of multiple linear regressions and beta analyses. Among enlisted personnel, three variables (time in service, age, and job satisfaction) cumulatively accounted for 48 percent of the variance in career orientation. Other predictor variables included educational level, being black,  Occupational Specialities 91 (medical) or 13 (field artillery), assessment of other members of the unit, assignment to a Ranger unit, and maintenance of nontraditional religious beliefs. Among officers, nine predictors explained only 41 percent of the variance in the criterion. Officer correlates of career intention were age; time in service; job satisfaction; occupational specialities of physician, dentist, and field artillery; perceptions of unit readiness; deviance; and assignment to a medical unit.

        "description":"This report presents a research plan to guide the determination of the empirical relationship between level of maintenance training simulator fidelity and training effectiveness. Chapter I describes data collection and analysis activities undertaken to provide guidance for fidelity decision making by the training simulator development community. These include a review of the empirical literature on training simulator fidelity; site visits and interviews at selected Army, Navy, and Air Force agencies; and a fidelity research issues workshop. The chapter also discusses issues related to the definitions of fidelity and fidelity specification and examines additional factors that determine device-training effectiveness. Chapter II presents the rationale for a framework within which a  specific plan of fidelity research can be developed and conducted. The framework is developed through considerations of (1) operational definitions of fidelity, (2) economic sequencing of studies, (3) theoretical and empirical aspects of maintenance tasks and required skills, and (4) desired subject population characteristics. Chapter III presents potential research paradigms for studying the relationship between training simulator fidelity and transfer of training for perceptual-motor and cognitive tasks. General design considerations for the pilot studies are discussed. Appendixes include a description and analysis of the Army's training simulator development process and workshop details. (YLB)",

Based on a translation of a Hebrew book, the text is intended for the general training of military and civilian personnel required to process, sort, and/or evaluate incomplete, unreliable information. Potential users are managers, commanders, and forecasting specialists. The first section, chapters 1 through 4, provides a general framework for thinking about uncertainty. Specific chapter topics include certainty and uncertainty, defining the uncertain situation, listing and grouping possible answers, and defining degrees of belief. The second section, chapters 5 through 7, discusses two tools, estimation and sampling, frequently used in dealing  with problems caused by uncertainty. The last section, chapters 8 through 11, deals specifically with probability assessment. The relationship between the chances for a single observation of a characteristic, the percentage of that characteristic in a group, and estimation of chances in exceptional problems are covered. Two examples are presented that are worked out using the starting-point-and-adjustment method. Exercises are provided within each chapter. A list of technical references and an outline of related topics for further study conclude the text. (YLB)",

        "description":"This volume is a discussion of research that resulted in a system for developing task summaries for writers of soldier's manuals. It is intended for people who will evaluate the system and for developers of task performance instructions (TPI) and their supervisors. First, some problems with the soldier's manuals, the basic written instructions for performance of critical tasks in most Army jobs, are considered. Some of the findings of research on the design of printed instructions are then addressed. The three principles involved in the model for developing task summaries, called the TPI system, are described sequentially. They are relevance, directness, and sufficiency. A discussion follows of provision in the TPI system for considering the needs of particular kinds of readers.  The method section discusses the way the TPI system was developed using an empirical, differential, and structural approach. A demonstration experiment to compare effectiveness of original and revised instructions is described in the final section. These results from the experiment involving instructions on filling out a standard maintenance form are reported: the revision reduced errors in checking entries by 64 percent, and people indicated greater confidence when following the revised instructions and found them much easier to understand.

Sections 2 to 5 are specific suggestions for each kind of task summary, namely procedures with equipment, procedures with data, component skills, and criterion-driven performance. Methods for tryouts and revisions are discussed in chapter 5. Use of the soldier's manuals by trainers is considered in chapter 6, since the new series of soldier's manuals will include notes for trainers and no separate commander's manual will be developed.

An introduction discusses current Army use of subjective appraisal, feedback methods, and problems with subjective appraisal. Data pertaining to the accuracy of various types of appraisal are summarized in the next section. The types of appraisal included are proficiency appraisals, task criticality appraisals, task difficulty appraisals, task frequency estimates, and appraisal of training materials. At the end of the section, research from the cognitive psychology literature relating to human ability to make accurate subjective appraisals is discussed. The third section summarizes data relating to the relative accuracy  of appraisals obtained from alternative sources, namely supervisor, self-, and peer appraisals. In the fourth section, discussion of the issue of how subjective appraisals are formulated centers around survey and interview techniques. Methods for increasing the accuracy of subjective appraisals are made, focusing on phrasing of questions, raters' experience, and other characteristics of raters. The paper concludes with suggestions for optimizing combined use of the survey and interview approaches. (YLB)",

        "description":"Traditional and performance-oriented approaches to procedural training were compared, and the deficiencies were identified. A cognitive interpretation of procedural learning was advanced, and training implications were considered. Representative armor procedures were analyzed to derive the underlying memory structures required for recall. Findings indicated that memory for armor procedural tasks can be represented as hierarchical structures of task goals, that the hierarchical structures have implications for procedural training, and that further research should be addressed to verification of the structures using actual soldier performance. Training applications of the memory structures that were suggested included a &quot;part-task&quot; training strategy that allows soldiers to organize  procedural elements into appropriate subgoal units and training of soldiers to associate subgoal names with the appropriate subprocedures.

        "description":"A look at the potential impact of high technology suggests that there may be a dim side to the popular view that high technology is the answer to America's educational and occupational problems. In reality, as technology advances continue, required job skills will decrease further. High technology will account for only 7 percent of all new jobs created between 1980 and 1990, while managerial, professional, clerical, and service occupations will account for 68% of the employment growth during this period. Contrary to the usual assumption that increasing technology will allow machines to perform the more tedious and less skilled tasks, high technology will actually further simplify and routinize work tasks and reduce the need for worker individualization and judgment. Educators  must resist the pressure to concentrate on specific skill training that will become useless as job requirements change. Instead, education should prepare students for success by providing skills in logic, analytical reasoning, scientific knowledge, communication, and the cultural arts. By providing these skills in addition to on-the-job training and recurrent education at various times over the life-cycle (as technology changes job requirements), schools can best utilize high technology as a tool for learning rather than as a subject that will displace more fundamental learning.

        "description":"Program development evaluation should focus on articulating theoretical rationales for program design and activities. To assist the managers of 17 school-based delinquency prevention projects (School Action Effectiveness Study) in developing theories of action, the Program Development Evaluation (PDE) method was utilized. To construct the theories, program managers extracted and stated links between individual variables (causes, events, outcomes) explicitly mentioned in the PDE plan. These theories of action were content analyzed. Results showed that, over time, the theories became larger, with more central variables and more links between them. Most of the increase was due to elaboration of the intermediate portions of the theories. The theories also became more related to  delinquency, but this change was largely attributable to the development of delinquency theories by project managers who had not orignially specified delinquency theories. Project managers appeared to develop theories in response to interventions that they already were committed to implementing. There was little evidence that theory produced substantial modification in most programs. The resultant theories were multi-causal and eclectic; traces of scientific theories could be found, but major differences, principally in size, were noted. Recommendations for future use of the PDE method include using it to design initial program interventions, and training implementors to use the model and to think in theoretical action terms. (BL)",

        "description":"Little has been done to analyze the forces that predict whether high-risk students will stay in school or drop out. Current and retrospective data from 27 high-risk youths were studied to shed light on this problem and to suggest ways of improving educational services. The at-risk students were from low socioeconomic backgrounds, were Mexican American, and were language minorities. Results showed that the high-risk youths did not differ significantly on standard school entry-level variables. However, more and regular exposure to learning activities in the home and school, in Spanish as well as English, seemed to be associated with greater educational attainment and achievement. The only noticeable differences in elementary school between eventual dropouts and college-bound  students appeared on tests of reading achievement. College-bound students and graduates reported more positive memories of elementary school. Dropping out was not influenced by employment, peer relationships, or school attendance policies. But by the end of eighth grade, eventual dropouts could be distinguished by their lower grades and poorer attendance records. There was no evidence that tracking, i.e., locking students into academic instructional streams, influenced dropping out. The findings suggest three general areas for interventions to improve services: (1) academic tutoring and programming; (2) entry considerations, for both elementary and junior and senior high school; and (3) counseling, school participation, and school structure in general.

To assist human service managers in developing guidelines and concrete action strategies for dealing with financial problems, 106 mental health professionals (e.g., agency directors, technical experts, government officials) with knowledge of community mental health center (CMHC) cutback management issues participated in a delphi process to identify action strategies. In the first round, panel members described 77 actions which might be conceptualized to weather cutbacks. In the second round, those action strategies were rated on four dimensions (importance, desirability, feasibility, and validity), resulting in a rank  ordering of the strategies. On the third round, panelists identified and ranked 15 strategies which they felt were most critical for weathering cutbacks. An analysis of the results showed a substantial consenus between the second and third round rankings. The 15 most important action strategies fell into internal organizational management and external environmental management categories. Internal organizational management strategies included development and maintenance of management information systems, priority setting in the areas of services and personnel, and improvement in business practices.

        "description":"These hearings present opening statements which argue for the government's responsibility to protect the health of citizens, citing the dangerous and often fatal relationship of cigarette smoking to cancer and heart and lung disease. Statements include those from Mrs. Barney Clark, widow of the first heart transplant patient, and physicians, surgeons, and medical researchers. In addition, a number of published accounts of the danger of cigarette additives, such as deerstongue, are presented. Other testimony describes smoking prevention studies and warning labels that are used in other countries. Reports linking smoking-related illness in non-smokers to association with heavy smokers are also presented. Opposing testimony, presented by representatives of the tobacco industry as  well as professionals from the fields of medicine, education, and psychology, proposes that people are sufficiently aware of the risks of smoking and that further federal intervention is unnecessary and would set an unwanted precedent. Additional testimony stresses that cigarette advertising is not aimed at young people, and evidence relating smoking to health hazards is not conclusive. The hearings include testimony from 17 witnesses; 42 prepared statements; and 13 additional articles, publications, and communications. (JAC)",

To compare the authority and influence of elected and appointed leaders, 140 students were recruited to participate in research on &quot;urban planning.&quot; They were organized into 35 four-person, same-sex groups. All subjects read a description of an imaginary city as background for a debate about urban planning programs emphasizing three problem areas: beautification, education, and welfare. Leaders were either elected or appointed. Low participators were given information supporting their position. Two kinds of dependent measures were used: (1) an observational measure, consisting of each  individual's percentage of total group speech as an indicator of influence; and (2) the ratings of group members on a post-interaction questionnaire. Percentage of total group speech indicated significant differential effects of appointment and election on men and women leaders. Men held a higher percentage of speech under the elected conditions, while women did so under appointed conditions. Competence ratings yielded the same interaction pattern. The correlation of influence ratings with percentage of speech for appointed or elected leaders yielded significant sex differences; for females there were substantial positive relationships, while for males these were zero or negative.

        "description":"Most teenagers learn to drive through a combination of classroom instruction, simulated driving experiences, and road driving. As part of a larger study focusing on public opinions of traffic safety education, parental views on safety education effectiveness, the licensing of teenage drivers, and parental involvement in driver education in the state of Washington were solicited in a statewide survey. Parents of recently licensed teenage drivers (553 mothers, 255 fathers, and 24 guardians), with an average of 25 years of driving experience, completed a 22 question, one page survey. An analysis of the results showed that parents supported the requirement of a traffic safety education (TSE) course prior to licensing but did not feel a second, advanced course was necessary. Further,  they believed that TSE was instrumental in helping teenagers to learn highway rules and regulations and to operate a motor vehicle in a safe manner. Parents supported the idea of a probationary license for 16- and 17-year-olds which could be taken away for citations for poor performance. They did not support a restrictive license which would not allow 16- and 17-year-olds to drive between midnight and 6 a.m. Parents also did not believe students should be required to wait until age 16 to enroll in TSE courses. The majority of parents reported helping their teenager learn to drive, spending an average of 38 hours in the effort. Parents reported they were willing to pay part of the TSE course fee, and they felt a fee in the $31 to $45 range was appropriate. (BL)",

The questionnaire, listing 40 topics on aging and 27 skills in working with older adults, was completed by a random sample of 74 employees (an 80 percent response rate) of a comprehensive retirement community in Southwestern Ohio. An analysis of the results showed that, due to the unique  characteristics of the retirement community, the data that were generated were adequate in determining the training needs of the facility surveyed, but unreliable for projecting the training needs of employees in other long term care facilities. All employees of this facility rated age related topics and training skills needs (e.g., communicating with the elderly, affective needs and responses, and death and dying) as very important. More generic topics and skills such as personality development and pathology were of interest only to professional employees.

In the first paper. H. Elizabeth King discusses the psychological consequences of sexual assault and incest on minors particularly in regard to family dynamics; the victim's age, cognitive development, and affective problems; and the effects on long term interpersonal relationships. Next, Carol Webb considers the psychological assessment of sexually abused adolescents in the context of a clinical study of 14 abused girls. Results of the study are presented in which the differences between this population and \"normals\" in objective, projective, cognitive, and affective processes are  addressed. Differences between incest victims and those individuals with a one-time-only occurrence of sexual abuse are discussed also. In the final paper, Ann Hazzard explores the effects of group therapy over time with the same group of sexually abused girls, focusing on the benefits of interaction, and the sharing and fulfillment of dependency needs. The clinical issues in such therapy and the counseling format are discussed, as well as therapeutic strategies which were found to be effective in helping such girls deal with their feelings. Long term themes and issues, e.g., relationships with mothers, trust, and sexual concerns, are described. The paper concludes with the results of pre- and post-tests administered to 5 out of the original 14 girls who attended at least 5 group therapy  sessions. (BL)",

        "description":"The Tenderloin Senior Outreach Project (TSOP) in San Francisco facilitated the development of intentional networks among elderly residents of eight single room occupancy (SRO) hotels in an attempt to improve residents' health and well being, and to focus on social and environmental change. The 45 block Tenderloin area is one of the largest &quot;gray ghettos&quot; in the United States with 8,000 elderly men and women living in the deteriorating hotels. The typical resident is a white, unmarried male with few social contacts and a multiplicity of health problems. Social contact grew systematically from initial blood pressure screenings in the hotel lobbies to weekly support and discussion groups in six of the hotels. The group facilitators used Paulo Freire's problem posing educational  method to help residents identify common problems, examine their root causes, and develop action plans. Crime was chosen as the key focus of group organization. Empowerment of the elderly was evidenced by the development of a Safehouse Project. Malnutrition was subsequently tackled by the seniors resulting in the establishment of a minimarket and nutrition project. The TSOP is currently a nonprofit organization with half of its board comprised of elderly Tenderloin residents. The TSOP is credited with improving community safety and individual health, and providing the residents with a sense of community, power, and control. (BL)",

Item content of the instrument was suggested by Bowlby's theoretical formulations concerning the nature of feelings toward attachment figures. A hierarchical regression model was employed to investigate the association between quality of attachment and self-esteem, life-satisfaction and affective status. Respondents were 88 adolescents ranging in age from 17 to 20 years. As hypothesized, perceived quality of parent and peer attachments was significantly related to psychological well-being. Degree of negative life-change was independently related to well-being. An exploratory classification scheme was devised in order to categorize  respondents according to the differential nature of their attachments. One secure and two anxious attachment groups were defined and compared on a number of variables theoretically expected to distinguish them. Adolescents classified as securely attached were superior in adjustment. The results also indicated that those adolescents characterized by anxious parent and peer attachment were more vulnerable to the deleterious impact of negative life-change on well-being. The study suggests the value of examining individual differences in quality of attachment during adolescence, as well as the importance of life-span approaches to the study of attachment. (Author)",

In phase three, evaluation, the assessment of Hispanic clients should focus on the effects of bilingualism and interview language, and the influence of ethnicity on evaluation and traditional assessment procedures. During the fourth phase, therapeutic modalities, the development and evaluation of culturally sensitive therapeutic modalities should be researched, emphasizing language barriers, psychocultural distance, bias, stereotyping, and expectations discrepancies.

To investigate differential effects of labels and/or descriptions of handicaps on attitudes toward disabilities, two studies were conducted. In the first study, 140 college students (65% white, 35% black) completed the Attitude Toward Disabled Persons (ATDP) Scale under two stimulus conditions (labels or descriptions). An analysis of the results showed that for amputee, blind, deaf, severely mentally retarded, and psychotic, there were no significant differences in the social distance scores under the two stimulus conditions. In contrast to the lower social distance scores for the labeling of alcoholics, diabetics,  epileptics, ex-convicts, and ulcer patients, neurotics received significantly lower social distance scores in the description condition. In the second study, 209 college students (52% white, 48% nonwhite) completed the ATDP under three stimulus conditions (labels, descriptions, labels and descriptions). An analysis of the results showed that for deaf, diabetic, epileptic, ex-convict and ulcer patients, exposure to descriptions led to significantly greater social distance scores than did exposure to the labels. On the other hand, for epilepsy, diabetes and ulcers, the labeled descriptions resulted in lower social distance than the unlabeled descriptions. For the epileptic, the description led to significantly greater social distance than did either the label or the labeled description. The  findings indicate that the choice of how to label the handicapped is a complex matter, dependent on the specific disabilities and on the nature of prevailing stereotypes about the disabilities.

To investigate the links between role groups (employment, marriage, parenthood), and pressures, satisfactions, and physical health among young women, a subsample of 162 white women, aged 18 to 34, drawn from the 1978 Health in Detroit Study, completed interviews about health and stresses; 144 women subsequently kept health diaries for 1 week or longer. An analysis of the results showed that, although motherhood and employment increased certain pressures, marriage tended to diminish them. Both marriage and employment were linked to well being, self-esteem, and personal control. Lowest competence was found among never married women, who had least resistance to stress and  lowest self-esteem, and among previously married women. Women with the fewest roles were least content, while those with the most roles were very content despite the pressures they experienced. Employment and motherhood were linked to good health, while previously married women had distinctly worse health. Overall, women with multiple roles learned how to buffer the increased pressures they often confronted, and women without multiple roles exploited their satisfactions when they were fortunate enough to feel them.

        "description":"Although many colleges offer programs in women's studies, research on the psychology of women has very low visibility in professional journals. Feminist research can enrich the discipline of social and personality psychology through its unique orientation and methodology. Gender must be viewed as both a characteristic of participants in a situation and a stimulus to which persons respond. Both men and women must be used in research samples in order to derive conclusions about all of human behavior. Gender stereotypes must be separated from definitions of good functioning and mental health. To date, uniquely female roles, behaviors, and occupations remain relatively unstudied, due to the tendency to study women in terms of their relationships to men. The study of behavior must  acknowledge the differences in status and power between the sexes. Feminist research must examine new sources of information from ethological/observational modes as opposed to laboratory studies of social behavior. Behavior should be studied as a function of both the person and the context. In reporting gender differences, the feminist researcher must take into account the magnitude of effect along with statistical significance and the traditional values and language used in the male dominated field. Feminist theory's response to gender differences is still in its infancy. Both social factors and life experiences have created a women's culture with both historical and contemporary significance. However, caution must be employed in focusing on women's uniqueness as it may lead back to  gender stereotypes, while ignoring within-gender variability. Feminist theory can aid social/personality psychology by forcing a revolution in scholarship directed toward change. (BL)",

        "description":"Attrition, which averages 40 percent among college freshmen, has been associated with academic skills, career decision making, psychological characteristics, and institutional climate. To determine the self-perceived developmental characteristics of college freshmen and the relationship of those characteristics to retention and grade point average (GPA), 592 college students (50 percent of the freshmen class enrolled in orientation classes, 251 males, 346 females) completed the Student Developmental Task Inventory (SDTI). Tests were administered in the fall semester and students were tracked for three semesters for retention and GPA data. An analysis of the results showed significant sex differences on the scales of the SDTI, with women viewing themselves as less mature than men  in emotional and behavioral autonomy. However, they viewed themselves as more mature than men in interpersonal relationships. Men perceived themselves as having more definite career plans than women, although women perceived themselves as having higher long range life plans than men. The data did not yield significant differences along sex-based variables insofar as association of the SDTI scales, sex of the student, retention, and GPA were concerned. For both GPA and retention, the SDTI was able to predict only group behavior. Life plans, career plans, and peer relationships contributed most to the prediction of GPA, while educational plans, career plans, tolerance, and life plans contributed most to the prediction of retention.

To examine the effects of social integration (social resources, social interaction, and perceived adequacy of resources), and health, age, marital status, and socioeconomic status (SES) on mental health among urban elderly individuals, 1,727 persons from Cleveland, Ohio, aged 62 or older, were interviewed using the Older American Resources and Services Questionnaire. Subjects' psychological well-being was assessed using selected items from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. An analysis of the results showed that physical health strongly correlated with psychological well being. Two measures of social integration, social resources and perceived adequacy of resources, were  also correlated with well being. Although social resources and social interaction were strongly correlated with each other, they were not at all related to the elderly individuals' perceptions of the adequacy of the resources or interaction. SES had a moderate effect on well being, largely through the better health experienced by higher status individuals. The findings suggest that although assisting the elderly to identify and use available social resources is important, simply increasing their level of interaction may have minimal effect on mental health.

        "description":"Of all cognitive styles, field dependence/independence (FD/I) is by far the most researched and has the greatest application potential to educational problems. Briefly stated, the FD/I dimension refers to people's ability to experience and interpret their environment in terms of a global versus analytic continuum. Field dependents are likely to favor vocational domains that have interpersonal emphasis and require social skills whereas field independents tend to show interest in domains emphasizing cognitive skills over interpersonal relations. Perhaps the most pervasive finding of all the FD/I research has been that field independents are more proficient readers than field dependents. Another implication from the research concerns structural provision for reading. All children  seem to profit from structure, but field dependents benefit the most. This means that text headings, advanced organizers, outlines, purpose-setting questions, and semantic maps are structures that should help reading. Since field dependents seem to have more proficiency in social skills and in operating within a social context, the reading program should allow for plenty of social interaction among readers. As research continues in the FD/I area, more powerful suggestions for reading instruction may be indicated. FD/I research could help both shed light on individual differences in the reading process and devise instructional techniques to enable all children to gain and enjoy literacy. (HOD)",

Two methods that help children to supply reading intonation involve using phrasally segmented texts and teacher modeling of the correct intonation. In the first of two experiments with fifth grade students, children were asked to divide a story into phrasal units under three conditions: while listening to a normally intoned tape recording of a story, while listening to a highly intoned rendition, and while reading the text without any audio aids. Results showed that the more audio help the children were given, the more they were able to parse the lines correctly. In the  second experiment, two groups of low ability fifth grade readers were given training in reading phrasally segmented texts. One of the groups was also exposed to teacher modeling of text. Tape recordings of student reading before and after training revealed increased sensitivity to phrasing, especially among students who had had teacher modeling.

All of the services offered under this model--(1) academic advisement, (2) personal counseling, (3) career counseling, (4) liason, (5) assessment, (6) work with information processing skills, and (7) monitoring--operate under three assumptions: that clients are their own best resource, that to be effective, questioning must be very specific, and that formal testing should be deemphasized. Use of this model revealed a number of findings, among them that learning disabilities should be seen as a continuum disablement, with more students becoming LD at  each succeeding school level, and that counseling and clinical psychology seem to provide the best background for counselors. The program was evaluated through critical incidence, a research method based on counselor observation of clients' progress toward mutually agreed upon goals. The program's success prompted acceptance of the counseling model by the California state college and university system, development of a graduate training program in working with adult LDs, and increased research on the topic.

The ability to use writing as a communication tool, for example, must be considered as part of diagnosis if the purpose is to determine how literate someone is. Diagnostic tasks must also reflect the varied forms of real print, in real contexts, rather than offering short, contrived test tasks. Diagnosis, therefore, should be as broad in practice as reading must be by definition. One framework for such a diagnosis is labeled C. A. L. M., an acronym for Continuous Assessment of Language Model. This model perceives diagnosis as being a continuous and cumulative observation in a variety of settings, asking and restating questions.  Several levels of the environment can be tapped as sources of data to generate initial diagnostic questions, including (1) the reader's microsystems, such as home, classroom, or day care center; (2) the reader's mesosystem, comprised of the interrelationships among the microsystems; and (3) the reader's exosystem, which embraces major social institutions that might affect the child's development of reading skills. Diagnostic procedures must sample as many of these systems as possible to create a valid, reliable, and complete picture of a reader's use of reading. (HOD)",

        "description":"The media imperialism approach to studies of communications in South America lacks sensitivity to the historical dimension, and tends to define the issues of western media imperialism in the context of the United States post-World War II ascendancy to world power. Through an examination of the expansion of U. S. communication interests into Latin America prior to the war, a deeper appreciation of media imperialism as a complex historical phenomenon can be achieved. In 1898, the U. S. began a period of phenomenal economic and political expansion into Latin America, matched by the expansion of American communication interests in the region and an increase in the control by U. S. companies over Latin American communications media, particularly cable and radio. Much of this expansion  was an effort to restrain European control and keep communications in the hands of the western hemisphere. At the end of World War I, North American news agencies successfully challenged European control over the distribution of foreign news to Latin American newspapers. North American interests also penetrated and soon controlled the Latin American film market, and North American exporters became major financial supporters of both print media and radio through advertising. Thus, by the end of World War II, U. S. commercial interests had already achieved a substantial degree of penetration into Latin American communications and media systems. The U. S. then faced the post-war era of world expansion with a partnership between government and media interests based on its experiences in Latin  America. (HTH)",

The articles describe writing exercises which have proven to be successful in the classroom. The first article gives suggestions for introducing students to mapping, a prewriting technique which uses graphic representations of information as an aid in organizing ideas for written and oral compositions. An example of mapping and a student essay derived from a map are included. The second article offers detailed instructions for a two-week writing unit which uses comparisons of film critiques from a variety of publications to teach writing and research skills. The guidelines include objectives and  day-by-day instructions. The final article describes two methods of using writing as a means of enhancing learning across the curriculum. The methods, speculative and double-entry journal writing, involve stopping frequently while reading in order to write down observations and thoughts. It is stressed that this type of writing is a process rather than product. (DC)",

        "description":"The internship program in technical communications at Oklahoma State University is a 3-credit-hour course that offers students an opportunity to apply the principles of technical communication learned in the classroom to an on-the-job situation. The prerequisites for the course are 9 hours of English and a course on intermediate technical/professional report writing. Students are also encouraged to complete an advanced technical/professional writing course and a course on scientific and technical editing. Once the student employers and projects are determined, students are assigned any academic work needed for them to be able to complete their internship successfully. In addition to the academic modules assigned, students are expected to keep a record of all application materials  and to complete progress reports, a final report, and a log book for all academic and on-the-job work. Employers evaluate their interns twice. Most of the internships involve a specific project (e. g., revising a booklet, writing a brochure), although a few involve working a set number of hours per week rather than completing a project. Regardless, students put in a total of at least 120 hours for both academic and on-the-job work. The goal now is to expand the program so that students can complete full-time paid internships. (A list of internship forms and projects is appended.) (HOD)",

        "description":"Use of metacognitive strategies, creative problem solving, and creative thinking techniques in intermediate grade writing instruction can promote students' thinking and creativity. Metacognitive strategies can help students attack the writing task in an orderly fashion. Answering specific questions for descriptive, expository, narrative, or persuasive writing, for example, can help students shape their verbalizations before, during, and after writing paragraphs. Prewriting verbalizations and composition planning worksheets can substitute for the formal outline. Creative problem solving as applied to written composition involves such prewriting activities as stimulation, recreation of impressions, selection of a creative problem, peer group consultation, and oral brainstorming,  while writing and rewriting include writing consultation and sharing writing with an appropriate audience. Creative thinking techniques such as brainstorming, attribute listing, morphological synthesis, and synectics methods can help writers supplement their store of intuitive ideas. (Appendixes include composition planning worksheets, a completed descriptive paragraph, and creative thinking worksheets.) (MM)",

        "description":"A study examined the amount and kinds of language arts curriculum integration that occurred in natural elementary school classroom settings, the contextual factors associated with such integration, and the relationship between teachers' thinking about this subject and the occurrence of integration in their classrooms. Teachers in six self-contained classrooms kept logs for three months in which they recorded the beginning and ending times for each instructional intent, and the materials used in each lesson. In addition, the teachers were observed six times during the period and were interviewed at the end of the study. Results showed that while interview data indicated that teachers generally favored an integrated approach to language arts instruction, logs and observations  revealed that less than 10% of time spent in language arts instruction actually involved integrated activities. Integration tended to occur only in whole-class settings under direct teacher supervision. (FL)",

Whether during audience analysis, invention, or disposition, composition always involves the development and testing of four virtues: honesty, courage, love, and a combination of hope and humility. Teachers can encourage their students' honesty by assigning manageable topics that emphasize informed opinion over succesful argumentation and by stressing the need for concern over the reality created by writing. Teachers can promote courage by having students conduct primary research on topics that threaten their image of the world, by emphasizing that writing is a deed that needs to be witnessed, and by stressing that the students must decide  whether to impress audiences with their writing style. Teachers need to understand that by establishing communion with the self and by communicating something beneficial and significant to readers, student writing can develop self-love and love of others. Finally, teachers can encourage students' humility as well as hope by helping them see that knowing and communicating are both difficult and valuable activities. (MM)",

        "description":"As drill and practice programs in computer assisted instruction (CAI) in English give students a chance to test their understanding and free the teacher from test grading, they seem a legitimate if unexciting use of the computer; but what seems less defensible is that, according to some estimates, 90% of available CAI software is of this drill and practice type. A new form of CAI known as &quot;simulation,&quot; however, uses the computer's full capabilities to put students in a simulated environment to discover for themselves how best to handle a situation. One such simulation in literature instruction is the &quot;Huck Finn&quot; program. After reading assigned pages, the students work with a computer simulation of the situation in which they have just left Huck Finn and try to get themselves out  of Huck's predicament. Having faced the situation on the screen and thought their way through it, the students will be more eager to see Huck's solution and more able to share his feelings. The students then read more assigned pages and the process is repeated. Students appear to enjoy the program and one formal evaluation showed that it improved both understanding and appreciation of the book. While the program is open to improvement, it at least uses fully the current state of technology and serves as a model for the type of computer program that might be made available for literature instruction. (Examples of three simulations from the Huck Finn program are included.) (HTH)",

        "description":"A synthesis of current research, theory, and professional opinion on how children learn to write, this report begins with a brief introduction followed by a discussion of writing readiness that suggests children's eagerness to learn to write. The third chapter examines children's use of writing to extend the functions of speech, drawing, and play, to participate in adult writing activities such as note writing, and to fulfill school assignments; and the fourth chapter examines how children learn the forms of writing from punctuation and grammar to story structure and conventions for arguing and explaining. The next chapter suggests that children learning to manage the writing process are increasingly able to use writing as a learning process, while the sixth chapter investigates  the influence of cultural differences on children's orientation toward language. The seventh chapter states that the teacher's first job is to provide children with intelligently guided writing experiences and the eighth describes two effective student publication projects. The ninth chapter presents a number of ways that parents can help their children become successful writers, the most important being reading aloud to them. The report concludes by urging both educators and researchers to seek out their own justifications for strong writing programs. (MM)",

The classes consisted of approximately 50% Middle Eastern students, 35% Southeast Asian students, and 15% African and South American students. Two instruments were used to measure the effect of this instruction. The first was a pair of narrative sentence-combining tasks: \"The Chicken,\" developed by W. Kellogg Hunt (pretest), and \"The Nightingale,\" developed by G. L. Broadhead and J. L. Berlin (posttest). In both tasks, students were presented with strings of short sentences in basic sentence patterns and were asked to rewrite the passages in a better way. The second measure was a  90-item test--the Diagnosis of Syntax and Punctuation Awareness. Each item on this test consisted of a sentence with a slash mark in it; students were to decide what punctuation would be appropriate where the slash mark appeared. Results showed student improvements in words per t-unit, t-unit standard deviation, free modifiers as a percent of all structures, free modifier words as a percent of all words, variety of structural types, punctuation accuracy, and punctuation test score.

        "description":"Appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) by President Kennedy in 1960, Newton Minow disturbed the traditionally comfortable relationship between the commission and the broadcast industry. In his first major speech, he outraged industry officials by attacking television programming as &quot;a vast wasteland&quot; and indicated that he would support legislation for FCC supervision of the networks. When he later spoke of the industry's responsibility to children, a major broadcasting group quickly announced a plan to increase high quality children's programming. The three major networks were unable to reach an agreement, however, over Minow's plan to share the commercial disadvantages of high quality children's programming by rotating a program among the networks. In  the fall of 1962, all three networks aired quality children's shows but were unable to attract commercial advertising. By the end of 1963, the absence of John Kennedy and Newton Minow lifted network fears of government regulation and the commitment to high quality but unprofitable children's shows died. (MM)",

        "description":"To improve speech communication education at the secondary school level, high school and college teachers must focus attention on speaking and listening content and on research having direct applications to speech instruction. Three approaches to curriculum planning have weakened secondary school level speech programs: the popularization of minicourses to the detriment of a basic skills foundation; the tendency among new instructors to present what they learned in college, with little attention to student needs; and teacher determination of the curriculum without objective criteria. To improve the secondary school speech curriculum, high school and college instructors must collaborate. Methods of building this collaboration include establishing partnerships between college speech  departments and local high school programs that focus on student needs, the application of research to those needs, and the improvement of instruction. In addition to giving preservice speech and language arts teachers the confidence and knowledge to teach secondary school speech education effectively, colleges can recognize outstanding high school speech programs, teachers, and students.

        "description":"Expert systems are computer programs that solve selected problems by modelling domain-specific behaviors of human experts. These computer programs typically consist of an input/output system that feeds data into the computer and retrieves advice, an inference system using the reasoning and heuristic processes of human experts, and a knowledge acquisition system that enters information into the system. Expert systems are used to solve problems associated with mundane or recurrent activities requiring high levels of relatively scarce expertise, usually in science or medicine. They can, however, be applied to human communication activities such as summarizing research, writing speeches, monitoring political campaigns, and evaluating instructional strategies. In pointing out that  generalized methods of problem solving are inefficient and error prone, artificial intelligence (AI) research encourages speech communication specialists to examine the domain-specific nature of certain communication patterns. Four potential hazards in AI development are an over dependence on machines, a reduction of the knowledge base, a loss of attention to pressing educational issues and a reliance on easy solutions to complex issues, and a loss of privacy due to the surveillance capabilities of expert systems.

The third section records interviews with the writers on such topics as the purpose of a critical piece and whether criticism can be right or wrong. Observations and hypotheses based on the writers' work and interviews include the following: (1) widespread confusion exists over the designs and intentions of newspaper theatre criticism, (2) critics are generally  believed to devote more of their writing to evaluation than is the case, (3) a reader's perception of what the critic has written will be almost entirely overshadowed by the evaluative component, (4) critics underestimate the effect their writing has on individual professionals, and (5) critics' standards show little relationship to those of regular theatregoers.

Because learning depends on good discipline, all contributors to and beneficiaries of education--students, teachers, and taxpayers--suffer when discipline is lacking: students and teachers as the direct victims of crimes committed in schools, and taxpayers as the indirect victims. Minority students are doubly affected by disruptive school environments because they are more likely than whites to be victims of attack and more certain to have learning disrupted. However, case-study research has shown that schools can reverse the trend toward disorder through motivated staff and leaders who enforce consistent, rigorous student  disciplinary codes. Case studies also show that schools that do little to improve disruption may be prevented from doing so by fear of public opinion or by complex legal procedures. Unless the public demands action, schools will remain unruly. The Departments of Education and Justice are undertaking to restore authority and disciplinary codes in schools; more importantly, President Reagan has raised the issue and called for action. (JW)",

Rankings of students are too often linked to judgments of moral worth; instead, the promotion of equal dignity in four areas (material well-being, individuality, communal affiliation, and wholeness) must form the broad goals of education. Even the pursuit of excellence can ultimately fail when human needs are ignored and only evidence of achievement is emphasized--when school standards do not actually reflect mastery of skills, when curriculum is narrow and self-serving, when limited resources are devoted to the gifted only, or when social responsibility is valued below individual achievement. Policy-makers at all levels can minimize these destructive effects  by promoting diverse forms of competence, providing support services for slow learners, encouraging cooperative activities in schools, integrating academic disciplines and spheres of school and community life, and including parents and students in decisions affecting school policy and procedure.

The study reported in this monograph attempted to address these concerns through a four-stage process: a review of literature exploring community expectations of schooling; the development of a classification of educational issues; a survey of 400 primary and secondary government and nongovernment school principals to determine their priorities among the issues; and detailed studies of school practices that exemplified the priority issues in 27 of the survey schools. Some significant differences between the groups emerged in the data analysis: pastoral care and moral education  were issues of particular importance to nongovernment school principals from both levels; cooperative learning was particularly important to primary government school principals; preparation for the world of work was much more important to secondary school principals than it was to primary school principals; and the issues of technology in education and special social competencies were of particular importance to secondary government school principals. From the study of selected schools a number of factors were identified in the areas of program, process, and personnel that were associated with successful practice. (Author/MJL)",

Data from the ETS Growth Study reveals that completion of the core curriculum has sizable effects on senior-year test performance, even when prior levels of test performance are controlled. It is also shown that completing the entire core curriculum enhances test performance beyond the effects of coursework in a particular outcome area alone. Importantly, though, completion of the core is effective only if students perform at relatively high levels in their courses. It is concluded that the new basics can be effective in promoting generic skills in the verbal and quantitative domains.  For this, the commission gets high marks. However, it is also the case that the commission has failed to provide a comprehensive stocktaking on the condition of American education. This is discussed in the concluding comments. An appendix shows course categories used to construct the new basics core curriculum. (Author/TE)",

What these linkages are, how they affect instruction, and the impact of the principal on them are the focus of this paper. Two kinds of linkages are distinguished: bureaucratic and cultural. An explantation of both, with particular attention to cultural linkages, is made. The contribution of the high school principal is complicated by the fact that high schools are more loosely linked than elementary schools. Yet, past research attended extensively to bureaucratic linkages without analyzing cultural linkages. It is argued that the high school principal has access to weak linkages of both kinds. The task for the principal is to employ the full range of linkages consistently through a  multitude of major and minor actions, in order to generate a common purpose and effect in the school.

Chapter 1, &quot;Professionalism and Responsiveness,&quot; addresses the inherent tension, in a democracy, between elected officials' accountability to the public will and the need of bureaucracies for expert knowledge in decision-making. Chapter 2, &quot;Conflict,&quot; analyzes similarities and differences in the way superintendents and city managers traditionally approach conflict management, and the degree to which the two are responsive to their publics. Chapter 3, &quot;The Winnowing Process,&quot; analyzes the ideological and practical consequences of the differences in the training and  selection process between city managers and superintendents. Chapter 4, &quot;The Parties to Conflict,&quot; covers the whole arena of conflict management with which city managers and school superintendetns are involved, including relations with federal, state, and local governments, school role representation, public apathy, interest groups, and collective bargaining. Chapter 5 accordingly concerns &quot;The Selection of Strategies,&quot; based on sources and severity of conflict and on individual attitudes and behaviors. Chapter 6 assesses &quot;Future Trends in Education Conflict,&quot; including financial, political, and demographic factors, and reexamines the question of responsiveness in light of these trends.

Section 1 describes some of the structural features of alternative schools, including where they are, why they were started, organizational characteristics, size, and growth. Following a look at the students who attend alternative schools in section 2, section 3 examines the following key elements in how such schools work: (1) choice, (2) role diffusion as opposed to specialized staff, (3) autonomy, (4) evaluation, (5) costs, (6) attendance, and (7) future prospects. After a description and evaluation of the distinctive elements, learning activities, and curriculum and skills emphases of  alternative school programs in section 4, section 5 provides a brief review of the alternative school experience from the perspectives of students and staff. Section 6 assesses the accomplishments and challenges of alternative education. The report's appendixes provide a sample survey questionnaire complete with tallies, bibliographical data on previous alternative school surveys, and additional information about the present survey and its history.

Phase 1 includes the following preliminary activities involved in planning for technological change: (1) forming a planning committee, (2) establishing broad direction, (3) conducting orientation activities, (4) compiling an inventory of current computer applications, and (5) identifying the planning resources needed. Phase 2, &quot;Integrating Computers into the Curriculum,&quot; requires developing broad goal and student competency statements, setting planning priorities, and developing curriculum objectives and  instructional strategies and applications. Following phase 3, which involves identifying required and actual faculty competencies and establishing a staff development program, phase 4 is devoted to preparing procurement specifications for software and hardware acquisition. The fifth and last phase involves providing for program coordination and implementation by developing logistical, materials, and equipment support systems. The guide's final section, &quot;Looking Ahead,&quot; includes a checklist for each stage of the planning and implementation process. Each of the guide's sections on the five major phases concludes with bibliographical information on supplementary readings. (JBM)",

The technique, predicated on individualized pacing and continuous progress, is generalizable to all elective programs, and offers a workable solution to satisfy the enrollment \"numbers game\" and to lend breadth and depth to the curricula of small schools and colleges. Any student beyond the first year, regardless of age and language being studied, can schedule \"Advanced Foreign Language\" during the hours where this option appears on the master schedule. Students negotiate long-term contracts each quarter and short-term contracts on a daily/weekly basis. For each core lesson, students are provided a checklist that details all the requirements for the lesson and facilitates  recordkeeping. In contrast to teacher-center instruction, this individualized instructional method requires teachers to: expend more energy and concentrated effort, have a stronger grasp of the subject matter, keep more complex records, and adjust to being facilitators rather than the center of attention. Appended are sample copies of a master schedule, a long-term contract, a student checklist, and a grade record sheet. (MLF)",

To help construct a model for examining the process of leader succession that specifies a number of major school process and outcome variables associated with such succession, a literature review of succession factors based on two fundamental categories proposed by G. E. Gordon and N. Rosen (1981) is provided. The first of these categories, &quot;Prearrival factors,&quot; focuses on reasons for succession, the selection process, and leader reputations and orientations. The second category, &quot;Arrival factors,&quot; focuses on demography, school structures and processes, educational programs,  successor actions, community environment, and school effectiveness. On the basis of literature reviews on each of these factors, it is argued that principal succession may have only marginal effects on subsequent school processes, structures, and outcomes. In conclusion, three longitudinally based empirical approaches to administrator succession--qualitative case studies, actuarial studies, and naturally occurring field experiments--are recommended and Gordon and Rosen's recommendation that leadership succession research replace more traditional leadership studies is affirmed.

        "description":"Involving producing, analyzing, and using information, evaluation is the central discipline of the information age. Both traditional criteria for good evaluation and standards formulated in 1981 prescribe evaluations that are useful, practical, ethical, and accurate. The burning question in evaluation is the utilization of information for decision-making. Incidents from stories by Dr. Seuss exemplify three major barriers to the utilization of evaluation information: fear, methods madness, and dogmatism. Educators' fear of judgment can be dealt with by placing evaluation in a cultural context, viewing it as one of the many possible ways of looking at remedial education programs. Methods madness occurs when attention to measurement dominates the evaluation process and methods  become an end in themselves. The removal of this barrier lies in the current consensus that whether qualitative or quantitative methods are used, the methods must be assessed in terms of what questions are asked and what kinds of data are needed. Dogmatism in evaluation models and in preconceptions about what evaluation means can be countered by creativity, flexibility, situational responsiveness, and sensitivity to different ways of raising questions. Factors contributing to a high level of utilization of an evaluation exemplar are appropriate and relevant methods, active involvement of people affected, a clear focus to research, and clear action implications specified in advance.

        "description":"In response to the funding crisis generated in part by the &quot;Serrano vs. Priest&quot; decision and by Proposition 13, parents and volunteers in over 100 California school districts have formed tax-exempt nonprofit corporations to improve the quality of education by raising supplementary funds, usually through donations from parents of children in school. These educational foundations generally follow one of three models for deciding how to spend foundation monies: by allowing the school board to decide how to spend funds raised; by awarding minigrants, usually in amounts of less than $3,000, directly to teachers for proposed projects; or by developing joint funding priorities from input by both school board and foundation. Successful educational foundations in San Francisco, Laguna  Beach, and Hillsborough are described. While critics of educational foundations focus on their potential for interfering with equal funding measures, no one has yet challenged foundations legally or suggested reducing state aid to districts with successful foundations. Another concern is the possible participation of private interests, especially corporations, in school fund allocation. The paper concludes that educational foundations are an important means of regaining some local control of the schools and are likely to flourish. (MJL)",

The research was informed by a developing theory viewing receptivity, or variation in acceptable conditions of risk, as determined by the interaction of organizational and personal factors. The survey questionnaire consisted primarily of instruments used in prior studies, including the Bridges Receptivity to Change Scale and the Moeller Sense-of-Power Scale. Discriminant analysis showed that innovators were more receptive, experimenting, professionally active, and had a higher sense of power. Multiple regression identified personal and organizational variables predictive of  receptivity. Receptive teachers differed from innovators in their uncertainties about principal support and their power to influence school decision-making. Results included sex-based differences that precluded single group analysis of relationships among predictor variables. It is concluded that it may be possible to manipulate variables associated with receptivity to encourage teachers to assume the risks of change. (Author/MJL)",

The researchers polled all 153 Mississippi school board presidents and superintendents and a representative sample of 44 percent of each category of principals, using the Leader Effectiveness and Adaptability Description, a 12-item questionnaire on leadership behavior perceptions. The findings suggest that appointed superintendents have a greater consensus among superiors and subordinates on their leadership style  effectiveness, whereas no conclusive evidence was found to support the contention that a difference exists in the leadership style effectiveness of elected and appointed superintendents. Significant differences were observed, however, between superintendents' self-perceptions and the perceptions of their superiors and subordinates. The implication of these findings is that educational administrators need to cultivate self-awareness by means of communication and feedback with superiors and subordinates. (TE)",

The literature for comparative studies of inservice personnel (not student teachers) in elementary and secondary schools was extensively searched. The 19 complete and 4 in-progress studies reported are grouped as follows: (1) attitudes toward supervision, (2) effects of training, (3) personnel characteristics, and (4) student achievement. Eight studies examined teachers' attitudes toward supervision, comparing clinically and traditionally supervised groups or recording attitude changes over time. More positive attitudes were found under clinical supervision, but longer-term research is needed for conclusive findings. The six studies (including one in progress) on the effects of  training, although difficult to categorize due to varied training emphases, demonstrated a need for adequate training. Five studies (including one in progress) examined characteristics of teachers and/or principals using clinical supervision. This avenue seems unpromising, though research focusing on behavior may be of use. The final four studies (including two in progress) attempted to relate clinical supervision to student achievement. Because of the many conditions affecting achievement, this area is very difficult to assess; the two works in progress may be significant. (MCG)",

Conducted over a 3-year period, the study involved 20 randomly selected school districts in the Chicago area, including 23 schools, 62 classrooms, and 253 public school fifth grade students. Appendix B provides a sample of a complete parent interview; appendix C briefly examines resource allocations within classrooms. The report contains approximately 50 tables. (JBM)",

        "description":"To compete with other professions for the most able people, teaching needs a career ladder system for elementary and secondary teachers comparable to the peer review model offered in higher education. Such a system should consist of three levels. Following the initial, probationary position on the career ladder, that of beginning instructor, the majority of teachers would be appointed to the rank of professional teacher. The final step of the career ladder, that of master teacher, should command a significantly higher salary than that of the professional teacher and be accessible to a significant number of teachers. Master teacher positions should be announced like administrative positions; appointments should be made proportionately at the K-3, 4-6, junior high or middle school,  and high school levels by a career ladder review panel composed of respected teachers, administrators, and others appointed by the superintendent. State legislators should appropriate funds specifically to the career ladder/master teacher program to help ensure its success. Career ladder review panels should be established as quickly as possible to respond to laws currently being enacted. These panels should involve teachers extensively both in the establishment of criteria for selecting master teachers and in the process of selection itself. (JBM)",

        "description":"Educational Service Agencies (ESA's) are public education agencies that provide specialized programs and services to a group of school districts in a specified geographical region and to the state department of education. Most states have encouraged the development of ESA's that have either evolved out of county districts or have been created to provide technical assistance, innovation, economies of scale, or more professional service delivery to local school districts. This research examined nine ESA's in five states to explore the dynamics of successful intergovernmental collaboration. At the sites, 300 intensive, semistructured interviews were conducted with state education officials, state legislators, ESA staff, ESA board members, local superintendents, other local district  staff, and local school board members knowledgeable about the creation, growth, and performance of the ESA. Data from observation and organizational records were also collected. Results show how the external political and legal context influences ESA performance and how ESA managers respond to constraints in their environment. Findings will be of interest to scholars in the fields of educational policymaking, implementation, and organizational theory; to practitioners in state and local education agencies that have contact with ESA's; and to ESA administrators.

        "description":"Organizational cultures are systems of publicly and collectively accepted meanings, beliefs, values, and assumptions that a staff uses to guide its actions and interpret its surroundings. In an effort to suggest concrete ways a principal can change or maintain a culture, three important elements of a school culture are discussed: content, symbols, and communication patterns. Content refers to commitments and task definitions emphasized by the school, including values such as diversity, respect for individual autonomy, and commitment to high standards. Symbols of a culture are the means used to convey its content. These may include legends or stories; iconic physical objects such as flags, trophies, or even classroom furnishings; and rituals such as assemblies, teachers' meetings,  conferences, and other recurrent activities. Communication patterns help reinforce the cultural context carried by the symbols. To be effective, a principal must establish preferences for certain kinds of cultural content, reinforce it through the symbol system, and consistently communicate this culture in all of his or her interactions around the school.

According to the organizational stage theory being developed since 1974 by William Torbert, bureaucratic organization, which is characterized by an instrumental rationality that does not question its own foundations, is to be contrasted to \"high stage\" modes of organizing, which are both instrumental and self-reflexive. A prime example of one type of postbureaucratic \"high stage\" mode of organizing--that of the \"openly chosen structure\"--is manifest in the United States Constitution, which emphasizes a flexible underlying contract over rigid surface  structures, and in a business enterprise such as the Graphic Controls Cooperation. A more advanced postbureaucratic mode is that of the \"Foundational Community\"--exemplified by Jesus and his disciplines and phenomena such as Ghandi and the Beatles--which invites participants to join in a continuing process of foundation-shaking research. A third and even higher stage of organizing, the \"Liberating Disciplines\" stage, involves helping new generations of persons and organizations to develop to a level as high as that of the organizational leadership. History provides only shadowy examples of the third stage. (JBM)",

        "description":"Since 1980, Loevinger's Sentence Completion Test has been used to explore the relationship between ego development and managerial effectiveness in the context of Boston College's Masters of Business Administration (MBA) program. According to the theory of ego development developed by Loevinger and others, most adults either inhabit one of four distinct worldviews or are in transition between them. The four worldviews, in ascending order of maturity, are (1) opportunistic, (2) social, (3) goal-oriented, and (4) integrative. In contrast to the first three, all of which are to some extent blind to opposing worldviews, the integrative worldview recognizes the partial validity of each of the other three. The two most frequent transitions the research has documented are the&quot;analytic&quot;--between social and goal-oriented worldviews--and the &quot;relativistic&quot;--between the goal-oriented and the integrative. Although recent research indicates that persons with relativistic and integrated worldviews make the best managers, most MBA students fall into other categories. The results of individual and group feedback sessions--as illustrated by the detailed presentations in this document of four separate cases involving four different worldviews--tend to confirm the &quot;internal validity&quot; of the Loevinger measure in predicting the relation of worldview to behavior.

        "author":["Torbert, William R."],
        "description":"Educational research has thus far failed to greatly improve education because it is based on a model of reality that emphasizes unilateral control in both research and practice. Efforts to gain unilateral control presume that researchers or practitioners know what is significant from the outset, that they are essentially outside the situation they are observing or acting on, and that knowledge is to be used to implement a preconceived plan of action. Scientific research based on the unilateral control model seeks only to develop descriptive theories; when faced with the task of proposing alternatives to what it describes, such research fails because it does not reflect on its own assumptions. In contrast to the unilateral control model, which offers only a fundamentally  anti-educational &quot;reflective&quot; science &quot;about&quot; action, a new model is needed on how to conduct an &quot;action science.&quot; Such a science would consider the researcher to be an interactive participant, rather than a detached observer, in the situation under consideration and would welcome the possibility of change through dialog between the actor-researcher and others. Research, according to this new model of collaborative inquiry in the social sciences, would be regarded as an &quot;experiment-in-practice,&quot; an opportunity for studying the self as well as others that would require a new politics and a new ethics.

Elements of each component common to all eight districts under study are then listed, followed by three case studies of instructional information systems: a student achievement model, a school improvement model, and a staff development model. Then a three-step cost analysis procedure is described: (1) identifying the system to which costs are assigned, (2) identifying costs associated with the system, and (3) evaluating these costs.

The project features an ecological analysis of environments and subenvironments, development of prioritized objectives, normal developmental and cumulative skill building approaches, and an in-school social integration component which formulates strategies to increase social interaction opportunities. Strategies include providing social interaction training to nonhandicapped peers, severely handicapped learners, and regular teachers, and arranging environments to facilitate social interactions.

In the keynote address, Senator L. Weicker, Jr., cites damaging effects of cutbacks in federal funds for special education and rehabilitation. Papers by M. Reynolds, H. Hickey, and H. Richardson, Jr., address the current status of education, allied health, and pediatrics. Responding to the state of the art papers are a consumer, E. Ellis, and a parent, J. Wittenmyer. Four papers describe cooperative program initiatives that emphasize sharing responsibilities with and communicating information to other disciplines. Prior to summary comments from the  perspectives of education and allied health, forum issues and recommendations are considered in terms of obstacles to coordination and policy recommendations for national, state, and local efforts.

Twelve districts were visited, and both administrative and instructional applications of microcomputers were observed. Two major types of software--applications and systems software--are described, and the principle applications of microcomputers in special education instruction (computer assisted instruction, computer managed instruction, computer literacy, and computer science) and administration (word processing, financial, statistical, and graphic systems, and file management systems) are reviewed. A discussion on selecting and acquiring software addresses difficulties facing many districts in identifying  appropriate software and in increasing teachers' knowledge about educational software. Evaluation criteria for special education software is suggested, including flexibility, and availability and distribution of educational software.

Regular and special education operate fairly independently. Policy changes regarding IEPs are noted. IEPs are formulated to be both initial planning and instructional tools. Interviews and surveys were completed by 84 teachers regarding their concrete plans for newly admitted pupils. Teachers responded to questions regarding information available, information used, the content of the plan, educational goals set for students, teaching content of the IEP, instructional approaches and learning activities, planning of teaching materials, evaluation of the instruction, organization of instruction, and any needed adjustments of planning. It is concluded that the  efforts to develop IEPs with goals and methods based on pupil learning problems are unrealistic. (CL)",

Issues emphasized in planning the program were relevance, information, convenience, and feasibility of the workshop model. Two workshop goals were identified: (1) to increase the participants' comfort levels in their role with mainstreamed students; and (2) to provide strategies, materials, curricula, and alternatives for use with the students. Workshop content (including behavior management, information on student characteristics, and individualization) was identified by the inservice planning team, and the importance of using peer training and active learning  in the inservice sessions was stressed. Evaluation and followup efforts indicated that the program was successful. Examples of workshop activities are given to illustrate the approach and the materials used. Features of the model that may require modification in other sites are considered, including composition of the inservice planning team, content of workshop sessions, and evaluation strategies.

Exploration and mobility issues are critical, and the student must acquire personal awareness in respect to the environment before basic work tasks can be performed. Classroom adaptations that require the visually impaired child to develop independence in traveling are important parts of the curriculum. Many modifications require only portable and useable equipment within the classroom. Appropriate teacher training is another vital concern in the successful career development of visually impaired learners. (CL)",

        "description":"The investigation involved a comprehensive descriptive analysis of the reading and writing behavior of 13 upper elementary level learning disabled students. Data were collected on student responses to 11 language tasks, including drawing; forming letters, numbers, and their names; being read to; reading; and answering questions about reading and writing. Other tasks focused on the student's book handling knowledge and on specific reading abilities. Interviews and surveys were conducted to ascertain students' attitudes and concepts of reading and writing, parental attitudes and models of reading, students' developmental and educational histories, and home environments. Students' miscue analysis (i.e., deviations from print) of their oral reading and subsequent story retelling  revealed how effectively they utilized the syntactic, semantic, and graphophonemic language systems in relation to reading comprehension. The results indicated that these students' responses to written language could be analyzed, categorized, and qualitatively measured within a particular information processing, psycholinguistic paradigm. The implications focused on the practical implementation of whole language instruction and integrated activities into the urban elementary school special education curriculum and the learning disabled students' home environment. Appendixes include: The Parent Questionnaire; Parent Individual Questionnaire; Book Handling Knowledge Inventory; Concepts of Reading Inventory; Concepts of Writing Inventory; Reading Interview; Reading Miscue Inventory;  Evaluation and Worksheet; summary and Profile Sheet of Reader's Strengths; and Sample Lesson Plans for Comprehension.

The pragmatics premise is that all behavior reflects the individual's attempts to interact and communicate. The pragmatics perspective, then, considers the functional role of bizarre behaviors rather than a strictly behavioral dynamic view. A pragmatics-oriented assessment tool is proposed which groups functions of behavior into five main categories: requests, negations, declarations/comments, declarations about feelings, and non-interactive functions. Evaluators form and test hypotheses regarding function-behavior relationships based on examination of the context.  Interventions based on analysis fall into two general categories: communication training strategies and behavior management strategies. A case study illustrates the approach with a 7-year-old autistic child. Appendices list definitions of behavioral and functional categories. (CL)",

Data were collected on the motoric responses made by each student during a 45 minute snack session. In the one-to-three arrangements, the teacher instructed the students concurrently. In the one-to-one arrangements, the teacher instructed each student consecutively. Thus, during the one-to-one arrangements, a student received one-to-one instruction for a portion of the 45 minute session and was wheeled to a free time area for the  remaining portion. Results indicated that the students made more task-relevant responses and fewer counterproductive responses during the one-to-three arrangement than during the one-to-one arrangement when the data from the free time portions were included in the analysis. Discussion focused on the merits and limitations of one-to-one arrangements and the implications of these findings for the design of future research efforts. (Author/CL)",

        "description":"The study was designed to investigate transfer of training for a nonschool Domestic Training Site (DTS) to the actual homes of three severely handicapped students aged 9-11. Pre- and posttest measures were secured in both the DTS and actual homes. All instruction occurred in the DTS. Phase I was designed to investigate the extent to which the students transferred the responses to relevant cues acquired in the DTS to their actual homes. Although many responses were both acquired and transferred, they were not judged instructionally acceptable. Responses that were not acquired, and therefore were not transferred, became the instructional targets of Phase II. Significant skill transfer would result if a student were taught to respond to cues in the DTS that more closely approximated  those available in his or her actual home. This replicative strategy produced significantly greater skill transfer when compared to the original strategy used during Phase I. (Author/CL)",

The paper concludes with an analysis of ways to make determinations about educational priorities in domestic training. Four aspects of such a determination procedure are covered: (1) an inventory of skills required for specific tasks to be completed by nonhandicapped persons; (2) an observation of the student while he or she is engaging in the activity in the actual environment; (3)  an analysis of the performance discrepancies; and (4) an analysis of skills for which there are performance discrepancies.

SPI Ss and a control group of normal IQ Ss were taught new discriminations. After a 3-month break, the discriminations were taught with procedures, methods, and materials identical to the initial learning phase. Analysis of number of trials necessary to reach criterion for each of the discriminative stimuli revealed that, on the average, SPI Ss took longer to relearn the discriminations than they took to learn them intially. However, there was a wide range of individual variations. Control Ss relearned the discriminations in fewer trials than were required for initial learning. Findings  suggested that generalizations about regression among SPI groups are not warranted. For two SPI Ss discrimination relearning was not impeded by the time lapse any more than would be expected for normal IQ Ss. (CL)",

        "description":"Until the 1880s, the language of instruction and that spoken by students was dictated by the culture of the community. Although public officials advised immigrants to use American English rather than their mother tongues, no legislation was enacted mandating English as the official language of education. However, with sizeable groups of immigrants arriving in the late 1800s, political issues and xenophobia brought about federal legislation and legislation in 32 states mandating English as the only language of instruction. By 1920 and until the 1960s, testing in English was used for screening people for employment and voting. Based on public laws of the last 20 years and results of court litigation, it appears educators must be careful to avoid systematic exclusion of culturally  and/or linguistically different students from the learning experience due to either their inability to understand the language of instruction or the teacher's inability to appreciate their speech community. Although no student has a constitutional right to a specific educational experience, each is protected from denial of access to education because of language barriers. However, the tendency to Anglify students and eradicate language differences remains, preventing many students' full participation in the educational process. (MSE)",

It is also suggested that the ability to monitor in formal language styles may improve accuracy in less formal styles, based on existing research. More research is recommended to discover whether nonnative speaker styles stratify as clearly as do Labov's native speaker styles. It is suggested that Labov's monitor model is a more accurate representation of the process than Krashen's, giving these pedagogical implications: learning activities have a legitimate place in the foreign language syllabus; and the social situation of speaking can affect students' accuracy,  causing use and even overuse of the monitor in class. It is noted that despite the superiority of Labov's model in this respect, Krashen's acquisition-learning distinction, and the resulting mix of activities, is important in the language classroom.

With the monitor working at a low level, beginning writers can use their store of acquired skills, and with the monitor level higher, they can integrate their learned skills. However, when native or nonnative speakers' individual ideas are forced to conform to a prescribed format and formula, the writing loses its effect and its versatility. Students' anxiety about writing is often due to overactive monitors. In one developmental writing program for college-level students of English as a second language, all students' initial essays were in a formal style that sounded rigid and confused, with  grammatical errors profuse and syntactic and knowledge errors difficult to distinguish. Taught in the context of the above findings, the students became more comfortable with the task of writing and acquired fluidity and correctness. (MSE)",

The primary data are the times required to answer pairs of questions such as, &quot;Who is chasing the boy?&quot; and &quot;Who is the boy chasing?&quot; and their counterparts in Dutch and German. In the three languages, the corresponding questions express the same semantic content, but in three different syntactic forms. The subject/object functions are signaled by word order in English, morphology in German, and context in Dutch. By noting which of the forms is responded to more rapidly in each language, insight may be gained into the roles these three kinds of cues play in comprehension. Subjects were adults and 7-year-olds tested in  universities and schools in their native countries. Results showed that subject-questions are answered faster in Dutch and German, but object-questions are answered faster in English. It is suggested that this shows comprehension to be a highly interactive process drawing on multiple kinds of cues.

        "description":"Gender schema theory predicts that sex-typed people are more likely than non-sex-typed people to invoke gender in processing information. This was tested in a covert semantic classification task in which male and female college students selected &quot;and&quot; or &quot;but&quot; to conjoin pairs of personality traits from the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI). Use of &quot;and&quot; indicates the traits are considered to be congruent, and use of &quot;but&quot; indicates they are seen as incongruent. Sex-typed and non-sex-typed subjects, as determined by administration of the BSRI, equally conjoined gender-congruent traits with &quot;and&quot; and non-gender-congruent traits with &quot;but,&quot; with results predicted by the degree to which the traits were stereotyped as masculine. Subjects also conjoined pairs of traits that were congruent  or incongruent with respect to both the gender schema and the self schema. Both gender and self-congruity affected responses and, as predicted by gender schema theory, sex-typed subjects were more likely than non-sex-typed to select &quot;and&quot; for gender-congruent and &quot;but&quot; for non-gender-congruent pairs. However, the largest effect for all subjects was that of gender congruity. (Author/MSE)",

Common instructional objectives and materials were used by the classes, in different schools. All students and teachers were given the Group Embedded Figures Test to determine field dependence or independence as a measure of cognitive style, and student-teacher matches and mismatches were noted. Teachers' grade expectations of their students were compared with students' rankings on standardized French tests and analyzed statistically. Results showed that field-independent teachers tend to estimate pupil competence more accurately than field-dependent teachers. It is suggested that the mismatch of student and teacher  cognitive styles may create serious learning problems in the French classroom because of the nature of the learning tasks involved. (MSE)",

The study, which consisted of a literature review, a database review, a series of seven workshops, and consultation of a national advisory panel, is summarized. It was found that more needs than opportunities for materials development exist. The most wanted opportunity was more training in microcomputer-assisted instruction. The most-identified need was for more courseware, beyond the over 500 packages already available in 14 languages. Existing courseware was found to consist primarily of drill and practice and tutorials, with the remainder in games  and simulation. Teacher preference was for drill and practice. Need was expressed for more prepublication quality control and improved evaluation and dissemination for teachers. Computer magazines were the main source of evaluations, with foreign language professional journals carrying little information. Teachers wanted cultural and civilization materials in addition to language skills materials, and were interested in open-ended or modifiable programs but not in the use of authoring languages. Better voice quality in the output of peripheral devices was also desired. Recommendations are made for software development, teacher training and support, developing capabilities, and the role of schools in influencing software development. (MSE)",

Overall, it was found that the program is: highly varied, with an emphasis on meeting individual students' needs; emphasizing English instruction, but with many projects making heavy use of the native languages; implemented successfully but in need of more staff training and parent participation; and only partially institutionalized locally, with Title VII remaining the primary source of funding.

Arguments favoring multicultural education are increasing in both countries, and the need for a multilingual curriculum and parent involvement are also recognized. In 1981 Britain's School Council undertook a major program to offer assistance in the form of resources and guidelines to teachers wishing to extend the native language skills of their primary students. Teachers developed instructional materials promoting intercultural communication, and materials for other teachers, especially those not speaking the students'  native languages. American programs and publications have focused on similar issues in minority language instruction. However, developing a unified policy in conditions of wide diversity is a complex undertaking, involving immigrant parent attitudes, minority isolation, discrimination, and economic disadvantagement. American school districts are choosing a middle ground, allowing students to retain literacy in their native languages while providing English instruction. As the debate continues in both countries, more research, curricular materials, and teacher education are needed. (MSE)",

Few of the total number of eligible schools in a state, however, actually confer degrees.

The Student Support Sources model uses readily available data sources to simulate the processes by which family and student resources and financial aid are allocated to different types of students enrolled at different types of New York State institutions. This analog model attempts to replicate the aid allocation process on a student-by-student basis. The model is written in BASIC for a Radio Shack Model III microcomputer system. It simulates resource allocation to categorical types of postsecondary students from the major support sources in New York State and calculates alternatively defined values for net prices facing these student types. To  calculate the dollar amount available to each type of student from each of seven sources of support, the model locates user defined price and resource allocation constraints and then adjusts the located dollar values to form a package of aid. Information is provided on the four main functions of the program, data requirements of the model, and limitations of the model. Illustrative data are provided, based on a comparison of dependent undergraduates who are campus-based aid recipients in the State University of New York and independent sectors. (SW)",

The sample of 25 male and 48 female students were 25 years of age and older, U.S. citizens, and had been out of school for 3 years. Students completed a biographical assessment, a \"barriers to learning\" instrument, Rosenberg's Total Self-Esteem Scale, and Canfield's Learning Styles Inventory. Ninety-five percent of the students returned to the university to broaden existing careers or expand into new ones. Sixty percent of respondents considered job/family/school time at least somewhat of a problem. Significant differences were found between males and females in learning style preferences. Females indicated a  significantly higher preference for using language as a media for learning, while males expected to obtain higher grades than did females. Fifty-three percent of the students indicated a strong or very strong preference for establishing their own learning goals within the classroom. The results indicate that while the returning adult students wanted to set their own learning goals, independent of the instructor, they valued the role of the teacher as content expert and climate setter.

Based on a telephone interview, findings include the following: many freshmen had little contact with major university services designed to orient them to the regulations and expectations of the university; many students were confused about requirements and other academic concerns; registration procedures were the most common problem area for students; while freshmen were knowledgeable about a number of student services (academic support, financial aid, and registration), they were not aware of other student services; many students dropped out for reasons unrelated to their  university experiences; some circumstances of dropouts were amenable to university intervention (e.g., need for financial assistance); and many dropouts were not counseled concerning their withdrawal. Differences among students who left school before the second semester and those who re-enrolled were examined. The experiences of nontraditional students (e.g., older students and minority students) and those of the more traditional freshmen were also compared. (SW)",

Burnout may occur with individuals who work with other people and who give much more than they get in return. Symptoms may include lack of enthusiasm for work, a sense of helplessness, and frustration. Physical changes occur during stress, and psychological stress involves both the environmental stimulus and the individual's reaction. The Person-Environment Fit Model, a theory of stress, describes the interrelationship of the person and the environment. The model maximizes good fit to minimize work stress and contribute to the individual's total personality growth and self-esteem. Certain personality characteristics may predispose an individual  to burnout, while certain work environment factors also contribute to stress and may lead to burnout (e.g., role dynamics, occupation, job satisfaction, career paths, and the organization itself). Information is provided on sources of stress related to students, colleagues, and to the administration. Tactics to prevent or relieve burnout are suggested that entail certain skills, including personal management skills and relationship skills. Organizational prescriptions are also addressed.

In the second paper, forecasts are presented of population-to-primary care physicians ratios in U.S. counties over the 1982-1994 period. The forecasts are based on an econometric model developed by the Modeling and Research Branch of the Office of Data Analysis and Management, a federal agency. These forecasts do not provide estimates of physician needs in shortage areas because the  majority of shortage areas are not whole counties. Therefore, the third paper went beyond the county-level forecasts to project rates of change in population-to-physician ratios for subcounty shortage areas and to calculate future needs based on the current shortage area designation criteria. Assumptions underlying the forecasts of the econometric model are also identified, with attention to projections of the supply of physicians at the national level and the county level projections of population and income.

Specifically, technical documentation is provided for the projections to 1990 that are presented in &quot;A Report to the President and Congress on the Status of Health Professions Personnel in the United States&quot; (HE 017 122). The model is based on the assumption that recent and current patterns of health services utilization, employment, and productivity will continue into the future. Population is separated into 40 subgroups characterized by the attributes of age, sex, and family income. Twenty categories of health services are covered in the model, and several types of medical office and hospital  utilization are developed. Nursing home care, dental care, drugs and laboratory services are included. The services of optometrists and podiatrists are treated both internally and separately from the model. The model examines 28 types of health personnel, and employment in the overall health care industry is related to specific services. Assumptions relating to population, price, and utilization are discussed. The derivation of the health personnel matrix is covered, along with methods/results for allocating specific kinds of care.

The following specialties were analyzed: family practitioners, internists, cardiologists, pediatricians, orthopedic surgeons, and emergency physicians. A case-mix index was created to measure the degree to which physicians concentrated on cases typical of the work of their  specialties. In addition, a severity-complexity index was formulated to indicate the seriousness of each patient's presenting condition. Inferences based on the findings include the following: raising physicians' fees is not likely to increase the supply of physicians services already in an area; and increasing the use of aides will not allow physicians to see significantly more patients.

Ideas were obtained from excellent teachers about what they did that led students to rate them high on any of 30 questions about particular facets of their teaching. These ideas were then passed along to other faculty members who had been rated low on the same items by students in one of their classes. Selected ideas were described to these faculty in a teaching improvement consultation just before the next time they taught the same course. Ideas that interested teachers were discussed in detail. The faculty members made the decision about whether they would use a particular idea in the next offering of the course. At the end of the second  offering of the course, ratings by the new group of students were obtained on the same 30-item questionnaire. Ratings before and after the consultation on the items for which 10 or more faculty had been given ideas showed statistically important positive change. Ratings of overall teaching effectiveness were also compared. Appendices include: a student description of teaching questionnaire; a faculty self-description of teaching questionnaire; sample individual teacher description profile, a sample of 26 ideas, and information on the faculty sample.

It was found that 285 of the respondents enrolled in CLA for fall 1982, and 57 did not. When asked their reasons for enrolling or not enrolling, respondents most often cited the availability of a particular program of study, as well as costs and the location of the school. Respondents were also asked to rate CLA on 16 characteristics in comparison with other universities they knew about. Both enrollees and nonenrollees gave the university above average marks on 14 of the 16 characteristics. The two that were given below average ratings were availability of financial aid and housing. Highest ratings were given to academic  reputation and course availability and variety. Factor analysis suggested that the most important factor in determining ratings of the college was a campus environment factor (location, housing, social climate, student population). Students were asked whether various information sources had a positive or negative influence on their desire to attend the university. Results suggest a two-stage model of how potential transfer students decide about attending the university. Based on the research, seven recommendations for the college were offered. The questionnaire is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"This analysis of how the federal government might best promote excellence in education via instructional technology identifies strengths and weaknesses of instructional technology during the 1980's, indicates how technology might aid the teaching and learning process, and suggests how the federal goverment might best assist states and localities in utilizing technology to improve educational achievement. Definitions of terms are followed by a brief review of the role of the federal government in education from the 1960's to the recent return of educational responsibilities from the federal level to the state and local governments. Giving special attention to the role the federal government should play in promoting instructional technology, the remainder of the analysis builds on  these definitions and preliminary observations. Specific sections address early development in instructional design, a brief history of federal support for educational research and its consequences, current strengths and weaknesses of instructional technology, using instructional systems design in computer based instruction development, and the use of technology in instruction. Conclusions, recommendations, and a 42-item reference list are included. (LMM)",

        "author":["Clancey, William J."],
        "description":"This paper argues that an important design principle for building expert systems is to represent all control knowledge abstractly and separately from the domain knowledge upon which it operates. Abstract control knowledge is defined as the specifications of when and how a program is to carry out its operations, such as pursuing a goal, focusing, acquiring data, and making inferences; domain knowledge is defined as the facts and relations of a knowledge base, such as a knowledge base of medical information. It is noted that a body of abstract control knowledge provides a generic framework for constructing knowledge bases for related problems in other domains, and also provides a useful starting point for studying the nature of strategies. The idea of separating control and domain  knowledge is illustrated by discussing knowledge representation on three intelligent computer-aided diagnostic consultation systems, MYCIN, NEOMYCIN, and CENTAUR. The scientific, engineering, and practical benefits of separating control and domain knowledge are outlined and the difficulty of attaining this ideal design is considered. Also provided are a 19-item bibliography and a list of names and addresses of government and private sector research/information centers and personnel concerned with computer-aided instruction.

        "description":"GUIDON is an intelligent computer-aided instruction (ICAI) program for teaching diagnosis, which has been tested using the infectious disease diagnosis rules of the MYCIN consultation system developed at the Stanford University School of Medicine. GUIDON engages a student in a dialogue about a patient suspected of having an infection and thus teaches the student about relevant clinical and laboratory data and diagnosis of the causative organism. Without reprogramming, the program can discuss any diagnostic problem that it can solve on its own. Moreover, by substituting problem solving knowledge from other domains, the program can immediately discuss problems in those domains. This power derives from the use of artificial intelligence methods for representing independently both  subject material and general knowledge about how to teach. There are teaching rules and procedures for: determining what the student knows, responding to his/her partial solution, providing hints, and opportunistically interrupting to test his/her understanding. Experience with GUIDON reveals the importance of differentiating between causal and strategic knowledge in order to explain diagnostic rules and to teach a reasoning approach. These lessons are now guiding the development of new representations for teaching. A 13-item bibliography and a list of names and addresses of government and private sector research/information centers and personnel concerned with computer-aided instruction are provided.

        "description":"A study was conducted of the efficacy of two methods of teaching music bibliography to 80 undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Akron in Ohio. One group of subjects received only lectures in bibliographic instruction; the other group had the benefit of lectures and worksheet exercises, which involved location of publications and information by the individual students in the central and music libraries. The courses covered such topics as approaches to music research; the meaning of library terminology; use of the library; and utilization of dictionaries, style manuals, encyclopedias, bibliographies, indexes, biographies, catalogs, and periodicals. Undergraduate students were instructed in the use of basic music sources while graduate students were taught about  complex music sources and large indexes that include music subjects. Pretests and posttests of both groups, administered five times during the 15-week semester, showed that students who received the lectures and worksheets performed significantly better than students who only received the lectures. It was concluded that it is beneficial for music bibliography instructors to supplement lectures with worksheet exercises. This paper describes study methodology and results. A nine-item bibliography and copies of the pretest, posttest, and worksheets are also provided. (ESR)",

        "description":"Since 1978, annual studies have been conducted of the flow of transfer students from the California community colleges to the University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU). The studies have focused on trends in the numbers of transfers and the ethnicity, majors, and age of transfer students. Findings from the study of fall 1983 transfers, contrasted with findings from previous years, indicated: (1) more students transferred from the California community colleges to the UC and CSU in fall 1983 than in fall 1982, but the number enrolling in each segment was less than the number who transferred each fall term between 1970 and 1980; (2) for the UC system, the fall 1983 increase was 3.3%, while the increase for the CSU system was 1.5%; (3) significant increases  in transfers were found for 30% of the community college districts between fall 1982 and 1983; (4) for men transferring to the UC, engineering and liberal/general studies were the two fields in which the largest numbers had majors, while at the CSU, business and management majors ranked first among transfers of both sexes; (5) numbers and percentages of Asians, Black, and Chicano transfers increased between 1980 and 1983 at the UC, with Asians experiencing the largest increase; (6) among fall 1983 UC transfers, the ratio of men to women was 52 to 48 for all ethnic groups combined; and (7) CSU transfer students were generally older than UC transfers. Extensive data tables are appended. (Author/LAL)",

First, the mission, philosophy, and attributes of community colleges are discussed, and the argument is presented that access, linkages to the community, low cost, flexibility, adaptiveness to the needs of part-time students, and emphasis on teaching make the community colleges particularly inviting for women. Next, a profile of women community college students is presented, and services to women are examined in eight key areas; i.e., counseling programs/services, academic skills advisement and assessment, vocational and career  counseling, financial information assistance, family relations and parenting, job searches, direct services, and academic programs and services. The following three sections examine the participation of women as community college faculty members, administrators, and trustees, emphasizing the advances made by women in these areas, the discrimination that continues to exist, and the personal and structural factors inhibiting women's advancement. The final section discusses the trends likely to affect women's opportunities and achievements in the community colleges in the coming years. (HB)",

        "description":"Urban community colleges can be distinguished from other community colleges in terms of their settings, clientele, richness and diversity of staff resources, and importance to the segments of the population who cluster in major national centers of commerce and government. In light of their unique characteristics, these institutions require study as a distinctive subset of the larger community college movement to determine their goals and objectives and success in achieving them. The two fundamental criteria for determining this success are effectiveness (i.e., performing a legitimate function for which a need exists at some acceptable level of quality) and efficiency (i.e., producing at as high a level of output as possible with as low a level of inputs or costs as possible). The  main difficulty in determining the success of community colleges arises from different views of effectiveness. One view would link effectiveness to success in carrying out priorities that are similar to the priorities of those who pay the bill. Another view would maintain that effectiveness is measured by assessing the level of agreement among faculty and administrators with respect to their support for institutional priorities. Future research contrasting these views of institutional effectiveness may illuminate some of the conflicting forces with which administrators must cope as well as strategies available to reconcile them.

        "description":"A study was conducted using the parity-equity model to investigate variances in faculty salaries at North Dakota State School for Science. The parity-equity model specifies three constructs as determinants of faculty salaries: (1) rational equity factors, including years of professional experience, rank, degree, graduate faculty status, tenure status, years in current rank, and administrative responsibilities; (2) nonrational equity factors, including sex, age, years at university, a 9-month versus a 12-month appointment, and former administrative duties; and (3) marketplace influences, as determined by average faculty salaries by college and by department in eight land grant institutions. The study focused on determining the amount of salary variance attributable to these  factors; developing a parsimonious regression model of salary; examining the efforts of the independent variable on salary; developing a recursive path model of salary, a block model of salary, and a nonrecursive model of salary; and analyzing the decomposition of salary differentials. The study found that over 80% of the salary variance could be explained by the rational equity variables, with years of experience having the greatest impact on faculty salaries; and that nearly two-thirds of the $224 salary differential between men and women arose from labor market discrimination. The study report includes background information on the parity-equity model, details the statistical methodologies employed, and provides diagrams depicting the statistic models. (HB)",

Two types of attendance scheduling patterns were used: (1) a full-day, alternate-day schedule; and (2) a half-day, every-day schedule. A relative balance existed between children's age and sex in both schedules. Randomly grouped, the children were presented a lesson and interviewed either 1, 2, or 5 days later. Four standardized tests were also administered. Results demonstrated a drop in recall between the 1-day and the 2-day groups in all aspects investigated. The 5-day group performed better than the 2-day group on initial recall of lesson components, but not on recall of lesson component details (with the  exception of recall of a story). Three of the four standardized tests were found to correlate with children's recall ability. Implications of the study were seen to concern appropriateness of alternate-day scheduling for all children and the need to identify accommodations teachers must make in curriculum content and teaching methods.

        "description":"An ecological approach was used to gather data about properties of purpose, human behavior, and setting as they unfolded in classrooms. Participating were 11 elementary school districts in the Chicago Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area; districts were stratified by median family income (low, middle, high) and per pupil expenditure (low, high). Classroom transactions were analyzed by examining the activity structure and its activity segments. Activity structure within the classroom was defined as being the main tasks or types of activities in which the children and teacher participate. An activity segment was defined as a unique time block in a lesson occurring in a fixed physical setting. In the investigation, main variables of interest were segment properties and measures of  student involvement in segments. Observations were made of eight students each in math and social studies classrooms within each district. Findings indicated that children's involvement in math and social studies classrooms was virtually identical. Student involvement was related to type of pacing and cognitive level of segments. A clear pattern of increasing involvement as a function of cognitive complexity was found to be present in both sets of subjects, and children's average involvement was highest when they were working cooperatively. Further, the function of a segment in the activity flow had a clear impact on student attention. (Sample instruments, coding definitions, classroom descriptions, and tables of data are appended.)

Based on a weekend college concept, coursework was scheduled on five Saturdays, course assignments were related to programs directed by participants, and emphasis was given to business and computers. Persons eligible to enter the program had to (1) meet all university admission requirements; (2) have an undergraduate degree from an accredited college or university; and (3) be a director, assistant director, head teacher, or education coordinator in a child care facility or aspire to such position. Courses offered in the 36-hour Master's  Degree program were generally those approved in the Master's Degree program in early childhood education. A questionnaire was sent to all 27 program participants to obtain an indication of the relative success of the program and directions for program development.

        "author":["Flin, Rhona H."],
        "description":"Children's ability to recognize unfamiliar faces shows an unusual developmental trend: performance improves from 6 to 11 years, a temporary regression occurs at 12 years, and then recovery leads to adult-level performance. The first study described in this paper tested 80 children 5 to 11 years of age on a face-matching and recognition task. Results showed that age differences in face recognition are a function of encoding ability at acquisition and cannot be attributed to an age-related improvement in recognition or storage skills. Using a sample of 271 children 7 to 16 years old, the second study examined the effect of orientation on face recognition and found an inversion effect for children under 10 years and a significant improvement in performance for both upright and  inverted faces. This finding updates earlier results and indicates the following: (1) general pattern encoding skills contribute to the recognition of upright faces; and (2) young children's face encoding is orientation-sensitive. Using a sample of 142 children from primary 3, 6, and 7 classes and senior 1, 2, and 4 classes, the third study assessed the generality of the unusual regression at 12 years and found that a similar &quot;dip&quot; in performance also occurs for children's recognition of pictures of houses. These data suggest that children's recognition of faces and pictures may be essentially similar processes. The finding of a dip in children's picture recognition adds to a growing catalog of similar developmental regressions. Possible explanations for this temporary loss of ability are  discussed.

After the first section's brief introduction, section 2 explores the thesis that tests developed in terms of selection and inference may not serve current social functions of educational testing. To clarify this thesis, section 3 recounts an example of instrument development from the history of Project Follow Through, suggesting that the value of an instrument may be overlooked because the instrument is judged by criteria inappropriate to the original motivations behind its development effort. Section 4 attempts to go beyond the statement of the problem to suggest how thinking of a test as a source of individual learning might guide test development in  nontraditional ways. Section 5 sums up some of the possible connections between testing and various social functions, pointing to some alternate ways in which standardized testing may serve goals of evaluation. (RH)",

        "description":"Extreme environments, such as polar regions or space crafts, provide an analogue for speculations concerning the needs of, educational provisions for, and environmental impacts on ghetto youth in kindergarten through the third grade. This discussion first centers on the common qualities of an extreme environment (whether exotic or mundane): forced socialization, spatial isolation, depression, time elasticity, biological dysrhythmia, sociological dysrhythmia, increased free time, extremes of noise and silence, loneliness, fears of abandonment, anxiety, panic, information fractionalization, boredom, and inability to escape. These qualities are thought to offer specific intervention and prevention sites for the attenuation of environmental consequences. After exploring aspects of  stress management in relationship to the needs of the young ghetto child, the discussion shifts to consider optimal characteristics of the 21st-century citizen, notable cosmopolitanism, that can be nurtured in the early school years. The concluding discussion postulates essential elements in education for young children in the 21st-century. In addition to attaining knowledge of the range and scope of intellectual possibilities, it is argued that ghetto youth should learn the consequences of pride and flexibility and, especially in the areas of health and racism, acquire concepts and skills enabling them to more adequately control their destiny.

In each pair, the daughter was 9 to 11 years old, and the mother was divorced or living with her husband and employed or at home full-time. A total of 41 pairs were recruited from after-school day care centers, Girl Scout troops, and other sources within an affluent southern sector of the San Francisco Bay area. Mothers and daughters independently completed parallel forms of a 29-item questionnaire measuring communication, affection, and shared activities. Four separate scores for each of the three variables were generated: one for the mother's self description, one for her description of her daughter, one for the daughter's self  description, and one for the daughter's description of her mother. Overall, results indicated fairly high levels of perceived communication, affection, and activity from both mothers' and daughters' perspectives. More specific findings revealed that (1) mothers report the relationship to be somewhat better than do daughters; (2) age differences among daughters exist (e.g., 10-year-old girls were perceived as less communicative and less affectionate than girls 9 or 11 years old); (3) marital status of mothers had no impact on the three variables; and, in terms of specific items, pairs in which the mother was employed full-time generally enjoyed the most frequent exchange of communication and affection and involvement in activities.

A total of 282 children were administered the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation - Behavior Children (FIRO-BC) test to identify and describe a stage-like progression in interpersonal behavior development. The data presented here failed to evidence such a progression. Rather, interpersonal behavior was largely unrelated to age until children reached 13, whereupon their profiles were significantly different from those of younger children. Similarly, gender-related differences appeared for the first time in 11-year-olds and increased dramatically by age 13. These  two facts suggest that interpersonal behavior may be more clearly related to puberty than has been previously supposed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The analysis presented here focuses on different problem situations extracted from everyday interactions in which individual developmental changes of the child interfere with well-established interaction patterns of the family. These problem situations require conjoint mastery of two objectives: (a) successful integration of the child into the family system, and (b) adaptation of the interaction patterns of the family to the new abilities and needs of the child. It is hypothesized that the &quot;course&quot; of development of a socializing family can be likened to the process of differentiation, specification, and hierarchical integration of a developing organism, according to Heinz Werner's conception of the &quot;orthogenetic principle,&quot; and it is suggested that this process can be confined  to a few &quot;critical&quot; situations, over a period of time, in which new problems associated with the development of the child emerge and have to be resolved. Proceeding from Havighurst's conception of developmental tasks, one can view such critical situations in which the family system has to be newly balanced as &quot;socialization tasks.&quot; Methodologically, this approach provides a basis for the comparison of families in their management of socialization problems in everyday situations. This approach may also lead to a new way of looking at the interplay between individual and family development. (Author)",

It was hypothesized that significant differences would be found in cue selection strategies of subjects at each grade and over all grades, with subjects exhibiting varying impulsivity and efficiency scores. Further, it was hypothesized that there would be a developmental trend in impulsivity and efficiency scores and on the cue selection preference task. Trends in cue selection for data pooled across all grade levels supported the hypothesis for an order by ranking of preferred cue (specifically, first letter, last letter, middle  letter, and word shape). An examination of the data for the amount of influence impulsivity or efficiency scores had on cue preference indicated that neither had any truly predictive ability. Results were interpreted to indicate that cognitive tempo is developmental in nature. It was concluded that, since visual cue preference is not significantly influenced by impulsivity or efficiency, the initial step in reading instruction could be the training of all subjects in initial position visual focusing on word recognition tasks.

The investigation included a national survey of state and local government initiatives and a special analysis of policies appropriate for New York State; inquiries were sent to approximately 500 state government agencies, to the mayors of the 100 largest cities in the United States, and to a network of community-based organizations and academic institutions that have been encouraging local employers to consider the family needs of their employees. Phone contact was made with policymakers to determine the reasons for a strategy's success or failure and to investigate the bases for  such evaluations. Respondents were found to view government variously as educator, broker, facilitator, and role model. Once the basic roles and strategies had been identified, ideas were presented for refinement to a group of state government, corporate, and community specialists.

Section 1 documents significant increases in the demand for care that will occur by 1990. Attention is given to factors affecting overall demand and factors bearing on federal support for dependent care services. Sections 2 and 3 describe a range of policy options designed to meet the increased needs for care described in the first section. These alternatives include direct expenditures for services, tax expenditures, or a mixture of both; some would increase federal costs while others would redirect the current level of resources. Section 2 specifically  describes the existing federal role and discusses issues related to changing that role, choosing between alternative options, and structuring federal programs. Section 3 focuses on child care options and options for care of the dependent elderly. Appended to the report are materials concerning estimation methods and supplementary views of members of the House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families. (RH)",

They established a control group and an experimental group of black and white residents of six small South Carolina communities. With the control group, they conducted a traditional approach to agency utilization and intervention, using group meetings, information dissemination, and encouragement. With the experimental group, researchers tested three experimental models of intervention: situational, cyclical, and interactional. The effectiveness of the treatment was apparently irrelevant. Early socialization experiences did not affect respondents' feelings of alienation and powerlessness, but race did. Instead of  feeling powerless or helpless individually, respondents tended to be thwarted in group efforts towards autonomy as local political institutions did not seem to support goal-setting behavior by limited resource groups. Researchers also measured the alienation of both groups before and after the experiment and administered the Srole Anomie Scale to 400 blacks and 400 whites in rural and urban South Carolina for purposes of comparison. They found that six hypothesized alienation dimensions were not substantiated. Recommendations regarding survey methods, participant-observation methods, unobtrusive measures, and the focus of research on interaction are included. (SB)",

Predominant types of collaboratives were state-mandated special district systems/educational service agencies, cooperatives formed by local districts, regional/decentralized state education agency systems providing no direct services, and other inter-organizational structures. Major benefits were improved cost efficiency ratios, continuing sense of local autonomy, easier compliance with federal special education  mandates, access to program/service specialists, better teacher retention, increased parent involvement, shared information for better planning, non-threatening information exchange, benefits of temporary systems, assessment/reallocation of resources, and conflict resolution. Problems were goal displacement, cumbersome bureaucratic/political structures, reduced district autonomy, inadequate district commitment to special education programs, inappropriate determinations of services, inadequate relationships between collaboratives and districts, staff supervision difficulties, personnel insecurity/dissatisfaction/attrition, difficulties with parents, conflicts between local district members, low district priorities for collaborative special education services, misconceptions about  interagency collaboration, fiscal inequalities, difficulties of administrative turnover, conflicting regulatory/monitoring service roles, and inadequacy of collaboratives for some cases of geographic/cultural isolation.

        "description":"The Border College Consortium (BCC), formed by six Texas, California, and Arizona community colleges along the United States and Mexico border, used a survey to derive a profile of its mathematics and science students. The profile revealed that both Hispanic and White students had difficulties with word problems and study habits, wanted mathematics study to be applied to everyday life, and wanted more patience and understanding from teachers. Hispanics, not so well prepared as Whites by high school science and mathematics courses, tended to enroll in remedial courses and to want more tutorial assistance and self-paced courses. White males were the best prepared group in science; White females had less difficulty with proper study habits. Females voiced more fear of science and  mathematics. The survey resulted in recommendations regarding reassessment of course and career prerequisites, BCC-public school links, increased parent participation, and staff development. Funded by the Ford Foundation, the BCC initiated the Mathematics Intervention Project (MIP) model to increase Hispanic mathematics participation. The MIP featured a multifaceted approach to faculty, counselors, parents, and students; close college collaboration; pilot projects linking BCC schools and local school districts; and binational collaboration. Currently, MIP maintains exemplary mathematics programs as resources for other BCC institutions. (SB)",

Funded by ETSU, the U.S. Department of Education, and the Texas Education Agency, the 7-year-old project began in cooperation with the Dallas Independent School District but expanded to other schools. During the year, the program cooperated closely with other universities, educational service centers, the Texas Education Agency, and other ETSU departments. Both observers and students rated degree and endorsement/certificate plans and instruction highly. Graduate courses and courses in Spanish and methods  received the highest ratings. Some undergraduate courses caused problems but only six received low ratings. Overall, the program showed improvements in instruction and degree design. Preliminary results of a survey of former students indicated they felt the program was strong, especially the Spanish, methods, ESL, and social studies courses. Their negative remarks were consistent with current student opinion. Appendices include the revised program of study, evaluation forms, and the survey. (SB)",

Six major areas of educational programs and services will be transfer/general education programs, occupational programs, developmental educational  programs, continuing education, cultural/community services, and counseling/student support services. The college philosophy embraces the concepts of lifelong learning, uniqueness of individuals, guidance of the community in determining the college mission, offering of educational services, and development of supportive and community services.

Four criteria are used to assess responsiveness of these programs: active user engagement, pluralism, affirmation of rural values and culture, and a stable institutional base with access to learning resource tools. Evaluation indicates that the three traditional providers have strong institutional stability but do not effectively meet the other  three criteria. The rural free university, based on the assumption that anyone can teach and anyone can learn, is assessed as being effective in the other three criteria, but with a weak institutional base. The rural free university model and its success in Kansas are described. Integration of the rural free university model into central operations of the Cooperative Extension Service, public libraries, and community service divisions in community college is suggested as being of great potential benefit to thousands of rural Americans, while greatly enhancing public perception and support for these institutions.

Each activity is arranged sequentially according to the skills involved and outlines specific objectives, procedures, materials required, special considerations, and evaluation techniques. The 12 daytime activities are determining time with a shadow stick, making and using a sundial, finding direction without a compass, using a watch to locate north, measuring angles with fists, measuring and locating sky objects on the azimuth, making a  simple astrolabe, measuring objects above the azimuth, using an astrolabe to measure the angle of the sun's rays, determining the &quot;altazimuth&quot; of objects, making a model of our solar system, and constructing and using a spectroscope. The five suggested nighttime astronomy activities are determining cardinal direction, using an astrolabe to measure the altitude of stars, observing apparent movement of stars, photographing star trails, observing meteors, and locating Polaris, Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, and Cassiopeia. Glossaries of stars, constellations, and terms are included, as is a bibliography. (NEC)",

To deal with rural development, the Rural Development Policy function has been elevated within the Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Administration has directed that USDA rural development grant and loan programs focus on the most rural communities and  that farming be treated as an integral part of rural development. The Administration will rely heavily on the private sector for development initiatives. Responsibilities of the Cabinet Council on Food and Agriculture have been expanded to include rural development, the Office of Rural Development Policy has been established, and the Advisory Council on Rural Development Policy has been announced. Participation in rural development policy formation will be sought via Advisory Council input, public hearings, national interest group input, and the direct participation of certain states and communities.

        "description":"The 75 Metis of Mission Metis, Alberta, exhibit three general types of linguistic behavior according to age. Traditional Metis, over 50, are trilingual in English, French, and Cree. Those aged 30-50 speak English and some Cree and understand but do not speak French. Those under 30 speak English. The Mission Metis English and Cree are not exceptional but the French is idiosyncratic as seen in the affrication of dental stops, vowel raising, treatment of gender, and expression of possession. The idiosyncracies suggest the existence of discrete sociolinguistic niches along a continuum characterizing lifestyle and social aspirations, as illustrated by three linguistic case histories. Traditional Metis use French and Cree as personal codes and English as a transactional code. However,  they attach no prestige to any language and apparently have no favorite, thus accepting trilingualism as the basis of their identity. Their speech events take place most commonly at home and in the bush. Traditional Metis frequently demonstrate code-switching and code-mixing, especially at the morphological level, as illustrated in three narratives. Despite parallels, Mission Metis people are different from Cajuns. Their education should stress literacy and cultural maintenance through traditional skills, bodily expression, and oral narratives.

The nature of language use must be documented and assessed to ascertain whether tribal members, particularly children, possess native language skills consistent with the body of knowledge that tribal communities wish to pass to future generations. The guide presents factors for American Indian language groups to consider when selecting and/or refining existing instruments and developing new instruments for assessing oral language proficiency including: documenting language usage among community members and the sequence of child language acquisition; identifying phonological, syntactic,  and semantic components of a language; defining proficiency; determining dimensions of bilingual measurement; considering cultural, age, linguistic, and technical appropriateness of testing instruments; establishing a language data base; choosing testing approaches (discrete point, integrated, direct rating, self-rating, or observation) and techniques (natural communication or linguistic manipulation); developing instrument administration skills; and pilot testing, field testing, and norming instruments.

However, individualized programs present particular difficulties in establishing this line of causality. When the program is the same for all individuals, everyone receiving the same intervention, then the conceptual structure is also the same for everyone--a common ground exists for the nature of the intervention, the outcomes, and the variables. With individualized programs, the specific interventions, outcomes, and rationale may vary from individual to individual. The common ground is now moved to a different level--the  program has a common process for generating a conceptual structure for an intervention with each individual case and a common interest in how well the goals of each intervention are met. As a result, the evaluation of the program as a whole must try to integrate the findings from a set of disparate &quot;programs,&quot; all having disparate measures of outcome goals. This paper attempts to define some of the difficulties inherent in these circumstances and to describe their impact on the evaluation for a particular individualized program. (Author)",

        "description":"Thirty grade 4 subjects were individually tested on a digit span test of working memory capacity (Case and Kurland) and the Reading Span Test (Daneman and Carpenter). The Reading Span Test was administered using sentences at a grade 2, grade 4, and grade 6 reading level. It was predicted that, as the decoding demands of the stimulus sentences in the Reading Span Test were increased, the amount of working memory capacity available for other reading tasks such as comprehension would decrease relative to a subject's working memory span as measured on the digit span test. This hypothesis was confirmed , providing support for the predictions of the LaBerge and Samuels model of learning to read. The results further support the Case, Kurland and Goldberg argument that working memory  capacity is a function of the interaction between the amount of central capacity required for processing operations and the amount of working memory capacity left over for storage. However, these conclusions need to be qualified by the observation that sentence reading time and word meaning knowledge were not controlled in this study. (Author/PN)",

The current instruments for measuring clinical problem-solving skills, however, are unable to differentially assess the hypothesis generating ability. For assessing this particular capability a new test is described. It is based upon exposing the examinee to an unrealistic, hypothetical, and thus unfamiliar context. A wide range of alternative data are presented, from which the examinee is required to choose those which fit his or her hypothesis, avoiding internal inconsistencies. Construct validation, both discriminant and convergent is presented, demonstrating independence of the test on the depth of the knowledge of the content areas from which it is derived; at the same time achieving  significant correlation with the scores on patient-management-problems (PMP). This later correlation increases as the PMP further diverges from the recognizable reality. Some variations of the &quot;unrealistic simulation approach&quot; are proposed. These may correspond with the various stages in the medical education. It is suggested that this test be used as a supplementary to the PMPs. (Author)",

Students were chosen because some aspect of their group testing on presentation formats was provocative (e.g. high spatial score, but low reading comprehension score; high drawn score and low verbal score, etc.). Nineteen non-learning disabled (LD) students from grades 4-5 and 21 non-LD students from grades 6-8 were chosen. In addition, 11 LD students from grades 4-5 and 20 LD students from grades 6-8 participated. Two different protocols, with five separate procedures each, one for grades 4-5 and another for grades 6-8 were devised. Each procedure was structured to reveal a different aspect of the children's problem solving processes. The  reported results are for the non-LD grade 4-5 students. Results imply: (1) that the pictures alone give a strong sense of the structure of the problem, and (2) that even after reading and thinking about problems the student generally cannot recall all the important information once the problem has been removed from view (i.e., students tend to focus on the data at the expense of the problem.

Individual raters may be more stringent or lenient than their colleagues. In this medical school setting, multiple raters evaluated each student. To reduce the influence of \"error\" due to differences among raters, each rater was assigned a handicap score which was calculated in three steps: (1) identify the cohort of students observed by the rater, (2) calculate the mean of all faculty ratings for that cohort (grand mean) and the mean given those students by the rater, and (3) subtract the individual rater mean from the grand mean. Analysis of the \"original\" and \"adjusted\" ratings for two academic years indicated no differences in overall mean and standard  deviation. Generalizability analysis indicated an improvement equivalent to increasing the number of raters per student by 50 percent (i.e., the variance component due to error was reduced by about 33 percent).

The purpose of this study is to describe: (1) the ways that adults prepare for the test; (2) the test performance of population sub-groups, and (3) the test candidates employment and educational outcomes 18 months later. Approximately 80 percent of the candidates prepared in some way for the test. In comparing those who prepared and those who did not prepare in any way, there are significant differences on age, gender, highest grade completed, and race. Performance on the test is significantly related to: highest grade completed, grades while in school, reason for taking the GED test, race, and reason for leaving  school. Test scores are not significantly related to age and gender. In addition to the 71 percent who passed the test initially, another 15 percent did so in the subsequent 18 months. About half of the sample indicated that the test helped them qualify for a job. Nearly half the group either are students or have been students in the 18 months following the test. GED candidates typically become students in two-year colleges and on the job training programs. (Author/PN)",

Based on the assumption that to measure effectiveness, one must measure a wide variety of school factors, the paper presents a broad perspective on measurement problems and dilemmas in analyzing norm-referenced test data and data obtained through interview, self appraisal, and observation concerning ll7 elementary schools. Trend analysis, two forms of residual gains analyses, traditional ranking, and expert judgment methods are compared. Data suggest that school level residual analysis appears to provide the best approach to selecting schools. The individual level residual scores yield a list which overlaps with the school level approach. Trend analysis  is the most conservative and yields the fewest schools (which are also identified by residual score analyses). Expert opinion does not correlate positively with residual or trend analyses. Analyses indicated few consistencies over time. The authors conclude with two alternatives--either schools are not consistent in their impacts from year to year or their metric is suspect. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"The study investigated whether school administrators (n=128) implicitly perceive the &quot;types&quot; of evaluators proposed by Meltsner (1976) when they consider evaluative information. One simulated evaluation report was written to represent each evaluator, differentiated from one another by their norms, expectations, motivations, and training. Two pilot studies were conducted to assess the validity of the simulation materials. Graduate students were asked to read all four reports to identify which &quot;type&quot; each report represented, and isolate which report features led to their decisions. Administrators were then asked to indicate: (1) the similarity of the report to their school system reports; (2) evaluator fairness; (3) technical competence of the evaluator; and (4) evaluator awareness  that political considerations sometimes affect program decisions. Finally, administrators were asked to make a policy recommendation regarding the program's future. Results indicate that administrators do perceive evaluator types when they consider evaluative information presented in reports. However, the results suggest that administrators are more attentive to the technical merit of reports than they are to the evaluator's political sensitivity, as indicated by the homogeneity of the subjects' perceptions of the political sensitivity of the various types of reports. This attention to the technical has been suggested in earlier research. (Author/PN)",

The students were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. Students in the experimental group were instructed on those skills outlined by Millman, Bishop and Ebel which are independent of the test constructor. Control subjects received information on the college's mathematics programs for an  equivalent period of time. All subjects were administered the computation scale of the College Guidance and Placement Program (CGP). Based on the results of the predictor test, subjects were placed in either a Basic Skills or Algebra course. A total of 159 subjects completed the courses.

As measures of divergent production, the study employed Guilford's Ideational Fluency and Consequences Tests. The Risk-Taking Scale from the Jackson Personality Inventory and two items  from the Choice Dilemmas Questionnaire were selected as measures of risk-taking. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between the Attitudes Toward Testing Scale and all measures for women and men.

        "description":"Sixty-five hour-long, topic-centered interviews were conducted with site-level administrators at elementary schools in a large urban school district to explore the relationships between evaluation information and other inputs into decision-making. The interviews focused on specific program-related decisions and sought to recreate the decision-making process as clearly as possible. These decisions sequences were analyzed to explore the relationship between the type of decision under discussion, the types of personnel who were involved, and the types of information that were utilized. The study found that personal opinion, rather than specific pieces of information dominated the decision process. In particular, evaluation data were mentioned only infrequently. However, when the  decision process was subdivided into four stages--problem recognition, decision-making, ratification and dissemination, it was found that evaluation played a significant role in the problem recognition stage. It was also found that increased evaluation use was related to greater personal commitment on the part of key administrators. (Author)",

        "description":"The Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) Task Force on Higher Education and the Schools calls for states &quot;to consider the feasibility of developing a regional assessment of teacher selection techniques&quot; (SREB, 1981). This recommendation reflects concerns about the need for: (1) more states to develop new teacher certification tests, and (2) applicants to be given a state's required test if they have already taken and passed another test required elsewhere. The Task Force strongly endorses a policy of requiring minimal competency of teacher applicants on content areas. The issue of whether there is a relationship between content mastery and the ability to &quot;put it over&quot; continues to be debated. This examines the relationship between the Georgia Teacher Certification Tests (TCT)  and the corresponding area tests on the National Teacher Examinations (NTE). A second part of the study examines the relationships between the TCT scores and the ratings on the Georgia Teacher Performance Assessment Instrument (TPAI), and the scores on the NTE and the TPAI ratings. The existing research base is not consistent as to the relationship between teacher testing and student criterion, or teacher performance assessment and student outcomes. Previous research and this study tend to support the idea that a teacher's knowledge base, as measured by a paper-and-pencil test, does not have a linear relationship with the ability to &quot;put it across.&quot; (Author/PN)",

This study demonstrated how surplus behavioral incidents scaled during the development of Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (BARS) can be used effectively in the evaluation of the newly developed scales. Construction of scenarios of hypothetical incumbent job performance and alternative rating instruments makes fuller use of behavioral incident item pools that result from BARS development procedures. Ratee (hypothetical incumbent) performance levels are known from the scale values of items chosen to depict ratee performance and the relative accuracy with which raters may use newly developed BARS can be evaluated in comparison with alternative formats developed as part of the  evaluation process. Secondly, the study adds to the literature concerned with comparisons of rating formats in terms of their psychometric properties by contrasting the sole effects of rating format upon the psychometric quality of resulting scales. Again, BARS was an effective format for the rating of the individuals' performance. Finally, the virtue of rating accuracy as an evaluative criterion for assessing the psychometric quality of performance rating scales was extolled. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"Earlier content analyses showed that the match between content covered by textbooks and tests varied as a function of the particular textbook and test a teacher was asked to use. This study tried to determine if the congruity in textbook-test content varied as a function of different styles of textbook use. Using year-long case studies of seven teachers as a guide, five distinct styles of textbook use were identified. These ranged from a page-by-page progression through the book to the selection of only those lessons that conformed to a management-by-objectives system (MBOS). The match between content covered on each of five standardized tests and the lessons covered by each usage style of the Holt fourth-grade mathematics textbook was determined. The results support two  important conclusions: (1) when a MBOS serves as the core of an individualized approach to instruction, low achievement students may suffer serious handicaps in their opportunities to learn content covered on standardized tests, and (2) overall levels of student performance on standardized tests of achievement may be relatively insensitive to variation in the content of classroom instruction resulting from differences in how teachers use textbooks.

The major emphasis has been methodological rather than substantive. The primary purpose has been to describe, evaluate, and recommend alternative concepts, methods, and techniques that enlarge capacities to understand and shape processes of knowledge use and school improvement. This project focuses on three core methodological problems: the criterion problem in knowledge use, the multiattribute problem of meanings attached to knowledge, and conceptualization and measurement in the knowledge transactional problem. Procedural inventory, typological procedures and analytic procedures are discussed as research  objectives. The approach employed to realize these objectives may be described as a form of methodological triangulation: documentary and archival search; pooling, selection, and analysis of procedures; and network consultation, conferences, and workshops. The project results are summarized around five sets of methodological findings: reproducibility, reliability, and validity; knowledge use as a criterion; formal classification schema; generative classification schema; and sociocognitive grid procedures. Appendices contain an annotated bibliography of working and occasional papers, a sample procedure abstract, a sample study profile, and frequency distributions for study profiles. (Author/PN)",

Ninety-five students were assessed in regard to mathematics achievement, attitude towards mathematics, and attitude towards elevation at the beginning and again at the termination of the 12-week trimester.  Overall, students obtained higher achievement scores when evaluated using a criterion-referenced method keyed to the specific performance objectives of an individualized instructional program. Students evaluated by criterion-referenced methods demonstrated significantly more positive attitudes towards the subject than did those middle school students evaluated by norm-referenced methods.

Section two reviews characteristics of the suburban school district studied and characteristics of the school system which appeared to influence parent participation in major issues (budget controversies, school board elections, facilities, school community relations). In sections three through five, the history, personnel networks, and social characteristics of several suburban parent  groups are then reconstructed and interaction settings and resources mobilized by these groups are described. The remainder of the study focuses on the urban research, with section six detailing methodological criteria. Sections seven and eight compare variations in parent participation levels in the five urban sites, and provide researchers' and community organizers' comments regarding the parent participation data. Implications of the study's findings for policymakers, administrators, and parents are discussed in section nine.

        "description":"The study described in this summary explores school and community factors that encourage parent participation in decisions that affect the quality of children's schooling. Its primary objective was to identify and compare factors that foster parent networks around school issues in suburban and urban areas. Five groups mobilized by middle class parents in the early 1970s to promote reforms in a suburban New York school district were identified, and their role in fostering school related networks was reviewed. Next, a description of formal arrangements that allow for parental involvement in this school district were contrasted to opportunities for minority parent involvement in schools in five Chicago neighborhoods. Based on differences in parent participation in the two study  areas, several recommendations were offered: (1) provide support for independent groups that are interested in reforming schools; (2) develop new procedures to represent and validate parental concerns; (3) implement training programs for parents to increase their access to new ideas; and (4) foster clarification of parents' role and promotion of meaningful parent participation by administrators and school personnel.

During 1979-80, 228 Samoans, 2,122 Cook Islanders, and 224 New Zealanders of European heritage were selected from within the same working class neighborhoods of Auckland, New Zealand. These groups were interviewed in their native language about their social and familial contacts, employment experiences, education, and general coping and adjustment patterns. In the paper, the experiences of one Samoan couple are presented, in order to describe the adjustment of Pacific Islanders to  life in their adopted land. Three adaptation strategies (kin reliance, peer reliance, and self reliance) are discussed, and the consequences of these strategies for ethnic minority immigrants are considered. (GC)",

The goal of the study was to ascertain whether students are resegregated in schools through these mechanisms. Data were obtained from 1,318 schools nationally as part of the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of the High School Class of 1972. Analysis of the data shows that: (1) white students in desegregated schools participate less in extracurricular and social activities than those in all white schools; (2) black students participate more in such desegregated activities as athletics, drama, and music, while whites are more active in  honorary clubs; (3) blacks are less likely to enroll in academic or college preparatory programs in both segregated and desegregated schools; and (4) interracial contact is diminished in desegregated schools because of the use of tracking or ability grouping procedure. Alternative measures to promote student heterogeneity are proposed. Appended to the report are statistical tables. (Author/AOS)",

Reynolds reviews the drafting of the Constitution and notes that the Constitution wronged blacks when it accorded them a fractional status of free persons. The doctrine of &quot;separate-but-equal&quot; dictated public policy for over fifty years until it was struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional in the 1954 &quot;Brown vs. Board of Education&quot; decision, he observes. The &quot;Brown&quot; decision and subsequent legislation such as the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Reynolds suggests, were intended by Congress to be colorblind. Thus, he contends, it is the Reagan administration policy to  enforce the civil rights laws to their maximum extent and to consider &quot;affirmative action&quot; to be discriminatory if it bestows advantage on members of a particular group. An alternative policy to racial quotas in educational and employment situations would be to evaluate people of all races on the basis of their qualifications, Reynolds suggests. (AOS)",

Health is cited as a variable that can lead a family into poverty and inhibit its movement out of it. Some of the study's findings are: (1) increases in unwed motherhood and marital breakup contribute to poverty among Black and Hispanic women; (2) teenage pregnancy prevents young mothers from acquiring marketable skills; (3) family socioeconomic status has a moderate influence on children's future economic status; (4)  many women who head households remain poor despite their work efforts; (5) occupational choice affects a woman's earnings; (6) the lower the level of educational attainment of women, the higher the poverty rate; (7) inequitable access to vocational training presents barriers for minority women; (8) disadvantaged women lack access to health care; (9) linguistic barriers present problems for Hispanic women; and (10) poverty, particularly among single parents with poor education, is a major cause of emotional stress.

Another school of thought criticizes this theory for not showing the relationship between schooling, productivity, and earnings, and holds that for minority workers, program completion may be more important than the number of years spent in a program. A review of the literature on minority income distribution shows that blacks earn less than whites and women less than men; that education, sex, and age influence posttraining earnings mainly through occupational choice and literacy; and that social welfare status influences earning through occupational choice and time in program. A New York City study conducted to evaluate  the effects of education on posttraining wages among participants in a large manpower program finds that: (1) When marginality factors--conditions which may result in underutilization of a particular group of workers, such as physical or mental disabilities, discriminatory practices, characteristics of some occupations, or lack of skills or training--are at work, literacy has no effect on wages; (2) when faced with limited occupational opportunities, individuals with higher social welfare status tend to prefer lower status trades which require less training time; (3) educational marginality neutralizes all other variables in posttraining earnings, and, under conditions of marginal education, neither literacy nor occupation contributes significantly to the determination of wages; and (4)  employers reward the possession of a diploma more than the number of years in training.

A secondary purpose of the publication is to provide counselors with a compendium of occupational information compiled from a great variety of sources. The publication is organized in three volumes. This first volume, divided into three parts, contains the 1980 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes and titles in a four-level  taxonomy. Subtitled &quot;Occupational Statements,&quot; this volume is primarily designed for counselor/client use. It also contains information useful to people using the SOC to classify information obtained from surveys, preparing information for a CIDS, or for other technical purposes. The Occupational Statements contain a brief guidance-oriented definition for each of the 834 categories contained in the 1980 SOC. In those cases where a SOC category has been assigned Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) codes and titles, this additional information is included: sample work activities, hours of work, travel, and sample places of work. [This document contains part 3 of volume I--SOC numbers 6699 (precision production occupations) to 9900 (miscellaneous occupations); and a numeric index.]  (KC)",

        "description":"Economists agree neither on the means for assessing education's contribution to the growth of productivity in the national economy nor on the role of education in the recent slowdown in productivity growth. Consequently, neither economists nor educators can confidently recommend a set of policies that will clearly lead to increases in education's contribution to productivity growth. In response to this need, the National Institute of Education (NIE) has begun a research program to explore the links between education and productivity, to develop improved methodology for conducting research in the field, and to examine a range of policy alternatives for increasing education's contribution to productivity growth. As a first step in addressing these research problems and policy  issues, the NIE has commissioned six papers and plans to hold a conference in 1982 on education's contribution to productivity. Titles of the papers commissioned include &quot;New Research Approaches to Measuring the Impact of Education on Productivity: The Growth Accounting Framework,&quot; by Dale Jorgenson; &quot;Guides for the Development of Educational Policy: Equity, Efficiency, and the Measurement of Educational Quality,&quot; by W.

        "description":"Recent research leaves unsettled the role of education in the recent fall of productivity growth. Part of this dilemma is due to two major methodological problems in the estimation of education's contribution to productivity growth: the methods for deriving weights for returns to education, and the interaction among education and other factors influencing the quality of labor. To reduce these problems, researchers must derive alternative methods for growth-accounting research. New policies to increase productivity should be examined within a context that accords high priority to two policy concerns: equity and the level of government expenditure. Other areas to be examined include the disaggregation of returns to education, links between education and work, federal spending on  education, education and taxes, and the effectiveness of schooling. The National Institute of Education can play one of several roles in resolving these methodological issues. For example, it could focus on a reexamination of the role of education in growth accounting, or it could examine a large number of the research issues relevant to the role of education in productivity growth, including the policy issues mentioned above.

By allocating the growth of the quality of labor input among the contributions of changes in the composition of the labor force by sex, age, education, employment status, and occupation, researchers were able to separate the contribution of education to economic growth from the contributions of other changes in the composition of the labor force. They concluded that investment in education is very large by comparison with labor market input, amounting to 5.13 times labor input in 1973. The rate of growth for investment is twice as high as that of labor input. Investment is highest for elementary education, next to highest for secondary education, and lowest for higher education.  Another finding of the study is that while the value of investment per student in constant price rises for males and females with elementary and secondary education, this value peaked for college trained males in 1955 and for college trained females in 1950.

        "description":"The human capital and growth accounting approaches to measuring the benefits of education both have serious weaknesses. Like other goods and services, educational services have effects on the economic well-being of individuals and families. Because the economic well-being effects of education include private marketed and non-marketed impacts as well as external or public impacts, estimates of the aggregate value of educational services must encompass all of these. To obtain a true understanding of the effects of education on productivity, various non-marketed, private returns must be considered, including the health and fertility effects of education, effects on the value of home time of mothers, effects on criminal behavior, and effects deriving from the impact of education on  the earnings distribution. A review of the existing literature on the effects of education in these areas supports the hypothesis that the provision of education services is likely to have a larger impact on economic well-being than is estimated by studies based upon the direct returns or growth accounting frameworks. Therefore, researchers must develop means to measure the full willingness to pay for educational services. (This study is one in a series on the relationship between education and productivity.)

Another area that must be considered is the effect of education on the rate of technological change and on capital formation. Still another factor that must be taken into account is the organization of education and research and development (R&D). Because education contributes to economic growth by influencing the rate of diffusion of innovations and because American educational institutions influence the diffusion process directly as well as via their students, government and industry must cooperate to develop R&D efforts that focus on future demands and training programs for researchers and scientists. Among the types of studies that are particularly  needed are the following: econometric productivity studies that include education; investigations of the educational level of inventors; examinations of the effect of educational levels on the nature and shape of learning curves; analyses of the relationship between the educational level and speed of response to innovations; and constructions of simple mathematical models relating educational levels, the rate of diffusion of new technology, and the rate of economic growth.

Teachers' time also was recorded by two observers during 99 class periods over two weeks. Some of the findings include: (1) about 56 percent of the class time was spent on content by the students, although teachers allotted about 67 percent of time for content; (2) the proportions of time usage varied  greatly among the individual classes as did the amount of time students were absent or late; (3) the amount of time on task spent by students varied widely--more among students in different classes than among students in the same class; (4) students spent the greatest time on task in long classes (146-176 minutes) with fewer students; (5) trade and industrial classes and agricultural classes had greater time on task than the marketing and distributive education classes; and (6) on the average, teachers spent 29 percent of their time providing one-to-one instruction. The study concluded that no typical class represented all vocational education classes.

Data were gathered through the Regional Occupation Planning and Evaluation System (ROPES) in which detailed information on the employment of 163 occupations in 82 industries and information on the distribution of expenditures for defense among supplying industries were combined within a system of economic forecasting models to estimate future employment by occupation nationally, by state, and for each of 70 major cities. Some of the conclusions reached by the study were the following: (1) between 1981 and 1987, the total employed labor force will increase by more than 7 million jobs; (2) one of every five new  jobs will be required to supply goods and services to support increasing expenditures for defense; (3) in nearly all industries, defense-related employment will account for over 10 percent of net new jobs; (4) in some industries, total new defense-related employment will be greater than total net new jobs; (5) shortages in trained workers may occur for computer personnel, engineers, technicians, electronic wirers, aircraft mechanics and assemblers, pipefitters, machine tool operators, machine tool setters, punch press setters, and other metalworking operatives; (6) the impact of defense expenditures will continue to be concentrated in California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut; and (7) there may be a  critical shortage of workers in 28 skilled categories in 24 major metropolitan areas.

A literature search focused on word processing and the medical and allied health professions, word processing and business education, and futuring of and changes in the secretarial science curriculum. Questionnaires to identify various aspects of word processing in the medical and allied health professions were mailed to 101 hospitals and 417 physicians within the five boroughs of New York City. Some study participants were also interviewed to gather in-depth data on operating installations. The major finding was that word processors were not currently being used as much as was thought. With the high percentage of hospital personnel and physicians who indicated they were  considering the use of word processing equipment and with decrease in their prices and future increases in technology, use of word processing was predicted to increase in the future. Larger hospitals tended to use word processing equipment. Investment costs hindered use in smaller hospitals. Another major reason for non-use was physicians' unfamiliarity with word processing equipment. A curriculum for secretarial science majors with a concentration in word processing was suggested that included courses in computer literacy and word processing supervision as well as management, simulation, and field experience.

        "description":"This study was conducted to provide information on equipment needs, the extent of planning to upgrade equipment, and technological advancements necessary to continue providing quality training to entry-level students and incumbent workers. The results were based on a 98 percent return from 72 area vocational-technical school directors, 17 community college occupational deans, and 12 administrators of vocational programs at selected comprehensive high schools in Pennsylvania. Data were collected by mail from July 1982 to January 1983. Some of the results of the study were as follows: (1) in general, vocational education institutions do not use a formal or systematic process to replace and update tools and equipment; (2) federal, state, and private contributions account for about  50 percent of the funds used to purchase new equipment; (3) the current mean dollar value of tools and equipment used in vocational schools is $1.812 million; (4) 53 percent of the schools' tools and equipment are over 10 years old, and about one-fourth of them are no longer current with the technology used in industry; (5) $77 million would be needed for updating tools and equipment, but only about 14 percent of that amount is spent for this purpose annually; and (6) almost all vocational schools surveyed are involved at some level in implementing or planning for the 13 selected advanced technologies (e.g., microprocessing technology, word processing, energy-saving devices, robotics, etc.) Based on the study, implementation of a systematic long-range plan for keeping tools and equipment  current was recommended and more long-term and private funds were suggested as sources for funding such a program. The survey instrument, a list of participating schools, and summary tables are appended. (KC)",

        "description":"One aspect of a nationwide survey dealt with the extent to which the attribution theory might be used to help account for students' perceptions of their successes and failures at employer sites. The study involved 1,102 high school students enrolled in 18 experience-based career education programs in 16 states. Respondents indicated the degree to which various worksite factors contributed to an excellent or poor working experience. The six most highly rated reasons why certain job-site experiences resulted in excellent learning (success) were related to effort and skill. The six most highly rated reasons why experiences resulted in little or no learning (failure) were related to boring aspects of the tasks themselves. Students from some ethnic backgrounds rated easy and  challenging tasks significantly differently than did those from others. Major differences among students were also found when considering grade point average and grade level. Results showed that some variables from previous attribution theory research--effort and ability--were found to be important as reasons given by students to explain success, but not failure, at employer sites and supported previous findings that different types of students have different attribution patterns.

        "description":"Oregon created a model for measuring secondary vocational education effectiveness and developed and field tested instruments to carry out the design. The five key features of this model were student and societal needs, program components, program outcomes (occupational, educational, ancillary, and societal), multiple perspectives for judging effectiveness (students, program completers, staff, parents, employers, and advisory committees), and multiple contexts in which vocational education operates (individual vocational education classes, and program, state, and multi-state efforts). Assessment instruments based on the key outcomes of vocational education were developed and pilot tested for vocational and general education students, employers, vocational education staff and  administrators, parents, and vocational education advisory committee members. Through a study, the instruments were then administered to a sample consisting of 12 schools in Oregon. Some of the results included: (1) students entered a vocational education program primarily because of an interest in the area; (2) as compared to nonvocational students, vocational students rated themselves as better prepared in work-related skills; (3) parents and vocational education teachers and coordinators rated students high in vocational and technical skills needed for entry-level jobs; (4) parents were generally satisfied with their child's vocational program; and (5) teachers and students rated the quality of instruction high. Some special analyses are reviewed, and recommendations for vocational  education improvements are suggested. (YLB)",

        "description":"Students and teachers at a suburban high school in Oregon and employers associated with cooperative work experience (CWE) and experience-based career education (EBCE) programs were interviewed regarding youth responsibility. Specific focuses were perceptions about the meaning of responsibility, youth attitudes regarding being given adult responsibility, kinds of student responsibilities, elements of the school and workplace contributing to or reducing the opportunity for young people to demonstrate responsible behavior, and ways to modify school and workplace settings to enhance responsible behavior. Students felt responsible persons were reliable, trustworthy, and dependable. Teachers indicated responsible students used time well and were punctual. Employers' ideas of a  responsible worker centered on punctuality, self-initiative, and loyalty. Students perceived the greatest help in becoming a responsible person as coming from home, work, and school, in that order. Students rated themselves as most responsible at job sites, somewhat lower in the CWE and EBCE programs, and lowest in their regular classes. Staff ratings correlated significantly only with the students' self ratings at the job site. Implications were that teachers, employers, and parents must provide young people with opportunities to make decisions and that effective strategies for developing responsibility in young people should be explored.

        "description":"Two separate research projects were undertaken in Georgia and Texas to examine the current and future needs of older adults for functional literacy and to analyze the involvement of adult basic education (ABE) programs to better serve those needs. The projects involved literature reviews; mail-out surveys; and one-on-one interviews with senior citizen nutrition site directors, ABE coordinators, ABE teachers, and older adults enrolled in ABE programs. These two research projects were analyzed from the perspective of obtaining key strategies for effective instruction in functional literacy skills and student recruitment strategies. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that subject matter must be relevant and taken from both the ascribed and expressed concerns of older adults.  Furthermore, ABE instructors would do better to use an individualized, personal approach with older learners. When feasible, classes should be conducted in facilities designated for older adults. Results of the Georgia and Texas projects also point to several areas in which further research is needed. Particularly needed is inquiry leading to the development of an operational definition of literacy for the undereducated older adult. In addition, research measurements must be developed with and for the older adult; and, when research involves an intergenerational sample, a proportionate number of adults should be included in that sample.

(Technological update refers to the technical, as opposed to pedagogical, knowledge and skills needed by vocational teachers to provide their students with up-to-date preparation for the current technology of the world of work.) Information on approaches now in use to update teachers' technological knowledge and skills was gathered from literature, knowledgeable observers, and vocational education institutions and agencies. Criteria related to cost effectiveness, complexity, and locus of administrative control were then applied to select those approaches that  appear to offer promise. Two different kinds of approaches were identified. First, six specific delivery techniques were described: work experience internships, university and college course work, workshops, industry observation, education and industry staff exchange, and part-time employment. Second, three different types of update programs were described: local programs, nonlocal programs, and industry training and update programs. Major barriers or facilitators include availability of funding, motivation, and policy. The result of the study is nine descriptions of promising approaches to the task of providing technological update, each approach with its own potential for providing update, administrative characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and barriers and facilitators. The  study recommended research to determine responsibilities of the various agents (teachers, administrators, state and federal departments of education, and business and industry) for updating and providing sufficient funds to carry out updating programs.

The mastery learning model does not, however, provide a conceptual framework through which teachers can make decisions about the alternative instructional methodologies to offer each student. A second type of learning theory is known as &quot;learning styles.&quot; A variety of models have been developed, all of which are based on theories of cognitive style. The combination of a learning styles model and the mastery learning concept holds great promise for improved programs that can provide for the learning styles of  the learners. A need exists, however, for content specification. In vocational education, the competency-based vocational education (CBVE) model provides the content specification required for the implementation of an effective, success-oriented program. Several such programs have been implemented in vocational-technical institutions around the country. (Two such programs are in White Bear Lake, Minnesota and in Appleton, Wisconsin.) Both of these programs involve assessment of learning styles through computerized educational cognitive-style mapping of students and matching them with alternative instructional methodologies prescribed by the resulting cognitive map.",

The methods used to develop BLS occupational employment projections are first described: projection of the labor force based on population projections by age, sex, and race; projections on the state of the general economy and on industry employment; and use of an industry-occupational matrix to convert industry employment figures that show the proportion of total employment in each industry by occupation. Assumptions upon which the data are based are discussed, and these factors that cause imprecise projections are cited: imperfect statistics, business cycles,  political and social events, analytical judgments, and geographical differences. Uses of projections information by counselors, educators, and others who help people choose a field of work are considered as well as uses by national, state, and local officials who plan education and training programs. Information is provided about the format, purpose, and frequency of the BLS publications that are sources of occupational projections data. A recommendations section urges vocational educators to use and report their satisfaction with occupational projections data in program planning. (YLB)",

Employers benefit through the ability of cooperative education programs to adapt to labor market needs, through reduced recruitment and training problems, and through the satisfaction gained from helping to educate students. The essential elements of cooperative education programs include (1) alternate or parallel periods of instruction in school and supervised employment, (2) written training agreements, (3) vocational instruction related to the job and the student's academic study or career goals, (4) carefully planned alternation of study and work, and (5) students' employment and compensation. These activities are guided by  a cooperative education coordinator--an individual who functions in each of the five areas into which the program is organized: administration, coordination, guidance, public relations, and professional development. Issues and recommendations for future cooperative education programs include increased funding, required preservice and inservice training for coordinators, and an expanded role for advisory committees.

The work force and work place of the 1980s are undergoing changes that could result in ever larger scale joblessness. These changes include technological changes, change from a goods producing to a service economy, geographical shift of business, mismatch of graduates to job openings, population changes, and increase of women in the labor force. National economic policies associated with human resource development that have contributed to the imbalance between worker supply and demand are minimum wage, full employment, and investment credit. Bringing education into better  alignment with the work place is the priority need in reducing worker displacement. Human resources development can be improved through a comprehensive career education and vocational training program. New approaches to reducing worker displacement should be aimed at meeting employer and worker needs through improved cooperation between industry and the schools. The occupational planning process must be improved; the response to local worker displacement should be decentralized; and workers should develop transferable skills. (YLB)",

A growing demand for workers in the coming decades may lead to the need for incentives to encourage older people to remain in the work force. Personal and financial factors, as well as work place conditions, may reverse the early retirement trend. An examination of the legislation, funding, programs, and services for older persons shows attempts that have been made to clarify issues relating to older citizens and to provide them with assistance. Ways to eliminate age discrimination are legislation and funding and solutions in the work place, such as  alternative work schedules; job redesign, transfer, or reassignment; phased retirement; or part-time employment. The main issue vocational educators must address is improved vocational skills-training opportunities for older adults. Employers can implement progressive policies extending work group opportunities to older workers and provide continued education and training opportunities. (YLB)",

        "description":"Efforts of immigrant and minority youth to make the school-to-work transition successfully are adversely affected by social, psychological, cultural, familial, and individual factors. Complicating their struggle to attain a sense of competence and personal identity, which is common to all youth, are &quot;outsider status,&quot; language problems, and cultural misunderstandings. Social factors that affect their successful transition are the degree of the society's egalitarianism, cultural pluralism, racism, sexism, and class stratification. Also significant are the society's attitudes toward youth, political stability, governmental structure, legal system, rate of economic growth, and employment structure. Social institutions, especially schools, can help students make the transition.  Preschool programs provide support that pays off in the early working years. The quality of primary, secondary, and vocational education is especially significant for immigrant and minority youth. Educational issues surrounding these populations include the provision of bilingual instruction, including vocational education in a second language, instruction based on individual learning styles, multicultural curricula, culture-fair testing and assessment procedures, integrated schools, comprehensive educational programs, and nonstereotypic treatment. Programs to prepare youth for work must deal with basic skills, occupational skills, and occupational information. Work experience programs, on-the-job training programs, &quot;second chance&quot; programs, and employment services are also needed.  (YLB)",

In response to this need, a task force on high technology was established to examine the following topics: the development of a perspective or a futures scenario for Ohio; human resource development of providers and consumers of postsecondary educational services; equipment and capital plan expenditures; and implications for program development, approval, and evaluation. After analyzing Ohio's strengths and weaknesses as well as its opportunities for and the threats against its successful transition to a high technology information  society, members of the task force concluded that the evolution of a technetronic society in Ohio can develop in a systematic way if the state can manage the issue of intellectual capital formation. What is needed is a conceptual framework to guide Ohio and its institutions in such a way as to focus science and technology on the individual and quality-of-life issues. In response to this need, the task force has developed a detailed plan of action concerning strategic planning, human resource development, capital planning, and program development and review for the 1983-1985 biennium.

During the study, 18 knowledgeable individuals were identified in 18 states to prepare papers on the need for and the problems of technological update of secondary and postsecondary vocational and technical teachers. Analysis of these papers indicates that large numbers of vocational and technical teachers at both the secondary and postsecondary levels are considered to have substantial or critical need for updating their knowledge of the technology of their field. Furthermore, this need exists for all occupational service areas examined. Despite the fact that a variety of approaches to  technological update are being used, lack of resources in terms of money, time, and links with external organizations are seen as major barriers to the successful technological update of teachers. Among those approaches considered to have the greatest potential for successfully updating programs are workshops, conferences, and seminars as well as collaborative activities and programs among schools, business, and industry for teacher occupational experiences and curriculum content revision. Particularly needed is an overall teacher update plan that provides for effective selection, application, coordination, and management of the above-mentioned approaches. (MN)",

The panelists concluded that there are six types of outcomes for vocational education: individual labor market-related and education-related outcomes, institutional labor market-related and education-related outcomes; and societal labor market-related and education-related outcomes. While research on the outcomes of vocational education usually looks at only one or two of these six outcomes, the public apparently considers outcomes in all of the six areas and performs a rough sum of the benefits of  vocational education. This broader evaluation of the outcomes of vocational education leads the public to desire more vocational education. Based on this realization, the panelists proposed a number of recommendations concerning future research and legislation dealing with vocational education. Included among these were calls for more research focusing on multiple outcomes and on the interrelationship of labor market- and education-related outcomes. Also, there were calls for federal legislation to emphasize outcomes that affect society as a whole, such as equity and productivity, rather than individual or institutional outcomes. (MN)",

The study combined a literature review; interviews with 274 individuals in 10 states involved in data production and use at the state or local level; interviews with agency and institutional representatives at local, state, and federal levels; and observations in 60 local training institutions or agencies. Multiple counting was found to occur as a result of duplicate counting within an institution and between agencies. Undercounting resulted from failure to secure data on the output of proprietary schools, and from lack of reports on public schools' vocational programs not in the state  plan and nonvocational programs producing trained individuals available for employment. (The report further describes the state reporting systems and the flow of data from the local institution to the federal level. Other findings are presented that deal with the human factors involved in the generation, collection, analysis, and use of occupational supply information.

        "description":"A strategy for increasing worker participation in an effort to remedy the problems of declining productivity and quality is the quality circles concept. The quality circles process involves small groups of employees who meet voluntarily on a regular basis to identify, analyze, and develop solutions to problems and to implement the solutions when feasible. The concept had its beginning in Japanese industry, using W. Edwards Deming's principles and practices of statistical quality control and Joseph Juran's &quot;total quality control.&quot; The quality circles movement spread to the Far East and then to South America and the Western world. Nine organizational prerequisites that must be present for success have been identified. Both management and quality circles members share in the  responsibilities of providing these. Key elements are management support, voluntarism, training, and union involvement. The quality circles concept combines behavioral science concepts and statistical quality circles analytical techniques. Three behavioral science theoretical bases form the foundation: participative decision making, goal setting, and team building. The vocational education system can facilitate the change to a total quality circles orientation by introducing and applying the concept. (Appendixes include quality circles tool skills and a list of organizations using the process.) (YLB)",

The use of unfounded beliefs or inappropriate rules causes people to fail to recognize that a remediable problem exists, to fail to exert needed effort, to fail to generate potentially satisfying alternatives, to choose poor alternatives, and to suffer anxiety over the inability to achieve goals. Troublesome career development beliefs are based on faulty generalizations, self-comparison with a single standard, exaggerated estimates of the emotional impact of an outcome, false causal relationships, ignorance of relevant facts, undue weight given to low probability events, and self-deception. Five major ways in which evidence about beliefs, thoughts, and thinking processes can be collected are  interviews, reconstruction of prior events, records of thought samples, inferences from behavior, and psychometric instruments. Evidence obtained from these samples of thinking may be used to identify thoughts at the root of problem behavior by examining assumptions and presuppositions of the expressed belief, looking for inconsistencies between words and behavior, testing simplistic answers for inadequacies, confronting barriers to stated goals, challenging the validity of key beliefs, and building a feeling of trust and cooperation.

        "description":"The feasibility of modelling the supply of 22- to 29-year-old enlistees was assessed. Key issues concerned the availability of data and the development of an appropriate methodology for making enlistment supply projections for 22- to 29-year-olds. The current status of supply modelling was reviewed, with particular attention being given to the decision context of the enlistment choice. It was found that ample data are available for modelling the supply of 20- to 29-year-old enlistees. Military, civilian, and civilian/military data sets were identified that would be useful for better understanding the enlistment decision. It was determined that it is feasible to model the supply of older-aged enlistees, and procedures for undertaking such supply modelling were suggested.  (YLB)",

Subjects for experiments 1 and 2 were 80 San Diego State University students in an introductory psychology course. Subjects for experiments 3 and 4 were 279 Navy enlisted personnel. In all experiments, subjects were randomly assigned to one of four groups: a read-only control group, a practice questions group, an instructions group, and a practice questions plus instructions group. The four experiments (1) compared the effect of instructions and practice questions on learning verbatim factual information; (2) replicated the procedures of the first, but used  paraphrased-comprehension questions instead of verbatim questions; (3) examined the effects of instructions and practice questions on learning as a conceptual classification task from the text; and (4) replicated the third experiment with revised instructions. Results indicated that instructions can be as effective or more effective than practice questions in learning from text, that instructions control/focus student processing and attention as well as do practice questions, and that the best instructional strategy is a combination of instructions and practice questions.

        "description":"Evidence suggests that the changes which have taken place in the educational background of the work force may have important implications for how organizations should be managed and for their effectiveness. More formal education may cause people to have different expectations and preferences with respect to work. This may lead to more upward job mobility both within and between organizations. In order to be more effective organizations will have to move to more organic and participative management styles. Three ways in which organizational design and management style can affect organizational effectiveness are individual performance motivation; existence of organizational communication, coordination, and control mechanisms that allow the performance of individuals to come  together in ways that produce an effective organization; and individual performance capability. All three of these conditions are needed in order for an effective high involvement system to develop. Although little research evidence exists on the effectiveness of high involvement work systems, some positive assessments have appeared. Ultimately, the participative management paradigm may be adopted not because of proof that it produces superior results but because of its suitability for the work force and work organizations.

        "description":"In the last 20 years, an increase in the number of working women has been accompanied by changes in the female labor force and in the concentration of women in particular occupations and industries. These changes have a profound effect upon women's earnings. The Current Population Survey (CPS) shows a wide disparity in the median earnings of women and men. More education usually translates to higher annual earnings, but at every level of educational achievement women's median earnings lag far behind men's. The 60-percent ratio in the national aggregate data shows a female-male wage gap or differential of almost 40 percent. Research has indicated that worker characteristics account for 44 percent of the female-male earnings gap and that the gap is reduced as more economic and  demographic factors are introduced into the analysis. Working women are concentrated in generally low-paying occupations in low-paying industries where they earn less than male co-workers. Women's median earnings in the high-paying wage and salary occupations are also substantially less. Available data suggest that differences in female-male earnings stem more from differences in occupational employment than from differences in earnings for the same job. (Eight tables are appended.)

A mastery test was administered to assess concept acquisition. The research issue was whether brain ERPs recorded while students are in the process of learning are correlated with their subsequent achievement and performance. Test items became criteria for multiple regression and discriminant analyses using as predictors ERP amplitudes that corresponded to specific concepts. One regression analysis indicated that ERPs recorded at the right temporal and parietal areas are significantly related to concept acquisition. Three discriminant analyses showed that ERPs evoked at the right frontal,  temporal, parietal, and occipital and the left parietal regions significantly distinguished below- from above-average concept learners. Poorer learners engaged the right frontal and temporal regions less and with greater variability than did better learners. The study established that the right frontal, temporal, and parietal areas are significantly associated with concept learning--not only left hemisphere regions as proposed in the popular asymmetric model of the brain.

Visual and emotional problems were the most common health conditions of those interviewed. Although some conditions such as allergies affected all ages, overall, the number of health problems increased with age. Sophisticated assistive rehabilitation devices were almost non-existent; no respondent had a modified vehicle. More than half of the respondents reported total family  yearly incomes of $6,000 or less, and the rate of full-time employment among work-age respondents was only 12 percent. Included among the ramifications of disabilities reported were emotional problems, difficulties with home and yard maintenance, and limited mobility both within and outside the home. Few respondents sought or received professional help with their problems. Furthermore, many respondents, especially minorities, were unaware of the service programs that are available to disabled workers. Based on these findings, researchers called for additional efforts to increase service utilization rates and to provide emotional support for disabled individuals and their families. (MN)",

The three chapters in unit 1 define independent living, identify the major historic events contributing to the development of independent living, and provide detailed information on significant legislation. Unit 2 addresses development and management of independent living programs. Its five chapters describe models for independent living programs; discuss generic services commonly found in independent living programs; consider staff positions, duties, and responsibilities; overview the role and function of the rehabilitation counselor in independent living settings; and  identify evaluation criteria. The first chapter in the closing unit focuses on vocational rehabilitation and reviews the rationale for the independent living rehabilitation services to be provided by state vocational rehabilitation agencies. The final chapter of the manual highlights a number of important concerns in independent living. The issues are phrased in the form of questions to stimulate discussion leading to identification of alternative solutions or recommendations. (Each chapter concludes with a summary and notes to the trainer.) References and an appendix listing training resources are included. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study examined career transitions within organizations. Developed and evaluated during the study was a model that views career transitions as a stress-coping process influenced by work and non-work factors. Data from organizational records, a questionnaire, and performance ratings were collected for 109 managers and professionals in a manufacturing firm and an osteopathic hospital concerning the relationship between career and personal transitions in their lives as well as the strategies they used to cope with any stress caused by these changes. Data supported the model in that individuals experiencing a large number of personal life transitions were more likely to adopt a symptom-coping strategy (as contrasted with a situation-focused strategy) for dealing with job stress  during the transition. Data indicated that major career transitions were associated with major transitions in personal life and suggested that a career transition could act as a trigger event for personal life instability. Based on the study, it was proposed that organizations examine the feasibility of career transitions other than promotion as a career management tool and that organizations begin to bear more responsibility for stress management. An appendix of scale items used to measure coping and personal life transitions is included. (MN)",

During the project, the author of the study reviewed literature pertaining to the past, present, and future of business, marketing education, marketing, and vocational education. In addition, he conducted telephone conversations and personal interviews with educators and business persons regarding the future of pre-baccalaureate marketing education. The author concluded that the present image of marketing and distributive education has been shaped by various factors, including the early retail and sales training, as spearheaded by Lucinda Prince; early federal legislation requiring enrollees in distributive education programs to be employed part-time; and  leadership provided by regional agents and program specialists in the Office of Education. According to the Marketing Education Association's mission statement for the 1980s, marketing education should be directed toward developing competent workers for marketing occupations, for improving the techniques of marketing, and for building understanding of the responsibilities that accompany the right to engage in marketing businesses in a free-enterprise system. Based on these findings, the researcher formulated seven major recommendations pertaining to the development of an overall conceptual framework for marketing education that would serve as the basis for a national plan for marketing and distributive education.

        "description":"From a national perspective, cooperative vocational education is becoming increasingly important. As the country changes from a manufacturing to a service economy, many traditional jobs are being eliminated, while new jobs are being created, especially in the information field. In order to prepare employees for these jobs, a partnership between the schools and the private sector is needed. Schools will benefit by providing quality education on the cutting edge of the new technology, and the private sector will benefit by getting qualified employees at less cost for recruiting and training. At the national level, Congress funds programs of national significance, which include (1) national discretionary projects, (2) the National Center for Research in Vocational Education, (3) six  regional curriculum coordination centers, and (4) the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee. These programs of national significance support the functions of applied research and curriculum development, demonstration, dissemination, and training. Through these programs, improvements can be made in education, including cooperative education. Research findings to date indicate that cooperative education leads to a positive attitude of students toward office occupations and higher job performance ratings from employers. Further efforts are needed to determine the effects of cooperative programs on productivity, minority employment, the work ethic, job satisfaction, employment of handicapped persons, high technology, entrepreneurship, and articulation from secondary to  postsecondary education. All signs now point, however, to the benefits of cooperative programs to the employer, to the students, and to the community. (KC)",

Through questionnaires, data were collected at the beginning and end of the 1981-82 school year from a sample of 1,135 youth participants of employability development programs from metropolitan areas nationwide, from nonprogram employed and nonemployed youth, and from worksite supervisors. The relationship between pre-program perceptions, hiring and disciplinary standards, and post-program perceptions was significant and positive. Personal characteristics related to perceptions of hiring practices were age, study (taking  courses in academic subjects), and work experience. Those related to perceptions of disciplinary standards were the amount of work experience and the youth's reservation wage (the minimum acceptable wage for future jobs). Firm and job characteristics were not related to changes in perceptions of the hiring standards. Those significantly related to differences between youth's perceptions and supervisors' reports of disciplinary standards were firm size, cost of equipment used, and wages. Differences between youth and supervisors on standards were significant but not large. The 17 hiring and disciplinary standards that youth consistently undervalued fell into three categories: basic academic skills, work attitudes and personal characteristics, and productivity.

Five dependent variables were classified as school-related behaviors: days tardy, days absent, number of extracurricular activities, transcript grade averages, and self-reported grades. Four career expectation variables were included: youth's educational expectations, youth's occupational expectations, parental educational expectations for youth, and parental occupational expectations for youth. Three waves of data were collected from 714 youths attending public high schools in Columbus, Ohio; 597 youths and their parents completed all three waves in grades 10, 11, and 12. Little support was shown for the general hypothesis that working interferes with  schooling. Data indicated that neither a linear nor a nonlinear effect of hours of work occurs for any of the school-related variables. Investigation of interaction effects revealed scant evidence that the quality of work, as indicated by job status, and hours at work interact to produce effects on school behavior. It was also found that working does not affect career expectations of youth or career expectations that parents hold for their children. (YLB)",

        "description":"Factors that affect work outcomes of high school youth and effects of the characteristics of the school that a youth attends on employer demand were studied. It was hypothesized that employers use the quality of the school as a proxy for accurate information about likely productivity of prospective employees. Four dependent variables were examined--hours of work per week, labor force participation, wage rate, and unemployment. A model of hours worked and labor force participation was derived from utility theory of labor supply. Data from 28,000 secondary and postsecondary seniors showed that wage and nonwage benefits of work tended to increase the supply of hours of teenage youth attending school. Commitment to schooling tended to reduce the hours worked. Empirical tests of the  school-effects hypotheses failed to support them. These results may have been due to the relatively homogeneous quality of high schools within the geographical limits from which employers typically hire teenage workers. Findings regarding the effects of other school variables were that attending a vocational or private school increases one's wages, cooperative education and work study tend to improve one's experience in the part-time youth labor market, and black students experience higher unemployment.

This paper reviews recent research in adolescent development as a major focus for determining the success or failure of specific practices in secondary schools. Factors of school effectiveness are examined in terms of their significance for the effective schools movement and for ways in which these factors may relate to recent research on adolescents. Conclusions are drawn about how the two areas of study address common issues as well as ways in which they diverge. The first part of the paper examines current literature to build a general conception of adolescence. The second part is concerned with major issues of adolescence and  their relationship to factors of school effectiveness. The third part seeks to determine the implications of these two areas for identifying desirable changes in secondary schools. Education in urban settings is also examined.

        "description":"Social and health service utilization have been the subject of numerous studies, but most have examined service utilization from the perspective of the type of service delivered to older adults. To determine the factors that predict overall utilization of services, data that had been collected in 1975 for the General Accounting Offices' survey of &quot;The Well-Being of Older Persons in Cleveland, Ohio&quot; (1,609 non-institutionalized adults) were analyzed. Using path analysis, predisposing, enabling and need factors were examined to determine their relationship to the use of formal and informal health and social services. Results showed that predisposing variables (age, sex, race, education, and marital status) had a small direct effect on utilization and an indirect effect through  their influence on subsequent stage variables. For the enabling variables (perceived income, income, and social support) only social support had an indirect and direct effect. Need factors were all directly related to service utilization. Perceived need was more important than all other predisposing, enabling and need factors. The findings emphasize the importance of perceived need and question the importance of predisposing and enabling factors in predicting service utilization. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"One approach to increasing our understanding of the rating process is to examine behavioral components of decision-making. Although observable rater behavior during appraisal is still removed from the actual contents of internal processing, these behavioral indices may provide important clues toward identifying determinants of rating success. To measure rater behavior during appraisal a methodology called Instantaneous Report of Judgments (IRJ) was developed. Rating behaviors which are believed to reflect important dimensions of rating ability were examined: (1) amount of information utilized; (2) sensitivity to differences between ratees; (3) sensitivity to ratee strengths and weaknesses; and (4) observational style. Several studies were conducted using the IRJ. The first set  consisted of basic descriptive studies of rater behavior during the rating process with the goal of identifying stable components of rating style. The second set involved construct validation of the IRJ procedure and rating data. Analyses of results from these studies showed that IRJ can provide reliable and valid data and that these behavioral indices shed some light on the underlying mechanisms of accuracy. (Author/WAS)",

Addressing the assumption that family members differ in their orientation to and dependence on other generations by virtue of their unique roles, three generations of women, 254 mother and daughter pairs, were studied for role convergence and the effect of role status on interdependence. The roles examined were marital status for the students, parenthood and work status for their mothers, and marriage/widowhood for the grandmothers. The components of interdependence in the mother/daughter relationship were aid (proximal and distal), contact (measured by frequency of visiting and telephoning), and attaching (dependence on a specific person for emotional support). Analyses of data showed that  middle aged women related similarly to their mothers and daughters regardless of role status, and widows were no more dependent on children than married elderly women. Role status was significant for the youngest generation in that married daughters exhibited greater independence from their mothers than did single daughters. (WAS)",

        "description":"A recent issue of importance in the vast literature on well-being and age concerns the factorial invariance of the construct across age groups. Current wisdom suggests that while differences in loadings exist among age groups, the construction of summary measures introduces little bias. To investigate age and ethnic variation in the meaning of morale, data on Blacks (N=413), Anglos (N=407) and Mexican Americans (N=449) were obtained from interviews which had been conducted with a larger sample of people living in Los Angeles County. Measures of three widely investigated causes of morale (self-assessed health, sex, and income) were included on the survey instrument. Evaluations of three latent structure causal models of morale were conducted. Each model was estimated separately  for Blacks, Angelos and Mexican Americans and for those aged 45-54, 55-64 and 65-74 within each of those categories. Analyses of results revealed factorial variance in the meaning of well-being across ethnic groups. In addition to factor structure, differences were uncovered for the causal significance of health and sex. Self-assessed health became less important with advancing age, and sex had markedly different effects for different age groups. The findings indicate that cross-ethnic comparisons of well-being which assume factorial invariance are conceptually flawed. (WAS)",

To examine the effects of sex and leader/subordinate role upon interpersonal sensitivity, female, male and mixed-sex dyads (N=72) were first observed in interaction and then asked to complete questionnaires. Data analyses showed that those in subordinate roles were more sensitive to the feelings of the other dyad member than those in leader roles. Subordinates were more sensitive to how the leader felt about them than to how the leaders felt about themselves and leaders were primarily sensitive to how the subordinates felt about themselves. While there was no main effect for sex, mixed-sex dyads were more sensitive than same-sex dyads, and  females were more sensitive to males than to other females. The results suggest these interaction effects provide evidence that sensitivity is an interactive process, affected by the respective roles of the interactants. (WAS)",

To determine what types of attributions observers make after the presentation of a sequence of behaviors, 135 college students were asked to make attributions about an actor's behavior after having been provided with category-based (group membership) and target-based (a prior behavior) information. The actor's behavioral freedom was left uncertain in order to determine whether observers would rely primarily on prior information or on the content of the behavior itself when making an attribution. Results showed that observers made a dispositional attribution even in those cases where possible constraints on the actor's behavior were indicated by the prior information. Only the confidence  ratings and the perceived validity of the actor's arguments were affected. The results indicate that when perceivers are given a series of behaviors to interpret, each behavior is believed to be high in information value even when prior behaviors and background of the actor indicate otherwise.

Relativistic operations are logical, cognitive operations which can be used as a system to relate, order, and select as more useful one of the many mutually contradictory but &quot;true&quot; formal operational systems. In terms of Piagetian theory they are a post-formal level of thought processing; in information processing terms these operations mainly determine what is included or excluded in &quot;problem-space&quot; by the problem solver. Relativistic operations make possible the analysis of such complex relations as interpersonal relations. To test the assumption that  these operations are present in the thinking of mature adults, male and female volunteers (N=79) aged 26-89 responded to written stimulus problems which demanded combinatorial reasoning with 2 or 3 variables. Responses were scored for the presence or absence of real-life formal operations as well as the presence or absence of relativistic operations. The results supported the assumption that relativistic operations seem to be used by many mature adults in logical problem solving. (WAS)",

Behavioral marital therapy uses communication skills training, contracting, and weekly homework assignments to help couples change specific behaviors in the clinic and at home. Interactional communications-oriented therapy provides feedback on current negative interaction patterns and suggests changes in couple behavior but does not use extensive behavioral rehearsal or specific homework assignments. Couples (N=36), in which the husband had recently begun individual outpatient alcoholism counseling, were randomly  assigned to a no-marital-treatment control group or to 10 weekly sessions of either a behavioral or an interactional couples group. Behaviorally treated couples improved more than the other couples on all the marital adjustment measures analyzed and more than the interactional (but not more than control) couples on drinking. In the year after treatment the behavioral group was still superior to the controls on marital adjustment but not to the interactional group and did not do appreciably better than the other two conditions on drinking adjustment.

Structural elements of our current economic system are identified as possible major stressors: (1) instability in the business cycle; (2) unemployment; (3) inequality in income distribution; and (4) fragmentation of the work process. Research is reviewed linking the economic cycle with suicide and increased psychological symptoms as well as physical illness. Intervention on the institutional level is suggested since these macro-economic elements appear to be more powerful than the individual coping  mechanisms of some demographic subgroups.

        "description":"There is a growing awareness among researchers that the magnitude of cognitive sex differences is affected by a number of subject variables. To examine spatial and verbal cognitive sex differences as a function of personal and family handedness, the 478 offspring who participated in the Minnesota family study and 454 offspring who participated in the Texas family study were tested. Results from these studies are contrasted with those presented by Hyde (1981) in her reanalysis of studies reviewed by Maccoby and Jacklin (1974). In aggregate, the results from the studies reviewed, which range in number of subjects studied from 44 to 45,222, show that the approximate magnitude of sex difference in spatial abilities is a .50 standard deviation (SD); the approximate magnitude of sex  difference in verbal abilities is .25 SD. Cognitive sex differences explain only a small proportion of the total variation among individuals; however, small mean sex differences are shown to generate large differences in the proportion of males to females at the tails of the distributions for spatial and verbal cognitive abilities. These results have practical implications for career counseling and the study of developmental reading disabilities. (Author/JAC)",

To examine the nature and extent of social integration, three age-segregated communitites, a Florida mobile home community, a Florida condominium community, and a community of detached units in Arizona, were examined. In-depth interviews with residents and staff, participant observation, and document collection, revealed that each community was tightly integrated, with members in constant contact. Residents identified strongly with their communities in a psychological sense, sharing similar values of health, sociability and leisure rather than success or material possessions. Although the three communities  varied in location, size and resident composition, age formed the basis of integration. Living among age peers reinforced a common set of values and interests shared by those in the same stage of the life cycle. (JAC)",

In order to examine the relationship between adolescents' perceptions of parental power and behavior and adolescent conformity, adolescents (N=368) in 184 families completed questionnaires concerning aspects of parental behavior (companionship, affection, love withdrawal, induction, coercion) and parental power (expert power, legitimate power, reward power, coercive power). Data analyses indicated gender differences in adolescent conformity related to parental power. Sons responded with greater conformity to parents seen as having coercive power. Daughters tended to respond to parents perceived as having legitimate and expert power. The  results also showed gender differences in adolescent conformity in relation to parental behavior. Physical affection was positively related to conformity, mainly in father-daughter and mother-son relationships. Induction (parental behavior intended to elicit voluntary compliance through reasoning) seemed to be most effective in father-son and mother-daughter relationships. (AG)",

The affective model proposes that pride of success and shame of failure are responsible for the observed preference. The cognitive model suggests preference for tasks of moderate difficulty because they are the most diagnostic of the subject's ability. In an experiment providing both trial success and failure feedback, undergraduate students (N=60) completed math problems on an Apple computer, a measure of achievement motivation, and a post-experimental questionnaire asking if subjects believed they had been deceived and if so, how. Data analyses indicated that subjects preferred moderately difficult tasks without preferring more diagnositc tasks.

In order to investigate the relative importance of different types of social ties and supports, the distinction between objective and subjective dimensions of social support, and sub-group variations in the implications of social support, older adults (N=1,185) participated in interviews which elicited information about social ties and supports as well as information regarding physical capacity. In addition, demographic data were gathered for all subjects. Data analyses indicated that respondents generally had access to extensive social ties and supports, preferring children more for  instrumental support than for expressive support. Neighbors substituted as instrumental helpers while other kin served as confidants. Subjective network assessments had more substantial associations with well-being. Objective network characteristics showed weak associations with measures of well-being, with friends making the greatest contribution. However, there was considerable sub-group variation in the contributions of network characteristics to well-being. Proximate social ties were particularly valuable for the vulnerable elderly. These results suggest that the accessibility of social supports is an important dimension of \"person/environment congruence.\" (Author/AG)",

In an attempt to study the relationship of self-awareness to affect by utilizing an experiential time sampling method, two studies were conducted. In the first, undergraduate volunteers (N=40) reported their feelings and activities during the 10-minutes preceding a buzz triggered by a randomly set timer. Data analyses focused on high and low private self-conscious subjects. In the second study undergraduate volunteers (N=23) completed a similar report of feelings following the same stimulus. Data analyses focused on states of private and public self-awareness. The results of both studies indicated that engaging in  private self-awareness was not associated with negative affect. The only condition under which private self-awareness was related to affect occurred when the presence or absence of others was a factor. The results indicate that the time sampling method, as an alternative to experimental designs, can be an effective method of obtaining data from respondents providing that care is taken in the research design.

        "description":"An increase in the number of adult women in the paid work force, many of whom are returning to work after a period as homemaker and parent, appears to be one of the major social changes of the past decade. As part of the Project HAVE Skills program, which was designed to develop career counseling materials for reentry women, questionnaires designed around 524 skills (e.g., communications, consumer economics, and emergency and crisis intervention) were developed to aid in identifying job-relevant skills which reentry women might have acquired during their absence from the paid labor force. Adult women homemakers (N=122) responded to the first questionnaire by indicating the extent of their experience with each skill. Personnel specialists (N=56) responded to the second  questionnaire by indicating the degree of job-relevance for each skill. Data analyses revealed a low correlation between the extent of women's experience and the personnel specialists' perception of job relevance. The data suggest several possible explanations for this low correlation: (1) the unpaid work on which women spend the most time has little relevance for paid work; (2) stereotypes may have affected the personnel specialists' ratings; and (3) beliefs about the appropriateness of various kinds of work for women may have affected the ratings. The information obtained from the two questionnaires was used to develop a survey instrument for personnel administrators or counselors screening women interested in returning to paid work after a period of time away from the labor force.  Tables of the 12 areas of women's unpaid work experiences with moderate or high job-relevance, and a summary of the factor structure of job relevance ratings in 6 unpaid work areas are appended. Also included are the Have Skills Chart, the research edition of the Have Skills Assessment Survey, and the Have Skills Assessment Survey Key. (AG)",

In addition, they interviewed the classroom teachers informally as the study unfolded and formally at the conclusion of the observation period. Other data analyzed included classroom maps, samples of instructional materials, lesson plans, student work, and informal interviews with principals and other teachers. The findings revealed that reading instruction in the summer school classrooms was materials centered, and that implementing the reading series provided was the driving force behind instructional  activity in both classrooms. Instruction was skill-based, product-oriented, reactive, and disconnected. Reading lessons and the instructional behavior of teachers were profoundly influenced by the basal materials. Teaching behaviors that dominated instructional assistance, direct instruction, and attempts to do more than assign practice activities and check them were conspicuous in their absence. (FL)",

A study of the metadiscourse in nine school social science texts and nine nonschool social science texts was made to examine differences (1) in the amount and types of metadiscourse used by social science writers in materials used for school and nonschool purposes, (2) in the amount and types of metadiscourse used in social science textbooks across grade levels, (3) among publishers of social  science textbooks on the same grade level, and (4) in the amount and types of metadiscourse used by nontextbook social science writers who write for different audiences. All levels of school were represented with the textbooks--early elementary, middle school, junior high, high school, and college. Results showed that nontextbooks used more informational metadiscourse than did textbooks, but the differences were not large.

        "description":"In a study designed to analyze differences between job performance and level of experience, 27 nurses from three different employment levels (in training, experienced, and supervisory) were observed, interviewed, tested, and rated for job performance. An observation checklist recorded job behavior in terms of the type of activity observed, the time spent in each activity, the purposes for which the activity was undertaken, the type of materials used in support of the activity, and the strategy or manner in which the materials were used. The structured interview consisted of five parts: a general cloze test, a job cloze test, an oral retelling anchored rating scale, seven open-ended questions dealing with literacy demands, and a few questions dealing with general demographic  information. Results showed that the three groups were similar in their abilities to identify key ideas and complete cloze tests constructed from job material. Significant differences appeared, however, when nurses were asked to summarize material. In this case registered nurses (RNs) outperformed licensed practical nurses (LPNs), who outperformed student nurses. A similar pattern was found in cloze test data for an unfamiliar piece of general reading material. The job of the RN called for skimming and checking documents for treatment changes or to identify the need to order new medications. RNs did more skimming and checking than LPNs and student nurses. Job classification revealed 25% of the nurses to be superior, 56% as competent, and 19% as adequate. There were no significant  differences among employment levels by job performance. Superior nurses had a clearer sense of what they were to be doing and actually used literacy to make themselves more effective. They wrote to communicate, they made notes to better organize themselves, and they read to gather information. There was little evidence of these behaviors in responses given by adequate nurses.

Three game-like microcomputer training systems were constructed, each concerned with a critical skill previously shown to pose difficulties for secondary school students with poor reading skills: (1) perception of multiletter units appearing within words, (2) efficient phonological decoding of orthographic information in words, and (3) use of context frames in accessing and integrating meanings of words read in context. Each system was designed to develop the capacity for automatic performance of a  particular component by providing a motivating, game-like environment in which to practice the skill. Subjects completed six computer-administered criterion tasks to evaluate their improvement in the targeted skill areas. Results showed that in all cases, subjects were able to reach levels of performance in the trained skills that equalled or exceeded those of high ability readers. There was also strong evidence for the transfer of acquired skills to other functionally related reading components. For subjects who completed the entire training sequence, there were increases in reading speed in an inference task, with no drop in comprehension, suggesting that improvements in the level of automaticity of multiple skill components of reading can reduce the effort required in reading for  comprehension.

        "description":"Recent developments in personal computers will affect the teaching of reading and writing because they offer capabilities that simply were not possible before. For example, an information storage and retrieval system, developed as a &quot;library&quot; for elementary school children, allows them to store and retrieve information under different descriptors. &quot;Dynamic books&quot; have become part of an interactive text that allows the student to browse to find information about particular topics or questions. The browser provides both a table of contents index and a subject index, parts of which can appear on the screen at the same time as the book's text. Through online dictionaries and thesauri, children can merely point to a word they do not understand and its definition can be given to them  automatically. Writing coaches are helpful in all phases of writing--helping the student to plan before writing, giving advice as the student writes, and suggesting to the student how to evaluate and revise when a draft is completed. The text editor lets students see the text on a display screen as they type it in and automatically moves the text around to make room for additions, removing extra space caused by deletions. Message systems provide a variety of capabilities for reading and sending messages. And, developments in publications systems enable students to create texts in different formats and with different page layouts. (HOD)",

Next, the paper reviews the dynamics of class and minority status and discusses these dynamics in light of findings concerning two major types of linguistic/cultural mismatches in the classroom: (1) those of participation structures, and (2) those of dialogue-like versus monologue-like styles  of discourse. On the basis of this review, the paper argues that the &quot;mismatch&quot; hypothesis must consider the ways in which institutional ideologies about language use and literacy influence classroom interaction. The paper then summarizes two studies focusing on the ways discourse coherence and processes of conversation influence literacy-related activities in educational settings. The paper concludes that such studies can enrich the understanding both of the role of culture in face-to-face communication and of the complex communicative events leading to the acquisition of literacy skills.

        "description":"The passage comprehensibility of three diagnostic reading tests--the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test, the Spache Diagnostic Reading Scales, and the Durrell Analysis of Reading Difficulty--was evaluated using the following text variables: content familiarity, vocabulary, the number of idea units in the text, the number of text-based inferences required to integrate ideas, the existence of main idea statements, and the logical sequence of ideas in the passage. Selections from the second, fourth and sixth reader levels were evaluated to identify passage characteristics across reader levels and test inconsistencies. With regard to text variables, each selection was transformed into a series of propositions or ideas. Also, eight graduate students rated each selection for content  familiarity. With regard to readability formula variables, a computer program was used in which each passage was evaluated in terms of four readability formulas: The ARI, Flesch-Kincaid, Harris-Jacobson, and the Dale-Chall. Results showed that the three tests differed substantially in the number of ideas presented, the number of inferences necessary to integrate these ideas, and text organization features. The readability indices reflected only surface features of the text and did not reflect the meaning characteristics of the passage nor identify the variables integral for deriving meaning from the text.

At the same time, the teachers agree to assist each student in his or her acquisition of reading skills, send the folders home each week, respond to parental concerns and questions, and send home supplementary books to be used during the reading periods  at home. The folders contain a sight word list, independent activities, and parent directed lessons. This package is accompanied by a weekly newsletter from the teacher that informs parents of the skills and activities that the students are engaged in that week. Both teachers and parents have responded positively to the program, and, after the first year, both groups noted that the students had developed a positive attitude toward reading.

Drawing on previous research indicating that poor readers were inferior to normal ones in judging whether two patterns of long and short tones were the same, the study examined whether the groups differed in ability to accurately encode patterns into auditory short term memory or in ability to maintain patterns in memory after they have been stored. The study also investigated the relationship among performance on a verbal sequential memory task, auditory digit span, and reading skill. Subjects, 35 normal and 63 poor fifth grade readers, were presented with pairs of Morse  Code-like patterns separated by 1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-second intervals, and asked to judge if the patterns were the same. Results showed that poor readers performed significantly worse on pattern comparison only at the longest interval, suggesting an inability to maintain properly encoded patterns and that poor retention of information in short term memory probably results in both semantic and syntactic processing breakdowns during reading. Digit span correlated significantly with reading ability, but not with pattern-comparison performance. Digit span may be correlated with reading skill because of a common dependency on rapid coding of verbal stimuli. (FL)",

The first study produced data indicating that the relationship is susceptible to subtle variations in the identity of the author. In those situations when readers were familiar with the topic and likely to identify with the author, they were more likely to recall more and be more critical of their reading. The second study demonstrated how topic familiarity and discourse style influenced the relationship across successful and less successful reading experiences. The more successful readers were more self-initiating with respect to their role as readers and their sense of what the  author was trying to do than were less successful readers. The third study highlighted how shifts in the author-reader relationship were manifested for both readers and writers. Taken together, the data afford a description of how readers negotiate meaning with a sense of who the author is and what he or she is trying to do. The data suggest that successful readers approach texts with two sets of concerns: what the author is trying to get them to think and do and what they themselves deem they need to do.

Data were collected by trained observers who viewed a random sample of second, third, and fifth grade classes in eight school systems participating in a state program to develop outstanding reading programs. The results suggested that the eight  activities, when examined individually, did not explain a useful amount of variance in student time on task rates.

The study also examined whether syntactic simplicity would lead to a greater salience of semantic properties of words. Subjects were required to name a word presented on a monitor after a context sentence. Syntactic complexity of the context sentence was varied. The target word was phonologically or semantically related or unrelated to the last word in the sentence. The time interval between the end of the context sentence and the word to be named was also varied. Resulting data provided no support for the hypothesis. However, trends in the data suggested that there is some interplay between lexical  accessing and syntactic processing. There was a tendency for frequency of the target word to correlate with naming time in complex syntax conditions (less frequent words were named more slowly), and there was also some indication that salience of activated words was maintained under conditions of syntactic complexity as time for sentence processing (the context sentence--naming word interval) was increased.

Subjects were college undergraduates with high and low verbal abilities as indicated by a standardized verbal aptitude test. The first study involved a multiple choice vocabulary test from which words that both groups defined correctly were selected. The subjects were then asked to use the words in sentences, define their meanings, and make semantic comparisons among them. The results indicated that low verbal subjects' knowledge of word meaning was less complete and more bound to a specific context than that of high verbal subjects. The second study investigated this possibility with a combined protocol and reaction time methodology. Subjects read two paragraphs--one using a word in a  familiar context, the other in an unfamiliar context--and were asked to define the word. The second study indicated that the completeness of knowledge about the meaning of a word that is familiar seems to affect both sentence reading time and paragraph recall (although the former more so for the high verbals and the latter more so for the low verbals). The results suggest that, although it may be a relatively straightforward task to teach a connection between an \"unknown\" word and a \"known\" word, it is a much more complex matter to provide and promote the decontextualized knowledge that will facilitate the comprehension of those words in an unfamiliar text.

Findings from this study were used for an analysis of the relationship between reading achievement and television viewing. The following background questions were selected for analysis: (1) How much television did you watch yesterday? (2) Is English the language spoken most often in your home? (3) Does your family get a newspaper regularly? (4) Are there more than 25 books in your home? (5) Is there an encyclopedia in your home? and (6) Did your father graduate from college or university? Results indicated that there was a curvilinear relationship between amount of viewing and  achievement, in which moderate amounts of viewing were associated with higher achievement. There was a threshold amount of viewing (five or six hours per day) beyond which there were sharp decreases in achievement. This curvilinear relationship interacted with social class to result in a mainstreaming effect. That is, achievement of disadvantaged students increased more with moderate amounts of viewing and decreased less with large amounts than that of advantaged students. The consequence of this was a lessening of the differences in achievement between advantaged and disadvantaged students with greater amounts of viewing. (Author/HOD)",

The Asian American students were native English speakers whose parents spoke an Asian language. Everything the students wrote was collected, including all drafts of their papers and all their notes, and all their conferences (a minimum of four across the semester) were tape recorded. Also collected were three investigator-student interviews about the student's at-home composing process. Transcripts were examined for topics of  conversation and idea units. Findings indicated that (1) the different students wanted to focus on different types of topics (discourse level topics for the two Caucasians and surface level for the high achieving Asian American; the lowest achieving student had no hierarchy of intellectual topics); (2) the teacher focused on different types of intellectual topics for the different students (discourse level topics for all except the lowest achieving Asian American student); (3) the teacher gave more praise to the higher achieving students who seemed to elicit that praise by expressing their insecurity about their writing; (4) the lower achieving students initiated topics likely to alienate a teacher; and (5) the synchrony of the conversation broke down with the lowest achieving Asian  American student, who inserted backchannel signals at inappropriate times in the conversation.

First, speaking is natural, and students come to the writing classroom linguistically well-developed and confident. Second, talking encourages exploration of words by slowing down the thought process without completely stopping it. Third, this naturalness and ease of speech establishes a comfortable atmosphere in which writers feel free to take risks in writing and in sharing their writing. Talking activities can be helpful during all three stages of the writing process. Prewriting activities include role-playing followed by free writing, or discussing an unusual object before writing about it. Questioning can be a very important activity during the drafting stage.  As students begin editing or revising their papers, student-teacher conferences and peer revision can help make the students' communication clearer and more in tune to audience needs. Most important, students must both understand that talking about writing is necessary and observe teachers talking about writing to learn this fact. Once talking about writing becomes important to teachers it will become important to students as well. (HTH)",

        "description":"The process of writing is explored from three perspectives in this paper. In the first part of the paper writing is viewed as a communicative act with four principles that form tacit objectives in any communicative act: comprehensibility, enticingness, persuasiveness, and memorability. The second part of the paper, which examines writing in the context of a taxonomy of communicative acts, explores the differences between oral and written language along the following dimensions: interaction, involvement, modality, spatial commonality, temporal commonality, concreteness of referents, and separability of characters. The third part of the paper examines these differences in a process model of writing with discussion given to the subskills of idea production, discovering ideas, and  manipulating ideas. Strategies suggested for systematically grouping ideas include compare and contrast, taxonomize, dimensionalize, and componentialize. Text production is then analyzed through three kinds of devices: structural devices, stylistic devices, and content devices. Editing is next discussed in terms of text level operators, especially those that beginning writers should learn to apply. The last part of the paper explores some of the problems beginning writers might experience and suggests some intermediate writing tasks that exercise different subskills. (HOD)",

The first chapter examines whether the &quot;writing crisis&quot; is fact or fiction, and discusses the test results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the California Survey of Basic Skills. The second chapter focuses on activities of the Bay Area Writing Project and other writing projects throughout the state of California. The third chapter deals with various approaches several California cities have taken, such as individualized language arts or the workshop/laboratory approach. Successful classroom  techniques are detailed in the fourth chapter, among them using students as evaluators, choosing good topics, observing students as they write, prewriting, and motivating the student. Evaluation and assessment are the focus of the fifth chapter, which considers the types of tests available, types of scoring, evaluation in the classroom, and state or school district testing. The sixth chapter discusses what is known about writing, emphasizing grammar, prewriting, reading, oral language, sentence combining, and writing practice. The final chapter discusses the use of computers in writing, especially the use of the word processor and how it will shape the student as writer. (HOD)",

A model was developed that used the level of cognitive processing as one dimension and the purposes of writing as the other. The dependent measure, \"student writing activities,\" was divided into two related parts: writing competence and writing preference. Three populations were tested and subjects were asked to participate in nine writing tasks: pragmatic information, summary, retelling a story, descriptive composition, personal story, argumentative/persuasive, personal/reflective, open  composition to pictorial stimuli, and a letter of advice. Compositions were scored in terms of general and detailed impressions. A small-scale pilot study in which native language experts from nine countries rated argumentative and reflective compositions showed a high agreement on all the rating categories (based on competence in generating and organizing ideas; applying appropriate style and tone; using appropriate grammatical, lexical, and spelling conventions; and producing a legible text). This, together with the fact that the raters were able to communicate with relative ease using the categories, suggested that the categories of writing competence were familiar and appropriate in various parts of the world. Writing preference, determined by self-reporting techniques and descriptive  analysis of students' compositions, was also found to be a variable worthy of consideration in developing a system for assessing student writing activities.

Both before and during the muckraking period, columns in &quot;Collier's&quot; argued both sides of the issue, sometimes opposing and sometimes favoring the lynching of blacks. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Everybody's&quot; paid almost no attention to lynching. Ray Stannard Baker wrote two articles on lynching for &quot;McClure's&quot; and continued to explore racial issues at &quot;The American Magazine.&quot; After Baker's departure, &quot;McClure's&quot; lost interest in lynching. The more radical &quot;Arena&quot; opposed lynching during the  premuckraking period, but made little of the issue during the period itself. The progressive movement's blind spot to lynching and race issues was caused by its feeling that immigrants and blacks did not fit in with their ideas of participatory democracy. Even Baker shared the racist perspective of his time. The muckraker's faith that &quot;facts&quot; themselves would lead to reform was justified only when the prevailing consensus allowed the &quot;facts&quot; to emerge, not in the case of the lynching of blacks.

        "description":"Newly discovered transcriptions of 87 of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's women-only press conferences held from 1933 to 1945 make possible an examination of the objectives, topics, and value of these conferences. By holding the conferences, Mrs. Roosevelt attributed to women an important function in the political communication process, and at the same time helped to secure the status and bolster the confidence of women reporters. The topics of the conferences were political issues related to women and legislation, and social and personal life at the White House. She also used the conferences to defuse criticism leveled at herself and her family, including the President, and to clarify statements made by him. At the time, male journalists felt that these conferences reduced the  dignity of the First Lady, provided little legitimate news, and compromised reportorial objectivity. The transcripts reveal that Mrs. Roosevelt maintained traditional propriety, though the conferences did become a bit chatty, and that reporters occasionally would shield the First Lady. All in all, the sex-segregated press conferences were a useful device for Mrs. Roosevelt, enabling her to establish herself as an important figure, to promote the New Deal, and to improve the status of American women.

But contrary to standard journalism history, this democratic press had nothing to do with the rise of the penny press; in fact, William Lloyd Garrison's abolitionist paper, &quot;The Liberator,&quot; best expresses Tocqueville's ideals. Trusting in God's truth, Garrison argued that free inquiry would lead to truth and that slavery could not stand up to free discussion. As time went on, Garrison moved from a narrow antislavery stand to advocacy of free expression and free exercise of reason in all areas. For him, discussion was the essence of both journalism and democracy, and reader participation and free discussion involving all parties  were essential to the paper. But in the end, though both Tocqueville and Garrison believed in a participatory, associational, group-based press, the penny papers that grew up in the 1830s and 1840s did not embody their ideal, ending up more commercial than democratic.

        "description":"American &quot;New Journalism&quot; of the 1880s and 1890s--a blend of the popular press and the elite political and literary journal creating a comprehensive general interest newspaper that informed, entertained, and editorialized on politics--became the model for the modern daily newspaper in the Western World. The American emphasis on news and the extensive use of the interview, human interest story, enterprise reporting and big headlines were soon seen in the major European newspapers. These American influences grew out of developments in the American Midwest and in New York City through the efforts of James Gordon Bennett, Jr., Joseph Pulitzer, and William Randolph Hearst. In spite of resistance from French and British editors and publishers, Bennett successfully introduced an  American style newspaper in France, and Alfred Harmsworth adapted the American style for British readers. In the first years of the twentieth century, there was a great deal of cross-Atlantic employment in both directions, and European journalists became better acquainted with the American press. They thought that the American press was newsy and enterprising, but that it might be toned down a bit. By this time Americans were conducting their own bitter campaign against the excesses of &quot;yellow journalism,&quot; but the modern direction was already set. At the start of World War I, journalists were working out a set of standards and a code of ethics that would encourage journalistic responsibility without ignoring the readers' interest in a good story.

A recording was made during the week of May 24-28, 1982 of the half-hour, early evening newscasts of the three network affiliates in the Mobile, Alabama-Pensacola, Florida market. One videotape for each station, with three minutes of news anchor reporting followed by three minutes of sports anchor reporting and three minutes of weather reporting, were presented to 37 students from a vocational school and community college  outside the Mobile-Pensacola viewing area. Results showed that only one measure, the average number of minutes of commercials, revealed significant differences across stations. Concerning the technical quality of the newscast, analysis showed that the station that scored highest in the rankings contained more techniques per video tape recordings, more slides and stills accompanying the news anchor reporting, and a greater amount of video accompanying the sports reporter. Audience preferences revealed almost no relationship or a negative one between audience ratings of the relative importance of different kinds of news stories and the station's attention to these stories. Four categories were ranked as important in determining news quality, in the following order: news substance, technical  quality, the association between public preference for news stories and the amount of time stations devoted to them, and the ratings of news, sports, and weather anchors.

        "description":"The evolution of the newspaper industry can be viewed within the perspective of a dialectic ecology that emphasizes the determinative influence of the environment on the development of newspapers in the three stages of variation, selection, and retention. This perspective also introduces the concept of contradictions that rupture into life-threatening crises in the evolution of organizations. The variation, selection, and retention stages in the life-cycle of newspapers take into account four dimensions: population, technology, resources, and adaptation maneuvers. The newspaper industry evolved through a phase of disorganization before evolving along the lines of the following historic scenario: variation, 1825 to 1845; selection, 1845 to 1900; and retention, 1900 to the present.  Contradictions generated by organizational growth and adaptation ruptured into periods of crisis: 1825 to 1845; 1890 to 1900; and 1960 to the present. The contemporary crisis in the newspaper industry is a result of the internal and external contradictions that have evolved since the 1830s. Internal contradictions reduced newspapers' flexibility and mobility in exploiting resources and in meeting competitive challenges. External contradictions produced a dense environment that heightened competitive pressures in the exploitations of resources. The dialectic of internal and external contradictions now threatens the life of the newspaper as a &quot;surviving species&quot; of information organization. (Author/HOD)",

Redundancy, defined as shared information, was proposed as an explanatory variable that considers the relationship between information in three channels: the audio, the nonverbal pictorial, and visual-verbal print channel. It was hypothesized that pictures would facilitate learning if they reinforced and complemented verbal information, but that adding an additional language channel through captioning would impede learning by forcing a split-attention situation. Network news stories were manipulated to create a 2x2 design with four conditions: (1) redundant pictures and words, (2) nonredundant pictures and words, (3) redundant pictures and words with redundant print, and (4) nonredundant  pictures and words with redundant print. Twenty-five undergraduate subjects were assigned to each condition. After viewing the stories, they completed a series of 10 semantic differential-type scales. Results showed that picture-word redundancy increased recall and reduced error, while adding print-impeded learning. The findings suggest that producers should use print information to highlight story concepts and synchronize visuals with their respective word labels. (JL)",

Nine groups of from four to six members in the fifth, eighth, and senior high grades were tape recorded in from three to six meetings. Transcripts were used to develop three language categories based on function: directing, informing, and eliciting. All transcripts were then analyzed to determine the incidence of each function for each meeting of the groups. Revisions of papers that had been read and commented on in the groups were then analyzed to determine the relationship between the comments made and the changes  in the writing. Results indicated that group responses were directed to the writing and were largely informative, providing directions to the writer about how a composition could be changed and improved. This idea was confirmed by the fact that revised papers did show change and improvement. (Suggestions for further research, sample transcripts and student papers are included.) (JL)",

        "description":"Unlike less skilled writers, who are intensely writer-oriented, skilled writers of personal essays and autobiographies are reader-oriented and demonstrate a conscious concern for their external audience. Student writers can develop a sense of an external audience by analyzing parallel autobiographical text selections of skilled and unskilled writers. They can contrast &quot;The Diary of Isaac Dodd&quot; with Mark Twain's more skillful &quot;Autobiography&quot; to learn about authorial perspective. A comparison of Isaac Dodd with Natalie Crouter's &quot;Forbidden Diary: A Record of Wartime Internment, 1941-45&quot; will demonstrate the principles of ordering events and proportioning for emphasis. Contrasting &quot;Diary of the Michigan Farmer's Wife&quot; with Mark Twain can help students learn how the author's  additional interpretation of events is often necessary to make the material more understandable to an unfamiliar audience. Finally, a comparison of &quot;Wishes are Horses: Montgomery, Alabama's First Lady of the Violin&quot; by novice writer Fanny Marks Seibels, with Maxine Hong Kingston's &quot;The Women Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts&quot; will show how skilled writers present numerous, varied, individualized, and complex personae. Such examinations will enable student writers to ask such questions as (1) Who will read this? (2) What will they find interesting or significant?

        "description":"A five-part computer program helps college students generate essays. Its first part, a list generator, forces students to consider a number of subjects and to select one that is reasonably defined. The second part of the program asks a series of questions to elicit information about the chosen topic and to shape the information into appropriate paragraph form and essay type (argumentative or descriptive). The third part of the program orders all the data and combines them, with some transitions, to create a complete essay, while the fourth section transmits the essay to a screen, printer, or floppy disk. In its last section, the program explains how and why it did what it did in order to help the student understand and apply the approach without the computer.

After an initial background interview, each student met biweekly with one member of the research staff and discussed the writing he or she had done since the last interview. The analysis of writing function distinguished among three general uses: imaginative writing, personal writing, and informational writing. Audience analysis distinguished among self, teacher as part of an instructional dialogue, teacher as examiner, and wider audience. Students' reports on their writing instruction revealed few available options when they wrote for school. They shaped their messages within a narrow range  of purposes and within rather severe formal constraints. The students' sense of audience profoundly affected their attitudes, so that with most of their work done for the teacher as examiner, they were less likely to engage themselves fully in the task. In general the results suggest that the nature of the writing students are asked to produce, the instructions they are given, and the responses they receive have a dramatic impact on the written product.

Stories from the &quot;National/Nation&quot; and &quot;International World&quot; sections were analyzed for use of anonymous sources, that is a direct or paraphrased quote attributed to an unnamed person or unnamed persons. For each story, several items were noted: the presence or absence of anonymous sources, the number of different anonymous sources quoted, the total number of anonymous attributions, and the types of anonymous sources quoted. Of the 388 stories analyzed, 216 stories dealt with national events and issues, while 172 stories dealt with international events and issues. Results revealed the use of 1,274 unattributed quotations.&quot;Newsweek&quot; tended to quote unnamed sources more often than did &quot;Time.&quot; Overall, more than eight in ten stories contained anonymous attribution with unnamed sources quoted more often in international stories than in national stories. High status sources were quoted most often, followed by neutral sources, subordinates, experts, friends or foes, and associates. Some &quot;official&quot; was the most common specific source quoted, followed by aides, diplomats, and experts. &quot;Newsweek&quot; quoted officials and sources more often and advisers less often than did &quot;Time.&quot; The findings suggest that the abuses of the anonymous source practice by Janet Cooke and others have not prompted the reporters, writers, and editors at &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; to restrict their use of anonymous attribution.

One group heard the control report while the other listened to an experimental report supplemented with actualities. A multiple-choice quiz administered to each group following the newscasts indicated a negative correlation between the use of actualities and both listener recall and interest. These findings, contradicting earlier studies that revealed no difference between experimental and control groups, might be influenced by the following: (1) the shortness of the simulated newscast; (2) the use of aural enhancements in consecutive news items, possibly  diminishing the technique's effect; (3) the difficulty of the questions based on actualities; and (4) the homogeneity of the listener population. The results indicate that while actualities might help illustrate a news item, a straight delivery is more effective in providing specific information. Radio news, the listeners also suggested, could be made more interesting through a slower, clearer delivery, more significant news, and a greater use of humor and human interest stories. (MM)",

Freshmen in expository writing classes were trained at the beginning of the semester to respond first to the ideas in the essays, and only after giving the writer feedback on this level were they to help the writer with mechanics and syntax. After being divided into groups of four or five, the students read their first drafts aloud, with each peer in turn criticizing the writer's work orally and in written comments on the copies. These comments were used in writing second drafts, which were turned in to the teacher, whose comments were then used for the final draft. The peer groups generally followed the same pattern of development. In the early stages, the majority of comments were positive evaluations of a  writer's work. Along with these supportive comments were criticisms of content and form, which the writers did not always use in their revisions (reflecting their resentment at being criticized by someone other than the teacher, as well as a lack of experience in revision). Comments about grammar, punctuation, and syntax were more helpful. The peers were able to pinpoint surface level problems and offer solutions. As the semester progressed, the peers began to suggest ways that the writer might revise a text instead of merely criticizing the writer. (HTH)",

Questionnaires containing semantic differential scales developed to determine public images of mass media institutions were mailed to all legislators, 69 of whom responded. Results indicated that the legislators rated television and radio coverage more favorably than newspaper coverage and that they saw far less distinction between statewide or district coverage in both forms of news media.

        "description":"Under an experimental license issued in 1978, KSL-TV in Salt Lake City, Utah, provided 120 pages of teletext information to its viewers. In choosing this system, the station had to decide between it and a videotext system. Although videotext systems permit two-way communication, usually over telephone lines, teletext broadcast technology is much cheaper. The cost for a decoder, a critical factor in the consumer's acceptance of either system, is expected to decline for both technologies. In teletext, access cost is zero, while in videotext the information provider has the option of charging users. It is possible that videotext's interactive capability and superior graphics will increase its penetration into paying households. Although teletext and videotext provide similar mass  market services, videotext has substantially more flexibility and speed. Since systems currently being used in different countries are incompatible, establishing technical standards in the areas of data format, transmission, and display is of key importance. Current trends and the growing home computer market favor the growth of videotext, but KSL-TV's experiment showed the value of teletext as an interim information system. (JL)",

An examination of QCs and labor relations in Japan reveals that labor relations there tend to be both more cooperative and more antagonistic than those in the West because of the presence of enterprise unions, labor-management collusion, traditional dispute  settlement, and modern dispute settlement. In Japan, the QCs play an important role in furthering employee interest by offering an alternative to identifying solely with company or union interests and by providing the training needed for advancement. Unlike the QCs in Japan, those in the United States do not consider the needs of the employee participant, stressing instead technical problems.

Chapter 1 summarizes research on learning styles--the ways in which individuals perceive, analyze, interpret, and respond to learning situations. Examined in this chapter are cognitive styles, including data reception and concept formation and retention; affective styles, comprising attention, expectancy, and incentive styles; physiological styles, such as developmental and sex- and health-related differences; and practical considerations in the use of instruments to measure learning styles. Chapter 2 covers research on brain lateralization (the location of different functions in  the brain's right or left hemispheres), the brain's building of models of reality, and brain growth stages. Learning time research is considered in chapter 3, which reviews findings about time on task and about variations among students in the time needed to master a subject. The final chapter looks at the administrative implications of recent research, noting first the problems with earlier attempts to individualize instruction and then discussing the implications of findings in the three areas of learning styles, brain development, and learning time.

The best programs and those discontinued are listed, as are the dates of the most important developments in year-round schooling. The current status of year-round programs is shown from data drawn both from California and nationwide. A series of tables also shows the public, curricular, and instructional issues most affected in schools that operate year-round. Along with summaries of the most vexing problems reported by experimental year-round programs, the report enumerates a range of functional problems, including those in the areas of curriculum and  instruction, finance, scheduling of students, allocation of personnel, facilities and maintenance, transportation, school lunches, student activities and athletics, and support services. The paper also lists some advantages and points out the most promising programs. (JW)",

The planning process and impact of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) of 1981 are studied along with compensatory education, special education, and state and local improvement programs. Dissemination functions are examined with special attention given to staff development. The findings are based on document analysis, telephone and field interviews with more than 100 persons, and site visits to more than two dozen agencies in the three states. The first  section of the report contains an overview and key findings for each state, along with cross-state analysis of ECIA findings and staff development effects; this section also discusses the implications and the futures of educational research and development, dissemination, and school improvement in the Far West. Separate sections contain detailed information for each state, including small case studies of local and intermediate agencies that describe current conditions, planning activities, and probable impacts of cutbacks, consolidation, and deregulation.

The process of presenting a program to new users is divided into seven tasks: creating awareness of the project, establishing commitment among the users, providing materials, training personnel, planning to meet users' individual needs, solving problems, and monitoring and evaluating the progress of the program. The process further involves determining the influence of the program on the users' behaviors, finding the influence on target populations, and evaluating the whole project. Expanding on the task of planning to meet users' needs, the author offers three planning profiles that monitor how well users are accepting innovations introduced by the model program,  users putting the new program into practice, and, in a comprehensive practice profile, to what extent and how accurately the intended model program is being used. The last section describes the vision, leadership, commitment, and fidelity to the model that are needed in users in order successfully to adopt model programs. (JW)",

Using a math-science curriculum called &quot;Finding Out: Descubrimiento,&quot; the nine bilingual classrooms, grades two through four, participating in the study tested two hypotheses: (1) the outcome of a complex curriculum will be improved by delegation of authority to students, communication among students, and supportive supervision by teachers; and (2) reciprocal interdependence and reflective decision-making among teachers and aides will improve the use of a complex curriculum. By scoring the rates of selected behaviors of  teachers, classrooms, and individual students, the study confirmed the first hypothesis by finding a strong correlation between the delegation of authority to students and the engagement of students in the curriculum. To test the second hypothesis, the nine teaching teams were divided into a control group and groups holding team meetings, in which behaviors were scored for types of interaction and content. The results, though statistically weak, confirm that children taught by staff with training in shared decision-making are generally more engaged in classroom work than other students. (JW)",

The questionnaire survey compared teacher expectations of school or program change before the SACS accreditation process with their perceptions of actual change after SACS. A total of 741 teachers (279 in the preaccreditation survey and 462 in the postaccreditation survey) in a large southern school district were asked about changes in instructional programs or materials, facilities, pupil services, administration, community interaction, and personal growth. Findings are presented in 16 text  tables, 5 graphs, and 33 appendix tables. Among the findings are that perceived changes did not meet teachers' expectations of change and that teachers anticipated greatest change in the areas where SACS guidelines were most explicit. The findings support three recommended changes in SACS processes and a proposed model for school staff development. In the informal interviews, conducted in the same district as the survey, five principals and six teachers indicated they considered the SACS accreditation process was worth the effort. Copies of the survey questionnaire are appended. (RW)",

Chapter 1 introduces the study and discusses planned change. Chapter 2 presents an overview of the research and profiles the 14 schools. Field agents and school change are reviewed in chapter 3. Chapters 4 and 5 examine the change process, looking at the effects of school conditions first on sequential planning and then on teacher prarticipation. Outcomes of change are covered in the next two  chapters, the first analyzing the implementation and the second the continuation of change. The last chapter traces changes in local school conditions through the life of change projects. The researchers found that field agents, planning, participation, implementation, and continuation were affected by eight conditions, including resource and incentive availability, school linkages and goals, faculty tensions and turnover, current school practices and knowledge use, and prior change projects.

The first 3 sections describe trends over 30 years in the amount of segregation, efforts to remedy segregation, and the ramifications of segregation. Section 4 considers existing models of interdistrict school desegregation: city/county federated districts, forced interdistrict transfers, and voluntary interdistrict transfers. The authors conclude that voluntary interdistrict transfer plans appear to be the most practical in New York State. Experiences from such programs in Boston, Hartford, Milwaukee, Rochester, and  St. Louis are summarized and suggest that state-level legislation that fosters incentives for voluntary interdistrict programs is a major condition for their success. Finally, the general conditions for achieving voluntary interdistrict school desegregation are discussed.

        "description":"Data on 174 Colorado school districts were used to measure districts' responses (as indicated by per-pupil expenditures) to their own fiscal capacity and to state aid that changes over time. Colorado's modified guaranteed tax base (GTB) formula was analyzed and a model constructed that took into account the formula's limits on district spending and its year-to-year changes in a district's state aid based on the district's tax revenues in the preceding year. Such changes comprise an &quot;intertemporal price variable.&quot; Data were collected on such variables as district wealth (total and residential assessed value), income, state and federal aid, enrollment size and growth, percentage of minority pupils, and agricultural land prices. Using linear and log-linear correlation equations,  researchers analyzed the variables' effects on districts' total and locally-derived expenditures and on the elasticity of these expenditures in relation to changes in other variables' values. Results indicate that Colorado's GTB formula has had significant effects neither on differences across districts in expenditures per student nor on the strong correlation between assessed valuation and expenditures. The results also carry implications for the construction of models of districts' fiscal responses. (RW)",

In the summary of research on Colorado and Minnesota, both of which have modified guaranteed tax base formulas, the authors examine numerous variables' effects on district fiscal response and note the elasticity of the responses. The variables covered include household income, residential property values, state and federal aid, the formulas' fiscal  price effects, pupil density and growth rate, percentage of minority pupils, and number of districts per square mile in a district's surrounding region. In their conclusions the authors discuss modifications in state aid formulas, including weighting for income and other variables, and long term changes in such factors as property values and fiscal capacity.

From the results of tax and expenditure limitations on ballot measures in 1978 and 1979, he observes that there is no national movement to copy California's Proposition 13. Polls taken in 1978 to assess citizens' opinions on taxes, government, education, and the general state of the nation made clear that people wanted to cut government waste but not government programs. Similarly, in a poll taken in California specifically on issues in educational effectiveness, voters expressed strong support for educational programs in general but were concerned most with decline in quality, poor management, and cost increases in  schooling because of inflation. Respondents also favored giving all school districts, whether rich or poor, an equal expenditure per pupil. To maintain public support for schools, it is concluded that educators should address the concerns of waste and quality. (JW)",

Reform efforts have concentrated on four issues: differences in expenditure per pupil across districts within a state, links between expenditure disparities and district property wealth, services for special needs students, and unique conditions of some types of districts. Actions in the 1970s began with court challenges and moved to legislated finance reforms, which have reduced the expenditure-wealth link. The 1970s reform activities also helped maintain total education expenditures and increase the state share of such spending. In the 1980s the demographic, political, and economic contexts of school finance will include declining school-age populations, increasing  proportions of minority students, potential decreases in political support, competition with tax limitation movements, and political fragmentation within the education community. Seven issues will dominate school finance in the 1980s, including continued basic school finance reforms, finance reforms' linkage to tax structure questions, educational program and service equity concerns, educational productivity, simplification of categorical programs, the relationship between school finance and state and local finance in general, and continued litigation on school finance.

Section 2 gives an overview of states' school finance reforms in the 1970s. The section first discusses finance reforms as a redistributive issue and then provides descriptions of reforms in California, Connecticut, and Missouri as well as data on types of reforms in the 28 states with school finance reforms. Finally, it summarizes empirical studies on the reforms' impacts on state school finance structures.  In the third section the author identifies political elements involved in state-level school finance reforms. He examines the roles of state courts in finance reform in all states, of state political leaders (especially governors and legislators) in the 28 states with reforms, and of the loose national network formed in the 1970s around school finance reform.

Using 44 studies that met the topic criteria, the authors measured the &quot;effect sizes&quot; in grand means. When each effect size was treated equally, the grand mean effect size was -.37, indicating that promoted children scored 0.37 standard deviation units higher than retained children on the outcome measures. When effect sizes within each study were averaged, the grand mean was -.34. In studies in which promoted and nonpromoted students  had been compared, the grand mean was -.38. It is noted that the high degree of consistency lends credibility to the validity of the findings. In addition to the grand means, effect sizes were calculated on some dependent variable measures, including academic achievement, personal adjustment, attitude, behavior, and attendance. The cumulative research shows that the potential for negative effects consistently outweighs positive outcomes. The analysis concludes with an extensive list of references. (JW)",

Simple comparisons of per-pupil costs are found to be misleading as indicators of educational services because they do not include the publicly-mandated programs required of public schools, nor the donated resources by which private schools often supplement their services, nor the specialized instruciton and facilities often found in public schools. In addition, the author finds that those measures of relative effectiveness of education that generally favor private schools do not account adequately for the difficulties in  accurately comparing student performance and in identifying the part of an outcome attributable to school resources. Assumptions found in most analyses of educational costs and productivity are then examined, including the views that the outputs and educational processes of public and private schools are identical and therefore comparable, and that the issues of efficiency and equity are independent. Concluding that current comparisons of public and private schools may not be valid, the paper suggests criteria for aid to private schools and topics for further research. (JW)",

        "description":"The landmark judicial decision &quot;Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children (PARC) v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania&quot; exemplifies a growing tendency toward the legal redefinition of educational issues previously committed to professional or bureaucratic solutions. During the decade since the &quot;PARC&quot; decision went into effect, the hearings and appeals process it mandated has come to emphasize procedural concerns at the expense of substance. The decision ushered in a dramatic increase both in the number of children receiving special education services and in financial support for such services. Its due process hearings, however, have proved more useful for settling individual grievances than for bringing about institutional/systemic reform. A comparison of model appeals cases  reveals that, although the quality of decisions has improved, confusion still remains concerning what constitutes &quot;appropriate&quot; instruction and placement. Federal judicial second-guessing since the 1975 &quot;Fialkowski v. Shapp&quot; case has complicated matters legally by challenging the &quot;PARC&quot; system's autonomy. Although the &quot;PARC&quot; case had the positive function of placing special education on the political agenda and shocking the educational system into responsiveness, its decade-long history argues for an awareness of the dangers of legalism and the extent to which a fixation on process can trivialize substantive rights.

However, government estimates for the period 1978-90 suggest that employment growth will favor jobs that require little or no training beyond the high school level (for instance, janitors, nurses' aides, sales clerks, cashiers, and restaurant workers). Although the percentage of high technology occupations will increase quickly over this decade, the contribution of these jobs to total employment will be quite small. On the other hand, the evidence from past and present applications of technology to existing jobs suggests that future technologies will lead to further job fragmentation (where work tasks are  simplified or routinized) and job &quot;deskilling&quot; (the reduction of opportunities for worker individuality and judgment). While such mechanization does reduce labor costs, it also allows management to control more easily the pace of production. This assessment favors a solid basic education over narrow vocational preparation, since a strong general education improves understanding of modern complexities and enhances worker adaptability in a changing job market. Quick and efficient response by educators to training needs and recurrent education are also important, since workers' skills may not be useful over their entire work lives. (PB)",

Black college graduates' earnings relative to those of their white counterparts improved slightly over the last two decades. White  female college graduates experienced no such improvement. Female and minority college graduates still earn less than white male high school graduates. While the educational attainments of U.S. workers continue to increase, employment growth in the 1980s will not produce widespread opportunities in high-level fields.

U.S. census data from 1960 to 1980 show that the public sector currently employs one-sixth of the labor force and has generated a quarter of all new jobs in those years. The types and number of jobs government creates have benefited women and minorities by providing relatively more high-level job opportunities than has the private sector. As a consequence, the public sector employs from one-third to two-thirds of minority and female college graduates. While earnings discrimination exists in both the public and private  sectors, the earnings gap is generally lower in the public sector, where, during the 1960s and early 1970s, minorities and women earned more than their counterparts in the private sector. This advantage has now largely disappeared because of inflation and the government's huge fiscal deficit.

A literature review shows that, unlike other social and economic influences, networks are marked by flexibility in membership, leadership (individual, group, or organizational), structure, operation, and lifespan. The literature also reveals that the initiators of issues may generate a policy movement by creating a network of advocates. Applying the literature's conclusions to four issues of state policy-making--school finance reform, creationism, collective bargaining for teachers, and minimum competency graduation--shows the influence of various types of networks. None of the issues was actively advocated by federal  government policy. Interview data and socioeconomic information were considered in analyzing the effects of the four issues on the policy agendas of California, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Texas, and Washington State. Networks were typed by their degree of uniform adherence to a concept and by their style of organization. The cases ranged from absolute control over the concept and strict centralization of dispersal, in the case of \"creation science,\" to the diffusion of a general concept without centralized guidance, in the case of minimum competency testing. Besides degrees of agreement, the paper notes, networks could possibly be typed according to variations in policy solutions and content. (JW)",

        "description":"The Education for All Handicapped Children Act, Public Law (PL) 94-142, exemplifies the trend in American public policy toward the &quot;legalization&quot; of educational issues previously left to political or professional solution. Such legislation characteristically includes a focus on individual rights, the use of legal concepts and modes of reasoning, and the provision of legal techniques such as written agreements and court-like procedures to enforce and protect rights. In the area of special education, &quot;Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children (PARC) v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania&quot; marked the end of the first stage of legalization, translating political pronouncements into legal guarantees and precipitating widespread litigation on behalf of the handicapped. The &quot;PARC&quot; and  subsequent decisions were crucial in initiating and shaping federal legislative policy involving special education. As the culmination of the legalization process through federal legislation, PL 94-142 emphasizes due process and procedural matters more than it does substantive issues, such as what constitutes an appropriate education. Although such legislation was necessary to bring attention to and legitimate the educational claims of the handicapped, the legalized model should not be relied upon too heavily and could be modified to avoid some of its detrimental effects, including its potential for distorting the allocation of education resources.

Chapter 2 offers an overview of major economic, demographic and fiscal trends for the nation as a whole, while chapter 3 describes the analytical framework used in the study and notes the study's limitations. Chapter 4 presents the study's results. The chapter first discusses state-by-state demographic trends and projections (used as indicators of educational demand), including school-age population, public and private enrollment, ethnic and income composition, and  migration; it then focuses on state and local factors (used as indicators of educational resources supply), including expenditures, dependence on federal aid, and fiscal effort and capacity. The chapter concludes with an assessment of state financial prospects, dividing the states into three groups, those with favorable, average, or unfavorable funding prospects. The appendixes provide methodological discussions and additional data and projections for demographic and fiscal factors. (RW)",

The first study, &quot;Recall of Temporal/Spatial Incongruent Letter Strings by Deaf and Hearing Children: A Test of Structural Determinants of Memory Performance,&quot; by J. Belmont et al., reports that comparison of 16 deaf and 16 hearing children, 11 years old, on a computerized memory test, yielded such results as that deaf children at age 11 years are better adapted to the spatial than to the temporal memory orientation. J. Bourg reports on the study, &quot;American Sign Language and Stroop  Interference,&quot; such results as that deaf Ss experienced more color-sign interference than hearing Ss and hearing Ss more color-word interference than deaf Ss. The last study, by T. Allen, &quot;Test Response Variations between Hearing Impaired and Hearing Students,&quot; reports that nine language arts test items from a Rasch based item bank were administered to 1,542 HI students, aged 7 to 18, in 39 programs in six states with results such as finding discrepancies in the ordering of item difficulty between the hearing impaired and hearing Ss.

Ten interest areas  are presented (representative occupations in parentheses): advising (child care attendant, lawyer); arranging (architect, hair stylist); building and making (roofing, painter); doing clerical work (cashier, file clerk); helping (police officer, waiter); maintaining and repairing (mechanic, plumber); thinking in pictures (cartoonist, photographer); using environmental information (farmer, landscape gardener); working with equipment (cook, telephone operator); and working with numbers and symbols (library assistant, teller). Step by step progression through the CPS is described in which students investigate activities and &quot;interview&quot; workers.

Guidelines are provided about interaction; listening skills (including active listening); expanding, modeling, and asking open ended questions; understanding and assessing the cognitive  prerequisites of language; and assessing speech sound production and language use. Among resource materials provided are questions regarding the structure of space, toys, and equipment. A manual developed by the Washington County Preschool Project presents suggestions for activities (including auditory, visual and tactile reception; visual discrimination; and auditory association) to stimulate preschool children's language development.

Change in local education agencies and the contribution of the private nonprofit agency are addressed in Chapters 2 and 3, respectively: &quot;Local Change through Policy Development&quot; (B. Smith) and &quot;Change at a Private Nonprofit Agency&quot; (C. Garland). Programmatic innovations in hospitals and the unique elements of state agencies and governments are considered in Chapters 4  and 5, respectively: &quot;Changes in Health Care Settings&quot; (A. Kaluzny) and &quot;The State Education Agency and the Change Process&quot; (R. Mayo, A. Taylor). The sixth chapter, &quot;Change Strategies for Institutions of Higher Education&quot; (N. Carlson), argues for a core group of planners within the college structure and assesses alternative change efforts. Finally, Chapter 7, &quot;Planning for Dissemination&quot; (P. Trohanis), considers the dissemination of products, ideas, programs, and practices. A bibliography (R. Etheridge, Comp.) contains 45 references covering hospitals, public schools, state government, and universities. (SEW)",

After identifying benefits and liabilities associated with analyzing program costs, attention is focused on the internal and external audiences who need program cost data, the desired outcomes resulting from providing certain cost information to certain audiences, and general requirements of a cost analysis system. It is suggested that designing a cost analysis system for early intervention programs would involve determining program components and the specific tasks/activities, along with categories of cost data (personnel and nonpersonnel costs, and in  kind contributions). Implementing the cost analysis system is discussed in terms of a trial period, staff support, data control and confidentiality, and leadership and coordination. Additional areas that are addressed include: analyzing total program costs and unit costs, types of decisions/judgments that will be encountered by categories of audiences; and the mechanics of developing reports, including a model for communicating with a specified audience for a specific purpose.

Determining the focus of the questionnaire before its construction involves identifying the following: the purpose of the questionnaire, the persons who will use the results, and the specific group that will answer the questionnaire. In addition to a title that is concise, understandable, and reflects the content of the instrument, an introductory statement is needed that specifies the purpose, how the data will be used,  anonymity, and motivators for respondents to participate. Directions for completing the instrument need to be written at the language level of the respondents and should indicate the approximate amount of time required to complete the questionnaire. The demographic section should request information limited to those variables that will be used in the data analysis. To assist in the actual writing of questionnaires, 15 suggestions are presented for developing rating scales, along with tips on writing qualitative items (e.g., items which elicit information on job classification, sex); and supply items (i.e., the respondent produces the response rather than selecting an alternative provided on the questionnaire).

Since the focus of the report is to describe the technical assistance interaction between the provider organization and the client organization, a narrative account is presented of the dynamics  that occurred during specific stages/events of the process among specific staff members. These accounts for both demonstration programs (called Project Early Start and Project Co-op) each involve 20 to 25 staff (e.g., teaching staff, therapists, technical assistance coordinators, evaluation specialists). The results, which are discussed in terms of the overall projects, administration, and staff, center on the following concerns: client and provider characteristics affecting technical assistance, characteristics of the technical assistance events that are significant in themselves, and outcomes of technical assistance.

First, commonality (the extent to which clinicians made the same statements about a case) was very low; most statements in the written diagnoses and remediations for a given case were mentioned only once. Only 3% of the statements were mentioned in half or more of the diagnoses for the same case. Second, individual agreement (between two clinicians on the same case and one clinician at two different times for the same case) was also  very low. Mean diagnostic agreement between two clinicians remained close to zero across all studies. Mean diagnostic agreement results for a single clinician on a case across time showed that only 20 percent of the statements were agreed upon both times by the same person. Additionally, analysis of diagnostic and remedial process in three of the studies revealed wide variability in total time taken to collect case information (cues) and in number of cues collected.

Following an initial chapter on P.L. 94-142 (the Education for All Handicapped Children Act) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the manual considers identification, screening, assessment, and evaluation (both formal and informal measures). Physical evaluation and the development of the individualized education program are covered in a third chapter, with sections on annual goals, short term  instructional objectives, and options for placement of children in the least restrictive environment appropriate. In the fourth chapter, prescriptive teaching is addressed in terms of six steps: defining the program, planning, assessing the student, prescribing activities, teaching, and evaluating the program. Chapter 5 discusses approaches to adapting activities through analysis of six factors (players, equipment, movement patterns, organizational patterns, limitations, and purpose). Disability considerations for structuring the movement environment are grouped according to input (sensory) disorders, integration (information processing) disorders, and output (physical) disorders. A final chapter lists references on adapted physical education topics, and the appendix provides a sign  language alphabet and selected terms. (CL)",

Financial forms from school districts were analyzed to determine the number of special education teacher aides employed, salary costs, program costs, and number of students served. In the second part, administrators, special education teachers, and special education teacher aides were surveyed regarding existing programs and support services as well as future needs. Results were analyzed in terms of three major areas: (1) selection, training and employment of special education teacher aides; (2) supervision and evaluation of special education teacher aides; and (3) characteristics of teacher aides employed in Nebraska. Implications were then considered for six  major issues (sample findings in parentheses): special education teacher training needs (respondents felt a need for teachers to be trained to supervise teacher aides); aides' training needs (11 areas, including school policy, legal and ethical issues, and tutoring techniques were identified as significant needs); selection criteria (completion of training was very rarely used as a selection mechanism); supervision guidelines for teacher aides (25 percent of administrators and teachers reported that no formal evaluation of aides was being performed); characteristics of aides (their age, relatively low level of educational training, and high turnover may be reflected in the mean salary range of $3.49 to $4.40 per hour); and delivery of service to handicapped students via special education  teacher aides (aides reported spending approximately 65 percent of their time in direct instruction). Findings suggest the need for developing guidelines on aide training. The research instruments used in the study are appended. (CL)",

Trends leading to acceptance of each model are cited, as are each model's basic assumptions. Flaws in the behavioral approach are cited, and the author contends that despite its apparent success, the model promotes synthetic skills rather than real ones. She describes the holistic model which has several basic assumptions, including that the LD student approaches academic tasks passively and lacks motivation and expertise in traditional school subjects. She suggests that students'  strengths and interests must be capitalized on, and different learning rates and content accepted. (CL)",

Staff were instructed to interrupt destructive behavior as quickly as possible and use the restitution procedure whenever feasible. Timeout was implemented if necessary. Analysis of observations revealed that the use of restitution with 144 incidents of destructive behavior resulted in seven subsequent destructive behavior incidents, repesenting a reoccurrence rate of 4.8 percent. Timeout, used for 67 incidents, resulted in 30 subsequent destructive behavior episodes, reflecting a 44.7 percent reoccurrence rate. Staff choice between the two  procedures apparently reflected the available time. Student reaction appeared to consider restitution as a matter of justice while timeout tended to be seen as punishment. (CL)",

Further, Ss indicated they they were frequently involved in educational programing for handicapped minority students, except for outlining classroom activities emphasizing cultural diversity and identifying educational materials depicting multicultural themes. Findings suggested that school psychologists undergo extensive preservice and inservice training on administering and perhaps also developing techniques for nondiscriminatory assessment. It was also recommended  that educators identify educational materials related to racial and ethnic themes. (Author/CL)",

Among demographic findings were that behavior disorders represented 34 percent and learning disabilities 24 percent of the returns; that parents of resource room students represented 42 percent and self contained classroom  students 38 percent of the sample; that of the 74 percent of parents who reported their child's needs were being met, rural parents expressed the greatest satisfaction with services; that there was unexpectedly low agreement between parents and districts on the category describing the students' handicap; that 87 percent of parents were not presently involved in the local school; and that 32 percent felt no one provided them with assistance and/or advocacy. Among parent preferences for ways to improve communication with the school were regular letters and school conferences, with home visits ranking lowest. Parents expressed greatest interest in becoming involved in their child's progress reviews.

These factors affect study abroad programs in several ways. Public institutions may experience less decrease in enrollment; they should therefore increase their overseas offerings and show that such programs do not cost more than home campus programs. Private institutions need not curtail programs; they can change them to attract more students. Also, some consolidation of programs can take place to avoid unnecessary duplication. In addition to these considerations, colleges and universities might capitalize on the growing awareness of  the need for U.S. citizens to be prepared for growing international interdependence. They could design study abroad programs to meet evolving student needs and interests, make provisions for students in programs other than foreign languages, and then seek ways to administer language proficiency examinations which will bring with them some foreign language certification. In addition to these internal factors, some external factors affect study abroad programs such as the rise and fall of the dollar, inflation, and unstable political conditions in some countries.

Nonnative speakers, in their native languages, follow the same procedures. When dealing with a foreign language, however, they are not as aware of the conventions and cues that allow one to evaluate information, make hypotheses, and add background knowledge. Non-native speakers need to be aware of their active role as listeners in the foreign language as well as in their native language. Lecture transcripts and cloze lecture transcripts can be used and analyzed to make students aware of the process of listening to lectures and to give students confidence in their  ability to listen selectively, piecing the discourse together, without attending to every word. Five exercises are suggested for nonnative speakers based on the theories and analyses cited: transcripts analysis, lecture transcripts with blanks for words or ideas, and hypothesis-making using lecture transcripts in three lengths.

Forty-three Finnish university students were administered a written test consisting of production tasks, subcategorization and syntactic categories, and comprehension items. Cross sectional data were analyzed to determine whether an invariant learning sequence exists for the sentential complement structures. Students' use of these structures was also analyzed longitudinally over a 9-month period. Although the cross-sectional group data indicated the existence of a learning sequence, longitudinal analysis demonstrated that progression through this continuum varies between individuals.

        "description":"Data on 1980 college and university enrollments and trends observed for the preceding several years are presented. Information is provided on enrollment in institutions of higher education by control and level of institution, student sex, and attendance status of student, major field of study, and race/ethnicity. Specific data include: enrollment of first-time freshmen in institutions of higher education, by control and level of institution; undergraduate, graduate, and first-professional enrollments by race/ethnicity; enrollments for the aggregate United States; level of enrollment, attendance status, and student sex for the 100 institutions with the largest enrollment in 1980; public and private college enrollments; and full-time equivalent and part-time enrollments. Highlights  are as follows: 1980 enrollments increased by 4.5 percent over the fall 1979 level; enrollment increases occurred for all types of institutions, with two-year institutions showing more growth than universities and other four-year schools; and the number of women enrolling in higher education institutions rose 5.7 percent compared with a 3.3 percent increase for men; part-time enrollment rose 4.7 percent, and students enrolled part time maintained a 41-percent share of the population at all institutions; the number of men enrolled in graduate programs rose 0.8 percent in 1980; enrollment of first-time freshmen increased 3.4 percent at all institutions between 1979 and 1980, but public and private universities reported declines in the number of first-time freshmen. In addition to  statistical tables and graphs, narrative sections are included, along with a questionnaire and information on the research methodology. (SW)",

The California Postsecondary Education Commission conducted the investigation at the request of the California Legislature. The first background paper examines the evolution since 1960 of policies regarding the use of student fee revenues along with the implementation of the California master plan for higher education. Attention is also directed to: the policies of California and other states regarding the uses of student fee revenues; and policies within the state, including a taxonomy of charges and their uses at California State University, University of California, and the California community colleges. The second paper discusses the  structure of major federal, state, and institutional student aid programs, and traces the history of federal and state aid. Recent proposals to reduce the growth of federal financial aid programs and the implications for California student financial aid recipients are considered. The third paper describes a number of approaches to setting fees for graduate students, including borrowing by graduate students and the nature of their indebtedness in different academic and professional fields.

The report is divided into separate sections for the University of California, the State University, and the California community colleges. Within each section, data is provided on: classification/occupational activity; compensation; full-time faculty by tenure status and rank; and new hires, promotions, and separations. Primary emphasis in the textual discussion is placed on the top three occupational categories of Executive/Administrative/Managerial staff; Faculty; and Professional Non-Faculty. Conclusions about affirmative action for personnel in the three public segments since 1977 include the  following: there have been modest increases in the percentages of women and minorities in the faculty and staff of the public institutions; in most employment categories, men are better represented than are women, regardless of ethnic group; and the representation of women and minorities in the tenure-track faculty, as well as in the tenured faculty is discouraging.

Attention is directed to the use of past census data by higher education planners as well as the development of the 1980 Census. The geographic subunits covered by the 1980 Census that may be of use to postsecondary education planners are also covered, along with differences between the 1970 and 1980 Census data items. Additional topics include the following: the limitations of 1980 Census data for postsecondary planning, including its timeliness and usefulness; the potential use of census data in analyzing issues and problems addressed by the California Postsecondary Education Commission in its 1982-1987 five-year plan; and additional sources of data beyond  the 1980 Census for postsecondary education planning. It is proposed that the Commission take greater leadership in expanding its own databases from a variety of federal and state sources and that it make data about trends available to California postsecondary planners and leaders.

The study was conducted by the California Postsecondary Education Commission at the request of the California Legislature. After considering the complex process of instituting new state policies for new conditions, attention is directed to four concerns: new state funding policies, appropriate relationships between individual and public support, distribution of student financial aid, and the use of student charge revenues. Four recommendations offered by the Commission regarding student charges are as follows: student charges should remain low; revenues from student charges should be available to the segments to maintain access and quality;  graduate and professional students should assume moderately greater responsibility for their educations than undergraduate students; and financial incentives for public service should build on existing mechanisms. Eleven guidelines that guided the Commission in making recommendations to the legislature are included. In addition, all recommendations in the Commission's April 1982 report are listed, and their current status is summarized.

Attention is directed to the quality of outreach staff employed by the state university campuses; the enrollment of minorities from outreach high schools; the amount of campus financial support; and program coordination. Progress data are presented for individual campuses. The following strengths of the program are considered: total institutional involvement in affirmative action; allocation of state  money to campuses making the most progress and commitment; annual publication of information about the program; rural outreach efforts; and the use of successful nontraditional outreach strategies. Areas where further progress is needed include: conflict between the core program as a comprehensive concept and as separate services, time consuming and unnecessary annual funding, and inadequate implementation of a comprehensive effort on some campuses.

Problems that schools have had in billing and collecting outstanding loans and the lack of effective program monitoring by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) were assessed, along with the DHHS' efforts to correct the problems. Specifically, the review focused on: the accounting, billing, and collection policies and procedures of 23 colleges; the amount of delinquent loans, bad debts, and federal funds held; and 1,430 student loan files. It was found that too little emphasis was placed on billing and collection, resulting in 28 percent of borrowers being behind in their payments. Some schools held large amounts of federal funds and some invested the  funds but did not return the earnings to the programs. It is concluded that the program provides borrowers little incentive to repay loans promptly, although many delinquent borrowers have good credit ratings in the private sector. Although the DHHS has neither effectively monitored collection activities nor kept accurate accounting records, the agency is taking administrative actions and making legislative proposals that will strengthen the collection effort. Recommendations to remedy the loan delinquency problem are offered. (SW)",

Attention is directed to the following topics: historical developments in university-industry relationships; the motivations and expectations for research relationships among the two sectors; the range and variety of research relationships currently engaged in by universities and corporations; the variety of roles, perceptions, and organizational structures within companies and universities relating to university-industry connections; the role of individual contacts and initiative in the development of relationships; the appropriate roles of universities, nonprofit entities, industries, and government in the initiation and development of such enterprises; and issues and problems in  university-industry research relationships. In addition to describing federal government actions over the past decade, the findings of several studies commissioned by the National Science Foundation are considered. Finally, a hypothesis concerning the general line of future development is set forth, and some likely specific activities are discussed. It is concluded that in both academic and industrial circles there are positive expectations about the future of mutual exchange and about the contributions that these interactions can make. (SW)",

        "description":"The way that remediation affects the costs and the academic quality of higher education is discussed, and approaches to dealing with these problems are addressed. Recent increases in the number of underprepared students entering college have resulted in a greater need for remedial education to prepare them for college-level work. In addition to the financial burden resulting from remedial programs, academic quality may be lowered because of lowering the exit standards of a college and the value of the degree. Approaches to improve the situation may include raising admission requirements, tightening academic standards, and monitoring of remedial programs at open-door institutions. Successful remedial programs seem to use specially trained faculty who have chosen their assignment  and are trained in counseling. The use of computer-managed and computer-assisted instruction in remedial programs is likely to increase in the future, and this technology has the potential to increase learning and reduce the cost of remediation. Although Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Georgia, and Virginia now allocate considerable resources to remedial programs, they plan to phase out funding for remedial programs to all but open-door institutions.

The public higher education system and each state agency submitted alternative retrenchment budgets. The University of Minnesota proposed three approaches for cuts at the 12 percent level: across-the-board reduction; closing selected programs and campuses; and closing the entire university for one academic quarter. By June 30, 1983, the university had to reduce its expenditures and/or increase its income by a total of $25.6 million from the original amount budgeted for the 1981-1983 biennium. Within the university, priority statements that specifically identified the high and low priority programs in a college were drafted, along with a table, which is  enclosed, summarizing 90 programs that were to be either eliminated, reorganized, or reduced. A voluntary separation and early retirement policy was also made available to faculty in programs that were affected. Finally, the mix of spending reductions and income enhancements to balance the projected shortfall was determined. The following criteria were utilized for program planning: quality, connectedness, integration, uniqueness, demand, and cost effectiveness. (SW)",

He cites examples of instances in which the Division has shown commitment to strong law enforcement under the civil rights statutes. He suggests that the States of North Carolina, Louisiana, and Virginia have entered into amicable settlements to higher education desegregation cases. He notes that the present administration believes that predominantly black  institutions should be preserved rather than discontinued or merged with white colleges. The State of Louisiana is used as an example of the steps that might be taken to strengthen existing programs and locate new academic programs at predominantly black colleges. Approaches to increasing other-race enrollments at predominantly white colleges are also noted. (SW)",

It was found that the process of educational attainment is not different for blacks and whites. Study results indicate that social background plays an equal role for blacks and whites. For both races, the  process of educational attainment appears to depend modestly on social background; children of higher status parents are more likely to enter an academic track in school. The influence of academic ability, curriculum, and grades on attainment do not differ for blacks and whites. Student ability is the most important determinant of placement in an academic program, and curriculum differentiation in high school also plays a major role.

Larger effects were associated with both earlier graduating classes and  traditional students (versus students in a combined six-year bachelor of science/M.D. program). It is concluded that the curriculum may be compared vis-a-vis student performance measures from year to year, as well as over all the years it is offered. Combining and synthesizing these individual class findings permits greater generalizability and confidence in the evaluation results of the program than do individual results based on smaller sample sizes.

        "description":"The structural aspects of ritual in a modern university and the way that ritual operates through the use of tenure at Stanford University is assessed, based on an ethnohistorical analysis of the firing of a tenured professor, H. Bruce Franklin. Mr. Franklin actively opposed the Vietnam War and Stanford University's alleged involvement with the war, and was charged and dismissed for his activities and speeches, and disruption of a speech by Henry Cabot Lodge. Attention is directed to how people socially construct their own reality and the following factors: (1) the positioning of the actors in the drama, (2) the historical forces that are at work within the symbolic representation of time, and (3) the place of ritual as a process in a period of conflict in a modern organization.  It is suggested that the cognitive and social mechanisms that are at work in simple society are also evident in modern institutions, such as a university. The current case of Mr. Franklin is also contrasted to the firing in 1900 of Edward A. Ross, a young Stanford University professor with liberal views. It is noted that understanding of time and the social and historical processes contextualize the ritual. However, a sacrifice occurs that follows set patterns that are influenced by the actors and the larger social world. (SW)",

        "description":"Data from the 1970 National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience are employed to estimate the foregone earnings of college students. An estimation of earnings functions from male and female youths who are not enrolled in school, and the potential earnings of enrollees is derived by substituting the characteristics of enrollees into the earnings functions of the nonstudents. Actual earnings are subtracted from potential earnings to derive estimates of foregone earnings. The estimation procedure provides a range of estimates by employing alternative earnings functions and assumptions concerning potential hours per year. Self-selection bias, part-time versus full-time employment, and levels of enrollments are also considered. Results are compared to other studies, and a  projection of earnings foregone is made for 1975 and 1980. The estimation methodology is described and illustrated with numerous equations. The results suggest that earnings foregone per student vary greatly between males and females, part-time and full-time students, and between levels of enrollments. It is estimated that earnings foregone by college students in 1980 range from $42.69 billion to $73.37 billion. (SW)",

It is argued that major demographic, economic, and political disruptions are likely in the 1980s. Demographic trends that will have a major impact on higher education include changes in the numbers and age mix of students, the geographic distribution of educational demand, and students' special needs. Shifts in American workplaces and communities created by breakthroughs in information technology will also alter the goals of students. The financing of higher education and demand for its services are intricately interconnected to the health of the national economy. Since the range of economic future  for the next decade is large, careful planning is needed to prepare colleges and universities to meet the spectrum of potential challenges they face. Probable changes in cultural beliefs and values, the political mood that these will engender, and the implications of higher education will also be important factors to consider. Research studies are suggested that may be helpful, particularly if these projects are integrated into an overall planning and monitoring system for higher education. Author/SW)",

An explanation is presented of the design of the model, measurement definitions, and analysis intended for the state and individual user. A limited macro analysis is also presented. Student load is derived by application of a college attendance ratio to state high school graduates, and enrollments are adjusted by a system cost  index. The final output measure is the estimated appropriations and tuition revenues per student adjusted for load. The input factors of tax capacity, high school graduates, college attendance ratio, and system are relatively stable, while tax effort, allocation, and tuition can be altered by legislative action.

(Training for such tasks is distinguished from the teaching of fact systems, the training domain most heavily studied in CAI applications.) Based on the hypothesis that the attentional demands of dynamic skill simulation training require that special instructional techniques be used for training to be effective, several dynamic skill tasks were studied, and a laboratory analog to the Air Intercept Controller task was developed for experimental use. One set of experiments tested different approaches to giving the student information about performance during training, while a second set of experiments focused on the  problems and potentials of the use of voice input and voice output technologies in computer-based training. The results showed that intrusive instruction is less effective for such simulation training than is non-intrusive instruction, and that current low-cost technologies for voice input/output are aproaching the acceptability threshold for this type of application.

Consequently, the new models often fail to meet the traditional criteria of scientific theories. Tools are available or can be developed which will help cognitive scientists build computational cognitive theories that will meet some widely-accepted standards. The prime tool (or class of tools) is the competitive argument, which involves explication of the principles of a theory and its entailments, and comparison of theories to other theories and with alternative versions of itself. The evolution of one theory can be examined as it develops through a  natural progression of stages, including task analysis, articulation of principles, and competitive argumentation.

Experiment I examined retention as a function of the feedback delay interval in an introductory anthropology course using short-answer essay tests. Experiment II varied the feedback delay interval, the informational quality of the feedback, and test item type, and Experiment III examined delay and item type in a psychology course on experimental design. Results showed that neither delayed nor immediate feedback produced superior, long-term knowledge retention, regardless of feedback quality. Further, subjects in the immediate feedback conditions did not repeat initial errors more frequently than did delay subjects. The  frequent, repeatable-quizzing aspect of PSI may make feedback a less potent variable than in other courses, and results do not support the use of immediate feedback when cost considerations and convenience or administration are important.

The first survey sampled 10% of the students who had transferred to the state's public universities from a community college in fall 1979 to determine why transfer students from community colleges might be required to take remedial coursework at the universities. The second study, a survey of 52 Illinois community colleges, sought to assess the effectiveness of the colleges' methods of identifying students in need of remedial coursework; the success of students who enrolled in remedial courses; and the overall quality of the colleges' developmental programs. Findings from the surveys indicated that: (1)  students who earned associate degrees prior to transfer did not require remedial education, but those who transferred before completing a degree often needed remediation; (2) the most common methods of identifying underprepared students were standardized and college-developed tests, instructor/counselor referral, and student self-referral; and (3) the main method of evaluating student progress in remedial courses was through pre-/post-testing, while the primary method of assessing program effectiveness was through student evaluations. The studies resulted in a revision of ICCB rules governing and defining remedial education. (HB)",

Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts project increases between 1980 and 1990 of 58% in the demand for computer professionals, 28% for engineers, and 24% for engineering technicians, compared with an increase of 17% for all workers. Industrial expansion and replacement of workers will produce an annual demand for 120,000 engineers (including 33,000 new openings) and 168,000 technicians (including 21,000 new openings). Graduation trends in high technology fields, however, indicate problems in filling these positions. Workforce needs have increased faster than labor supply due to poor planning and resource allocation at the college level and poor preparation of students in science and mathematics in elementary  and high schools. These problems should be addressed through pressure from colleges and universities on local and state boards of education to improve math and science preparation in the schools; flexible provision of skills up-dating for adults in both credit and non-credit programs; and increased funding of high technology education at the state level.

After providing information on the establishment of LARC and a sample of its activities (e.g., faculty workshops, research efforts, and publication programs), the report identifies strategic questions for college planning; looks at the objectives of assessment according to the LARC model;  identifies assessment, advisement, placement, and follow-up as the four components in LARC's comprehensive system; and discusses their interrelationships. Next, various types of assessment/placement systems are briefly described and the guidelines established for the development of the LARC model are set forth.

Survey instruments were distributed to all senior females (N=853) in local high schools, requesting information on personal characteristics, family background, occupational and educational goals and perceived influences on attainment of these goals. Study findings, based on an 85% response rate, included the following: (1) 87% of the respondents were of Hispanic origin; (2) 70% expected to enter relatively high-status occupations, with the most frequently cited careers in the teaching and protective services areas; (3) the majority of the  respondents were aware that factors such as finances and job scarcity could affect their opportunity to get a job; (4) 60% aspired and expected to obtain some type of postsecondary education; and (5) the survey results confirmed that Hispanic females were success oriented. Based on the findings, it was recommended that career education programs be designed to fit students' needs; that parents be increasingly involved with youth in determining their career lines and educational needs; and that educational and government policy makers reassess their operating assumptions about what Hispanic women need and want. A review of the literature concerning the status projections of Hispanic youth is included. (LL)",

Introductory material defines technology transfer as a strategy integrating knowledge of the latest technological practices, procedures for their implementation, tactics for their integration into existing delivery systems, and evaluation designs to measure the achievement of technological mastery. Further, the introduction discusses the role of colleges in selecting delivery systems to transfer innovations to business and industry. Next, the technology adaptation project of the National Center for Research in Vocational Education is described. Using Hagerstown Junior College's (HJC's) programs as examples, the following section discusses modes  of transferring technology, including: (1) the translation of technical knowledge into information about operational tactics; (2) the installation and application of new hardware; and (3) contracts for the delivery of technological services. After a discussion of the transfer of appropriate technologies to the production setting, barriers to successful transfer (e.g., costs and lack of information) are identified. Finally, strategic issues related to the location of businesses and industries and the level of mastery of previously developed technologies are presented. (HB)",

        "description":"Between 1979 and 1981, in-depth interviews were conducted with 76 faculty and staff members at community colleges in New York, Massachusetts, and California. During a series of three interviews, participants were asked to talk openly about their lives before they were employed at the college; the nature and quality of their day-to-day work activities; and the meaning of their work and its place in their lives. Self-contained profiles were constructed for 35 participants from verbatim transcripts of their interviews. An analysis of the profiles of three minority group participants, who were working in predominantly white community colleges in California, revealed that: (1) while issues of minority status were central to the experience of the participants, they also had to contend  with the same issues currently facing all community college faculty (e.g., academic standards and student retention); (2) minority faculty were affected by the complex interaction of racism, social class, power, and opportunity; (3) many minority participants had resisted efforts by their schools and counselors to track them into non-academic vocational curricula; and (4) participants felt they had to work harder, do their job better, more thoroughly and conscientiously than their non-minority colleagues. The report describes the methodological considerations involved in indepth interviewing and includes the complete profiles of three minority group faculty members: a black counselor and teacher in her 30s; a Chicano history instructor in his 40s; and a Black physics teacher in his 40s.

Major findings reveal that students seeking a certificate were taking 56% of their course work in vocational courses; those seeking an associate in arts degree (AA) were taking 88% of their work in general education; and those seeking an associate in science degree (AS) were taking 54% of their work in vocational courses. The courses taken by certificate and AS students were generally numbered less than 100, while AA students took 75% of their course work in courses numbered 100 or higher. As in previous years, liberal arts majors took the bulk of their course work  (88%) in general education courses, and vocational majors took 56% of their course work in vocational education areas. Vocational students continued to generate the bulk of the vocational student semester hours (SSH's), and to generate an increasing proportion of the SSH's in general education courses. Other findings indicated that the proportion of SSH's generated by general education was slightly less than two-thirds of the total, and that 87% of the SSH's taken by early admits and 63% taken by concurrent registrants were in general education courses.

Thirty elementary and junior high students, fluent in French and English, named pictures as rapidly as possible while attempting to ignore distractor words printed inside the pictures' borders. The printed distractors interfered with naming both on intralingual trials, for which the distractor and name language were the same, and on interlingual trials, for which they were different. The pattern of interference across the six levels of name/distractor relation was similar for the intralingual and interlingual conditions and indicated that at least part of the interference occurred at a semantic level.

Three German and four Israeli classes were selected for systematic study. Structured observations were made of class activities, the uses of space, and salient movements in the classroom. Attention was given to glosses teachers applied to activities and to the functions of talk in the kindergarten. Observations were analyzed along several dimensions, including the impact of control through sound and the effects of sound used to establish routines or to provide opportunities for creativity. Findings indicated that the most urgent use of sound in the kindergarten was the creation of talk. Different approaches to talk in the two  cities were found, and each teacher's sound profile was revealed to be idiosyncratic. Paralinguistic sounds were also found to be significant to the ongoing context of the kindergarten. Music making was shown to be modeled in the kindergarten as a synchronized, intentional, and entirely predictable way of using sound, with the activity of making music and the sounds of music serving the kindergarten teacher as a covert means of control. The reality structured by sound in the kindergarten is discussed, and a description of data coding and scoring procedures is appended. (RH)",

Each class consisted of 15 LEP students and 3 English-proficient students. It was anticipated that English-proficient students would act as models for their LEP classmates. Two observers fluent in English and Spanish and trained in classroom observation techniques used the Early Childhood Observation Form (Revised) to record events and behaviors of specific children according to preestablished codes and definitions. Minute-by-minute records were made of the experiences of individual children across the school day. Three types of children were  observed: (1) Spanish-dominant; (2) English-dominant, high proficiency; and (3) speakers of English and Spanish with low language skills. Findings indicated that over half the school day was devoted to noninstructional activities; bilingually certified teachers and their aides provided instruction; structured learning activities were conducted predominately in English, with some Spanish being used with Spanish-dominant children; teachers differed in the amount of time spent in providing structured instruction; small-group instruction was the predominant mode of instruction; and interaction between English-proficient children and LEP peers occurred during unstructured instruction.

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine the interrelationships between drawing, early writing, and the context of talk in which both phenomena occur. Participant observation methodology was used in a self-contained public school kindergarten in order to gather daily data during a 3-month period. Specifically, children freely drew and wrote in an established area, or &quot;center,&quot; while the investigator observed and interacted with them to gain insight into their perceptions about these actions. Data collected consisted of audio recordings of the children's talk at the center, their graphic products, observational notes, and interviews with children. Patterns were identified reflecting ways the children combined the drawing and writing processes in the production of one graphic product and  in the manner they used drawing and writing terminology referentially across production modes. On the basis of these patterns, inferences were made about written language development. Learning to write was portrayed as a process of gradually differentiating and consolidating the separate meanings of these two forms of graphic symbolism. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"Studies of children's deceptive behavior have scientific merit and can be carried out in an ethically defensible manner. Many arguments against studies requiring children to deceive others in an experimental context are relatively easy to refute. It is true, though, that the debriefing phase of deception studies presents ethical problems, particularly when the researcher employs a confederate. There are substantial arguments for and against informing children after a study of the nature of any deception incorporated in the research design. Clear ethical problems would exist, of course, if subjects were put in a situation leading them to spontaneously lie or cheat. Two factors support the claim that research on deception is ethical: subjects are at negligible risk, and benefits of  the research are high. Further, certain questions can be answered with no other technique. In comparison to results of studies of role-played emotional states, results of deception studies involving spontaneous behavior are more illustrative of skill in the actual use of nonverbal behavior. Recent research suggests that the ability to be deceptive successfully is a social skill related to the development of other abilities in children. The finding of a significant correlation between role-taking abilities and ability to be deceptive illustrates the importance of research in which children are led to be deceptive. (RH)",

High-, average-, and low-ability students at the first-, third-, and fifth-grade levels were targeted for in-depth observation. A &quot;focal-child&quot; observational procedure was used to gather data on naturally occurring help-seeking interactions in the classroom. When a targeted child initiated interaction with a teacher or another child--intending to solicit aid, information, or materials pertinent to the task at hand--observers coded critical features of the episode on the observation form (i.e., the target of the bid for assistance, the type of help requested, responses to the request, and the activity structure in which the interaction occurred).  Overall, children's rates of help seeking were higher in math than in reading. Boys and girls differed by rates of help seeking and by type of help requested. Children of different ability levels were found to vary not only in rate of help seeking and type of help requested, but also in the type of responses elicited from their helper choices. (Implications of these findings for children's achievement, learning, and social adjustment in the classroom are discussed.) (MP)",

        "description":"A longitudinal study was conducted at the Frank Porter Graham Center NC to explore the use of educational day care and related services as a mechanism for preparing socially disadvantaged children for success in later public schooling. Infant children of mothers who met a criterion score on a high risk index were randomly assigned to either an experimental group which received educational day care beginning before infants reached 3 months of age or to a control group which received paper diapers and nutritional supplements but no systematic educational day care. Four cohorts consisting of approximately 28 children each were admitted to the project between 1972 and 1977. Over the preschool years social and cognitive developmental information on all four cohorts was collected. Data  on four measures appear to differ in impact on the child on a continuum ranging from distal to proximal influences. These measures are ( 1) education of mother at child's birth, (2) maternal IQ, (3) total score from Caldwell's Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment, and (4) laboratory observations of mother and child at play. Results of statistical analyses suggest that educational day care intervention with high risk children beginning in infancy can prevent declines in measured intelligence during early childhood, that early intervention may be one of the most important environmental determinants of intelligence in high risk children, and that parental intelligence and quality of home environments are other variables worth studying for their impact on intellectual  development.

A total of 112 first- and fourth-grade children participated in the first study; 114 fourth- and eighth-grade children participated in the second. In the fall and spring of the school year, children were asked to name their friends and rate their liking for other children in their grade. For the primary measure of friendship, pairs of friends were identified by a combination of best-friend nominations and ratings of liking on a five-point scale. A second measure of friendship was based on reciprocal best-friend nominations. For this measure, children were identified as friends if they named each  other as best friends, regardless of their ratings of liking for others. In general, results from both studies indicated that the stability of friendships did not increase between first and eighth grade, although it did increase regularly between first and fourth. The interplay between cognitive and ecological factors is considered to be a possible explanation for these results. (MP)",

Selected on the basis of a stratified random sample technique, participants were 96 white fathers from intact families having a 3-year-old child. Network theory provided three hypotheses regarding how a father's social network might affect his involvement in childrearing. A variable was constructed for each hypothesis; these variables were &quot;percent male network,&quot; a measure of the percentage of the exchange/activity network who are male; &quot;network range,&quot; a measure of the size and diversity of the social network; and &quot;non-kin intensity,&quot; a measure of the degree of choice operative in social network selection and  involvement. The index of childrearing involvement was labeled &quot;childrearing advice.&quot; The review also provided a causal path hypothesis in which social network was proposed as a link mediating the effect of education on childrearing involvement. Data were gathered in social network interviews designed to generate a multifaceted picture of parents' social worlds; total network membership was obtained on the basis of results on a series of role context probes. To analyze the data, the three network variables were entered into a multiple regession along with a set of eight demographic and situational variables, including father's work hours, mother's work hours, sex of child, swing shift (dummy variable), father's education, occupational status, family ethnicity, and father's age. Only  non-kin intensity strongly predicted childrearing advice, and the causal path hypothesis was confirmed. (RH)",

In the structured situation, children could see one another but were separated by a gate. One child was given four age-appropriate toys; the other child was given none. If a child with toys did not share spontaneously after 4 minutes, the mother was signaled to encourage sharing. The toys were then removed from the first child and a matched set was given to the second child for 5 minutes. Ten minutes of free interaction followed.  Interactive reciprocity data collected when the children were 9 to 12 months of age and a concurrent indicator of mother/child reciprocity were employed, involving six tasks varying in difficulty. Schematic drawings of faces with a happy or sad expression were used prior to the sharing situation to assess comprehension of emotion. Contrary to expectations, none of the children shared spontaneously in the presence of the barrier, even though toy-deprived children would often stand at the gate watching the child with the toys. A toddler's willingness to share at the mother's request was influenced by reciprocity within the mother/child dyad. Mother/child reciprocity was also related to the child's comprehension of emotional expression. (RH)",

At each of the three levels, the children's performance during interactive play sequences was found to be more advanced than their performance during noninteractive sequences.

Individual teachers were presented with 20 student requests, one at a time, and were asked to respond to each request as they might in a classroom setting. They were also asked not to dwell on each item but to respond spontaneously. Following comparable procedures, investigators provided individual students with 20 teacher requests. Imposition ratings of requests were collected a month later to eliminate potential bias due to selective  memory for items. Results indicated that both teachers and students perceived differences in impositions among a set of requests made of them. Since teachers judged requests to be more of an imposition than did students, they were less likely to respond with simple compliance and more apt to comply conditionally or not to comply at all. Students' response strategies did not vary as a function of request imposition; their predominant response was simple compliance. (MP)",

        "description":"In an effort to draw together a program response to needs of those preparing to teach in rural/small schools, a review of literature is provided, which concludes with an indepth look at a 1982 research project conducted on the topic. It investigates how important some 45 areas of college studies are to success in current teaching assignments of 162 Kansas teachers who are recent college graduates. A summary of responses indicates differences in degrees of emphasis, rather than a completely different set of qualifications needed for successful teaching in rural schools. The response to problems appearing in the literature review includes a suggestion that undergraduate programs provide a wide range of study and experiences, including those applicable to rural/small schools. Based  on studies and recommendations set forth, 18 specific areas to be emphasized in education programs are identified, including that pre-service secondary education students are strongly advised to prepare to teach in at least 2 subject areas. Although total rural education programs are impractical, it is suggested: that early experience in the field and longer student teaching periods (a minimum of 12 weeks) are valuable; that undergraduate programs should include rural/small school preparation; and that inservice/continuing professional development courses be offered to current teachers.

        "description":"An analysis of a 1979 questionnaire and interviews with young women leaving school or continuing their education in country areas of Tasmania revealed that the females were having greater difficulty in obtaining employment and were the most isolated when unemployed. For this reason it was considered desirable to continue the study. A questionnaire was sent in April 1981 to the 512 female students who were in Years 9 and 10 in 1978. The questionnaire was designed to provide information on the number of students entering the work force and continuing their education, employment histories and experience of unemployment of those leaving school, as well as to update 1979 information. Questions concerned activities of the females and their desire for further education. Additionally,  the questionnaire was sent to 66 males to allow for male/female comparisons. Employers were questioned concerning their attitudes about the qualifications of those they employed. Responses were obtained from 117 of the 148 school leavers surveyed in 1979. Many findings from this follow-up study confirmed those of the initial study. Appendices include: the questionnaire used to survey high school leavers; transcripts of interviews with 30 females; a list of questions asked of employers; and findings and recommendations of the 1979 survey.

Sections of this report address: the project background; the Australian ELD projects; how education can lead directly to local economic development; how education gives indirect support to local economies; education and local political development; how education can support local society and culture; education as a partner in the provision of joint resources; how education can inhibit local development; unlocking local resources; and the conclusions.

Of the 334 Family Involvement Questionnaire responses, 315 usable responses from leaders indicated that the 4-H program was effective. Eighty-one percent of the 4-H leaders sampled felt that the 4-H program was effective in giving parents and members of their family opportunities to spend additional time together. Only five leaders felt that the 4-H program was not effective in the area of giving members opportunities to express apreciation to others. More than 45% felt that 4-H was very or  extremely effective in giving opportunities for members to learn to communicate. Four-H leaders felt that the program was effective in contributing to citizenship development of youth and in teaching other values. Additionally, leaders felt that 4-H programs provided opportunities for members to learn to deal with problems in a positive way. The length of time the person had been a 4-H leader influenced the amount of confidence the leader had in the 4-H program as an influence in building family strengths. (AH)",

This brief narrative covers the Navajo's oral account of their emergence from a series of underworlds, presence in Dinetah (&quot;Navajo homeland&quot;) in northern New Mexico, expansion into northeastern Arizona, conflicts with the settlers and other tribes, return to and resettlement of 3.5 million acres within their  former range, and attempt to develop new economic alternatives. Next, the book provides 48 photographs depicting people, the land, the sky, and plant and animal life (e.g., a Rough Rock moonrise, cacti in bloom, juniper trees, the canyon walls of Rough Rock Springs, homestead of a Rough Rock councilman, a mud oven, goats and cattle, rock formations, and various community leaders). The book concludes with brief information about the photographer and a listing of 12 references. (NQA)",

Events described include settlement in the Four Corners region, first encounter and war with the Spaniards, the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, 4 years of peace among tribes and the Spaniards, cultural exchange with the Pueblo and Spaniards, effects of the Mexican Revolution, and slave trade. Events occurring with western settlement were intrusion of the United States Army into New Mexico; confusion and conflict with the new government and Indian affairs of New Mexico; death of  Narbona, a Navajo leader of peace; signing of the Washington treaty; leadership under Manuelito, a Navajo leader; Kit Carson's campaign to imprison Navajos and Apaches; the Long Walk to Bosque Redondo, which served as a reservation; life at Ft. Sumner; the Long Walk back to Navajoland; rebirth of Navajo country; expansion of the Navajo reservation; and the coming of traders.

        "description":"The Mexican American's education is affected by such societal factors as the (1) referent used to identify these Americans; (2) relationships created and affected by historical events; (3) access to participation in the educational process at the elementary, secondary, and post-secondary levels; (4) curriculum offering at all levels; and (5) retention efforts provided within the educational system. Therefore, the educational status of Chicanos can be judged only in relation to the education provided to all Americans. This manuscript discusses the educational status of the Mexican American by: (1) examining the Chicano's nature as that nature is affectd by historical events and by the referents used in identification; (2) looking at the nature and state of education in light of  assumptions, philosophy and principles of learning, disparities of teacher behavior, inequities of school facilities, and irrelevant curriculum; and (3) reviewing the Chicano's participation in the educational process through access, educational attainment, and retention. The manuscript concludes with 17 recommendations, e.g., re-examination of current policies and practices, new testing and grading, academic and personal support systems, better career counseling, strong minority leadership at the community level, and mode of delivery of instruction to accommodate the cognitive learning styles of Mexican American students.

Using the Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS) forms, school history records, student cumulative files, and other documents pertaining to migrant program enrollment, data on school enrollments, attendance, achievement, and participation in special programs were collected for 811 migrant students, selected from the MSRTS universe of migrant students enrolled between September 1, and December 31, 1981 at each location. Representing 56% current migrants and 44% former migrants, the 811 students  ranged in age from 5 to 19, with about half aged 10 or younger and two thirds enrolled in grades K-6. Data pertaining to student arrival and departure dates were collected in Washington and Michigan, two of the largest migrant receiving states. The migrant program's legislative history was also reviewed. Findings indicated that about 40% of the migrant student population within the six districts had a continuous school experience, generally within a single school district, and migrated only during the summer, over holiday breaks, or before initial school enrollment.

Ethnic and sex differences in the attributions of academic success or failure to ability, effort, context, or luck were investigated. Context of the MMCS, which consisted of 24 causal attribution statements, included such topics as the teacher's opinion, teacher's grading scheme, and the course material. The MMCS was administered in the spring of 1982 by classroom teachers. Students were not informed of the scale's research purposes. Results indicated Hispanic students were more internal than Anglos. Hispanics attributed their achievement more to  ability than did Anglos. Hispanics attributed their academic success more to effort and less to luck than did Anglos. Further, Hispanic students attributed their failure more to their lack of ability than did Anglos. Sex and interaction effects were also found. These results were interpreted within the framework of the attribution theory. (Author/NQA)",

        "description":"Drawing on Roger Schank's and Robert Abelson's theory of scripts as a way of viewing learning as behavior at four hierarchical levels, the study examined the literacy learning behavior of two Chicano sisters (one in the second grade and the other in kindergarten) reading orally from storybooks in a home setting. The English story books received in the mail were among the first introductions of English literacy materials into the home by children. As the elder child read to her sister, mother, and an observer, she emulated a teacher's reading to children at school. Her enactment was marked by paralinguistic cues and vignette behavior appropriate to the teacher role. When she encountered words she could not pronounce, she would pause, step out of the teacher script, and ask the  observer for help in pronouncing the words, thus enacting the theme of being a child at home in a family setting. During the reading episode, the little sister spontaneously began to copy and emulate her sister. Although important instances of learning were spotted, it was not concluded that such circumstances had a long term learning impact. The children had increasing problems at school. The self themes they developed did not manifest goals and plans that emphasized literacy. (NQA)",

        "description":"Because of fewer human resources, teachers in rural schools have to assume a larger responsibility for their own curriculum development than do teachers in city schools. There is a need for a curriculum specialist to get into a situation quickly, to assess the problem, and to solve the problem quickly in order to move to another problem. In rural schools, one of the most important ways of getting teachers to assume that responsibility is to teach them to become independent learners by using the student as a major source of information and guidance in curriculum development. While this is a generic principle in curriculum development, it is a principle that assumes the critical role in rural school curriculum development. Generalizations suggested by the model developed from this  curriculum project include: teachers, particularly in rural school districts, need proof of the effectiveness of a curriculum development (they must see a change in student behavior or learning needs); teachers need to value the approach to curriculum development (they must decide what is best and what is effective within the context of their own classroom); and teachers need more concrete guidance initially, but they need to work towards independence in learning via learning how to learn from their students.

Subject matter is presented in three  sections (oil and transportation, nuclear energy, and coal). The teaching guide includes an overview of the module (purpose; strategies employed, focusing on the dilemma/debate discussion techniques; module structure/objectives; and its use in the school curriculum) and instructional strategies related to the readings, dilemma discussions, and students activities in each of the three sections. A chart indicating moral issues (as defined by Kohlberg) presented in the dilemmas, suggested schedule of activities, and bibliography are also included. The module may be used as a separate unit of study, as a mini-course, or incorporated into existing curricula where appropriate. (JN)",

The module is organized into 12 topic areas, each containing a dilemma story, introductory reading material, sample student responses, and questions. Dilemmas are essentially brief stories which pose a critical decision to be made by a main character. This decision revolves around conflicts between two or more moral/ethical issues (as identified by Kohlberg) presented in the situation, and it is the moral/ethical implication that provides the thrust for student discussions. Preceding each dilemma are relevant readings or case studies providing basic background information regarding the  environmental issue presented in the dilemma. Questions and sample student responses (representing positions taken by typical students) serve to stimulate thinking about the issues and generate discussions. Issues examined include water shortage; world food supply; protecting access to sunlight for solar heating/power purposes; microwave; nuclear power; coal; DDT (an insecticide); waste disposal/hazardous chemicals; polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and hazardous materials; wastewater treatment; and overproduction.

The program promotes responsible citizenry with increased abilities in critical thinking, problem-solving, social/ethical reasoning, and decision-making. This module, a role-playing simulation, is intended for use in grades 7-12 social studies, general science, earth science, and English classes. It consists of 13 open-ended, decision-making activities related to a simulated space mission. Additional activities include large/small group dilemma discussions. Dilemmas, brief stories in which two or more  moral/ethical conflicts must be resolved, are accompanied by questions to stimulate thinking and/or generate discussions. In addition to student handouts and instructional strategies, the teaching guide contains module overview, chart indicating moral issues (as identified by Kohlberg) in each dilemma, suggested time schedule, bibliography, discussion of the socio-scientific reasoning model (theoretical basis of the PTW), and bibliography. The module may be used as a separate unit of study, as a mini-course, or incorporated into existing curricula where appropriate. (JN)",

The program promotes responsible citizenry with increased abilities in critical thinking, problem-solving, social/ethical reasoning, and decision-making. The socio-scientific reasoning model (SSRM) is the theoretical basis of the program. The model consists of four interacting components: (1) logical reasoning development based on Piagetian theory; (2) moral/ethical reasoning based on Kohlberg's stages; (3) Selman's views of social role taking stages; and (4) a content or informational component. SSRM serves as the basis for identifying the types of learning  experience and the sophistication level of those experiences important to help students develop. A major instructional strategy related to SSRM is the dilemma discussion. Dilemmas, brief stories in which conflicting moral/ethical issues must be resolved, consist of six stages: background information, presentation of dilemma, selection of alternative positions, small group discussions, class discussion, and discussion summary/closing. Each of these steps is discussed, followed by some general guidelines for stimulating dilemma discussions and characteristics of any dilemma discussion. In addition, a list of helpful hints and answers to commonly asked questions (such as how long should a discussion be continued) are provided. (JN)",

In the first study, 255 fourth graders were assigned to groups to be taught a 15-minute teacher-led lesson only, a 15-minute lesson plus 12 minutes of teacher-led follow-up, or a 15-minute lesson plus 12 minutes of independent seatwork, each taught individually or in groups of 3 or 6. Group size affected both time-on-task and achievement. The hypothesized relationship between achievement and amount of teacher-led instruction was supported for children taught individually; length of teacher-led lessons appeared to be critical in determining achievement for groups of 3 and 6. In the second study, 108 fourth graders received a 15 minute lesson  with no follow-up, a 30-minute lesson with 25% teacher-led instruction and 75% seatwork, a 30-minute lesson divided equally between teacher-led instruction and seatwork, or a 30-minute lesson with 75% teacher-led instruction and 25% seatwork. It was concluded that the more time spent in a sustained instructional activity, the greater is achievement. (MNS)",

        "description":"In this study, Piagetian theory is extended to explore ways in which children construct their understanding of our notational system and place value. Eighty children aged 4 to 9 were asked to group objects, draw pictures of grouped quantities, write numerals to indicate amounts, and theorize about the relationship between their written numerals and drawn quantities. Developmental levels were inferred for these and other tasks, and level x age analyses were performed. Eighteen hypotheses that children brought to bear on the meaning of the notational marks in relation to the symbolized quantities were formed, and were grouped into five developmental levels. Among the patterns that emerged was a developmental sequence in the kinds of ideas used by children, singly and in  combination. Children's understanding of place value seems to be built in phases over a long period of time, in conjunction with other kinds of knowledge. Some developmental relations were evident; however, the children appeared to have many theories that intruded upon their understanding of the numeration system. Some parallel findings between the historical development of our system and the developing knowledge of that system in children are pointed out. A selection of the children's graphic productions is appended. (Author/MNS)",

        "description":"More effective reading, writing, and communication courseware can be promoted through clearer guidelines in courseware development, stronger incentives for courseware developers, and greater motivation for teachers to seek out and use the courseware. In reading and writing, software guidelines must reflect traditional instructional objectives--or functional domains--needed information processing skills, and courseware implications. Incentives for developers include assurance of a large and stable educational market and more effective measures to control software piracy. Teacher resistance, a major obstacle to the successful implementation of computer assisted instruction, can be countered through improved teacher training, inclusion of positive teacher roles in the lessons, user  friendly materials, and the establishment of courseware evaluation standards. Recommendations for software developers, schools, and state and federal policy makers include creating computer literacy standards in preservice teacher education; establishing local teams of teachers, programmers, publishers, and researchers to generate high quality courseware; and promoting strong school positions against software piracy.

        "description":"A Chicago area private consulting firm worked in cooperation with the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) program to train applicants in word processing operations. Careful task analyses of on-the-job word processing were used to develop a curriculum based on realistic goals and expectations. Small groups of CETA eligible applicants received information on word processing careers and on the training program, as well as some &quot;hands on&quot; experience with the equipment and the kind of work that would be required. Interested applicants were then screened through a series of comprehension and literacy tests. One hundred trainees were selected to enter the program in three groups--approximately 70% female, 30% male, 80% black, and all between the ages of 22 and 44. Trainees  were paid to attend 40 hours of training per week in language skills, typing and word processing, work habits, and individual study time. Specialists in word processing, reading, and business planned assignments integrating language and machine skills, and provided classwork simulating actual job demands. The average time needed for the trainees to reach the preset standard was 20 weeks, with a few requiring only 14 weeks and a few as many as 28. The principles behind the success of this program include (1) application level reading and problem solving tasks, (2) materials and performance criteria reflecting real world expectations, (3) maximum student time-on-task, and (4) screening applicants to select those most likely to benefit from the program.(HTH)",

        "description":"A study examined the questioning behavior of teachers following the reading of a basal reader story. The four teachers who served as subjects were chosen from a pool of 18 fourth grade teachers, and were selected because their classes produced the two highest and two lowest mean scores on a standardized reading comprehension measure. Each classroom was audiotaped three times and the tapes were analyzed for questioning behavior exhibited by the teacher and for student behavior when responding. A quantitative analysis of the results revealed that students in the high mean (HM) groups tended to ask fewer questions per session and fewer different questions than did low mean (LM) group students; however, the HM teachers asked more text-based questions than did LM teachers. Both HM and  LM teachers incorporated reader-based questions into their lessons, with the HM teachers asking more reader-based questions that were related to the text and the LM teachers deviating from the text during such questioning. In addition, the LM teachers used more questions relating to management, student responses, and other language arts subjects than did HM teachers. Qualitative analysis of data showed that effective teacher questioning (1) focuses on depth rather than breadth of response, (2) is explicit, (3) reflects cohesiveness within multiple question asking as well as throughout the questioning period, and (4) clarifies misconceptions following incorrect responses.

The emergent level is the level of highest performance within the zone of proximal development, the area created by the difference between students' unaided performance and the level that could be achieved with aid. To determine students' emergent reading levels, dynamic reading assessment sessions rather than static testing procedures must be used. The  level at which students gain information with assistance can be established if teachers provide needed demonstrations, modeling, and coaching during the evaluation session. With adult mediation, students are more likely to be placed at the reading level where growth takes place. (MM)",

        "author":["Green, Georgia M."],
        "description":"Most of the ordinary words in a language do not mean; rather, they act as rigid designators, referring to the same object in all possible words in which the object exists. Most words are names that are used as rigid designators of kinds--natural kinds (species, genre, and so forth), artifacts, physical and social magnitudes, and sorts of activities, states, properties, situations, and events. As they designate kinds, it does not make sense to speak of them as having senses or meanings. Although it is appropriate to say that some words (e.g., orphan, kill, or pediatrician) have a sense of meaning that might change with time, kind-name references change, apparently, because the kind has changed, not the term. A few words seem to lack not only sense, but also reference. Some (e.g.,  all or and) have this property because they are syncategorematic, but contribute to the semantics of an expression according to logical rules. Others (e.g., yikes, damn, or the) do not contribute to the sense at all, but only to the pragmatics, that is what is to be inferred from what was said by reference to the conditions governing the use of such words. It is therefore folly to assume that the reference of most words is determined by their sense of intention. (HOD)",

        "description":"A developmental study investigated the pictorial and linguistic main idea identification skills of 104 students in second, fifth, and eighth grades. In the pictorial task, the subjects studied a complete picture story and ranked the effectiveness of four separate main idea alternatives at capturing the meaning of the story. Following the same procedures with a verbal story, subjects chose the most appropriate sentence alternative. The second and fifth grade students performed the tasks individually, and the eighth graders performed them in small groups. Compared with similar studies of adult subjects, the results of the verbal task indicated that children had more difficulty distinguishing between important superordinate and subordinate statements in a main idea identification  task than did older students. They also indicated that 11 of the elementary school students had more difficulty distinguishing between subordinate action statements and subordinate setting statements than did adults, although older students appeared better at it than younger ones. The results of the pictorial task indicated that elementary school children of all ages had more difficulty distinguishing between important superordinate and subordinate statements than did adults, with the older students more proficient than the younger ones. These results suggest that both similarities and differences may exist between the processes of verbal and pictorial main idea identification. (HTH)",

        "author":["Liebling, Cheryl Rappaport"],
        "description":"The home's supportive setting, which has the potential to encourage children to share their thoughts and feelings through spoken language, is the basis of the home's strength as a communicative context. Teachers can help extend this sharing of meaning by creating classroom environments in which written language experiences and microcomputer-based writing and reading activities are surrounded by familiar spoken language. One example of interactive software, Story Maker, enhances the classroom's communicative context by helping children concentrate on the structure and content of narratives rather than on the mechanical aspects of writing. A child using Story Maker has an opportunity to simultaneously play the roles of writer and reader as stories are created from structural  branches of a story tree. A second example of interactive software, QUILL, provides activities that encompass the prewriting/planning, composing/drafting, revising/editing, and publishing components of the writing process. Another type of communicative environment can be created by electronic mail systems in which children must attend to their audience by sending messages to peers and adults. Revisions of messages occur with the help of a child-oriented text editor. Parent-child dialogue, integrated spoken and written language experiences at school, and the inclusion of interactive microcomputer activities within the classroom all contribute to the creation of meaningful communicative contexts.

Stating that theory and research both point out the importance of text coherence in promoting reader comprehension, the report then describes strategies used to develop global, or overall, coherence in the chapter: creating a clear, defensible structure for the text (in this case, goal-action-outcome frames); using an  introduction, headings, subheadings, and tables to emphasize the text's organization and content; and relegating the information that might detract from global coherence to an inconspicuous place in the text. To increase local, or phrase, clause and sentence coherence, the chapter uses cohesive ties such as pronoun reference, substitution, and conjunctions or connectives. The second part of the report includes the actual chapter of history text and concludes with reactions by three educators. (MM)",

Thorndike's landmark 1917 study of the complexity of reading comprehension, inferential research has generally focused on either inference as a developmental process or the nature of inferences made during reading. In his 1930 study, R. W. Tyler established that inference could be objectively measured. S. G. Paris conducted several studies in the 1970s showing that readers' age and ability level influenced their inferencing skills, and indicating that young children are capable of producing inferences but usually do not do so spontaneously. Examinations of the nature of inferences have not been as conclusive as developmental studies. E. T. Goetz's 1977 study of high school students found no main effects for the importance or salience of the reading material. A 1979  study by P. D. Pearson, J. Hansen, and C. Gordon revealed that prior knowledge has a simple effect for inferable questions but no effect for explicitly stated questions. In a major contribution on the nature of inferencing, R. Tierney, C. A. Bridge, and M. Cera discovered that good readers made more causal and conditional connections between propositions while poor readers more often overgeneralized. One point of unanimity in reading research is that inferential ability is vital to mature readers. (MM)",

After reading each type of story, they responded to six questions requiring text-based inferences. Analysis of both the number of correct responses and the number of erroneous inferences revealed significant decoding ability by story-source interactions. Fast-accurate readers showed similar inferential abilities across all stories, whereas slow-inaccurate readers showed significant story-source effects and slow-accurate readers showed an intermediate trend. All readers demonstrated equivalent inferential abilities for their own stories, but  the less skilled readers showed increasing deficits in correct inference making for stories written by peers and adults.

In fact, an examination of 317 language arts programs listed in a directory of educational software shows that 60% of the programs were of the drill and practice type. In response to this problem, a microcomputer-based writing curriculum was developed for upper elementary students. Entitled QUILL, the curriculum consists of six programs, each of which addresses a pedagogical goal in the teaching of writing. The first program, Planner, helps children to develop planning and critical thinking skills by encouraging children to take notes, write down ideas, and structure thoughts that will later develop into a piece of writing.  The second goal of reading and writing integration is incorporated into the program called Library. With this program students can enter text, assign keywords, and read each other's texts. The program Publisher facilitates the third goal of making writing public by formatting written text for publication. The fourth goal, to support meaningful communication with real audiences, is handled by the electronic message systems or Mailbag. Story Maker, a story construction program, supports the fifth goal of writing with and for peers. Finally, the sixth goal of revision is facilitated by the Writer's Assistant, a text editor that helps with spelling, punctuation, and subject-verb agreement. (HOD)",

        "description":"To provide the most effective instruction, materials, and support for beginning readers, teachers need to know if young children are more likely to process from print to meaning-- bottom-up or text-driven processing--or to interpret print to follow meaning--top-down or concept-driven processing. While some studies reveal a correlation between beginning reading instruction and reading strategies used by students, others indicate that, irrespective of the strategies taught, good readers combine top-down and bottom-up processing. In a case study focusing on reading development, a four-year-old child learned to read from the words and meaning in her own repertoire. Miscue analysis of her tape-recorded reading of basal texts showed that she was processing unfamiliar texts using an  effective interaction of concept-driven and text-driven strategies. The study suggested that if children are too dependent either on expectations they bring to the text or on print as the sole source of meaning, they will be poorly equipped to handle the complexities of unfamiliar passages. Teachers therefore need to make children aware of the different reading strategies available to them. (MM)",

Instructional activities in the eight-week program stressed (1) identifying story information categories and causal relationships in simple and more complex stories, (2) completing macro-cloze exercises, (3) creating story trees or graphs, and (4) initiating and responding to inferential questions about causal relationships in stories. Comparing the instructional group's pretest and posttest causal reasoning and recall scores with those of six students of similar age and  aptitude indicated that the instructional group did make progress but that the progress varied across tasks and across children. The results showed no significant improvement in student recall. The data demonstrated the importance of matching the instruction to children's readiness level and indicated that global effects of new instruction are unlikely. It also indicated that causal relationships among elements within and between story episodes are important aspects of reading skill. (Extensive tables are appended.) (MM)",

A linguistic prediction task was set up to investigate students' use of orthographic constraints, syntactic redundancy, and syntactic and semantic knowledge. A program was written for a computer so the prediction task could be presented as a progressive cloze activity. The data were examined using inferential and descriptive statistics and detailed protocols of individual performances. Contrary to prediction, inferential analyses of the data revealed no significant differences between the groups of readers. Descriptive statistics showed some of the problems underlying the application of inferential  analyses. Protocol examination, comparing the performance of ideal readers with real ones, was the most revealing form of analysis as it showed the individual differences of children in using interactive processes to carry out language tasks.

Data indicated that the likelihood of forward saccades taking the eyes to a particular letter position is a function not only of the distance of that position from the prior fixation, but also of the word length and the letter position in the word being read. The analysis suggests that in reading the eyes are simply sent to the next unidentified word with location preferences in the word being a complex function of length and distance.

Results showed that publishers of four of the five programs acknowledged the importance of reading in the social studies curriculum and purported to teach reading-related skills. However, there was little direct instruction of these skills, and what little instruction there was often seemed inadequate. The programs relied primarily on having students practice or apply skills without the benefit of instruction in how to do this. This  situation may stem from (1) the confusion regarding what &quot;reading skills&quot; really are, (2) the fact that what is known about teaching reading comprehension is not finding its way into the social studies programs, and (3) the fact that really good instruction in content area reading takes time to develop and time to practice, and publishers seem to be unwilling to invest a large amount of their resources in developing reading instruction.

        "description":"The assumption that phonological processes support comprehension guided two experiments in manipulating the similarity of the consonant code both within silently read sentences and between these sentences and concurrently vocalized phrases. The first experiment examined whether tongue-twisters would take longer to read than phonetically &quot;neutral&quot; sentences (those containing a natural mix of phonemes). The second experiment examined whether the phonological activation that occurs in reading is shared by vocalization. For example, reading a tongue-twister with many initial &quot;t's&quot; and &quot;d's&quot; might be additionally impaired by vocalizing phrases with alveolar consonants, &quot;/d/&quot; or &quot;/t/.&quot; Results support the assumption that phonological processes are involved in at least some of the tasks  of silent reading. However, the lack of a consistent interaction between consonant vocalization and specific tongue-twister sentences did not support the hypothesis that vocalization suppresses phonological codes used in reading. The lack of specific interference between concurrent vocalization and the reading task suggests that these automatically activated phonetic representations are not subvocal motor programs. In reading, concurrent vocalization may play a role similar to its role in memory. That is, it may impair reading not because it interferes with phonological activation, but because it requires capacity within a limited capacity cognitive system. (HOD)",

The question is whether simple verbal processing differences are adequate to account for general reading ability differences. Across different verbal domains and different ages, the hallmark of skilled verbal processing is efficient word retrieval from inactive memory. What varies across different verbal domains and verbal skill levels is the extent to which one or the other of these simple processes is rate limiting for an individual. Research studies have shown that among children, the rate limiting process is word decoding, whereas among college students it is name retrieval. However, verbal knowledge also  makes a contribution to general verbal ability that cannot be easily reduced to simple verbal processes. Simple verbal processes cannot account for either differences in the ability to compose a text or to appreciate distinctions between semantically related words. The former entails a number of complex verbal abilities producing wide individual talents while the latter implies fairly simple but powerful semantic and morphological knowledge. Such abilities suggest cognitive components beyond simple verbal processes. (HOD)",

This type assumes that the time to identify a word in context is an activation function, whereas the time to activate a word in memory beyond some criterial identification threshold is a multiplicative function of context plus the individual's basic word processing rate. Studies confirm this model's predictions for individual differences in the time to read a word in context: skilled readers identify words more quickly and are affected less either by context or by stimulus degrading than unskilled readers. Conversly, while less skilled readers are more dependent on context to compensate for less efficient word identification skills, they are  less able to use context to predict words. (HOD)",

        "description":"Considerable discussion and debate have been devoted to the extent and nature of structural or functional correspondence between internal representations and their external visual counterparts. An analogue representation or process is one in which the relational structure of external events is preserved in the corresponding internal representations. A great deal of experimental evidence purporting to demonstrate the existence of analogue internal representations and processes has accumulated during the past decade. These experimental efforts have the use of a powerful psychophysical technique--mental chronometry--in common, thus permitting inferences about internal mental events and processes from purely observable data. However, analogue models for visual/spatial representations  and transformations have recently been challenged on both empirical and theoretical grounds. The empirical challenges can be shown to be inconclusive, and further experimental work is needed to resolve inconsistencies. The theoretical challenges have taken the form of proposing nonanalogue models that may account for at least some of the findings generally regarded as supporting the need for positing analogue representations and transformations. An internal process can qualify as analogue if it can be shown that the intermediate stage in the processing has a one-to-one relation to the intermediate stage of the corresponding external process. Conceived in this fashion, the nature of analogue representations can be assessed in behavioral experiments that have the potential of elucidating  the way in which mental processes simulate or model external operations and events.

A direct or indirect comparison between two apparently unlike things, metaphor consists of a topic, a vehicle of comparison, and ground--or traits--linking the topic and the vehicle. When the metaphor is interpreted, tension created by the comparison is resolved. A metaphor may be either context independent (a part sentence metaphor that is meaningless when interpreted literally) or context dependent (a whole sentence metaphor that may have a literal meaning in another context). Metaphors are evident in children's earliest speech and increase in frequency until the early elementary school years. With  adolescence, metaphor usage again increases. Children's success at interpreting a metaphor seems to depend on the developmental cognitive stage controlling their thinking. First basing comparisons on physical similarities, children gradually begin to compare psychological and abstract qualities. Instructional procedures for developing student skill with metaphors include naming and classifying exercises, work with situational ambiguities, use of metonymy, and attention to the affect that a word's function in a sentence has on its meaning.

In the first experiment, 27 third grade and 27 sixth grade students of average reading ability from rural schools in central Florida were given pretest and posttest cloze passages on science materials two readability levels above their grade placement. Between the tests, one half of the students (the experimental group) received instruction on the material covered. The significant effect for treatment of both third and sixth grade cloze posttest data supported the construct of emergent reading levels based on the zone of proximal development. L. S. Vygotsky (1978) defined the zone of proximal development as the difference between students' actual and potential developmental  level. Students' zone of proximal development appeared to be two levels above their instructional reading level. In the second experiment, baseline data were collected on the reading and vocabulary development of 23 fifth grade students from an urban north Florida school, comprehension pretests based on narrative passages were administered to all students, the experimental group received adult mediation, and all students completed comprehension posttests. Results indicated that students would be independent at reading level seven and instructional at level eight and above. The experiments suggested that emergent reading levels are a viable alternative to instructional reading level for placement in reading materials. (MM)",

Results of four subscales on teacher attitudes toward content area reading issues, benefits, use, and significance indicated that teacher attitudes, while positive, were not strong enough to initiate use of reading strategies in their classrooms. A comparison of teacher groups showed that teachers whose subject matter demanded more reading, such as English or social studies, placed the most value on content area reading strategies. Results also revealed that less  experienced teachers had better attitudes than the more experienced group, indicating the need for more widespread implementation of the inservice model developed by Dupuis, Askov, and Lee (1978).

        "description":"Given critical theory's current focus on the interaction between writers and readers over the surface of a text, it seems appropriate to examine the semantic component concerned with how writers anticipate that interaction--the interpersonal component. The relevance of the interpersonal component is apparent in traditional instruction on point of view and tone. Most composition texts encourage students to maintain a consistent point of view through consistent lexical and grammatical choices of a certain formality and purpose; many texts also encourage students to think of these choices within an initially determined rhetorical stance incorporating attitudes toward the reader and the subject matter. But the scalar nature of these choices reveals interesting information about why  some shifts in point of view and tone are considered acceptable and others are identified as performance errors. An analysis of several text samples reveals that certain shifts do occur in &quot;professional&quot; texts, but that such shifts must be modulated in order to be acceptable; unmodulated, abrupt shifts will still be perceived as mistakes. Further, such shifts must occur within the limits of variation established at the beginning of a text. The treatment of point of view and tone as part of the interpersonal component of texts permits a more accurate description of shifts and a more precise explanation of the difference between acceptable and unacceptable shifts in point of view and tone. (Three text samples are appended.) (HOD)",

        "description":"According to James Britton, too much emphasis is being placed currently on revision. In his essay, &quot;Shaping at the Point of Utterance,&quot; Britton notes that (1) concentrating on the reader in teaching writing can disturb the writer's ability to formulate what he or she wants to say; (2) the essence of the writing process is not writing something to be cleaned up later, but rather creating connections between ideas; (3) a precise and explicit mastery of the rules of writing can obstruct effective writing; and (4) writing develops in a complex relationship to speech and not by a process of differentiating between spoken and written discourse. This information conflicts directly with some of the basic principles that underly many composition texts and teaching models. Britton also  states that the basic force of writing comes less from the effort to persuade a reader and more from the effort to articulate the writer's experience. This suggests the great value in writing instruction of using very frequent short writings, emphasizing validation through the writer's experiential knowledge, and staying aware of the close relationships between writing and speaking and between writing and learning.

Hunt was used to describe two functions of macroresearch methodology--reporting and classifying--of the type conducted by J. Britton. This was done by contrasting the use of nine linguistic features of writing produced by four groups of students in each of the functions. The features were t-units, adverbial clauses, adjectival clauses, markers of tentativeness, abstract nouns, and four categories of &quot;free modification&quot; (words or phrases set off from the rest of the t-unit by commas). In addition, the study also examined differences between students at different achievement and grade levels. Subjects were borderline-pass and very successful students in grades 10 and 12. The writing was first draft and the audience was the  teacher. The results showed that students felt more free to modify loosely, by adding or interrupting or prefacing, the core of their writing when reporting than when classifying. The latter function seemed to call for closer concentration and tighter statements. On the other hand, students tended to limit their cognitive involvement as measured by the linguistic features in that they used shorter t-unis, less tentativeness, fewer abstract nouns, and fewer clauses of concession and condition.

Teachers represent a combination of two audiences: a literal audience--a specific person or group of people implied in a writing assignment--and an ideal audience shaped by the writers themselves. As these two general types of audiences imply, writers both create and are created by their audience. Their choice of genre also reflects the internal and external pressures at work during the writing process. By providing direction in writing assignments and offering help in invention and revision, teachers can aid students in establishing a hypothetical dialogue with the audience. When teachers ask questions that help students to define their audience, for example, they ensure more successful  revisions of papers. In helping to define what are acceptable and significant audiences, teachers determine how engaging students' writing will be. (MM)",

        "description":"One proposed model of the writing process describes writing as a dynamic, three dimensional, interactive process. It is dynamic in that it changes in intensity proportionate to the sophistication of the student and the teacher. It is three dimensional and interactive because, similar to the gears within a clock, it is composed of a number of smaller, dependent processes that continuously interact with and support one another. These dependent processes are the teacher, the teacher's responsibilities, the student, and the students' responsibilities, all of whose interactions are facilitated through the assignment. If the instructor's teaching style is affected by positive elements, then the teacher will most likely be effective in implementing the responsibilities of organizing,  stimulating, focusing, conferencing, assessing, and diagnosing. Unlike teacher responsibilities, student responsibilities do not represent clearly defined, distinct stages but encompass rehearsing, drafting, evaluating, revising, editing, producing, and presenting. The last major component in the writing process model is the assignment, the communicative link between teacher expectations and student performance. When students know the objectives, receive direct instruction concerning the objectives, understand how the assignment will be evaluated, and have the prerequisite skills to handle the new challenge, teachers can expect positive results.

        "description":"One hundred college remedial writing students participated in a study designed to (1) demonstrate some of the differences between speaking and writing in a controlled situation; (2) test the hypothesis that the writing of subjects who have spoken about a particular topic will be qualitatively superior to the writing of those who have not; and (3) determine the degree of semantic transfer from prior speaking to subsequent writing on the same topic. Divided evenly into experimental (speak/write) and control (write only) groups, all subjects watched a film as stimulus for writing. The experimental subjects were interviewed individually on the subject of the film, the conversations were tape recorded, and students were asked to write a 30-minute essay on a general topic generated by  the film. The control subjects were given the same instruction but were asked only to write the 30-minute essay. Essays were evaluated for quantifiable variables (words, T-units, subordinate clauses, and propositions) and judged holistically. Results indicated that the speak/write technique proved beneficial to the writing of the experimental subjects. Not only did their fluency in the use of certain quantifiable variables prove to be greater than that of the control group, but judged holistically their essays were of higher quality in terms of sophistication and number of ideas expressed, development, and organization. In addition, the prior oral exposition stimulated thinking and facilitated organization.

Suggested models of instruction emphasize the progress of the individul through conferences, individualized assignments, high levels of peer interaction, and grade negotiation. The best programs are identified as those that offer an eclectic, inductive, team-designed approach to teaching composition, focusing on writing as an ongoing learning process. The worst programs are considered to be those focused on grammar and mechanics and those that are machine or program centered. Despite the many advantages that have been credited to individualized instruction, a number of objections have also been raised, including  isolation from peers, superficial individualization and a fragmented presentation of modules. The number of studies that have examined the effectiveness of individualized instruction yield no consensus since many of the studies are flawed in design and inconsistent in their results. In fact, the bulk of the literature concerning individualized, self-paced or auto-instructional writing courses is subjective and highly interpretive, suggesting a need for further studies of the effectiveness of individualized and classroom modes of instruction.

In a 2x2x2 design for analysis of variance, 27 composition teachers were randomly assigned, stratified by years of experience, to two parallel but contrasting summer workshops. In assessing self-awareness, teachers rated themselves on 18 variables of group interaction. These self ratings were then correlated with those of the course instructor and a randomly selected anonymous peer, and the mean ratings of the peer evaluation. A 33-item, three scale program evaluation was administered to assess attitudes toward inservice manner or presentation, usefulness to teaching, and usefulness to consulting. Among the  findings were the following: (1) role playing as a technique for training agents of change appeared to be more effective than the open instruction method, except that it may have caused participants and instructors to have similar perceptions of group process; (2) more experienced teachers tended to benefit more from inservice education than did teachers with less experience; (3) teachers of low writing apprehension tended to benefit more from inservice education than did teachers of high apprehension; and (4) teachers with an internal locus of control appeared to benefit more from inservice education than did teachers with an external sense of control.

The first summary in the report, by P.

The second summary presented is by D. England of the Commission on Media and identifies the following concerns and issues: new ways of integrating media into the teaching of  English, computer use skills relevant to English and the language arts, declining visualization ability as a result of visual media, and the effect of computers on student thinking skills. In the third summary, by E. Lundy, members of the Commission on Curriculum express concern over the role of the humanities in a healthy technological society, the need to support the development of sound writing instruction at all levels, and the need to support curricula built on the best of current theory and practice. The final summary offered is by D. Turner of the Commission on Literature and identifies eight trends and issues, among them the decline of student exposure to literature, school board insistence on the use of anthologies, growing censorship, and inadequate teacher training in  literature.

Subjects were expert and novice student writers at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The research method employed was that of protocol analysis, with each student being asked to think aloud as he or she performed writing tasks. The resulting tapes were analyzed to discover the cognitive processes involved in writing and to develop a model of composition. The findings suggest the following: (1) there are important differences in the ways expert and novice writers handle the  writing process, (2) many of the strategies employed by expert writers are teachable, and (3) one of the most promising areas for improving students' writing is in the art of planning.

Specifically, the guide offers a simple, direct coding scheme for describing the movements occurring during composing that involves four procedures: teaching writers how to compose aloud, taping the composing aloud sessions, coding the tapes onto the composing style sheets, and analyzing the composing style sheet. The guide describes the style sheet as a tool to (1) reduce a lengthy composing tape to a chart; (2) introduce a coding system that can be replicated; (3) sort specific, observable behaviors into defined categories that make it possible to discern regularities and patterns within  and across cases; (4) provide a way of determining how parts of the process relate to the whole; and (5) present the sequences of movements that occur during composing as they unfold. The first chapter of the guide provides a background of the writing process and discusses the purpose of the coding scheme, while the second chapter examines various methods and techniques of observing the writing process. The coding scheme is explained in the third chapter and applied to the composing process of one writer in the fourth chapter, and the final chapter examines some of the questions that guide research efforts to study the writing process.

        "description":"In order to evaluate writer control of global coherence under various contexts, writer texts produced by 13 college freshmen enrolled in a basic skills section of a composition course were collected as a natural part of the ongoing instruction. The texts examined were written on five different topics: misuse of power, a personal experience of the writer, schooling, a writer-selected topic, and discrimination. Each assignment required different types of cognitive, linguistic, and textual manipulations on the part of the students; demanded the use of different background knowledge; and were produced under various time constraints. The written texts were then given to three readers and ranked in terms of their overall or global coherence. Results showed that as ranking conditions  varied for the students, so did their ability to control global coherence. For almost all writers, rank within one writing condition was not predictive of rank within another. Furthermore, different writers were affected differently by different tasks and sensitive to different aspects of each writing condition. Just as a writer's control of coherence within one writing condition was not predictive of control within another, overall writer control of coherence was not always predictive of control from one task to another. These results suggest that growth in writing is a process that involves the writer's ability to use and control strategies within an ever widening range of contexts. (HOD)",

However, the situation with regard to videotex, the medium that served as the basis for predicting an information society, is far from settled. The statistics concerning videotex are impressive, the technology fascinating, and the promise tantalizing. However, there is good reason to doubt that the medium is on the verge of universal availability, much less adoption, and certainly much less dominance. At this time, after all the marketing hyperbole is stripped away, the facts remain that most videotex systems are in the testing stage, are not two-way, and have not yet proven their attractiveness. Many of these alternative ways of gathering information or  of conducting transactions are not perceived overwhelmingly by consumers as having advantages over tried and proven methods. While an impressive percentage of potential consumers seem predisposed to adopt videotex, some 40 years of mass media research has shown the difficulty in linking experimental predispositions or attitudes to ultimate behavior in field studies. Despite the failure to link attitudes and behavior, predictions are still being made of a &quot;wired nation,&quot; but the information available indicates that this is more charming mythology than fact.

The component on interpersonal attraction explains the complex relationship of age to attraction, while the component on talk with friends and neighbors shows that the elderly live in a social world very similar to the college student--both see friends and neighbors come and go and must replace friends to avoid isolation. The component on marital communication presents a realistic picture of romantic communication through the life cycle, acquaints students with theory relevant to marital communication, and reviews extant research on  communication between older partners. The component on family communication and aging presents communication theory relevant to family interactions that include older members and reviews research on communication within the older family. Finally, the component on personal communication with service providers addresses two issues: (1) to what extent do social programs for the elderly facilitate meaningful social interaction? and (2) how can practitioners and clients communicate so that the goals of each will be accomplished with minimal discomfort?

        "description":"The conflict resolution communication attempts practiced by a food cooperative were studied to determine if they revealed the primary ideals of the counterculture philosophy. To highlight the findings, the study also examined the conflict resolution communication attempts of a fraternity--a representative of the dominant culture philosophy. Data were gathered through participant observation, interviews, surveys, and reviews of the literature written by and about the organizations. Results showed that the conflict resolution communication attempts of the food cooperative were based on a counterculture philosophy on the organizational level (ritual, procedures, clothing styles, jargon, and norms), but were essentially the same as the fraternity conflict resolution communication  attempts on the core philosophy level. The findings indicate that while the formal conflict resolution formats of the two groups differed, the power bases were the same, with power usually based on who had information and position. While the cooperative generally used a form of voting within the consensus process framework instead of the actual process consensus itself, the fraternity simply discussed an issue and then voted on it. The egalitarian ideals advocated by the cooperative were only superficially evident in its attempts to resolve conflicts. (FL)",

        "description":"While language switching among multilinguals has been studied in a wide variety of contexts, few attempts have been made to generalize or to integrate findings into useful communication theory. Since language switching is an important part of personal as well as group identity and since issues surrounding language identity are often a focal point of interethnic conflict, the speech act of switching language merits a more concentrated study. This can be accomplished through such techniques as ethnographic description, consisting of participant observation, interviewing, and breaching experiments; conversation analysis of bilingual interaction; and examination of communication behavior through literature. Such diverse methods of study, however, are only a first step. An approach is  needed that can integrate research findings into a useful intercultural theory and that may also be incorporated into education training in the field. Such a research direction can be provided by frame analysis, which offers a set of terms that describe metacommunication through language and code switching, and by multiple analysis research which approaches a communication event from several diverse perspectives simultaneously.

        "description":"A definition of intrapersonal communication is needed that will encompass noncognitive elements and thus allow for a broader range of research methodologies. One possible definition is the physiological and psychological decoding, processing, storing, and encoding of messages that happen within individuals at conscious and nonconscious levels whenever they communicate with themselves or others for the purposes of defining, maintaining, or developing their social, psychological, or physical selves. Such a definition differs from other conceptualizations in several ways. First, it considers both physiological and psychological processes. Second, it includes conscious and nonconscious communication processes. Third, it specifies functions that frame the intrapersonal domain.  Finally, it extends the situations in which intrapersonal communication can be considered by focusing on the functions of intrapersonal communication rather than on the situations in which people find themselves. Broadening the definitional boundaries of intrapersonal communication to include physiological processes can give impetus to new research techniques and allow for additional insights into how and why various communication processes function.

        "author":["Robards, Brooks"],
        "description":"Although television is highly dependent on language and semiotic analysis, its form can best be analyzed through the structural notion of transformation. The critic's task becomes the articulation of structural laws intrinsic to television. One such law has to do with how television structures time. Television programming transforms action into half-hour or hour-long episodes that can continue over several nights, weeks, months or years, sometimes in a simple sequence of recurrent patterns, sometimes incrementally, and sometimes even by repeating individual segments. The structural coherence of the individual episodes allows the audience closure, the ability to put together the parts of a greater whole. Instead of a compression, in a literary sense, of character development,  usually unfolding over a period of two hours, serialization demands repetition and expansion. It diminishes the need for resolution and shifts the emphasis to process. The use of temporal structure also helps build a web of connections that enlarges and complicates characters and allows for sustained thematic treatment. Given the current linguistic bias in semiotics, such considerations of television's aesthetic structure would most likely slip through the semiologist's analytic net. Structuralism as a methodological tool, therefore, must be rescued from the semiologists if it is going to be useful in television criticism. (HOD)",

        "description":"One hundred seventy-one middle school students participated in a study to assess cognitive activity during television viewing. Students completed a questionnaire about their favorite programs, viewing habits, and social reality beliefs, then viewed a 17-minute professionally edited episode of a family drama and answered a multiple choice questionnaire. The subjects also kept diaries of their home television viewing for three days, from which the amount of viewing was determined for six categories: comedy, crime-adventure, drama, cartoons, public affairs, and variety. The three main learning measures were central content learning, incidental learning, and inference-making abilities. Distinguishing between attentiveness and amount of viewing, the results indicated that viewing and  preference were predictably related. However, viewing was much more weakly related to attentiveness. In general, older children, girls, and those who scored higher on school achievement tests learned more from viewing the family drama episode, confirming that learning more reflected more advanced information processing skills. In contrast, attentiveness to television was unrelated to sex or academic achievement and related to grade only in ways that reflected changing program preferences with age. Surprisingly, correlations between attentiveness and learning indicated that more attentive viewing over a long term was associated with reduced learning from a specific television program. (HTH)",

        "description":"Two recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court have emasculated First Amendment guarantees for military personnel. In the first case, Parker v. Levy, an Army captain urged enlisted Special Forces personnel at his post to refuse to go to Viet Nam, claiming that &quot;Special Forces personnel are liars and thieves and killers of peasants and murderers of women and children.&quot; His statements were deemed violative of Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which provide punishment for conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman and for all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the Armed Forces. In rendering its decision, the court reasoned that the historical context and language of the General Articles of the Uniform Code  provided &quot;fair notice&quot; that the officer's conduct was punishable. In the second case, Brown v. Glines, a serviceman drafted petitions to several congressmen complaining about grooming standards imposed upon Air Force personnel and then circulated the petitions without seeking prior approval from the base commander. The court found the regulations authorizing prior restraint to be reasonably necessary to the unimpeded operation of the military establishment. These two decisions illustrate the need for a continuing assessment of judicial opinions to ensure that the interests of free expression for military personnel are articulated and defended. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study investigated whether there was a relationship between contestants' speaking position and their ranking and quality ratings by judges in forensics competitions. In addition, the study examined whether these relationships varied by type of event. Subjects were contestants from two- and four-year colleges in two tournaments held in California. The tournaments consisted of three preliminary rounds and one final round per event. All rounds studied consisted of between three and seven contestants and were judged by forensics coaches, graduate students, and hired local judges. The judges were asked, in addition to filling out their normal ballots, to complete a questionnaire that asked them to list the speakers in order of actual speaking with their assigned ranks and ratings.  Scores were collected for approximately 1,500 contestants. Data analysis revealed no significant relationship between speaking position and ranking in panels of three, four, six, or seven speakers when events were combined. A significant difference was found in panels of five, with an advantage to last position. This advantage disappeared, however, when the expository event was excluded from analysis. Additionally, no significant relationship was found in any instance between speaking position and quality ratings. Overall, the findings suggest that speaker position is not a significant determiner of forensic success. (FL)",

The basis of the NFC is the designated tournament and yearly divisional sweepstakes awards. Special features of designated tournaments include oral critiques and seminars on forensic issues. Initially, it was assumed that the NFC could stabilize and expand the size of some local tournaments and would provide a competitive alternative to these events for programs in the area. NFC tournaments have in fact been larger than local tournaments in previous years, and NFC contestants have competed successfully in the National Debate Tournament and sweepstakes competitions. Based on the NFC experience, several conclusions about the advisability of the  designated tournament format may be made. First, this format is generally effective in providing a stable and reasonably predictable tournament size. Second, the form is educationally defensible. Finally, this format demonstrates the willingness of forensics educators to adapt to changing conditions. (HTH)",

In an attempt to maintain some control over the quantity of arguments they may face, debaters have developed adaptive behavior, primarily through the generic argument--any argument within a &quot;deliverative&quot; framework that recurs in fulfilling the discovery of issues. Using the generic argument's standard content or form, the debater can develop arguments that are familiar in their content or function as an aid to the audience's understanding of the issues. This definition has several implications. First, any issue or argument may become generic through the argument's analytic function or repetition of content. Second, generic argument is not an impediment to  the discovery of new arguments. Finally, generic argument does not impede other adaptive responses to overload. Other fields will develop responses appropriate to their needs. (HTH)",

However, because the attainment of new skills does not by itself ensure transfer to classroom use, teacher training programs should incorporate study of the transfer process itself, reinforced by team effort. Accordingly, strategies are suggested for a collaborative approach to teacher development, involving continuous training and study of both the academic substance and the craft of teaching. Chapter 1 of this inquiry concerns the need to integrate research and practice in learning to teach. Chapter 2 distinguishes between &quot;horizontal transfer&quot; (a direct shift of skill from training to actual use) and &quot;vertical transfer&quot; (the adaptation of skills to fit  conditions of the workplace). Chapter 3 concerns attacking the transfer problem by controlling the context of the workplace. Chapter 4 concerns ways of making training more effective: forecasting the transfer problem, overlearning skills, peer coaching, and &quot;executive control.&quot; The latter, a key concept, refers to developing a functional and adaptive understanding of a given model. Chapter 5, &quot;Parallels with Athletic Training,&quot; is an interview with Coach Rich Brooks of the University of Oregon, focusing on acquisition and incorporation of new skills. Chapter 6 reviews basic principles for increasing learning aptitude and stresses the importance for teachers of continual growth. An appendix reviews the essential literature on teacher training.
