        "title":"The Development of Protection of Political Expression in Wisconsin Supreme Court Cases: 1848-1925.",
        "author":["Neal, John A.",
          "Neal, Kay"],
        "description":"Most communication courses and research involving freedom of speech examine issues by reviewing the decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the federal appelate courts. However, the high visibility of the federal courts can lead to a misguided emphasis by students of the history of free speech. Research into the development of present legal protections should concentrate on early decisions of state courts. For example, a review of the development of Wisconsin's interpretation of its constitutional provisions on free speech shows that many hundreds of cases before 1925 dealt, at least tangentially, with some aspects of free speech or free press. The most important aspect of its decisions was the degree of protection it afforded for criticism of public figures. By 1925,  the court had provided itself with a number of precedents which it could choose to consider dominant in any particular case and may have been determined by the balance the court thought wise between the free speech rights of the individual or newspaper and the right of a person not to be the object of public ridicule. In this balance, the court gave more leeway to criticism of public officials whose conduct as officials was before the voters. The court appeared unwilling to extend the fair comment rationale to persons who were not integral members of the governmental process. The Court was also not willing to extend the constitutional protections to censorship by nongovernmental sources. Very generally, there was an increase in the protection of expression during the period from 1858  through 1925. (HOD)",

        "author":["Littlefield, Robert S."],
        "description":"A study was conducted to determine (1) what active forensic coaches currently perceive to be the purpose of forensic participation courses, (2) the difficulties they have had in reaching their course goals, and (3) what they think the purpose of the courses should be. Data were collected from coaches at 130 schools with active forensic programs. Results indicated that the initial motivation for the development of a participation course was the effort of coaches to academically reward students who compete on forensic teams. The coaches defined their courses to include preparation, practice, on-campus activities, and competition, and reported experiencing a number of difficulties--generally grouped into the areas of time, content, and commitment. Suggestions for improving the  course included providing objectives, creating a syllabus, offering content that is instructional, offering practice sessions, creating both competitive and noncompetitive opportunities, and developing an appropriate method of evaluation.

        "description":"A study explored the degree to which people can capture the meaning of logical terms, using mental imagery. It was then hypothesized that: (1) subjects generally would fail to express logical relationships accurately, and (2) abstract images would be more difficult to capture than would concrete ones. Subjects, 25 college students, were asked to form mental images of two abstract and two concrete sentences, each of which contained a logical term (&quot;either/or,&quot;&quot;if/then,&quot;&quot;because,&quot; or &quot;not&quot;) and to write a brief description of the images. These image reports were then coded and analyzed. Results tended to support the first hypothesis, with only 8% of the images reported deemed adequate in a logical sense. Data concerning the second hypothesis were more ambiguous. Concrete stimuli  produced more logically appropriate images for &quot;either/or&quot; and &quot;not&quot; sentences, but abstract stimuli worked better for &quot;if/then&quot; and causal reasoning.

        "description":"An edited version of a 10-item instrument titled &quot;Decision&quot; was administered to 240 freshman students enrolled in speech courses to discover whether there were differential effects on the stability of a decision when the evidence used was fact or opinion and whether there were differential effects on the stability of the decision depending upon the sex of the persuader and persuadee in interpersonal decision-making situations. The instrument described 10 situations in which an individual with the power to make a decision had done so. The employer (persuadee) was then approached by the employee (persuader) who attempted to convince the employer to revoke or change the decision. Among the conclusions supported by the findings were the following: (1) the addition of opinion evidence  during a persuasive attempt in an everyday situation decreased the perceived stability of the decision significantly as compared to no evidence; (2) the addition of factual evidence decreased the perceived stability of the decision significantly as compared to no evidence; (3) the addition of factual evidence decreased the perceived stability of the decision significantly as compared to opinion evidence; (4) the perceived stability of the decision with the addition of evidence did not vary significantly depending upon the sex of the persuader or the persuadee; and (5) there were no significant relationships between any of the factors of evidence, sex of the persuader, and sex of the persuadee.

          "Stokes, Colleen Stiles"],
        "description":"Older, nontraditional students are appearing with increasing frequency in conventional basic communication classes, and the unique learning needs of this group present a challenge to instructors, who must take into consideration the following: (1) the challenge of the learning process itself, (2) basic problems or concerns of the adult within the classroom, (3) general characteristics of adult learners, and (4) the andragogical view of adult learning. The basic speech communication course has inherent strengths for addressing these nontraditional students' needs, in building verbal skills, integrating the adult into the educational setting, and developing the adult student's self-confidence. An instructor's directed efforts to integrate the nontraditional student into the  classroom should consider curriculum design, teaching strategies, and evaluation methods. The curriculum should be problem-oriented rather than subject-oriented, and the grading method individualistic and noncompetitive. Among the teaching strategies that can meet the needs of nontraditional students are modeling, needs assessment and student/instructor consultation, discussion, learning-teaching teams, role playing, and journal writing. Evaluation procedures should clearly define expectations, be supportive, and directly involve the student. Self-evaluation and the communication skills performance assessment scales of M. S. Knowles (1970) are among the noncompetitive evaluation techniques. (HTH)",

        "author":["Buzza, Bonnie W."],
        "description":"Effective oral interpretation, like effective communication, is self-revealing. Teachers and students of oral interpretation can improve analysis and performance of the literature by remaining aware of, first, their own involvement in the presentation and, second, the effect of this personal involvement on the audience. In the performance of oral interpretation, the author must first interpret and record his or her experience, then the oral interpreter must interpret and present the author's meaning, and finally the audience must interpret and respond to both the reader's performance and the author's original experience as expressed in the literature. Just as the giving of a name to a thing or idea reveals the namer, so does the effective interpretive performance of the reader  reveal that individual. An effective interpreter, like an effective actor, often must look inward to seek common experience, or note its absence, in analyzing a selection. At any moment, but especially in a personal moment, interpreters must first deal with emotions in terms of their own experiences; then they must be willing to show their conclusions to others. In an oral interpretation performance, however, students may be unaware of the self-disclosure in their readings, and of this self-disclosure as a source of at least part of their discomfort. Nevertheless, the reality of self-disclosure must be faced for an interpretation to be successful. And, for a fully developed experience of oral interpretation, audiences must also become interpreters, thus engaging in the same imaginative  involvement as the readers. (HOD)",

        "author":["Buzza, Bonnie W."],
        "description":"Speech teachers in small colleges often feel frustrated because of their course load and other heavy demands made on their time. Because their departments are small, they have few colleagues in their discipline to work with, and this--plus time constraints--makes it difficult for them to remain professionally active. One way they can extricate themselves from the sense of pressure and isolation this situation generates is to join a professional group such as the Small College Committee of the Speech Communication Association. This committee provides its members with a network of colleagues with whom to interact, share ideas, and so on. This approach appears to work, but it is difficult to demonstrate it clearly and objectively. Research is needed to define small college speech  departments, to gather objective data on their programs and their faculties, and to assess the progress of both so that professional organizations know how to respond to their members' specific needs. Monitoring of 25 colleges and universities in the midwest has provided some answers and has suggested some other areas where help is needed. (Extensive tables containing general information about the schools monitored, detailed data about their speech and drama faculty and curricula, and a copy of the questionnaire used to gather information are included.)

Thirty-one coaches and 71 students from colleges and universities in the eastern United States responded to a set of comparison statements addressing three primary areas of consistency versus diversity in individual events: (1) tournaments offering both national and nonnational events versus those that offer only national events, (2) a nationally accepted description of events versus descriptions developed by individual tournament directors, and (3) nationally accepted time limits versus time limits determined by individual tournament  directors. The survey results indicated that, overall, both coaches and students preferred tournaments offering diversity--both national and nonnational events--over those offering national events only. A majority of both coaches and students preferred to attend tournaments that use nationally accepted descriptions of events rather than the diversity of descriptions developed by individual tournament directors. A majority of both coaches and students also preferred to attend tournaments that adhere to nationally accepted time limits for events. (HTH)",

        "description":"An interpretive report of the conference &quot;Creative Partnerships in Technology: An Open Forum,&quot; held in Atlanta, Georgia, fall 1983, is presented. The first section, &quot;Computers and Learning,&quot; discusses the fact that the instructional capacity of the computer makes it possible to transcend the limits of the current educational system. The need to rethink instructional practices is outlined and indications are made that the basic motivation for education has changed, e.g., with increasing computer use the role of memorization in learning may be on the way out. Section 2, &quot;Beyond the Computer--Skills for Tomorrow,&quot; redefines skills needed in a technological age and suggests the following trends: (1) the growing importance of public and private partnerships supporting public schools,  (2) an increased emphasis on lifelong learning, (3) greater cooperation within the educational community, and (4) the need to bring about legislation and public support for major philosophical change. In section 3, &quot;Computer Literacy,&quot; the definition and evaluation of computer literacy are discussed. The fourth section, &quot;Realizing the Potential--Making Technology Work in the Schools,&quot; discusses the assessment of teacher competencies, the evaluation of software, and the use of networking. Case studies of California's and West Virginia's educational computer programs are provided in section 5, &quot;The Process of Change--Two Approaches.&quot; Section 6, &quot;Next Steps--Forming a Regional Agenda,&quot; discusses planned partnerships for positive change. The keynote address, &quot;A Nation's Schools in  Transition,&quot; presented by LeRoy Hay, the 1983 National Teacher of the Year, is included along with five appendixes. (MD)",

        "description":"Documented effects of relaxed school disciplinary standards show the need for implementation of strict, consistent disciplinary measures. Poor school discipline endangers students and staff, contributes to teacher burnout, hinders student education, costs taxpayers, and encourages criminality both in and out of school. Students rights advocates and court decisions have protected the rights of disruptive students, failing to consider the rights of other children to learn in a disciplined, structured place. The result has been a loss of teacher authority and the inability of schools to respond to criminal activity with an appropriate degree of punishment--thus erasing distinctions between good and poor behavior. Stepped up security measures are not the answer. Studies have found  that the best, virtually cost-free method of responding to the problem is a clear, systemwide commitment to constructive and firm treatment of discipline problems and a strong, dedicated principal who serves as a role model for both students and teachers. Such was the case in the transformation of George Washington Preparatory High School, in the Watts section of Los Angeles, California, from one of the worst schools in the Los Angeles area, in 1979, to a school with a safe environment where students eagerly accept the opportunity to concentrate on academic achievement, in 1984. Although the Reagan administration has undertaken a school discipline initiative, state and local jurisdictions must accept their responsibility to restore discipline to the public schools. (DCS)",

        "description":"Recent polls have shown that the more education a person has, the less likely he or she is to be proud to be an American. What school children learn today about their country and political system may leave them confused and lacking conviction. Much of this change to neutrality in citizenship education regarding political systems spills over from the values education movement. The change is accurately chronicled in textbooks, which often fail to communicate the basic values of the Western tradition. When the fundamental principles that undergird the political system are not focused on, government is trivialized and citizenship is deprived of the moral and social meaning that engender loyalty. Loyalty is at the very core of human values, allowing social bonds to exist. Adolescents  are naturally more concerned about freedom than about loyalty; yet if they can be taught to feel that they are part of a community, loyalty can grow. Textbooks will change to reemphasize good citizenship only if parents and teachers place greater emphasis on patriotism. Reviving patriotic songs and poems, the pledge of allegiance to flag, and the celebration of national holidays and heroes, and by teaching the obligations that freedom entails--including simple private observance of the law--may be the best way to introduce children to patriotism.

It covers who they are, what roles they play, and how they contribute to various outcomes. The sample is from the Study of Dissemination Efforts Supporting School Improvement, a national study of the impact of four selected dissemination/school improvement strategies on teachers and schools in 146 districts. Of these, 66 districts (45 percent) have designated one or more persons as local facilitators--a total of 78 persons, including 35 curriculum coordinators, 10 other district personnel, 4 assistant principals, 1 guidance staff person, 1 assistant superintendent, and 27 others. Characteristics of  these facilitators are described, including years of experience in various positions, professional activities, and inservice education. Next, data are provided on local facilitators' perceptions of the value of the practice they are helping to implement, and on their sense of ownership of the practice. This is followed by information on the time they spent and the roles they played in the school improvement effort. A description is provided, with accompanying data, of how local facilitators interact with external facilitators, and of how local facilitators influence the school improvement process. Two causal models are present that illuminate the variables influencing school improvement outcomes: individually focused (outcomes among individual teachers) and school-focused (outcomes at the  organizational level). Charts and tables are included. (TE)",

        "description":"The Dissemination Efforts Supporting School Improvement (DESSI) study examined the adoption or development and implementation in 146 schools in 10 states of 61 practices that were part of 4 federal or state programs. Local schools in the study sample were asked to identify those individuals (facilitators) who had helped them with a particular new practice. Based on data collected from 96 external and 78 local facilitators, this paper describes the distribution of facilitators by program and by site; looks at the general patterns of facilitator assistance; examines the activities included and emphasized in the assistance given by facilitators; and discusses the variation in certain outcome variables when different assistance configurations are present. Findings show that the sheer  presence of facilitators in local sites attempting change is striking: of 146 local schools in the study sample, only 17 did not nominate either an external or a local facilitator. Assistance given by facilitators formed nine clusters of activity: (1) initiation/awareness, (2) support of teachers, (3) administrator adoption preparation, (4) teacher adoption preparation, (5) materials, (6) implementation specifics, (7) evaluation, (8) continuation/diffusion, and (9) allocating financial resources.

The problems have remained in spite of remediation strategies based on additional controls and regulations within state/federal programs. Accordingly, the Management Control Project, a research and demonstration project funded by the National Institute of Handicapped Research, was designed to develop, implement, and investigate an innovative approach to agency management. Emphasis is placed on setting performance standards, evaluating performance objectively, and providing feedback regarding performance. Skilled counselors  operate autonomously; the system eliminates superficial controls. Experimental testing was completed in Georgia, Michigan, and Maryland, each of which has begun statewide installation plans. Performance has improved significantly in all three states. Analysis of survey data show little change in job satisfaction, perceptions of time utilization, and leader descriptions. Work alienation surveys demonstrate that counselors feel that they have significantly more authority regarding their work and that they feel less confined by rules. (TE)",

Three bodies of literature are highlighted and summarized in pursuit of answers to these concerns. First, the large body of leadership literature is searched for material on change facilitation and style. Models of leadership discussed include Fiedler's (1978) contingency model, the Vroom-Yetton model, the path-goal theory, the attribution theory, and Jago's typology of leadership research and literature. The second body of literature considered is the change agent literature. Three classifications of approaches to change  described by Chin and Benne (1969) are presented (rational-empirical, normative-reeducative, and power-coercive), followed by Havelock's three change models (social interaction, research and development, and problem-solver). Other models discussed include the linkage model, Goodlad's responsive model, the concerns-based adoption model, and the Rand Change Agent Study model. The third section presents three related bodies of literature on principals: leadership role, principal as change facilitator, and principal effectiveness/school improvement. The fourth section provides a synthesis and discussion, while the final section presents a working definition of the change facilitation process and of &quot;style.&quot; Thirteen pages of references are included.

The application of a climate assessment battery in organizational development and the evaluation of disciplinary programs in schools is described. The &quot;Effective Schools Battery&quot; (ESB) produces climate profiles to diagnose school problems, suggest improvement ideas, and monitor progress, based on questionnaires completed by teachers and students. Profiles of illustrative schools are shown, and the implications of these assessments for program design are discussed. Selected results from the evaluation of the U.S. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) program are presented to illustrate the application of the  ESB in program evaluation. Finally, the implications of knowledge gained from evaluation of the OJJDP program are contrasted with the recently emerged &quot;get tough&quot; approach to school discipline. (TE)",

        "description":"Results from the evaluation of a large-scale educational intervention designed to prevent school disruption suggest that altering the school organization is a more effective approach to delinquency prevention than treating individuals. Data for this comparison came from the evaluation of a school-based delinquency prevention program, Project PATHE, that operated in seven Charleston, South Carolina, public secondary schools between 1980 and 1983. Two other schools are used for comparison purposes. The following steps, taken together, were found to reduce school disruption: involving the school staff, students, and community members in planning and implementing change; using information to identify weaknesses and focusing resources on those weaknesses; retraining school staff; and  making changes in the curriculum and discipline procedures in the school. Using roughly the same level of resources to provide what, for a typical school system, is intensive tutoring and counseling services of high quality appears not to have reduced delinquency or its risk factors. Appended are 3 data tables and 11 project reference. (MLF)",

The development plan adopted addresses this issue by recommending five levels of differentiation for each administrator job classification. A person may stay in one classification for an entire career and move through the levels of differentiation as approved. A graduate certificate and appropriate certification are required in order for a person to be eligible for consideration for these positions. Upon appointment to any of these positions, the person will receive an initial, nonrenewable certificate, good for 2 years. Results of a review panel will be used to make recommendations for provisional status and for a continuing,  renewable certificate. Each of the subsequent three career levels requires a minimum of 2 years' service before advancement. Qualifications at each level, the percentage of salary increments, and the composition and function of the review panel are outlined. Compensation details are also illustrated in tables for the positions of assistant principal, supervisor/director, principal, assistant superintendent, associate superintendent, and superintendent.

        "description":"In examining the dynamics of change processes in high schools, this study makes initial interpretations about school officials who serve as change facilitators. The researchers found that a trend exists for the source of change to come from outside the high school. Principals, assistant principals, and department heads as well as central office staff and teachers are obvious role groups to take the lead in implementing change in high schools. Some principals do act as active change facilitators. Department heads, in most cases, do not facilitate change implementation. The role assistant principals play in facilitating change is defined by the principal. If principals are passive, then assistant principals maintain the status quo; when active principals involve assistant  principals there tends to be a dynamic change facilitating team. The dynamic of the central office is similar to that within the school; if the superintendent or the assistant sets a priority for change, then the central office staff is active in that direction. In general, teachers rarely act as change facilitators. While it is difficult to make sweeping generalizations or to propose specific prescriptions, there is a need to further study the roles of underutilized staff, and to clarify potential roles that staff can assume. Without clarification and assistance, change will be treated as an event rather than as a process. (MD)",

The evaluation consisted of a national survey of 2,600 randomly selected LEA's. A telephone survey found that 83 percent of all schools have been inspected. Of those, 35 percent were found to have asbestos. Almost all LEA's with asbestos (93 percent) have abatement programs, about one-third of which (31 percent) are operations/maintenance only. Only 9 percent of the LEA's were in complicance with the rule by June 28, 1983, the rule's compliance date; 11 percent were in compliance by January 1984,  the date of the survey. Recordkeeping and notification were the major problem areas of noncompliance. Quality assurance site visits were made to 38 LEA's, and 94 schools within these LEA's were inspected. The LEA data collected during the site visit agreed substantially with the telephone survey data. The document contains 24 tables and 4 appendixes. (MD)",

Responses to a questionnaire by 129 principals (from a sample of 15) were analyzed to determine the extent, diversity, and results of fund raising activities and fee collections. Approximately 90 percent of the responding principals indicated that fund raising was practiced in their schools. The most popular fund raising activity reported was student picture sales (87 percent), followed by sweets sales, carnivals, and entertainment. Academic programs receive 65 percent of the funds and extracurricular programs 35 percent. The amount of funds collected ranged from $5,000 to $100,000 annually, with the  average of $25,000. Eliminating fund raising activities and increasing taxes were favored by 84 percent of the principals.

The main purpose of the study was to investigate different ways to document the actions taken by the principals to facilitate implementation of innovations in their schools. In this paper, the procedures and methodology of the pilot study are described, followed by analysis of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the five data collection procedures tested: (1) a written log maintained weekly by the principal; (2) a weekly report submitted via audio tape; (3) weekly reports over the telephone; (4) a monthly face-to-face &quot;game plan&quot; interview; (5) a face-to-face Stages of Concern interview. Results of the pilot study led to the  conclusion that a combination of logging and interviewing procedures might be used in the major study. An ideal technique, resulting from the research, is described, and other implications of the pilot study for the collection and analysis of qualitative data are discussed. An appendix provides an overview of the major study and its procedures. (TE)",

This issue brief draws from presentations given at two sessions on education and excellence held at the 1983 meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures. California's approach is highlighted, based on the assumption that a thoughtful strategy precedes successful passage of comprehensive legislation. Three other general legislative approaches to improving education are given, contrasting a strategy of centralizing state authority over the schools to one of delegating maximum responsibility locally, and concluding with some suggestions on how to strike the middle ground.

Complicating factors cited range from increased employment opportunities for women and minorities outside the teaching profession to difficulty in objectively measuring teacher performance. Research shows that better respect, status, and working conditions are the most important factors in attracting people to the profession and getting them to stay. Advantages and disadvantages are given for each of 24 policy options that range from increasing all teacher salaries to establishing a merit pay system. Legislators are advised that no single policy is likely to solve a state's problem of  recruiting and retaining qualified teachers, but rather, that what is needed are packages of policies that address specific needs and that are able to garner public support for teachers.

First, meta analysis, a procedure used to review and integrate results of 156 studies (1937-1983) on the efficacy of early intervention with handicapped, at-risk, or disadvantaged children, is evaluated and its needs established. Among tentative conclusions offered as a result of the review are that intervention programs do result in moderately large immediate benefits for handicapped and disadvantaged populations; the more highly structured programs are directly associated with more effective outcomes; certified primary intervenors are substantially more effective than noncertified intervenors; and that for disadvantaged populations, the immediate benefits of  early intervention decline rapidly up to about 36 months after the intervention is completed. Results were not clear-cut as to whether or not involving parents in intervention programs is effective. The second major research effort was directed to analysis of cost effectiveness for half day versus full day programs for communicatively and mentally disabled children. An economic model for cost analysis is proposed and its use illustrated. The third research activity described is a longitudinal study of early intervention with hearing impaired students. Among findings was that hearing impaired Ss who received early home intervention perfomed better than late intervention Ss on communication/language skills in relationship to academic skills. Additional chapters describe disseminative  activities, the functions of the advisory committee, research training for graduate/research assistants, and project management. (CL)",

The studies which are discussed were designed to demonstrate that basic cognitive tasks are capable of predicting performance on standard measures of intelligence. The subjects of the research were 141 graduating high school seniors, who were tested on 10 different tasks of cognitive ability. In addition to the 10 tasks, each S completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and a demographic questionnaire. An introduction to the symposium by Douglas K. Detterman briefly describes the research aims and procedures. The results of each of the 10 tasks are presented in separate papers: (1) \"Reaction Time, Memory  Scanning, and Recognition Correlates of Intelligence\" (Frances A. Conners and Douglas K. Detterman), which presents the results of the Choice Reaction Time task, the Sternberg Search Task, and the Recognition task; (2) the paper by Peter J. Legree and Douglas K. Detterman, which discusses the Tachistoscopic Threshold, Tachistoscopic Decay, Learning, and Relearning tasks; and (3) the presentation of Rolf Taylor and Douglas K. Detterman, which reports on the Stimulus Discrimination task, the Self-Paced Probe task, and the Experimenter Paced Probe task. The general purpose of the three papers is to present the data obtained from each task, compare the results obtained in this study with those generally obtained using these tasks, and, where relevant, to compare the results of this research  to those obtained in a previous study.

These conditions serve as \"marker\" diseases, i.e., they have characteristics that make them representative of the total range of such illnesses. Definitions of chronicity and severity are also considered in the background section. Section 2 focuses  on the organization, costs, and financing of health care services for chronically ill children. A brief section on public policy principles concludes that policies should be designed to help families carry out their responsibilities to nurture their children and encourage their development. The fourth section advocates the establishment of a regional program that emphasizes comprehensiveness of service, coordination, continuity, and communication. The concluding section examines issues and recommends changes in the health care system regarding organization and financing of services, schools, research, and training of service providers. (CL)",

The lack of opportunities for establishing custodial contracts in the five areas was one of the obstacles cited. Findings reveal that even during the recent recession, the company was able to compete successfully in the custodial business, stay in operation, and realize a profit. Additional comments focus on  employee involvement in running the company, private sector involvement, and marketing of small businesses. The model is seen as a feasible alternative to traditional vocational rehabilitation approaches. Policy implications and recommendations conclude the report. (CL)",

Reliability was established by using the test-retest method. A supervisory rating was developed and the reliability established by using the split-half method. The correlation between the supervisor's two separate scores based on their responses to odd and even items revealed a Pearson product-moment coefficient of .98. A factor analysis was computed to determine whether a general or distinct factor of performance existed. Two factors emerged: performance and compliance/conformity, of which performance was the stronger. A concurrent approach was used to establish the criterion validity of  the Fine Finger Dexterity Work Task Unit. Statistical analysis revealed some degree of positive correlation between the predictor and criterion. It was concluded that the validity coefficient of .33 would be useful in selection when the selection ratio and base rate were favorable. (Author/CL)",

Basic planning principles, reflecting philosophical and legal concepts such as least restrictive alternative, normalization, and respect for human dignity, are reviewed. The next section considers the negative aspects of the continuum of residential services, including the following: (1) such a continuum is highly expensive to implement (most of the resources go to the more restrictive settings); (2) it reinforces and deepens the perception of difference in disabled persons; and (3) such a continuum prohibits development of a truly individualized program in congregated, segregated settings. In contrast  to the continuum approach, the report cites advantages of the home-centered approach. Differences between a facility-based and home-centered approach are charted in terms of language, community presence and participation, program function, and decision making. Issues specific to children, adults, and handicapped persons with special needs (including the elderly) are noted. Aspects of management models needed to develop integrated residential options are described. Ohio's needs for preparing for transitions to a home centered residential system are briefly noted.

The subjects were 40 Persian students in Canada at two distinct proficiency levels, and 20 native English speakers as a comparison group. Communication skills were elicited by a concept-identification task using concrete and abstract nouns, and involving both oral production and interaction between members of the two groups. A taxonomy of communication strategies was developed, with classification into four communicative approaches (linguistic, contextual,  conceptual, and mime) based on the type of knowledge used by the speaker for their adoption. Results also showed that differences between groups in the adoption of communication approach types were minimal except in the relative frequency of use of some strategies, and that the groups differed in success rate at getting meaning across and in their effective use of strategies to communicate abstract concepts. It is concluded that use of communications strategies and target language proficiency level are related, use of communication strategies is dynamic, and that differing surface realizations of speakers' communication skills cumulatively affect success in conveying meaning.

        "description":"Part of a study of the oral communication skills of Chinese scientists in an intensive course in English for science and technology focused on the importance of attaining accuracy or mastery for their specific language needs and the error tolerance level of English-speaking scientist peers. Three students in each of three different science specialties at the Graduate School English Language Center in Beijing were chosen as subjects for speech samples of two types: one a planned presentation as in a formal, professional setting; the other, unplanned, informal conversation. The three students in each specialty had language skills considered good, average, and weak. Native English-speaking scientists and English teachers evaluated the taped speech samples. Results suggest that the  Chinese scientists probably could function adequately in formal and informal professional settings and have adequate speech speed, but with only acceptable grammar. It is also concluded that the program had successfully lowered the psychological barrier about making mistakes in English. Adjustment of language programs' expectations of accuracy and fluency to meet the real language needs of the students, weighing grammatical accuracy against other factors such as word choice and pronunciation, is recommended. Appendices consist of the evaluation questionnaire and two statistical tables showing results. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study of language patterning as an indicator of higher cortical process focused on three matched comparison groups: normal pre-middle-aged, normal elderly, and elderly adults with senile dementia Alzheimer's type. In addition to tests of memory, level of cognitive function, and organic deficit, the formal aspects of language were analyzed in these 60 individuals through tests of phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Significant differences in linguistic processing between the comparison groups were found, and the findings suggest that there is a fundamental correlation between the degree of organic impairment and the degree of linguistic decrement, and a direct relationship beween normative denotation and connotation and organic intactness. The process of senile  dementing appears to be a process of dedifferentiation in which the person can no longer respond to complexities of the cortical realm. The progressive incapacity of the elderly person with Alzheimer's dementia to code and decode within the normative range is similar to a process of desocialization, and in this process, the two lines of thought and language, or meaning and sound, which merged at one point in development, now begin to separate. A direct relationship is found between linguistic deficits and linguistic complexity, with a concomitant inverse relationship between linguistic deterioration and sequence in language development.

        "description":"A study investigating whether and how non-native speakers of English (NNS) make efforts to repair communication breakdowns with other NNS used data gathered from 59 verbal interactions by 26 students. The students were grouped by proficiency level (low, medium, and high) before the analysis of the interactions took place. Each instance of breakdown was classified according to the speaker's strategies to re-establish communication. Nonlinguistic and group repair types of strategies are considered as well as other strategies: word-for-word or nearly word-for-word repetition, appeal to the written language (spelling, writing down or pointing to a word in question), clarification by repeating only the final segment of the original utterance, restatement in a different form, returning  contractions and abbreviations to their full form, paraphrasing, defining, providing contrast, providing examples, providing contextual information, and gesturing. The results of the analysis indicate that NNS do negotiate understanding with each other through a variety of strategies, typically following a two-tiered approach: (1) first checking to confirm that both speaker and listener agree about what has been said; and (2) if that is not sufficient to re-establish communication, clarifying meaning by a variety of mechanisms. In addition, when communication breaks down in a group, the group can attempt repair without waiting for the original speaker to repair the communication himself. (MSE)",

It has been caught in the turmoil associated with the downfall of the theoretical model and the rise of several others. It is no longer identified solely with language teaching, but has begun to explore the solution of language problems in nonformal educational settings and noneducational settings as well as in traditional educational settings. However, while applied linguistics has evolved in recent years, it suffers from the lack of a clear model for what it is doing. Applied linguistics needs to develop a theoretical paradigm offering a constructive view of language, against which to test hypotheses. After a period of deconstructivism, the discipline is entering a period of constructivism with the  development of a new paradigm, much of whose content will come from current work in oral and written discourse analysis. The new paradigm will probably cause an even greater separation between applied and theoretical linguistics. Other elements promising to have a major influence include some of the work in language acquisition, the issue of literacy, the question of fluency versus accuracy, and analysis of language learners' needs.

(2) Are these differences reflected in traditional speech and language tests? and (3) Will presentation of tests in English and Creole enhance the child's performance? A native speaker of Creole provided information about the Cape Verdean culture and translated the Test for Auditory Comprehension of Language, which was then administered to a small group of native Creole-speaking immigrant children,  some of whom were language-disabled, and the results were compared with a series of predictions. The findings suggest that this test is a viable clinical procedure for monolingual examiners assessing language performance of nonnative English speaking children, and are being used to establish more appropriate levels of expectation for the performance of Cape Verdean Creole speaking children on the test. The specific language differences between English and Creole that were identified are generalized to other types of tests in the educational setting. (MSE)",

A literature review explores materials relating to the process of change, staff development and school change, and bilingual programs. A description of the program in question, exploring key factors in program change, follows. The program is in a recently urbanized community east of Los Angeles that is almost half Mexican American. Data were collected from documents, observation, and interviews. Three approaches of organizational change, including the empirical-rational, normative-reeducative, and power-coercive approaches, were  applied to the process experienced by the school when funding was removed. It is concluded that the approaches to change used by the school's administration, and particularly by the principal, included changes in attitudes, values, skills, and significant relationships as well as in knowledge and intellectual rationales. Elements of all three approaches played a part in the school's experience. Specific aspects of the staff development process and their role in the change process are examined, and the significance of the teacher-aide relationship in this situation is discussed. (MSE)",

The study examined two hypotheses: (1) that the notion of diglossia applies to the British deaf signing community, and (2) that the low variety of BSL will exploit the visual medium in its grammar to a greater extent than the high variety. Data were collected on the structural features of the language relating to diglossia according to Charles Ferguson's work, and on those areas of grammar sharing special potential for exploitation of the visual medium: spatial modification as a marker of case relations, negatives, and interrogatives. The research population was the entire British signing community of about 40,000. Results show the community has a clear perception  of two varieties of BSL, each used under different conditions comparable to high and low forms in diglossia, and that the low form does exploit the visual medium in its grammar to a greater extent. The findings have both theoretical and practical implications. Further support is found for the notion of diglossia and for the relationship of structure and function. In addition, it is proposed that the controversy over the use of signing in schools can now be better informed, the methodology of teaching sign language can be improved and made more explicit, and the expansion of sign language can proceed with more information.

        "description":"The decision of whether to use French or English in Montreal, Canada, is not always predetermined but must be negotiated by the interactants in conversation in ways that can be serious or humorous and have great potential for misunderstanding. The complex relationship between language choice and ethnicity is one factor involved in the decision about which language to use. After a long period of social and geographic isolation of the francophone and anglophone communities, the francophones have become increasingly aware of their lesser economic and social opportunities and have as a community preferred solidarity and replacement of the anglophone community to assimilation into it. Protection of the French language is one aspect of this solidarity. Each language choice situation  has its own set of norms, generally unspoken and sometimes governed by circumstance, as in the situation of a patient seeking medical care. Conversants may identify their preference immediately, negotiate the choice of language, or wait until spoken to in their preferred language. In cases in which language choice may be politically determined, one conversant may prefer not to identify a preference. The negotiation process can become a negotiation not only of language choice but also of interpretive frame. Larger-scale events thus have a direct effect on people's communication strategies, but the events are also affected by interpersonal negotiations, an example of how language can come to have social values attached to it.

It was hypothesized that Greeks tend to be more indirect in speech than Americans, and that English speakers of Greek ancestry may have Greek communicative styles. These hypotheses were tested through observation of interactions, interviews with Greeks and Americans with bicultural experience about their interaction experiences, and a questionnaire based on an actual conversation. It is concluded from the findings that conversational style, which is strongly influenced by family communicative habits, is more resistant to change than more apparent marks of  ethnicity such as retention of parents' language. Furthermore, understanding the patterns of retention or loss of ethnically-related communicative strategies can offer insight into the assimilation from Greeks to Greek-Americans. (MSE)",

        "description":"The case study of the use of a classroom observation technique to evaluate the abilities and performance of a bilingual kindergarten student previously assessed as a low achiever is described. There are three objectives: to show the validity of the ethnographic monitoring technique, to show the value of teachers as collaborating researchers, and to demonstrate how information gathered in a natural classroom setting is useful as immediate feedback and can be incorporated into ongoing planning. Ethnographic monitoring, or focused ethnography, takes personal observation of social behavior and constructs a social theory of the working of a particular culture in terms as close as possible to the way its members view the universe and organize their behavior, and focuses on particular  aspects of variation in observations that are theoretically and practically salient. The approach was applied here by videotaping a low-achieving student's behavior outside the teacher's view and immediately presenting it to the teacher, expanding her awareness of the child's communicative competence and other positive social qualities. The process resulted in an improved student-teacher relationship, changed instructional strategies and teacher expectations, and improved student performance. (MSE)",

        "description":"A discussion of student competence focuses on two types of competence required of students: the integration of academic content and interactional form (e.g., turn-taking, producing ordered and coherent discourse, making coherent topical ties), and the integration of teacher and student agendas, examining what happens when students' display of academic content is not integrated with appropriate interactional form. It is observed that lack of integration undermines classroom social interaction and can lead to negative teacher evaluations of students. It is proposed that students and teachers come to the classroom with different agendas, objectives and programs they would like to see met, and students and teachers coordinate procedures to accomplish their respective objectives,  allowing multiple activities to coexist in the classroom. It is argued that recognition of the existence of interactional competence as part of the implicit, tacit background of social knowledge students must learn as they learn academic knowledge is important, and that this competence is often important in teachers' and others' evaluations of student performance. Prevailing theories of socialization are criticized from the perspective that socialization is a two-way street, with students and teachers influencing each others' behavior in the classroom environment.

        "description":"The study of the spontaneous generation of a pidgin by two children, five and six years old, to accommodate their communication needs when neither had fully acquired his native language, is described. The children were an African native of a Swahili-speaking family and an American child living in the African village. The new language created was a mixture of Swahili and English but distinct from both, unintelligible to any but the two, and the primary language for both children for most of their daylight hours for a period of fifteen months. The pidgin is analyzed from the American child's comments on and translations of tape recordings of a variety of interactions. Directions of linguistic change and elaboration typical of creolization were found. The language is described in  terms of its elements from Swahili and English, lexical content and development, an ethnographic view of the social context of the pidgin, the village speech community, children's speech community, and functions and uses of the pidgin. Comments are made on verbal play and the process of invention in language, and on the universal characteristics of both children's language and pidgin language. Transcribed conversations and data on specific word use and utterances are used as illustrations. (MSE)",

        "description":"Several ways in which the speech event may constitute a frame for performing and interpreting a particular speech genre are illustrated in the Samoan &quot;fono,&quot; a meeting of chiefs and orators. In this event, both the organization of verbal interaction and the particular kind of language used by participants is distinct from the participants' conversations in other social situations. The turn-taking rules are different, the lexicon is specially suited for the context, different terms are used for differentiating statuses and ranks, and the morphology and syntax are distinctive. Within the event itself, native speakers differentiate two types of speech: &quot;lauga&quot; and &quot;talanoaga,&quot; and the terms used for this distinction in the fono speeches also refer to but do not match types of speech  found outside the fono, illustrating again that the speech event is a key to interpreting the genres in each case. This is related to the notion of verbal art as performance: despite their structural similarities, two instances of the same speech genre are both performed by the speechmaker and perceived by the audience in a different way.

        "description":"Research on Spanish/English code switching is reviewed and the definitions and categories set up by the investigators are examined. Their methods of locating, limiting, and classifying true code switches, and the terms used and results obtained, are compared. It is found that in these studies, conversational (intra-discourse) code switching is separated from situational (stylistic) code switching because the latter is motivated by obvious social factors while the former may have various motivations. Also, intrasentential switching is found to be more interesting linguistically than intersentential switching because of its complexity. In such research, it has usually been found necessary to exclude terms already borrowed by the community. Proficiency, attitude, and education are  all seen to affect the type of code switching engaged in, but some common rules are followed. It is concluded that the different results obtained by investigators may be due to different analysis methods and to different ways of classifying switches. A comparison of classification schemes clarifies what is and is not code switching for the improvement of future data gathering and analysis methods. One conclusion is that there is little justification for the educational system's prevailing stigma associated with language mixing, because linguistic borrowing is not a corruption of language but an inevitable and natural process in language contact.

The field methods outlined include neighborhood studies (aims, design, selection, entry, the  interview and its components, and field experiments), the telephone survey (the sampling problem, the Philadelphia sample, survey design, and evaluation), group sessions, rapid and anonymous surveys, a comparison of methods for acquiring sociolinguistic data, and policy for protection of data and subjects' rights (candid recording, protection of anonymity, and access to tape recordings).

        "description":"In view of the apparent successes achieved with Labovian quantitative methods in the analysis of phonological variation, it is not surprising to find these techniques being extended to include the study of syntax. Sankoff suggests that the extension of probabilistic considerations from phonology to syntax is not a conceptually difficult jump. However, this optimism is premature. An analogous view of syntactic variation is incoherent; what is meant by the notion of syntactic variation is a moot point. No sociolinguistic or syntactic theory exists that is sufficiently well articulated and restricted to deal with the problem of variation in syntax. The most serious issue raised by the problem of syntactic variation concerns the kind of semantic/pragmatic theory on which the  foundations of an integrative sociolinguistic theory should be based. Possible approaches to accounting for this variation include seeing the form of grammatical structure through the relationship between (1) the logical structure of utterances and surface syntactic form; (2) perceptual processing and syntactic process; or (3) conversational organization/interaction and syntactic structure. The third approach has the advantage of allowing a perspective on variation in acquisitional and post-creole continua as well as on both diachronic and synchronic variation. (Author/MSE)",

        "author":["Sherzer, Joel"],
        "description":"A system of classification for tellings and retellings by Panama's Kuna Indians reveals the dimensions of their structure and function, textually, contextually, strategically, and ethnographically. Kuna verbal life can be characterized in terms of three distinct ritual-ceremonial traditions marked by three distinct languages, settings, sets of official actors, and speech events and two basic patterns in the organization and performance of discourse. A constant interaction of poetry and discourse is also characteristic of Kuna verbal life. The typology deals with the intersection and interplay of saying or reporting, and retelling or reformulating. Five types of telling-retelling are distinguished as: (1) a telling followed immediately and sequentially by a retelling; (2) a  telling followed by a retelling to a different audience in a different setting; (3) telling of the same content in one way for one purpose in one context and in a different way for another purpose in another context; (4) a range of contexts for performance of magical texts; and (5) performance of the same narrative content as the central verbal event of two separate and discrete ritual-ceremonial traditions, by different performers, in different linguistic varieties, in different contexts. Attention to these different telling-retelling relationships allows for focus on interplay of allusive and non-allusive language, rhetorical strategies, verbal expression of new information, and the Kuna theory and practice of magic and narration.

        "description":"A study of the limits of native speakers' awareness of, and ability to express, the dimensions of his language for the researcher investigates this hypothesis: that the ease or difficulty of a native speaker's characterization of the use of the forms of his own language depends on certain general semiotic properties of the use in question. Specifically, the study looks at the pragmatic dimension of meaning in speech forms, or how speech forms are used as effective action in specifiable cultural contexts, such as when a proper religious or judiciary functionary pronounces a man and woman husband and wife. It is concluded that although the linguistic models applied to cultural phenomena have usually depended on the pure referential system unique to language among all social codes,  this investigation illustrates that the other functions of language are always being assimilated to reference in terms of native speaker awareness. They are subject to conscious metapragmatic tesimony only to the extent that they ride along on referential structure. Further research using this approach is suggested in the areas of understanding the cognitive bases of the many functions of language, and of the investigation of cultural phenomena in general.

Variations of steady gazing, a common eye contact routine, are outlined, including: (1) negative non-gazing or glance routines, especially in situations in which gazing would ordinarily occur; (2) gazing for visual acquisition of knowledge, characterized in various lexical items indicating positive results of the gazing or knowledge acquisition by more than one sense; (3) long and unhurried scrutiny, with different terms to describe cautious looking, speculative looking, or participation in a process one is watching; (4) glancing and then blinking hard and looking away, serving as a warning to the speaker; (5) rapid blinking  as an insult; (6) eye-rolling associated with witchcraft; (7) gazing with eyes half-closed and head tilted back as an immature gesture; (8) eye-contact avoidance as embarrassment or humility; (9) darting sideways glances as an indication of fear; and (10) intense gazing, sometimes with narrowed eyes or wide open eyes to show anger. Childhood error in understanding gazing routines, finer distinctions in gaze type, limits to gaze duration, less readily-elicited Hemba terms for non-negative short gazes and scans, and the interaction of other situational factors in distinguishing gazes are also discussed.

        "description":"Because speaking was a major symbolic focus of 17th century Quakerism, a movement of radical puritanism, and distinctive ways of speaking represented the principal visible means by which the Quakers differentiated themselves from others, much of the religious and political conflict surrounding Quakerism implicated speaking in some way. One aspect of their speech that challenged the core of social relations and interaction was the Quaker refusal to use politeness phenomena: greetings, leavetakings, salutations, titles, and honorific pronouns. The Quakers actively criticized the practice of customary manners, feeling that such utterances were not literally true and that they represented earthly pride. It is not clear what address forms they actually did employ except that they did  call both Quakers and non-Quakers &quot;friend&quot; and that the handshake became a customary gesture of leavetaking in some situations. The reason for the Quaker rejection of &quot;you&quot; in the second person singular is the subject of much speculation focusing primarily on two principles: grammaticality and the rejection of forms of deference. The &quot;plain style&quot; of speaking characterized by these elements was the subject of much public debate, the thrust of some of which was to try to decrease the validity of plain talk by trivializing it. The Quaker response was that if the plain style did not deserve so much attention, why did the non-Quakers oppose it so vehemently? The fact is that it did become a rallying symbol for both Quakers and non-Quakers during this peak period of the Quakers' missionary  zeal. (MSE)",

        "description":"While most previous research has implied or assumed that the conversational structure giving each speaker a turn to speak is universally normative, findings of one study suggest that in interactions with at least four participants, alternatives to this rule are possible. A phenomenon called &quot;conversational fission&quot; occurs when a four- (or more) person conversation departs from the one-person-one-turn format and two or more subconversations occur, allocating multiple speaker and multiple listener roles. This pattern is illustrated in a six-person conversation, both in speech and in body, head, and eye movements. At some point, two or more participants may self-select to speak simultaneously, and the situation is either repaired by one or more speakers becoming silent, or becomes  two or more simultaneous conversations. This initial simultaneous talk may be an invitation to fission and may also involve a search by the simultaneous speakers for an available subgroup of listeners. The dyadic turn-taking model should be revised to account for turns taken simultaneously in non dyadic conversations, a multi systemic interaction pattern. This pattern also argues against the assumption of verbal hegemony in interaction with the related consideration that the right to speak is inherently limited rather than interactionally controlled and negotiated.

Previous work on folk theory has shown an internal structuring by which a premise entails subsequent terms, consistent within the framework of the folk theory's logic. An analysis of metapragmatic statements in U.S. case law materials reveals a crudely \"Whorfian\" premise from which a common folk theory of language builds. This theory, evident in judges' decisions and dissents, predicates the ability to understand U.S. political concepts on fluency in English. Because becoming a citizen requires comprehension of these political concepts, the folk theory links identity as a U.S. citizen with the ability to speak the English language. The appearance of a Whorfian  premise in this folk theory also lends support to the suggestion by cognitive anthropologists that scientific theories are typically systematized adaptations of folk theories.

The dictionary is primarily oriented to spoken communication and was designed to be semantically sensitive, bridging the semantic gap between Tibetan and English. Tibetan terms corresponding to submeanings of English subterms are specified, and each entry in the dictionary includes both the Tibetan orthography and a phonemic notation to indicate pronunciation. Grammatical features are noted, and all examples of usage are presented with the romanization of the Tibetan and phonemic notation of the spoken forms. An introductory essay outlines the main features of Tibetan grammar. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study of one of the most recurrent and persistent obstacles in learning English as a second language, the use of tense marking, is presented. The analysis is based on audio recordings from a Vietnamese community in Northern Virginia, representing four age ranges from 10 to 55 years, two lengths of U.S. residency (1-3 years and 4-7 years), and both males and females. A range of possible effects on variable tense marking patterns is considered, including surface form distinctions such as regular and irregular forms, phonological shape of those forms, the linguistic context of the forms, lexical items, and relative frequency of the forms. Higher order effects such as foregrounding, episodic boundaries, and tense continuity within narratives are also considered in both spoken and  written language. The analysis reveals that surface-level constraints are more significant than the higher-order constraints, and that several principles account for the systematic relationships of variability among forms. Written language constraints show both similarities and differences with spoken language, demonstrating an important lack of isomorphy in the two language registers. The nature of tense marking in interlanguage is shown to have some corollaries with the way tense marking has been treated traditionally in formal instruction. It is concluded, however, that this similarity derives from some general principles of second language acquisition rather than the primary influence of formal instruction on English tense formation.

Facts include the following: the typical rank for a female faculty member is that of untenured instructor; affirmative action policies have not significantly increased the percentage of women on higher education faculties; the salary gap between female and male faculty continues to widen; in the early 1980s, women make  up the majority of the postsecondary student population; women earn about half the bachelor's and master's degrees awarded each year, one third of the doctoral degrees, and one quarter of the professional degrees; many women attend college on a part-time and reentry basis; and content analysis studies demonstrate that many postsecondary texts continue to stereotype male and female roles and exclude women from the narrative and content.

The following common software design models that have been helpful in developing CAI models are briefly reviewed: composite or structural design model, Jackson model, META stepwise refinement model, and higher-order software model. Design principles that encourage the development of good software are also explained--modularity, abstraction, localization, and hiding. The CAI design model is based on the META stepwise refinement model and consists of five phases: problem clarification, system design, blueprinting, CAI synthesis, and documentation development. The problem clarification phase is composed of three tasks: objective development, content research, and  narrative synthesis. The purpose of system design is to prepare the instruction for computer coding. Blueprinting involves the development of a detailed description of the CAI from frame to frame and function to function. This phase involves two stages of development: frame development and frame design. CAI synthesis refers to the actual encoding of the computer, along with debugging and evaluation. Finally, documentation involves the development of manuals and technical data. (SW)",

A model of instructional design and the unique qualities of computers are also briefly reviewed. The general model of instruction, which is used for designing a curriculum, has five major components: objectives, pre-assessment, instruction, evaluation, and feedback. When planning CAI it is necessary to determine what outcome should occur from instruction. Once objectives and items for pre-assessment have been determined, method of presentation must be determined. CAI is broken down into four major types of presentations: drill and practice, tutorial, simulation, and problem solving. The method of design includes content development,  presentation development, frame design, response assessment, feedback/reinforcement development, and post-assessment. Content development concerns the selection and \"story line\" of the information presented in the CAI, while presentation development involves the design of strategy for presenting the content effectively. The contributions of various learning theorists to the various phases of CAI design are considered, with attention to theories of Hull and Thorndike, Skinner, Pavlov, Guthrie, Piaget, Estes, Bandura, and Gestalt theory.

Students' responses to a questionnaire were compared to those of a control group matched for academic ability. In addition, faculty completed an open-ended questionnaire to evaluate the honor class. It was found that honors students had  higher grade point averages, enjoyed their classes more than did nonhonors students, and were much more likely to double major (33 vs. 4 percent) than were nonhonors students. Honors students also indicated that their coursework had a greater impact on their future career choices and their studies were much more experiential in content, compared to the work of nonhonors students.

Although students were highly successful in completing the course, student evaluations indicated that the course was not as interesting as they had expected. Student attitudes concerning highly interactive graphic material in the form of videotext presentations (TELIDON) were assessed. Over 300 students participated in the evaluation. Two sections of the course were taught using traditional lecture and seminar techniques. Two sections of the course were taught using a PSI format with module quizzes presented via a VAX computer system.  Two other course sections also experienced the PSI format but these students took quizzes via TELIDON. The combination of a PSI format and the use of the color/graphic/text TELIDON mode of presentation produced enhanced student performance and course satisfaction without increasing student study time. Overall, TELIDON was accepted by students as a superior mode of communication. Information presented via TELIDON was judged to be more definitive and helpful than the same information provided by a lecturer or via computer text. (SW)",

        "description":"The educational motivation of 200 adult undergraduate college women from four academic groups were examined, using the Educational Participation Scale (Boshier, 1971). The sample ranged in age from 30 to 55 years old, with a median age of 39. Their academic areas of study were business and public administration, health services, liberal arts and home economics, and education and psychology. Overall, the women were motivated highly by \"cognitive interest,\" moderately by \"social welfare,\"\"escape/stimulation,\" and \"professional advancement\" and low by \"social relations.\" The academic program groups did not differ in social relations, escape/stimulation, and social welfare. On professional advancement, the liberal arts/home economics group scored lowest. Minority women scored higher  on social relations, professional advancement, and cognitive interest. Unemployed women score higher on professional advancement and cognitive advancement. Caucasian unemployed women were highest on escape/stimulation and lowest on cognitive interest. (Author/SW)",

In addition to evaluating records of 761 students, officials who administered the program were interviewed. The following practices by schools did not comply with the Pell program requirements: (1) admitting unqualified students who had a greater tendency to drop out of school before completing their training than did qualified students; (2) not establishing and/or enforcing academic progress standards; (3) misrepresenting themselves to prospective students; and (4) making errors in computing and disbursing Pell Grant awards and refunds. It was found that about 83 percent of the schools failed to consistently enforce  academic progress standards. Estimates by the General Accounting Office indicate that: 27,100 students were allowed to remain in school despite making little academic progress, and while receiving $68 million in federal assistance; 766 of the 1,165 schools in the universe had misrepresented themselves to varying degrees in recruitment; and 433 schools had computed some Pell Grant awards incorrectly. Appendices include the response of the Department of Education to this report and information on the study methodology. (SW)",

The Annual Operating Report for the period ending June 30, 1983, was revised to reflect changes in new regulations and program policy and to monitor more closely the progress of schools in their efforts to  lower delinquency rates. DHHS is unwilling to impose on schools the penalty provided for them in the current regulations, until a policy decision is made as to how the delinquency rate will be calculated. Data are presented that show dollar delinquency rates in 1981 and 1982 when a loan was delinquent if a payment was 90 or more days overdue, and in 1983 when a loan was delinquent if a payment was 60 or more days overdue. The data indicate that considerable progress among the schools has been made in reducing their loan delinquency rates. (SW)",

Business leaders reaffirmed that employees educated in the humanities have writing and speaking skills, interpersonal abilities, and a historical perspective. One theme of the recommendations was that colleges need to maintain excellence in the humanities, as well as services and courses that help students begin successful careers. Another theme of the recommendations was that businesses should examine their hiring practices  and should hire specialists only when particular expertise is essential. They should develop methods that incorporate the knowledge and perspective of the humanities throughout their operations. Recommendations for schools include the following concerns: teaching, curriculum development, research, career advising, liaison with local businesses, internships, and continuing education. Recommendations for business include the issues of hiring, training and placement, professional interchange, internships, and employee education. (SW)",

Study of the humanities yields a liberally educated person who: remains an active independent learner; stands on a system of values that demands the application of ethical concerns to action  and that accepts the presence of alternate value systems in others; understands the cultural milieu of modern society; possesses skills in analysis and synthesis, critical thinking, reading, writing, and speaking; and welcomes productive work that calls for continually developing capacities and for flexibility in changing the direction of careers over a lifetime of work.

The objectives and procedures followed by the bank in recruitment and training of new staff are addressed. Trainees are screened for six mental abilities that correlate with success in this position: memory, learning speed, logical reasoning, divergent thinking, convergent thinking, and affinity for numbers. As of 1981, about one-third of the bank's trainees had majors in the humanities; over two-thirds had majors in liberal arts and sciences disciplines. Success on the job had a negative correlation with collegiate education: sixty percent of the most successful managers held only bachelor of arts degrees, while a similar  percentage of the least successful managers had master's of business administration degrees. It is concluded that hiring students with diverse academic backgrounds and then providing specialized training are effective in an organization having a wide variety of jobs and career paths. Focusing on specific mental abilities is critical for recruiting, training, and job success. Some skills are needed by the job applicant at the time of recruitment (logical reasoning ability) while other skills can be developed through training. (Author/SW)",

Two assessment instruments developed by the American College Testing Program were used: the College Outcomes Measurement Project (COMP) and the Alumni Survey. For a sample of college seniors from 52 colleges, the COMP tests were used to measure performance in the following six general outcomes areas: communications, problem solving, clarifying values, functioning within social institutions, using science and technology, and using the arts. For the Alumni Survey, 1,959 humanities graduates and 3,164 business graduates were studied. Alumni attitudes were examined as a function of academic major and the number of years since graduation. Pursuit of continuing education by alumni, their career paths, and  salaries were also assessed. It was concluded that humanities study develops general skills of value in a wide range of careers, and that the humanities contribute relatively more than business curricula to the development of three critical skills: writing, speaking, and understanding written information. Further, while a humanities major is not a prerequisite for business success, study of humanities disciplines contributes to the development of cognitive skills, social skills, and work habits considered indispensable to today's business environment.

The humanities can help develop both the values and functional skills that are necessary for executive success. Competence in value analysis helps future executives to understand the full implications of the economic system, especially when it is followed by the study of microeconomics from a liberal arts perspective. The humanities, particularly philosophy and literature, can play a significant role in approaching value questions. Executive action requires a balance between creative and integrative abilities and execution and control responsibilities. Business curricula teach students to develop systems of control and execution through study of fields such as finance, production, marketing, and  accounting. Certain business disciplines also develop skills in evaluating alternative strategies, structures, and technologies. Business subjects are comparatively weak in developing a facility for generating opportunities, exploring their full implications, and presenting choices to form a coherent strategy. Literary studies offer a broad spectrum of experience and skills that are significant for the creative and integrative dimensions of executive action. (SW)",

The scrutiny of students' writing, which occurs in humanities courses, develops skills in logic, precision of expression, and the ability to persuade. Humanities studies, which include English and history, help students learn about how people act and think. Humanities majors not only develop skills in writing but also in reading. Humanities graduates have skills that are valuable to a range of unspecialized jobs (management, public relations, personnel, communications). Liberal arts colleges should find  out about job opportunities and create more ties with diverse employers. Insufficient concern for introductory humanities courses by colleges and narrow teaching of advanced courses are criticized. Specific reference is made to issues concerning the study of English. Reasons that keep business from turning to the humanities to find their employees are largely related to the identification of subject matters in the university, the established relationships between college and business, and routes of access by which students move to business careers.

Longitudinal data on career paths show that humanities graduates have fared as well in their careers as vocationally-trained graduates. However, humanities graduates face special problems when they seek their first job after college. There are limited opportunities for access to campus recruiters and limited interest by  employers in those with liberal arts backgrounds. While technological knowledge may be useful to college graduates, the communication and interpersonal skills used in administrative positions are usually learned in a liberal arts curriculum.

Information was sought on incentives and barriers affecting business-university research and approaches to strengthening cooperative relationships. The following types of information were used: published materials and data; interviews with key Florida industry, government, and university personnel; and questionnaires mailed to samples of high-technology business administrators and university administrators. A literature review and an explanation of the conceptual model for the project (organizational structure and  interorganizational relations theory) are included. Among the findings is the point of view of the SUS administrator that the most helpful state action would be to provide research parks, personnel exchanges, and funds. Appendices include the survey questionnaires, information on empirical studies and literature reviews of tax and other fiscal incentives, sections of key Florida and federal legislation for joint university-business research, an illustrative protective agreement concerning research disclosure and review procedures for joint research conducted by Florida universities and business firms, information on types of operating joint business-university research programs, and a bibliography.

Several types of institutions were assessed: residential, commuter, traditionally black, and special focus (military, medical, technical, and agricultural). Also considered were the performance of transfer students. The study population consisted of over 63,000 transfer students who were attending a state college system in 1983. Students who transferred within the system itself were the primary focus. Comparisons were made by level of institution and were broken down by gender and minority status. The numbers of students transferring and their performance before and after transfer were also assessed by  type of institution. It was found that when students transfer, typically their grade point average (GPA) increases, with the exception of students transferring to universities. Some institutions were sending a large number of students experiencing difficulties at that institution (typically at the universities) to other institutions where the students experienced an increase in GPA.

Attention is directed to a proposed bill that would require university athletic departments to maintain an accurate accounting of all athletes under scholarship, organized by sport, in order to evaluate their academic progress. The following concerns are addressed: the case of athletes who have academic ability but do not succeed because of time demands placed on them by athletics; the dilution of academic standards to accommodate the student-athlete; and the extent to which athletic scholarship programs respond to the needs of student-athletes no longer able to participate in college athletic programs. Additional considerations include: the initial eligibility of the  student-athlete; the extent to which student-athletes are awarded inappropriate passing grades; and the problems student-athletes face in accumulating enough credits to graduate in 4 years. The proposed bill would require institutions to make an educational commitment to the athlete at the time of recruitment. If it took 4 or 5 years for the student to graduate or if the individual was injured, the scholarship would not be terminated. Suggestions are offered that college presidents should get involved in college athletic issues to stop abuses. (SW)",

Attention is directed to the need for improving and enhancing the research infrastructure, including support for instrumentation, buildings, and other related research facilities. U.S. universities and colleges are encountering severe facilities and instrumentation problems. Federal funding to universities has recently been made in political, rather than peer review, circumstances. Recently, several universities have attempted to alleviate their infrastructural problems through direct solicitation to the Congress, thereby by-passing any peer-group review, which is based on scientific merits of specific proposals, in open competition. Constraints to the research infrastructure in U.S. universities  include equipment, space, support personnel, graduate student support, and the ability to handle the information explosion and to translate new information into practice. In addition, universities face increased indirect costs. The attractiveness of an academic career is being diminished by an environment that provides outdated equipment and inadequate laboratory space. Tax incentives to business and equipment grants by the federal government are important catalysts in the development of university-industry research partnerships. (SW)",

Attention was directed to QOL, adjustment, and stress in the study population. Life component satisfaction ratings were multiplied by the importance ascribed to them by the respondents. Life component scores for men and women were factor analyzed separately. The use of correlation and covariance matrices led to similar results. A high level of similarity between men's and women's QOL structures in four factors was found. Active use of leisure time was an important structural component for both men and women, despite a negative association with having and raising children in women. Personal development was another common structural component  for men and women, although this involved a relationship with a spouse or member of the opposite sex for women and relationship with relatives for men. Involvement in the community was another common component: for women it was associated with self-expression, while it was related to work for men. Finally, a productivity component was revealed for both men and women. For men, it described the classical good provider role, while for women, it was associated with personal health and safety.

        "description":"As mathematics instruction in two-year colleges enters the late 1980's and 1990's, two major concerns will come to the forefront. The first is retraining faculty to ensure the provision of instruction relevant to the needs of two-year college students. Retaining this relevancy involves two aspects: faculty must acquire new knowledge in order to provide instruction in new areas; and faculty must incorporate new approaches, methods, and emphases into existing courses. The second concern involves retaining and uplifting of the vitality of mathematics faculty. Limited resources, changing demographics, and heavy resources are fast depleting the vitality of faculty in two-year colleges. The changing clientele of two-year colleges includes underprepared students, older returning  students, part-timers and students needing nontraditional class times and nontraditional modes of instruction. Providing appropriate instruction to these students will require mathematics faculty attention and concern. The notion of faculty vitality appears to be the key link upon which any new curriculum recommendations will depend. There needs to be a new direction on the part of colleges in terms of workload, remuneration, and the role of the faculty at the college. Other facets of society, such as industry, government, and foundations will also have to support efforts to retain quality instruction and faculty vitality. (Author/LAL)",

The purposes of tutoring services are to provide individual attention to students in academic difficulty, training and assistance in developing effective study skills, assistance and support to special groups of students such as the physically handicapped or learning disabled, and to assist the instructor in skills courses or labs. Students who are recipients of tutoring services include students without the verbal and mathematical skills required for college work, students with disabilities, and older adults seeking retraining or beginning job skills. The benefits of tutoring include decreased dropout rates, improved student grades, and financial  and educational benefits for tutors. With current funding concerns, many colleges have reduced their financial support of tutoring or learning assistance programs. The reduction or dismantling of tutoring programs may result in increased attrition, reduction of labs, increased demands on faculty, lower academic performance, increased rates of course repeats, harm to disadvantaged populations, slower student goal completion, reduction of the transfer rate, and ultimate increased costs to the state. The most obvious options for providing the financial support needed to maintain tutoring programs are through differential funding or generation of average daily attendance. (LAL)",

        "description":"A study was conducted at Phillips County Community College to examine part-time students' and adjunct faculty members' perceptions of effective instructional behaviors and strategies. A teaching effectiveness survey was distributed to a random sample of 225 part-time students enrolled in spring 1984 and to 54 adjunct faculty members, asking them to specify which of 48 instructional behaviors/strategies were most effective in helping students learn and to indicate the skill areas in which part-time faculty needed staff development opportunities. Study findings, based on responses from 43% of the students and 76% of the faculty, revealed: (1) there was a high degree of similarity between faculty and student perceptions of effective instructional behaviors/strategies; (2) creating  an atmosphere of acceptance, treating students fairly, and including recent developments in the field were the top three strategies/behaviors for students and were within the top eight for faculty; and (3) students and faculty generally disagreed on the staff development needs of part-time instructors, with students rating providing up-to-date developments in the field, advising students about career opportunities, and encouraging original thinking most highly and faculty members rating course planning; providing printed handouts; and using films, tapes, and slides most highly. The survey instrument and recommendations for staff development planning are included. (HB)",

        "description":"The 39 Illinois public community college districts currently offer 3,467 individual curricula within 258 discrete occupational fields. Within the past 18 months, slightly more curricula have been withdrawn then added, with the office occupations category showing a net gain of 36 curricula and the categories of home economics and protective services each showing a net loss of 17 curricula. Opening fall term enrollment of students declaring an occupational curriculum has remained relatively constant at approximately one-third of the total enrollment for the past several years. The reported number of associate degree graduates increased by nearly 20% from fiscal year (FY) 1982 to FY 1983, while the total number of occupational program completers increased 12%. In 1983, the Generic  Course List was developed and implemented. All courses were reexamined and some were reclassified consistently from college to college. While the number of courses classified as occupational declined somewhat due to the reclassification in conjunction with the development of the Generic Course List, the number of credit hours generated in the three occupational/vocational funding categories has increased an average of 28% from FY 1980 to FY 1983. The unit cost per credit hour also increased during this same period, but at a lesser rate, from a high of 11% in the business/service category to a low of 7% in the health funding category. Data tables are presented throughout this report, which analyzes the current status of and short-term trends in occupational programs in the Illinois public  colleges. (Author/LAL)",

Research in the area of high-risk pregnancy includes: the impacts of medications; psychosocial dynamics of pregnancy; and the effects of diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, malnutrition, infections, and hematological problems. In the area of premature labor and birth, research is concerned with the determinants of normal labor, the causes of premature labor, how to stop  premature labor, and the causes of fetal growth retardation. Research to reduce disorders of the newborn focusses on neonatal infection, interventricular hemorrhage, respiratory distress syndrome, jaundice, and the care of the low birthweight infant. In the areas of mental retardation and behavioral development, research is directed toward prevention of retardation among the offspring of individuals successfully treated for phenylketonuria (PKU) and toward better understanding the effects of cigarette smoking, eating disorders, and accident proneness.

        "description":"The first in a series of five regional fact-gathering committee hearings, this hearing report includes testimony from private and public social agencies in New York, New Jersey, Maine, Massachussetts, and Connecticut. Information and statistics are presented on a wide variety of social problems, including (1) family violence; (2) family planning and teenage pregnancy; (3) infant mortality and health care for children and pregnant women; (4) juvenile delinquency; (5) low income housing; (6) private and public food assistance; (7) drug and alcohol abuse prevention; (8) children's fears about nuclear warfare; and (9) the problems of minority and immigrant groups. Several causes for the increased demand for social services are documented; these include the growth of households headed  by females and the growth of minority and immigrant populations with few skills at a time when the country is being de-industralized and few low skill jobs are being created. Testimony is also presented about programs successful in preventing child abuse and neglect, teenage pregnancy, juvenile delinquency, and failure in low income urban schools. Among the prepared statements presented is the charge that New York City is conducting a &quot;churning campaign&quot; to artificially reduce the welfare role and cut funds for eligible recipients, several reports describing state and local social services and the effects of funding cutbacks, and information on malnutrition.

Participants from Afghanistan, China, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, as well as observers from India, UNICEF, and UNHCR, met to share experiences regarding programs for children from disadvantaged environments and to consider alternative and new forms of preschool education for such children. Chapter One of this document reviews programs, specifically discussing delivery structures; criteria for reviewing national programs; and center, school, and home-based programs. Chapter Two explores general and specific categories of needs and competencies of children from disadvantaged environments, describing children's total development and preparation for school.  The chapter further elaborates the characteristics of disadvantaged families. Chapter Three deals with the problems of reaching children from disadvantaged environments on a mass scale. Criteria for new preschool education models and alternative models of preschool education (namely, child, school, and home-based models) are also discussed. It is recognized that successful implementation of a design requires the establishment of a suitable management system. Appendices provide the text of the inaugural address, the study group meeting agenda, and a list of participants and observers. (AS)",

        "description":"This investigation examines two contrasting evaluations of early childhood education: the Westinghouse-Ohio University study and the Ypsilanti Perry Preschool Project. The Westinghouse study concluded that Head Start experience had very little, if any, academic value for participating children, whereas the Perry Preschool Project concluded that preschool experience was indeed valuable. Since the two studies were very different, it is asserted that comparing them is like comparing apples and oranges. Specifically, the two programs varied in form and content and were very different in their goals. The Perry Preschool study was a carefully controlled experiment with very low teacher/pupil ratios, weekly home visits, expert teachers recruited for their certification in preschool  teaching, and a capable research director. In contrast, the Westinghouse-Ohio University study assessed Head Start programs, which involved thousands of children, fairly large pupil/teacher ratios, no regularly scheduled home visits, and few specially certified preschool teachers. The majority of Head Start programs were not full-year, half-day as were programs studied by the Perry Preschool researchers; rather, they were global summer-only, full-day programs with very little direction from the federal government. In addition, whereas the Perry Preschool study attempted to discover differences between experimental and control groups, the Head Start programs were evaluated in terms of whether or not participants achieved at the middle class academic level. Concluding remarks point out many  unanswered questions about early childhood education programs. (RH)",

        "description":"This report describes the provisions, legislative history, and justification of the School Facilities Child Care Act. This act authorizes $30 million for each of the fiscal years 1985 through 1987 for grants to public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations to establish and operate school-age child care programs in public school facilities and community centers, with priority being given to school facilities. These programs would be operated before and after school and during vacations, would be developed with the involvement of parents, and would have to comply with state and local day care licensing laws and regulations. The federal share for operating costs would be 100 percent in the first year, 50 percent in the second year, and 25 percent in the third year. The  committee believes that this approach will assist parents who cannot afford private care, strengthen the quality of care through public school involvement, and provide services to the largest possible number of children. Among the bill's provisions are a requirement that the Secretary of Health and Human Services establish a national clearinghouse to disseminate information on school-age day care programs. (CB)",

        "author":["DeLoache, Judy S."],
        "description":"Discussing findings from three studies, this report focuses on questions mothers ask their children while looking at picture books and recent family photographs. In the first study, 30 mothers and their 12-, 15-, and 18-month-old children &quot;read&quot; a simple ABC book that had one picture for each letter in the alphabet. In the second study, 15 pairs of 18- to 38-month-old children and their mothers talked about a complex farm scene from a children's book. Findings of both studies indicate that memory demands made by mothers differed as a function of their child's age. Starting when their children were around 15 months of age, mothers began to demand responses involving recall and recognition memory. They also reduced demands if their child gave no response to questioning. Generally,  mothers challenged the child and helped him or her to respond correctly. It was also found that almost every mother of a child 18 months old or younger at least once related something in a picture to some general aspect of the child's past experience. To examine how mothers would question young children about their memory for particular events in contrast to general experience, the third study involved observations of mothers and their 24- to 36-month-old children while they looked at family photograph albums. Findings revealed a very low frequency of specific memory questioning by the mothers. Children frequently were asked to describe, but not to recall. In all three studies, mothers showed a strong bias toward asking their children to report general knowledge rather than to recount  specific events from personal past experience. (Implications of the findings are discussed.) (RH)",

In the first part of the Dutch study, 7,000 parents responded to the questionnnaire, which was printed in a Dutch magazine distributed in the Netherlands and Belgium. Results suggested that more attention should be paid to changes in parental judgment related to developmental changes in their children. Test-retest reliability of ICQ factors was also examined in some parents' responses to the ICQ six months later. When the factor analyses of Bates' original sample of Indiana parents and one  sample of Dutch parents were compared, striking cross-cultural similarities were found. Another analysis found stable factors across age groups. In other Dutch populations, a relationship was found between perceived &quot;difficultness&quot; of infants and maternal scores on neuroticism, but no relationship was found between ICQ scores and children's language development at 3 to 4 years.

It also explored correlations between sociodemographic variables and factor scores that summarized interaction variables. The sample consisted of 128 single adolescent mothers, ages 15 to 20, with a firstborn child from 9 to 27 months of age. Subjects, 93 percent of whom were black, averaged 10.5 years of school. Observations of mother/child interaction occurred in the home during a developmentally appropriate teaching task and a period of free play. Four observers were trained for 12 to 15 hours before the project and received a refresher course two-thirds of the way  through the data collection. Interobserver reliability was measured at the midpoint and at the end of the data collection year according to two methods. Scores on two of the observation scales were standardized to make them comparable and to remove the bias of systematic scale preference. The methods for recording behavior (Barnard's Teaching Scale, Schaefer's Attachment Inventory, and Clarke-Stewart's Rating Scale), required different degrees of inference by observers and examined different-sized units of data. Results of factor analyses of the child and maternal data were reported separately for each of the instruments and then comparatively for all three instruments. Few sociodemographic variables were correlated with instrument factors or items. Conclusions discussed the overlapping  relationships between the scales and the contribution of each to efforts to describe maternal/child interaction. (CB)",

Data were collected through observations of training implementation, knowledge pretests and posttests, an opinionnaire, and a demographic survey of trainee characteristics. Results indicated that each training approach could be presented to cover the same content and procedures in similar amounts of time. Each approach resulted in a significant increase in knowledge, and none of the approaches was more effective than others in achieving knowledge gain. Subjects viewed  traditional sessions more positively than audio or slowscan television sessions and preferred sessions delivered at a single site to multi-site sessions. Trainees who initially knew the least about the content learned the most. Other trainee characteristics were not related to the amount of learning that occurred. It was concluded that telecommunications technologies can effectively be used for training day care personnel. Additional observations are discussed, and recommendations are offered regarding the implementation of telecommunications training.

Interview questions requested justification for subjects' judgments of what story protagonists should and must do. Subjects' responses were classified as instrumental or normative. Additionally, subjects' elaboration of their basic premise by offering subsidiary information was assessed, complexity of arguments was rated, and the number of simple clauses in each response was calculated. Results indicated that tenth graders gave more  arguments and were more likely to include explicit reference to contrasting or alternative arguments than were sixth and first graders. Tenth graders also qualified their inference rules by explicitly stating more contextual constraints on the application of the rules. Sixth graders produced longer reasons than did first graders. Elaboration among sixth graders was similar to that of tenth graders in amount and kind, but, while sixth graders gave more complex reasons than did first graders, their reasons were not as complicated as those of tenth graders. First graders gave essentially single-premise reasons. They were able to use both instrumental and normative logical schemata, but they included virtually no complex argumentation or elaboration of premise. (RH)",

Using computers in early childhood classrooms will make early childhood teaching a more attractive profession and will provide more access to computers for minorities and girls. The computer will be helpful as a \"tutor\" to teach students academic skills, as a \"tool\" for teachers to use in keeping records, and as a \"tutee\" with which students learn to program. While microcomputers should not be accepted uncritically into classrooms, positive aspects of computers for young  children include enhancing self-concept, teaching problem solving, and providing individualized instruction. Negative aspects for young children include a paucity of suitable educational software, the possibility of reducing time parents spend with children, and the increasing gap between the \"haves\" and the \"have nots.\" Early childhood teachers also need to know about the larger context and effects of microcomputers on society. Teachers must have a role in children's learning about computers, or the marketplace will be the greatest influence on the use of computers by children. (CB)",

        "description":"Using four large existing databases on student performance in the elementary grades, this study involves a task-by-task, year-by-year cross-sectional analysis of six topics in computation. Information about what students eventually learn and when they learn it is provided by the data analysis; information about when skills are introduced and expanded is determined by examining school textbooks. This information is seen as being useful in setting higher standards for elementary schools, which currently concentrate on teaching skills piecemeal over several grades. Specifically, topics investigated are addition and subtraction with regrouping, multiplication and division facts with numbers 5 through 9, and multiplication and division beyond basic number facts. Results show that the  topography of student performance varies across topics and across grades within topics. Implications of findings are that efforts focusing on learning opportunities in the middle elementary grades will be more productive than efforts undertaken at the point of entry into secondary schooling. In particular, it is concluded that students learn most when topics are taught as part of regular instruction, that the margin for school improvement may be more promising in certain segments of a subject (i.e., subtraction and division), and that a dramatic loss of performance occurs when the first teaching of a topic occurs late in the school year.

        "description":"A replication of earlier research, this study investigates the relationship between moral reasoning and classroom conduct. According to Kohlberg (1978), children who reason at preconventional levels (Stages 1 and 2) would be likely to disrupt a classroom, while children who reason at the conventional levels (Stages 3 and 4) should cause less classroom disruption. Bear and Richards (1981) found that conduct problems declined monotonically (almost linearly) with advances in moral reasoning for a sample of middle class Iowa fourth graders. These findings were consistent with theoretical expectations. In this replication of Bear and Richard's study, 87 fourth, sixth, and eighth graders from lower class homes in rural western Virginia were assessed according to Kohlberg's interviewing  procedure. Classroom behavior was assessed by teacher reports on the Conduct Scale of the Behavior Problem Checklist. In most respects, results accorded well with the views of Kohlberg and replicate those of Bear and Richards. Level of moral reasoning increased with age, and conduct ratings were strongly influenced by sex and social class. However, the predicted monotonic trend between moral reasoning and conduct emerged only for boys; low-reasoning girls exhibited few behavior problems. (Author/CB)",

        "description":"Two unanswered questions about child care are: (1) Does compliance with state child care regulations have a positive impact on children? and (2) Have predictors of program quality been identified? This paper explores a research study and related model that have had some success in answering these questions. Section I, a general introduction, highlights some major forces within the child care field that appear to be shaping program monitoring and regulatory efforts in the United States. Section II describes Pennsylvania's instrument-based program monitoring information system (the Child Development Program Evaluation System). Section III provides a brief history of the state's experience with the model. Particular attention is given to the reasons why Pennsylvania decided to use  an instrument-based program monitoring system, which employs standardized checklists and questionnaires with weighted items measuring relative risk to children in day care settings. Section IV describes results obtained from using the model and includes a theoretical curve illustrating compliance with state regulations and child care outcomes. Section V briefly describes the Indicator Checklist Statistical Model and shows how to construct an indicator checklist and obtain predictors of program compliance and quality. Section VI poses potential problems with the use of the indicator model and offers some solutions. In conclusion, Section VII provides a future perspective on program monitoring and compliance review. Photocopies of the 14 slides that originally accompanied this conference  paper are appended.

An introduction on the nature and purpose of the guide is followed by three substantive sections, beginning in section II with a discussion on how IPM improves day care monitoring. Specific comments under this heading include descriptions of how IPM is performed, objectives and characteristics of the IPM approach, and positive outcomes of using IPM in Pennsylvania.  Section III examines the effectiveness of Pennsylvania's day care monitoring system, known as the Child Development Program Evaluation (CDPE). Particular comments are directed toward general characteristics of the CDPE system; CDPE system components; types and level of information generated (including provider, regional, and statewide information); and the implementation process. Concluding material in section IV provides guidelines for determining a state's need for an IPM system. Five steps in conducting an adequate assessment are described, and necessary elements of an effective implementation plan are briefly outlined. (RH)",

To determine the reliability of measures, a pilot sample of mothers and children was interviewed again after 1 to 2 months. Both maternal and child reports of network functioning exhibited considerable stability. Data from the study sample of 60 preschoolers and their mothers were analyzed to evaluate the internal consistency of the measures and the relationship between maternal and child reports of functions performed by network members. Scales derived from the interview data showed good internal consistency. Considerable  correspondence also existed between maternal and child reports regarding members of the child's social network. Findings suggested that mothers provide reliable information about the support provided by members of their children's social networks. (Author/RH)",

The community served is one characterized by exceptionally high unemployment, a 10 percent rate of heroin addiction among local 15- to 19-year-olds, a disproportionately high rate of children in care, and poverty and associated powerlessness. Specifically, the project offers six residential places on a short to medium term basis for local children 8 to 12 years of age who live not more than a 20-minute walk from the project premises. In addition, the project works with residents' families, offers a &quot;drop-in&quot; facility for peers and siblings of residents, provides day care to  selected local children on a short term basis, and conducts counseling and community work.

        "description":"Developmental changes leading to mature judgments of the relative effectiveness of verbal memory strategies were examined in 60 subjects (20 each from second-, fourth-, and sixth-grade classrooms). Subjects viewed videotapes of a female child who was given the task of remembering a set of categorizable pictures. Demonstrations of four memory strategies (grouping, repeating, naming, and looking) were made. Following these demonstrations, 24 pairs of strategies were presented for paired comparison judgments. Subsequently, subjects were administered memory tasks involving picture stimuli from four taxonomic categories. Subjects were told to remember the pictures in the way that would help them remember best. Half the children in each grade first made strategy judgments and then  performed the memory tasks; the order was reversed for the remaining half. Results indicated that second graders showed no significant preference for grouping over rehearsal. Fourth graders chose grouping over rehearsal as being most effective. Sixth graders demonstrated a clear preference for the grouping strategy. This increasing strategic awareness was also reflected in developmental increases in individual strategic awareness scores. Thus, although some awareness of the benefits of a categorization strategy may be evident as early as first grade, understanding of the relative benefits of categorization over rehearsal appears to develop during elementary school.

        "description":"Children diagnosed with environmentally based failure to thrive early during their first year of life were seen at 12 and 18 months for assessment of psychological development (cognition, language, symbolic play, and behavior during testing). Based on a transactional model of outcome, factors reflecting biological vulnerability (wasting and stunting) and family ecology (income level, family size, and ratio of adults to children) were correlated with outcome measures. Predictions that outcome would reflect biological vulnerability and family ecology were upheld for Bayley Mental Development Index and Symbolic Play scores at 18 months but not at different ages or for other measures. Children who were less malnourished at study intake and who were from families with higher incomes  had higher levels of cognitive development. Children who were less malnourished and from families with higher incomes and a higher ratio of adults to children had higher Symbolic Play scores. Findings underscored the utility of a transactional model in predicting psychological outcome for childhood disorders such as failure to thrive. It was suggested that models of research and clinical intervention in failure to thrive should consider the conjoint influences of the child's nutritional status and family ecology, especially the impact of resources and their allocation on psychological outcome.

Representatives presented the views of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which preferred a 1-year reauthorization of the programs. Other prepared and live testimony concerned the following: the requirement that 3 percent of all applicants to the School Lunch Program have their income verified; means testing for parents whose children in  family day care receive aid through the Child Care Food Program; and the effects of terminating USDA sponsorship of the programs. Budgeting concerns included restoration of funds for NET and food preparation equipment and increasing funds to reduce students' cost for the reduced-price school lunch and to reach increasing numbers of poor children eligible for WIC. Discussion with committee members concerned the possibility of a compromise 4-year reauthorization of the programs, the effects of a block grant for child nutrition, and the possibility of combining nutrition programs for children and the elderly.

        "description":"This study investigated the relationship between peer relations and help-seeking behavior. Seventy-four subjects, predominately black boys and girls, were drawn from the third and fifth grades. A roster-rating sociometric scale was used to obtain measures of children's perceived academic competence, desirability as a helper, and friendship status in their reading and math classes. Intensive naturalistic observation of a subset of these children in their classrooms provided data on actual help-seeking behavior. The relationship between peer relations and academic help-seeking was found to vary with the target of the help-seeking overture and with the type of help requested. The helper's perceived academic competence and friendship status were important determinants of help  seekers' liking of their helpers, but the impact of these factors differed for boys and girls. In reading classes, significant negative correlations were found between instrumental help-seeking and competence ratings received from both same- and opposite-sex classmates. In math classes, however, frequency of instrumental help-seeking was not related to any of the peer sociometric ratings. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Four research-based principles offer guidance to educators aiming to facilitate young children's acquisition of communicative competence. These principles concern the effect of interaction on the development of competence; the necessity for content in interaction; the requirement that content be ecologically valid to participants; and the impact of reciprocity in interaction on interpersonal as well as communicative competence. Educational practices likely to help children develop competence involve the availability of opportunities for interaction; involvement of children in long-term projects; participation of children in mixed-age and mixed-competence groups; using the technique of &quot;reflection&quot; to let children know that their feelings are accepted and to encourage children to  make their understandings and misunderstandings explicit; the teacher's role in modeling language use; opportunities for children to talk with other children about many subjects; and talking to children in a serious, authentic, non-artificial way. Practices likely to inhibit the development of competence include teacher-directed large-group instruction; premature formal whole-group instruction; bias in student/teacher interaction; overuse of interrogation as a teaching technique; allowing judgments of children's competence to influence response time allocated to children; focusing on language as an object of primary concern; and bribing reluctant children to speak. Improving educational practice is likely to require giving attention to: (1) teachers' comprehension of communicative  competence; (2) detrimental customs and traditions in educational practice; and (3) institutional constraints on instruction.

Testimony centers on (1) the rationale for the act; (2) characteristics of hazardous and safe toys and articles; (3) injuries to children resulting from hazardous toys and articles; (4) manufacturers' attempts to make toys safe; (5) problems of recalling unsafe toys; (6) potential problems created by the act and its recommended changes; (7) age labeling on toys; (8) Wisconsin state provisions for protecting children from unsafe products; (9) procedures for implementing the act; (10) broader issues of product safety; and (11) positive results and improvement of the product recall process.

The project's goal was to foster collaboration leading to more effective linkages between publicly funded child care and development programs and other service providers. The model for promoting collaboration involved a state level Core CARE Committee and eight county-level CARE Committees. The Core CARE Committee promoted coordination among statewide agencies, while the local CARE Committees focused on developing linkages among local agencies and individuals. These local committees met monthly for 9 months. The impact of the CARE  project was measured by administering a pretest and posttest telephone survey to over 100 preschool program directors and by documenting the actual events that occurred in counties as a result of project activities. Results indicated that the interagency committee is an effective model for bringing about collaboration. Survey responses did not show substantial differences between the eight intervention counties and eight comparison counties in attitudes toward coordination. However, documentation of local CARE Committee activities indicated that the committees went through a process that resulted in a high degree of collaboration to address local preschool needs.

The goal of the CARE project was to foster collaboration leading to more effective linkages between publicly funded child care and development programs and other service providers. The survey was designed to evaluate project impact and to provide information about preschool programs. Following two training sessions and 6 months prior to intervention, local CARE district coordinators conducted telephone interviews with 120 preschool program directors in eight control and eight treatment counties. The following information was solicited: (1) program characteristics; (2) the program's current and needed  services; (3) current networking and collaboration; (4) knowledge of other preschool services; (5) director's attitudes toward collaboration; (6) director's perceptions of the consequences of collaboration; (7) possible barriers to collaboration; and (8) director's professional experience. The results of the pretest indicated that preschool program directors in both the intervention and the comparison counties had very positive attitudes toward collaboration. In the posttest survey (a year later) the whole group of directors showed a slight, but statistically significant increase in their positive attitudes toward collaboration. Perhaps as a result of problems with the survey questionnaire, results did not suggest that the intervention itself had any positive impact on directors'  perceptions.

Data were collected through observations in kindergarten and first-grade classrooms and through interviews with principals, teachers, and parents. The 15 research sites were ranked by research team members as to the degree of articulation present. Results indicated that, in schools with a high degree of articulation, teachers and principals emphasized the development of children who were self-reliant and self-motivated to learn. First-grade teachers also used more &quot;ECS-like&quot;  methods. In schools with low articulation, the emphasis tended to be on socialization, fitting in with the group, and learning school-appropriate behavior. These same interviews were used to gather data for the second study, &quot;Parental Involvement in Early Childhood Services Programming.&quot; Overall, parents reported a high level of involvement and many benefits from involvement, with less involvement in the primary grades than in ECS. The studies concluded with specific recommendations for the Alberta Department of Education for Improving articulation and parental involvement at the early childhood and primary school levels.

        "description":"To investigate the current status of group time in early childhood centers, a small-scale exploratory study was designed and executed. Results of interviews with 35 teachers and observations in five classrooms serving children ages 2 1/2 through kindergarten revealed that all classrooms had at least one group time or circle time, usually in the morning. Of 14 broad categories of resources noted by teachers, books and stories, and music and songs were most frequently mentioned; poetry, nursery rhymes, and relaxation activities were least frequently mentioned. Teachers' written plans and observations revealed the actual use of a much narrower range of activities. Immediate concerns, such as \"themes\" and children's interests and needs, were primary determinants of what teachers did.  Detailed written plans were seldom made. Teachers reported that their major problems involved disturbances of group time by students and balancing the needs of the individual child with those of the group. Teachers ascribed such problems to factors beyond their control; these included children's developmental level, home backgound, and group size. Observation revealed much inattention during group time, with teachers using relatively few techniques for monitoring, maintaining, and guiding children's attention and behavior. Implications for teacher educators, administrators, and teachers are discussed. Teachers are urged to take an active classroom leadership role by: (1) planning more systematically; (2) using group time to introduce new ideas and skills and develop positive attitudes and  behavior; (3) expand their repertoire of materials and activities; (4) enlarge their techniques of monitoring and guiding behavior; and (5) coaching other adults in the classroom how to behave during group time. Measures used are appended. (Author/RH)",

Communication and interaction attempts, or bids, that 25 male and 25 female toddlers from low income families in day care made toward their teachers were analyzed. Instrumental bids requesting help were significantly more frequent for males. Expressive bids were equally present for boys and girls, but these bids were found to differ in type. Specifically, girls made more positive affectional approaches, while boys made significantly more distress/negative bids. Females were ignored by caregivers more often than males. It was suggested that caregivers may need to help male toddlers find more appropriate ways to meet their needs for nurturance  from adults. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"A study was undertaken to investigate the effects of directed response training to focus attention and to assess the impact of pictorial integrated stimuli on incidental learning. A total of 140 second- and fifth-grade children were administered a two-choice discrimination learning task consisting of three parts: original learning, overtraining, and a nonreversal shift task. The original learning task was the same for all participants. During overtraining trials, children either made a response that the experimenter said to make (response training) or responded without help. A second task was administered in which, for some children, &quot;real-life&quot; pictorial integrated stimuli replaced geometric forms. Other children saw the same stimuli as in original learning. Results indicated  that response-trained second graders learned the shift task more rapidly than did untrained second graders. The poorest shift task performance was made by response-trained fifth graders. In addition, learning was more rapid when pictorial stimuli were used on the shift task. These findings supported the conclusion that younger children selectively attend when an attentional strategy is available and generalize that attention to pictorial integrated or more realistic stimuli. Poor learning by response-trained fifth graders raised questions as to the appropriateness of the response training strategy for older children's learning. (Author/RH)",

A discriminant analysis followed by  univariate F tests indicated monolinguals were superior to bilinguals in knowledge of body parts, whereas bilinguals were superior to monolinguals in the ability to follow complex directions and in perceptual-motor coordination.

Although Mexico benefits because many Mexicans send money home, the resultant brain drain comes at a time when Mexico's economy must accommodate an estimated 450,000 refugees from Central America. Although Mexico has had political stability and the peso has been stable with a gradual decline during most of this century, the oil fiasco, and lack of favored nation treatment by the United States has brought Mexico to the brink of disaster. If it were not for the special interests of  the United States, and several European governments and their banks, Mexico might have collapsed. Utilizing an historical-descriptive, theoretical research methodology, the paper examines immmigration-emigration patterns as cultural, economic, and political determinants that affect-effect the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the Mexicans mass media system. The Soviet Union is juxtaposed against the United States and Latin America to determine the extent of its involvement in this hemisphere. (NQA)",

The participants (aged 16-31, 75% male) had taken 1 of 10 standard residential Outward Bound courses offered between November 1982 and May 1983. Self-description questionnaires were completed 1 month before the start of the program, on the first day of the program, and on the last day of the program. Findings showed that participation in the program produced increases in the multiple dimensions of self-concept over the 26-day interval, demonstrating the program's  effectiveness. Counter explanations for the findings were examined with a variety of different approaches and did not appear to be viable. The psychometric properties of responses to the self description questionnaire (reliability, dimensionality, and stability), coupled with the systematic relationship between the size of shifts in the questionnaire scales and the scales' a priori relevance to program goals, supported the validity of interpretations based upon the questionnaire and its use as a criterion measure in intervention studies.

Forty-two recommendations resulted; the groups and the first recommendation made by each, are as follows: the content group urged local school districts to use &quot;Nation at Risk&quot; as an impetus for examining their own programs based on Alaska's needs; the  standards and expectations group advised educators to use the classroom, community, and home to raise student academic performance; the time group perceived the need to improve time management in the current school day, rather than lengthening the school day or year; the teaching group recognized the importance of liberal arts training for prospective teachers and urged teacher training centers to develop programs to accommodate need; and the leadership and fiscal support group advocated establishment of early childhood education programs, with set standards and certification requirements, and with state funding. All recommendations, as well as the presentations, a list of participants, and the editor's concluding statement are included. (BRR)",

        "description":"Land grant institutions and state universities have a long history of involvement in Clergy Continuing Education and continue to encourage such programs because: (1) clergy are important community leaders, (2) they could become an important support group, and (3) they have information needs related to their activity in such public policy matters as agriculture and community and rural life. A 1982 study similar to studies done in 1970 and 1975 found that 17 states had Clergy Continuing Education programs in 1982, 3 states had programs in 1970 but not in 1982, 11 states had programs in 1975 but not in 1982, and 4 states had programs in 1982 but not in 1975. In addition, 21 other states felt they had from slight to strong possibilities that they would initiate or renew such programs  by 1988. The National Extension Committee on Clergy Continuing Education is attempting to expand linkages between denominations, land grant institutions, and state universities, and to develop more training material and procedures that could be used by clergy from urban backgrounds who find themselves experiencing &quot;culture shock&quot; in rural settings. Areas in which clergy and university staff could work together include committee membership, co-sponsoring programs, and sharing meeting space and expertise. (BRR)",

This study demonstrated the use of IAI information to illuminate further the instructional accomplishments of schools priority program to which a district is committed. One of the procedural principles suggested by Milazzo, Buchanan, and Schutz (1981) for analyzing IAI district level databases in Racially Isolated Minority (RIM) school or other special priority program context was to identify those students who register instructional accomplishments at or above the average for non-RIM (or non-program) students. The procedure was applied to 89 Hispanic RIM schools in the Los  Angles Unified School District relative to the accomplishment information yielded by the District's 1980 Survey of Essential Skills. Demonstrating that the procedure was practical, the findings showed that: a 5% random sample of student records was adequate to preliminarily identify such schools; the procedure revealed substantial positive accomplishments in Hispanic RIM schools; the accomplishments did cluster in some RIM schools more than others; and schools and schooling practices did make a difference in attaining instructional accomplishments.

These efforts have resulted in productive new forms of partnership and cooperation at all levels. While federal programs have sometimes supported these efforts, and while recent changes in federal policy have improved the climate for high technology development initiatives, in most cases both the initiative and the ongoing leadership have come from imaginative state and local leaders. This five-chapter report provides: (1) an overview of high-technology development (HTD); (2) a definition and analysis of high-technology industries; (3) a discussion of  entrepreneurship and venture capital in HTD; (4) a discussion of state and local government, university, and private sector initiatives for HTD; and (5) an examination of the federal role in regional HTD. Three reports are appended: they concern (1) the theoretical base for high-technology location and regional development, (2) a regional assessment of the formation and growth in high-technology firms, and (3) a preliminary investigation of recent evidence on high-technology industries' spatial tendencies. One factor examined in the latter report is the nature and diversity among high-technology industries in both growth performance and locational tendencies. (JN)",

Many of the experiments are completely passive and depend on postflight laboratory investigations for the experimental results. The LDEF is essentially a free-flying cylindrical structure which can accommodate 86 experimental trays mounted on its exterior; like the space shuttle, the LDEF is reusable. This book provides descriptions of 57 experiments from the United States and eight other  countries scheduled for the first LDEF mission on STS-13 (Space Transportation System).

Test-writing responsibilities were delegated to mathematics and mathematics education faculties at four state universities, with the mathematical content based on course objectives in the state guidelines. Fourteen sites across Indiana served as test centers, with 2394 students participating. Outstanding Scholar awards were presented to 136 students. Analysis of the performance of a random stratified sample of 129 students on selected items from each test is then presented. Item difficulties were examined to determine areas of weakness. For Algebra (First Course), fundamental operations on rational expressions and roots for quadratic equations  were of particular concern. Three areas of concern were evident on the Algebra (Second Course) results: exponential and logarithmic functions, permutations and combinations, and ability to analyze conditions related to solutions to elementary algebraic equations and functions. In Geometry, ability to apply information in novel situations seemed to create difficulty, rather than specific content. On the Comprehensive Test, concern was with a range of content. Overall, a lack of problem-solving ability was noted. Appendices contain the four tests. (MNS)",

The MARS was administered to 197 college students, and the responses were factor analyzed. Twenty-one factors were found; the first two components accounted for approximately 33% and 7% of the variance in MARS scores. The first item was labelled Math Test/Course Anxiety, while the second item concerned Numerical Task Anxiety. More anxiety was  stimulated by mathematics test items than by numerical task items. Analysis of variance procedures indicated that students who had taken Algebra II in high school experienced significantly less math anxiety than students who had not taken Algebra II, and those with A's and B's in Algebra or Geometry experienced significantly less math anxiety than did students with poorer grades. It is suggested that student performance in high school mathematics courses be monitored, and early intervention provided. (MNS)",

In the second portion, solution strategies are discussed. Twenty-two states have initiated financial-incentive programs, while 27 states have used training or retraining programs. Federal, state, and local efforts are then described, followed by a description of college-based retraining programs in Ohio. Finally, recommendations are made. Several success factors were identified across all efforts: effective programs were based on identified needs; were designed to continue as long as the need existed; had capable coordinators, trainers, and trainees; were characterized by close cooperation among the participating agencies; fostered mutual support by  keeping trainers together throughout the program; involved practice teaching with gradual progression from easy to more advanced subject matter; and subsidized tuition cost with federal funding sources.

This monograph presents an account of how number concepts are extended and elaborated as a result of formal instruction. A theory of number representation is outlined for three broad periods of development: (1) the preschool period, during which counting and quantity comparison competencies of young children provide the main basis for inferring number representation; (2) the early primary period, during which children's invention of sophisticated mental computational procedures and the mastery of certain forms of story problems  point to two important expansions of the number concept; and (3) the later primary period, during which the representation of number is modified to reflect knowledge of the decimal structure of the counting and notational systems.

Quotes from participant-observers who have studied various social phenomena indicate that they experienced transition and conflict between their observer and participant roles. At times they were strangers (observers) to those they were researching and at other times friends (participants). Personal effects and subsequent self-concept alternations occurred. For example, one researcher did field work involving mentally disabled individuals. He became so involved that his family ended up providing a home for one of the disabled girls. The author experienced a change in self-concept as a result of his research, which showed that  counter-culture groups use the same approaches as the dominant culture to solve conflicts. Prior to his study he had very strongly associated himself with the counter-culture, but his personal orientation shifted away from this identification during the study. The conclusion is that personal effects of research should be acknowledged and discussed. (RM)",

Because business, science, and technological interests dominated both the  process and product of the Commission, both social scientists and humanists must question the validity and breadth of the resulting report.

The Lister system, which has many of the requirements important for an ethnographic database, e.g., flexibility in formatting data and ability to store both qualitative and quantitative data, is described. The field work was paperless. Interviews were recorded on audio-cassettes and then abstracted and typed into the field  computer. Field notes and translations of the shaman interviews were entered and edited on the field computer. The information was then transferred by phone line from the microcomputer disks to the large computer. An index of the abstracts was made by the large computer.

Results showed that the civil war in Lebanon has sensitized the Armenian community to its differentiation from other groups, rigidified its ethnic boundaries, and increased in-group allegiance.

Creativity in the selection of research questions would require that behavioral scientists ask questions whose answers could make a difference to societal and world well-being. Behavioral scientists must explore through lateral thinking various kinds of research methodologies and choose those that best match the topic(s) under research. The most creative step that a behavioral scientist might undertake would be not to collect yet another piece of data, but to synthesize more of the knowledge that already exists. It is the creative investigator who can discover pattern, who can draw into greater unity that which had been widespread.  What is needed is a course in creativity training for Ph.D. candidates in the behavioral sciences. In such a course, neophyte researchers would learn to establish greater contact with their right hemisphere capacities in order to acquire lateral as well as vertical thinking skills. A combination of lateral and vertical thinking styles can create complementary perspectives and in the process a new dimension can be conceived. (RM)",

When teaching thinking skills using the SIMILE model, curriculum instruction has as its major purpose the integration of experience across the iconic (picture form) and symbolic (verbal form) modalities. The best motivational set for learning thinking skills is allocentric. Under conditions of allocentricity the student is free from drives to satisfy deficiencies and accordingly is open to reflective consideration of perceptual experience. Fiction or simulations can be used to activate allocentric perception  by creating a \"safe\" environment in which the participant can leave the pressure of the outside world behind. Two sets of protocol materials are included, one for elementary students and one for secondary students. Students read a selection and answer questions that help them analyze the concept of power from American and Japanese perspectives. (RM)",

        "description":"Views concerning the influence of the 1954 Supreme Court decision in &quot;Brown versus the Board of Education&quot; which ended school segregation are discussed. Historian Raymond Wolters believes that while segregation was wrong and the Supreme Court's unanimous decision reversing the &quot;separate but equal&quot; interpretation was right, the Court erred in calling for more state action to correct state error. For example, the Supreme Court in &quot;Green versus New Kent County&quot; (1968) required statistical evidence of integration. Because urban whites found this social engineering and judicial reconstruction distasteful and retreated to suburbs and private schools, public education and blacks suffered. According to Wolters, reform belongs to elected representatives, not to unelected judges. On the  positive side, however, the Brown decision did force the South to desegregate and gave impetus to the far-reaching civil rights movement. However, since about 1974, during which time economic retrenchment and conservative renewal have prevailed, these positive elements have lost support. Today, 30 years after Brown, we see federal disinvestment in public schooling, retreat from equality, and return to pre-Brown &quot;separate but equal&quot; programs and facilities. (RM)",

A total of 1,130 students in grades 5-8 from 13 Catholic schools, 613 mothers, and 352 fathers completed survey questionnaires. The data collected were compared with data from similar surveys of students conducted by 12 non-Catholic organizations (largely a public school sample). Because data are to be used by the National Catholic Education Association to develop new programs, specific survey results and discussion starters and suggestions for action are presented parallel to one another. Results indicate that in comparision with other youth, Catholic students do more  homework, experience more anxiety about school, attend church more often, are more concerned with social problems, and are more likely to consider abortion as morally wrong. Catholic youth report less prosocial behavior and more agressive and norm-breaking behavior, are more interested in sexuality, and are more likely than other youth to drink and smoke. Catholic parents expressed a great deal of worry and concern over their children. (RM)",

Chapter III, the bulk of the document, contains the actual evaluation forms. A three-step process (awareness, assessment, and analysis) for completing the instrument is designed to assure readiness of the school community, provide for the actual assessment of the school, and provide for analysis to guarantee movement toward a long-range improvement plan. Five areas emphasized in this  instrument include: philosophy, the Catholic school as community, the Catholic school in the community, the teaching/learning program, and organizational services. Summary forms conclude chapter III. In chapter IV, guidelines for the coordinator/consultant are briefly presented, followed by guidelines for the visiting team in chapter V. These guidelines focus on preliminary duties of a visiting chairperson, the instruction and orientation of a visiting team, the written report, and follow-up duties. The final chapter, chapter VI, focuses on designing and implementing an improvement plan; it is followed by sample forms, a guide for ordering, and a glossary of terms. (LH)",

In the second article, &quot;Religious and Cultural Variety: Gift to Catholic Schools,&quot; Sister Thea Bowman stresses that the presence of non-Catholics in Catholic schools can help children learn about and appreciate other religions and, thus, better prepare them for life in a pluralistic, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural world.

Sections 1-5 focus on Catholic secondary schools, including their character (section 1), curriculum and academic organization (section 2), the character of instruction (section 3), and faculty roles and concerns (section 4). Based on an analysis of data from a national survey on American secondary  schools, &quot;High School and Beyond,&quot; section 5 discusses: major differences among Catholic schools as well as how these schools compare as a group to public schools; institutional factors associated with quality secondary schools; the effects of Catholic secondary schools on student achievement, post-secondary educational plans, and affective and social development; and findings from research on the effects of Catholic school education. Although the study focuses on secondary schools, some attention is given to elementary schools in section 6. Sections 7 and 8 deal with finance and governance issues facing Catholic schools.

In both mediation and arbitration a presumably neutral third party is involved, along with disputants, as an element of the dispute-resolution process. Mediation and arbitration differ primarily in terms of the role that is assigned to this third party. In mediation, disputants are actively charged with presenting information to each other and to the third party, while the third party is only allowed to propose or recommend a settlement. Under mediation, disputants have both high process control and high decision control. In arbitration, the disputants are in charge of the information to be presented, but  the third-party decision maker has the authority to impose a decision after listening to the evidence. In arbitration, disputants have high process control but low decision control. The studies show that both voice (process control) and veto power (outcome control) are significant elements influencing people's feelings about the procedures they encounter. Current evidence is not sufficient to resolve the controversy. (RM)",

The biases are (1) egocentricity, the tendency to perceive events primarily in terms of their relation to oneself; (2) \"beneffectance,\" the tendency to perceive oneself selectively as responsible for desired, but not undesired, events; and (3) cognitive conservatism, the tendency to adhere to one's initial judgments even in the face of disconfirming evidence. In contrast with the effectiveness claims that can be made for the totalitarian ego, totalitarian societies usually operate ineffectively. One major reason is that totalitarian societies suppress totalitarian egos, thus reducing people's effectiveness.  Additional aspects of the relationship between personal and political systems are (1) the functioning of totalitarian-ego characteristics in the personalities of political leaders; (2) the paradox that effective political leaders may be the ones who have only an illusion of control; and (3) the possibility that our society might evolve toward a form characterized by collective unity of thought, rather than individuality.

Intended for use in undergraduate psychology courses, four demonstrations that illustrate common examples of human variation are described. The demonstrations deal with the following individual differences: taste blindness, relative length of fingers, sex differences in odor detection, and red-green color blindness. Demonstrations are easy to implement. For example, in the activity concerning taste blindness, a phenylthiocarbamide (PTC)-impregnated strip, easily obtained from biology supply labs, is used to test students for taste blindness. Students learn that PTC has a bitter, unpleasant taste for 70 percent of U.S. adults; for the remaining 30 percent PTC is  completely tasteless. This phenomenon is a taste dimorphism which is due to variation in a single pair of genes. (RM)",

Chapter one provides an overview of trends pertaining to the future elderly population, emphasizing some of the issues Congress may need to address in the near future. Sources of support for the elderly are also examined. Employment and retirement issues are the foci of the second chapter. The key policy issue discussed is how to provide cost-effective incentives to an increasing proportion of healthy elderly who can work in a productive economy free of age discrimination and without penalizing those who must retire early. Chapter three discusses the allocation of health care resources. It points out that Congress will have to struggle to balance issues such as government regulation,  quality, freedom of choice, effectiveness, efficiency, and equity across society as it makes policy in this area. The concluding chapter deals with long-term care, defined as helping people live their lives rather than as extended medical care.

Three challenges outlined in the first of five sections include: (1) informing citizens about complex social issues and decisions, (2) connecting diverse fields of knowledge in school curricula, and (3) resisting antagonists of science and technology. In order to determine the extent to which these challenges are currently being met, the  second section examines: goal statements in curriculum reports and major reports in the social studies and the sciences; research findings on student knowledge and attitudes regarding science, technology, and society; and analyses of current curricula and textbooks. The third section describes ways in which &quot;integrative threads&quot; can be used to provide common learning experiences within and between distinct courses in the social studies and sciences. The fourth section presents promising practices that can contribute to this building of connections between social studies and science curricula; the use of &quot;decision trees&quot; and case studies, the use of role play and simulation, and the use of instructional television and microcomputers. Concluding observations in the final section and a  bibliography listing over 170 publications conclude the document. (LH)",

        "description":"A long-term study of new professors in 14 graduate schools of education sought to identify the academic choices professors make early in their careers. A survey examined professors' hours spent in job-related work each week, tasks they committed their time to, tasks they felt they should commit more time to, and insights they reported about their experience of being professors. An analysis of their responses indicated that new professors spend only a portion of their time on research, scholarship, and the potentially supportive work of personal professional development, and that they would choose to spend considerably more time at those activities. The data suggest that those who are already working more hours per week than the average are not committing more time to research and  scholarship. Despite their desire to apply themselves to scholarly pursuits and research, new professors find that they canot control the time they spend at work and that their choices are limited by administrative expectations and assignments. The conclusions suggest that exercising choice in an academic career is an important dimension of that work, but choices are not unlimited. (JD)",

A critical review is presented of what has been achieved in this area, especially in Finland, both within legislation and by recent researchers. According to the authors, the lists of educational aims produced by policy-makers as well as those constructed by researchers evidently do not render any purposive whole. The role of stated aims, especially the behavioral ones, has been exaggerated and selection of teaching methods have not been considered by either policy-makers or investigators. The fact that stated aims have no significant impact on the teacher's planning activity has, when operating with lists of stated aims, been given almost no consideration. The  differences in the teachers' general basic views and pedagogical outlooks have been given minor consideration. A prerequisite for arranging more purposive instruction is that the teacher is able and has the right to modify the stated aims, and also to set individual aims on the basis of personal beliefs and convictions. Corresponding arrangements regarding both teacher education and school administration are needed. (Author/JD)",

There is also a trend toward increasing the grade point average required for admission. Policies on admission to teacher education programs reflect concern about the decline in both the number and quality of the talent pool and the decline in public confidence in teachers and teaching. An analysis is presented of the impact of more stringent admissions criteria on schools of education. The question is raised of conditions or resources needed to implement such admission policies, and a brief discussion is presented on both the advantages and disadvantages of the policies. Also considered are the views of educational practitioners and the  effects on teacher education programs and faculties. The effects of higher admission standards on teacher education students and public perceptions about teaching are discussed. A keyed map provides information on states implementing and planning new policies for admission to teacher education. An article on state assessment trends is appended, as well as brief annotations on the activities of 23 states relative to standards for admission to teacher education programs. (JD)",

A method for identifying such risks has been derived from analysis of district-level Instructional Accomplishment Information (IAI) data bases. The method involves examination of patterns of instructional accomplishments in the first through sixth grades as they relate to the scope, sequence, and emphasis of grade-by-grade instruction. The operational elements of the method are: (1) learning opportunities--skill areas on which instructional time is actually invested in a given subject matter at a given grade level; (2) instructional accomplishments--the mean  percentage of student performance arrayed by skill areas and school grades; and (3) learning opportunity risks--patterns of instructional accomplishments within and across grade levels that appear to depress subsequent instructional performance. The method is illustrated for the subjects of elementary school mathematics and reading in two rural southern school districts. (JD)",

        "description":"There is a risk that some students will progressively slip further behind the pace of instruction across grade levels, particularly in the second through fourth grades. A combination of factors are related to instructional risk: (1) structure of skill development across more than one grade level; (2) organization of textbook lessons that provide instruction and practice within a particular grade level; and (3) the way teachers move students through a year's worth of lessons--especially how they make adjustments in what to cover for students who may not complete all topics within the textbook by the end of the school year. The first step in reducing instructional risk is identifying pivotal skills which have strong instructional linkages across grade levels. Risks to further  learning are increased when there is little practice on skill units which are strongly linked to next year's instruction, when practice is located near the end of textbooks, or when practice is badly fragmented. Once pivotal skills are identified, students must be instructed in these skills at the appropriate time, and intensive practice on these skills should be provided. Sample specifications are presented for risk reduction resources, and types of exercises that may be used in sequence by the classroom teacher are provided. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper presents a proposal for improving the relationship between the communities of research on teaching and teacher education. An examination is made on ways existing research on teaching might be used in curriculum planning for teacher education. Three changes are called for: (1) that researchers and teacher educators understand each other's work more profoundly; (2) that the curriculum planning process in teacher education be clearly delineated; and (3) that the concept of the newly graduated teacher be changed from that of &quot;inexperienced expert&quot; to &quot;well-started novice.&quot; This concept, it is pointed out, would characterize beginning teachers as individuals who lack professional experience, but who are actively learning and continuing to develop toward expert status. It is  argued that research on teaching could be made more useful in teacher education settings by conceptualizing the research outcomes as consisting not only of findings and implications, but also of concepts, theoretical models, questions, methods of inquiry, and case studies. It is predicted that appropriate use of research on teaching in the service of teacher preparation will not make teacher education easier, but will make it more appropriately complex. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"A study of the stability of teacher behavior over time was formulated through two major questions: (1) Is the behavior of an individual teacher consistent over time? and (2) Are individual differences among teachers consistent over time? Regrettably, the first question has rarely been considered in previous investigations of the stability of teacher behavior, and empirical research on the second question has been marked by considerable confusion. In this paper, statistical procedures have been developed for answering each of these questions. Approaches and methods of previous studies of temporal stability are re-evaluated. In addition, methods for assessing the stability of teacher behavior across contexts are described. Observational data on classroom teachers are used  throughout to illustrate new approaches and methods for the study of stability of behavior. (Author/JD)",

The two critical indicators hypothesized by the model, Level of Use of the Innovation, and Stages of Concern About the Innovation, are discussed. The seven stages of concern (awareness, informational, personal, management, consequence, collaboration, and refocusing) are described. Excerpts from the Levels of Use chart provide a guide to the process of adapting an innovation: nonuse, orientation, preparation, mechanical use, routine, refinement, integration, and renewal. The relationship between the two indicators is examined using a case study approach to investigate the ways in which the concerns  of individuals related to their use or nonuse of educational innovations. Two specific research studies are described: a study of the adoption of team teaching at the public school level, and a study of the use of instructional modules in two universities. (JD)",

        "description":"Researchers are becoming increasingly aware of context variables in interpreting research findings. The Procedures for Adopting Educational Innovations (PAEI) Project at the Texas Research and Development Center for Teacher Education has been attempting to identify and conceptualize important research-based and clinical-based context variables. An implication of this research is that researchers must ask a series of specific questions about the state of an innovation (treatment), rather than implicitly assuming what the influence of contextual variables are on the independent and dependent variables in their research designs. The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM), specifically the &quot;Levels of Use&quot; concept, aids in determining how an innovation is actually being used and how the  innovation itself changes during implementation. The mutations of the innovation have been labeled &quot;configurations.&quot; The implication for teacher effects researchers is that both Levels of Use and configurations may vary for any given teacher, and both can be assessed as one way of describing the context.

        "author":["Martin, Jeanne"],
        "description":"Expectation research has frequently assumed that teachers respond differently to students, based upon their perceptions of student ability. Because general student behavior is correlated with ability, however, it is possible that teachers are responding to differences in behavior rather than ability. A study examined the relationship between teacher behavior to teacher perceptions of student ability, and the relationship of teacher behavior to teacher perceptions of student behavior. Data were obtained on teacher-student interactions in 105 seventh- and eighth-grade mathematics and English classes. Results indicated that both perceptions of ability and general student behavior affected teacher behavior. This suggests that both student characteristics should be considered when  attempting to understand differences in teacher behavior. The study also demonstrates the importance of considering the context in which teacher-student interactions occur, since results in this study for English instruction were not the same as the results for mathematics classes.

        "description":"A variety of methods can be used for instructing classes having highly heterogeneous students, including individualization of instruction, homogeneous grouping, team teaching, and modifying whole-class instruction. Through classroom observations and teacher interviews, the prevalence of such methods in 32 second- and third-grade classrooms were studied, and the relationships between these methods and student achievement were examined. A greater variety of approaches to heterogeneity was observed in reading instruction than in mathematics instruction. Very few relationships were found between use of the various approaches and achievement gains in mathematics. In reading, however, greater achievement gains were associated with the extent of team teaching arrangements, use of  individualized instruction, and several other variables. (Author/JD)",

Beginning-of-the-year observation data from classes of more and less effective managers were compared to gain information about beginning-of-the-year behaviors and management success throughout the school year. Results identified  a number of significant predictors of management success, especially in the areas of establishing classroom procedures, use of consequences, consistency, clarity of communication, and prompt handling of inappropriate behavior.

Comparative case studies of two junior high school teachers are presented, and data are analyzed to provide information on teachers' cognitive processes and beliefs. Two new procedures for analyzing stimulated recall data are introduced. Starting with the stimulated recall data, each data set is examined in turn,  and initial findings are tested, extended, and revised with the addition of each new data set. The potential power of the triangulation method is demonstrated, and potential problems are identified. (Author)",

The researchers explored teachers' stages of concern and teacher development; organizational change; teacher effectiveness; and contextual influence on teaching. Discussion of the two cases focuses on four central questions: (1) What were the  teachers' personal and professional characteristics, and did these relate to perceptions of the initial class assignments? (2) Did the teachers change their classroom practice as a function of the multiple layers of change they experienced? (3) Who initiated the changes in classroom assignments, and how did the teachers feel about the changes? and (4) What contextual changes occurred as a result of the new assignments, and how (if at all) did these relate to the teachers' perceptions and practices?

Findings indicated that there was occasional disagreement over  decision making responsibility at all levels. Curriculum decision making was seen as moving further away from the classroom.

        "description":"The Classroom Management Improvement Study (CMIS) was designed to investigate a complex staff development effort in order to provide a clear explication of the treatment in the event that either researchers or practitioners desired to replicate the intervention. The treatment was directed toward introducing effective classroom management procedures to teachers. It consisted of a workshop prior to the beginning of school, a manual of management prescriptions, and a reinforcement workshop 4 weeks after school began. Results show that, prior to the treatment, there was no statistically significant difference between treatment and control teachers' knowledge of classroom management as defined by the CMIS study. Afterwards, treatment teachers exhibited significantly more desired  classroom management behaviors than did control teachers. The reinforcement workshop appeared to have little or no effect on treatment teachers' management behaviors other than maintenance. A group of control teachers received a mid-year treatment; results suggested that the mid-year treatment was not as effective as that given prior to the beginning of school. Speculations are made concerning the utility of the CMIS treatment for staff development programs for teachers. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"A design for analyzing the narrative records obtained in four studies examined the character of classroom activities and how they are managed by teachers. Focus was on controlling classroom behaviors, classroom rules, handling of disruptive or inappropriate behavior, instructional leadership, classroom organization, and student engagement. Approximately 2,775 narratives were obtained, consisting of fairly detailed accounts of management-related behaviors during class sessions in elementary and junior high school classes. In addition, observers kept time logs on student engagement and, at the end of the year, teachers were interviewed concerning student achievement. To analyze this body of information, 31 junior high and 15 elementary teachers were selected as a sample for a  series of planned comparisons around themes that separate task and performance dimensions contained in the descriptions. Four levels of analysis were defined to move systematically from the accounts of classroom behavior in the narrative records to progressively more general propositions about what teachers do to establish order in the classroom, and what proficient teachers are likely to know about classrooms and how this knowledge is organized for use in accomplishing lessons. The information gained from this type of analysis is viewed as a major contribution to defining the knowledge base for classroom practice and, thus, the content of teacher education and staff development programs.

The purpose was to identify factors in planning and to identify relationships among planning and classroom management on the first day and throughout the first 8 weeks of school. Planning variables included goal emphasis, contextual factors and alternatives considered, content emphasis and level of detail of written plans, and teacher feelings of success and projected changes in future first-day planning. Results indicated that teacher written plans were not very detailed; however, teachers' activities on the first day were generally congruent with their written plans and their stated goal  emphasis. Results also suggested that more comprehensive first-day planning is positively related to more effective classroom management throughout the first 8 weeks of school; that a procedural emphasis is most common on the first day but that teachers who restricted their first day activities to administrative tasks have less effective 8-week classroom management success; and that teachers who combine an affective and procedural emphasis on the first day have better 8-week classroom management results.

Research on classroom management and discipline is reviewed and integrated into a three phase model. The first phase occurs prior to the beginning of school and includes the formation of expectations about behavior and work requirements along with room and materials preparation. A second phase occurs at the beginning of the school year; in this phase the teacher needs to be concerned with socializing students into the classroom setting and establishing appropriate behavior. The third phase occurs throughout the year and is focused on maintaining appropriate behavior. Research related  to each phase in the management process is summarized and discussed, with an emphasis on describing the teaching skills and principles associated with effective management.

The literature is organized under four major headings: teacher planning, teachers' interactive thoughts and decisions, teachers' attributions, and teachers' implicit theories. The paper also includes a theoretical model of the relationships among the four major topics reviewed, as well as their relationships to teacher and student behavior and to the contexts of school and classroom. It is concluded that more than a decade of research on teachers' thinking has taught as much about how to think about teaching as it has about the thought processes of teachers. More integrated research efforts are called for, in which the several aspects of teachers' cognitive  activity, typically studied in isolation, are examined in all of their interactive complexity.

Across these four areas, mutually reinforcing factors explain why teacher education has been kept from being as academic and intellectual as it should be, and why change has been slow and difficult. The research review indicates that, although a number of academically talented persons pursue careers in teaching and teacher education, persons with limited academic talent are allowed to dominate the field. Studies of the curriculum of initial and continuing teacher education show it to be fragmented,  shallow, and overly technical. Institutional policies, structures, and resources that might be expected to foster the quality of teaching and teacher education appear to do the opposite. A pattern is revealed which reinforces the maintenance of teacher education as a marginal part of the university and school communities. Significant change in teacher education will be difficult, since reform will have to be orchestrated through attention to a set of complex, interdependent factors. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"An expert reading instruction teacher was studied for one academic year to explore his interactive decision making processes. Previous lines of research have indicated that, for some teachers, interactive decision making involves more than simply maintaining established routines that assure smooth activity flow and involves deviating from the pre-planned activities to attend to issues of content and pedagogy. In this study, Shavelson and Stern's models of preactive and interactive decision making were used to describe the expert teacher's actual performance. Specific examples of teacher-student interactions are given, with analyses of how they reflected the close relationship that existed between the teacher's preactive and interactive decision making and his knowledge, values,  and beliefs about how reading should be taught. The study revealed that at least some teachers do make more interactive decisions during reading instruction. It also dramatized the relationship between preactive and interactive teaching, and the relationship between instructional plans and implementation of those plans. The study also emphasized that interactive decision making may not be a static phenomenon; rather, it takes different forms at different times of the academic year according to the function of instruction and the teacher's focus. The results support the Shavelson and Stern Models (1981) and suggest that those models are useful for explaining teacher decision making and planning further research. (JD)",

The Vance & Schlecty study compared \"recruits\"--those who had: (1) majored in education; (2) taught school; or (3) obtained a certificate to teach--to \"non-recruits,\" ranking them separately by Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores. Recruits were subdivided into: non-teachers; teachers; committed teachers; defectors; and confirmed defectors. Committed teachers represented a greater proportion of lower SAT scores than did the other groups. It is suggested that: (1) Societal factors may convince those with modest abilities that teaching is a good profession to consider, and  persuade those with higher ability levels that it is an inappropriate career choice; (2) Teacher education programs may encourage the more modestly endowed to continue in teacher training and drive the higher academic-functioning students away; and (3) Teaching conditions may be instrumental in selecting or maintaining staff members of lower ability. A parallel study made at Michigan State University focused on students entering the teaching program. The SAT rankings of students interviewed for both studies are presented in tables and comparisons are made. (DG)",

Fifty-three tri-ethnic sixth-grade classes, comprising about 1,500 students, were studied the first year, and 43 classes of about 1,200 new students were studied in the next year. A second replication sample of 27 fourth to seventh grade classes, with about 700 students, was studied in Daviess County, Kentucky. Findings included: (1) Teacher age and experience showed either no relationship or a negative relationship to the measures of teaching effectiveness; (2)  Teachers' self-rated personal traits did not predict teacher or student classroom behavior; (3) Student socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, and pre-test status showed substantial effects on student outcomes; (4) Observer-rated teacher behavior had strong effects on students' evaluation of the teacher's impact on them; (5) Teacher behavior showed effects on student time-on-task behavior and outcomes; and (6) A given kind of teaching behavior had different effects on different kinds of students, especially very low-achieving, low SES, minority students, or high-achieving, high status students. Findings suggest that particular sub-groups of students need to be looked at afresh each year, and their responsiveness to instruction alertly monitored. (Author/JD)",

It affects achievement positively, and students generally rate lessons higher when the structure of the lesson is relatively high. Teachers vary in the degree of structure of their lessons, a fact indicating that some teachers could profit by being trained to increase the degree of structure, or commonality of ideas and concepts, in their lessons. Problems have been identified in the training process and in analyzing lesson structure, but these problems can be resolved by expending time and by employing subject matter experts. The most relevant suggestion for teacher training and  teacher evaluation is that trainers and evaluators focus on low-inference teacher behaviors that can be critiqued objectively. Clusters of such behaviors may provide a key for developing useful theories of instruction. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"If education is concerned with imagination, it is important to know how educators perceive the term. For this purpose, an attempt was made to categorize ways in which teachers conceptualize imagination. Responses were obtained in a survey from 120 teachers who were registered in a graduate course on creative thinking. Participants ranged in age from young adults to middle age and included both males and females who taught at all levels from elementary through college. They were given approximately ten minutes to write their definitions of imagination. A content analysis of their responses showed that, in varying proportions, they viewed imagination as: (1) a thought process (thinking/mental activity); (2) dreaming, fantasizing, mind-wandering, visualization; (3) the basis of  creative thinking (uniqueness, fluency, flexibility, originality of ideas and products); (4) an ability; (5) beyond ordinary thinking (not limited by reality, personal inhibitions, or logic; a way of seeing ordinary things differently); (6) ideating; (7) an expression of individuality; and (8) a problem solving or inventing kind of process.

        "description":"A \"troubleshooting\" model was designed to aid individual teachers in solving behavioral problems in the classroom. The model focused on student behavior for problem identification; on teacher behavior for causal analysis; and on teacher behavior for solution proposals. To examine how readily the model can be understood, applied, and integrated into teachers' existing ways of identifying and solving classroom problems, two questions were addressed: (1) How readily do teachers learn the components of a troubleshooting model via a guided design approach? and (2) Is the language used by the model consistent with the language used by teachers? Forty-five teachers, first individually and then in groups, identified problems they perceived in a transcript of a high school mathematics  class. While the group exercise was seen as an effective tool for having teachers explore the troubleshooting model, data obtained dealt only with how teachers modify attention to teacher and student behavior within the context of a given classroom problem. Appendices include a descriptive summary of participant characteristics, a sample of the exercise used in testing the model, and before-and-after differences in participants' attitudes toward solving classroom problems.

In 1982 future options for the AISD minimum competency program, which requires all students to meet minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics before graduation, were evaluated against legal and local criteria. It was decided to develop an item bank that would allow the generation of multiple, parallel forms of a competency test to be administered: to students in tutorial courses; to senior transfers; and in special testing sessions to students meeting the course requirements, but not yet meeting the minimum competency requirement, for graduation. Important issues during the BEST development process fell into six general categories: (1)  identification of objectives; (2) item acquisition; (3) item calibration; (4) test formatting; (5) test production; and (6) item and test booklet security.

Several key school files and documents were examined; prior dropout data were examined; and a survey of school personnel was conducted. The general conclusion of the study was that, given (1) the current state definition of a dropout, (2) the existing district procedures for defining dropouts and calculating dropout rates, and (3) the extent to which staffs at some schools are knowledgeable of and correctly follow these procedures, there is reason to question the accuracy of the district's and schools' dropout data. Further, the extensiveness of the problems in these three areas is such that  determining an accurate dropout rate would not, at this time, be feasible. Specifically, the resources that would be required to produce accurate data would be better spent in revising existing definitions and procedures, developing computer programs to monitor and summarize school-level data, and providing inservice programs to schools' clerical and administrative staff regarding the revised definitions and procedures.

In order to accomplish these goals, staff changes were initiated, instructional materials were upgraded, physical plant repairs and improvements were begun, and a major inservice training program was provided  in three of the Dade County Public Schools: Holmes Elementary, Little River Elementary, and Orchard Villa Elementary. The evaluation found no evidence, from the available data, that Operation Turnaround has had an impact on student performance on either the State Student Assessment Tests or the Stanford Achievement Tests. The teacher questionnaire variables did not show program-related differences. Data on school crime indicate a sharp decline in the total number of reported violent incidents for the last two years at Operation Turnaround schools in relation to previous years and in relation to the last two years at the comparison schools.

The evaluation of Dade County's Beginning Teacher Program's first operational year was conducted to examine the appropriateness and effectiveness of major program elements. Data were obtained to determine whether the required program activities occurred; whether the activities occurred in the manner prescribed by district and state quidelines; and  whether the program had an overall favorable impact upon the beginning teachers with regard to their performance on 23 generic teaching competencies. Overall, the evaluation findings indicated that the assessment and instructional components of the BTP were implemented, primarily through the efforts of building-level administrators and peer teachers, and with a degree of success. Generally, perceptions regarding the contributions of the program were favorable. Most beginning teachers and support team members perceived that the program was effective and contributed positively to their professional development. (BW)",

The GMAT, first administered in 1954, provides objective measures of an applicant's abilities for use in admissions decisions by graduate management schools. It is currently composed of five sections: (1) Reading Comprehension; (2) Problem Solving; (3) Practical Judgment; (4) Data Sufficiency; and (5) Usage. New test forms are developed systematically from a test item pool. New items are pretested at regular test administrations and evaluated empirically. Test specifications are the blueprints for assembling a final test form. Uniform test administration conditions are maintained through responsible supervision and careful test  security procedures. In addition, several publications provide all examinees with GMAT test information and test taking strategies. The GMAT score scale has a mean of 500, a standard deviation of 100 for the base group, and a possible range from 200 to 800. Angoff's methods are used to equate scores. Continuing validity studies (predictive, content, and construct) provide an important basis for score interpretation information on reliability, standard error, descriptive statistics, and biographical data for examinees are also given to assist in score interpretation.

Most of these examinees were non-native speakers of English for whom average scores on the verbal and analytical measures were considerably lower than those of native English speakers. However, the quantitative mean profile of foreign examinees did not vary according to English language background and was quite similar to that of U.S. examinees. Detailed comparative profiles of GRE performance data are provided for the general foreign and U.S. examinee populations; for foreign examinees classified by country of citizenship; and for groups of foreign and U.S. examinees defined in terms of  age, sex, reported English language communication status, intended graduate field, U.S. vs. other undergraduate origin, repeater vs. nonrepeater status, and other personal, academic, and testing-related characteristics. Study findings suggest that GRE General Test data (especially verbal and analytical test data) generated by non-U.S. citizens from non-native English speaking societies should not be treated as comparable to test data for U.S. examinees or examinees from other native-English speaking societies.

The average number of hours spent preparing for and taking these tests ranged from 6.0 hours in Grade 6 to 29.5 hours in Grade 3. These results indicate that the amount of periodic testing is not large and in fact consumes less than 2 percent of the available instruction time. Nonetheless, three areas of concern emerged from the analysis: (1) the status of locally-developed curriculum-related  tests, given teacher uncertainty about their usefulness and quality; (2) the misuse of achievement test data by using results to place individual students in particular programs and classes; and (3) questions about the reliability and validity of the measures used, especially at the intermediate level.

In addition, the psychometric characteristics of these tests when used with handicapped people are reported. Though much more data needs to be collected, several observations are made. Handicapped students as a general group perform appreciably lower than national norms on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and ACT Assessment. Of the four specific disability groups discussed, the admissions test performance of physically handicapped and of visually impaired examinees is most similar to the nondisabled population. The performance of learning disabled individuals ranks third among the specific disability groups, and is  appreciably lower than national norms. Hearing impaired students perform the least well of all disabled groups on admissions tests. The limited data on the reliability of cognitive tests for handicapped examinees show no trustworthy differences in measurement precision between disabled and nondisabled populations. The results of the small number of validity investigations that have been conducted also show no dependable differences across popuulations. Data on the ACT Assessment and the SAT generally support the validity of these measures as equivalent predictors of college performance. (Author/BW)",

        "description":"This paper reports on two comprehensive multi-institutional collaborative efforts for school improvement. The two studies demonstrate that collaborative efforts involving multiple agencies and multiple agendas can be successful even when separated by considerable geographical distance. The school systems were concerned with implementing a locally developed curriculum; researchers, meanwhile, were investigating the implementation process and providing training. The conceptual framework used in both programs, the Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM), is summarized. Its diagnostic dimensions (Stages of Concern about the Innovation, Levels of Use of the Innovation, and Innovation Configuration) are discussed. The planning, implementation, and evaluation of the two case studies are  summarized: the Jefferson County (JeffCo) (Colorado) Schools program to improve elementary science curriculum and instruction; and the Palm Beach (Florida) Schools development and implementation of the Unified Curriculum program. The JeffCo case provides a clear example of a concerns-based implementation effort and illustrates how the diagnostic dimensions of the CBAM can be used to plan, monitor, and intervene in improvement efforts. Addressing teacher concerns is emphasized. The Palm Beach study emphasizes principal inservice training for the role of implementaion facilitation. The collaboration of research teams from schools mentioned above and from the Research and Development Center for Teacher Education at the University of Texas at Austin led to the formulation of seven key  principles for school improvement; six important unresolved issues are also presented.

        "description":"Using a series of regression equations, classroom process and student achievement data from 136 junior high school mathematics and English classes were analyzed to answer the following questions: (1) Are the classroom behaviors and achievement levels of students systematically different across classes of higher and lower ability? (2) Within classes, are the behaviors of higher and lower ability students systematically different? and (3) Does student ability level interact with the ability level of the class to affect systematically students' classroom behavior and achievement? Results of class level analyses suggest that better learning environments are associated with classes of higher mean ability, and that both higher ability students and lower ability students achieve better  in higher ability classes. Interactions obtained between class and student ability levels suggest that differences in class environment associated with class ability level have more impact on achievement and behavior of lower ability students than on high ability students. Lower ability students appear to be more reactive to or dependent on class norms than are higher ability students. (Author)",

The constituency groups included are: the general public, community leaders, parents, students, graduates, and professional educators. The method requires polling the groups using telephone surveys, mailed surveys, or group administered surveys. Many survey questions can be used on all survey forms with minor modifications. This general procedure was applied to two Alabama School Systems wanting broad input on future district plans and their financing. In both cases the general public and community leaders were surveyed via the telephone. Other groups were surveyed via hand-carried and mailed questionnaires. The survey forms were developed through central office  staff brainstorming activities. The boards of educations reviewed the issues before their incorporation into the instruments. Issues incorporated included physical plant, supporting services, staff personnel, pupil personnel, curriculum, community relations, and school finance. There was much more agreement among constituency groups than disagreement. The participation of multiple constituency groups and its attendant publicity resulted in a more favorable environment for change. (Author/BS)",

Student information was obtained through the Los Angeles Unified School District's data base for the Survey of Essential Skills (May 1982). Predominantly English-speaking, the students represented many subgroups (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Samoan, etc.). The exploratory analysis identified manipulable variables of classroom instruction that affect the schooling achievement of API students, such as the amount of time spent using grade-level instructional materials, the \"thickness\" or \"thinness\" of lesson space devoted to particular skill areas, the placement of instruction in the curriculum sequence, and  the relative complexity of the skill area concepts. Implications for improved instruction for all students are discussed. Numerous line graphs illustrate skill area patterns. (Author/BW)",

Taking table-using skill as the illustrative domain, this paper presents a view of task analysis and synthesis as dependent on workspace characteristics and grounding on base operations.

The method has three steps: (1) establishing a RIMS-specific District level data base containing data on achievement, student demographics, school demographics, and classroom practices for implementing instructional programs in RIM schools; (2) developing an analysis design for RIMS-specific data which identifies skills students do have (rather than &quot;missing&quot;  skills) and has significant implications for adjusting RIMS schooling practices; and (3) using analyses which identify successful instructional practices to implement a two- to three-year instructional plan for moving achievement along in RIM schools.

Longitudinal data were gathered from 900 classes, with each class using one of the products. The results illustrate how valid information on instructional effects can be obtained and used for the purpose of comparative evaluation. Further, the results contradict the popular belief that the specific instructional resources used in an instructional program do not matter. Instructional outcomes reflect the specific skills and  concepts emphasized in a given product system, and these differences in emphasis emerge when instructionally sensitive instrumentation is used. Of more importance, the study illustrates a methodology that can be used for what is referred to as empirical curriculum inquiry. This is a way of identifying what students know, what school programs commonly and uniquely teach, and what students learn. Some implications of this methodology for school improvement efforts are discussed. (Author/BS)",

Cluster analysis forms groups of relatively homogeneous subjects represented in large data blocks that contain several different observations for each subject. While recently developed software packages make the computation more manageable, identifying the optimal number of clusters, and making sense out of them, requires considerable knowledge of the subjects and variables being clustered. Cluster analysis was applied to data from the two Prealgebra surveys of the Training and Employment Prerequisites Survey given to almost  1,500 wards of the California Youth Authority enrolled in remedial mathematics classes. The Prealgebra Surveys cover the skills and concepts most common to mathematics instruction up through grade 7. Results indicate that even fairly well prepared students will be unsuccessful in traditional remediation programs which focus first on mastery of all types of complicated computational skills. Instead, general mathematics instruction should consist of one course that redevelops basic concepts and skills for handling fractions and decimals, and another course on more advanced topics in general mathematics applications or an introduction to algebra where the requirements for complicated forms of computation are carefully controlled.

Teachers and principals at both elementary and secondary grade levels served as primary subjects for the nationwide survey, which was preceded by an extensive literature review and exploratory fieldwork in three school districts and followed by case study inquiry. The results from this research were used to specifically address  three sets of policy issues: (1) equity in testing; (2) teacher preparation and local test quality; and (3) ways of integrating, aligning, or rationalizing assessment to address the needs of policy makers.

Equating transformations were evaluated by comparing equated scores with true/observed scores along with bias and root-mean-squared-error indices. Specific testing-condition manipulations included variations in test length, item difficulty, sample size, and examinee ability distributions. The study found that parallel subtests were best equated using the simple conventional methods; nonparallel subtests, on the other hand, were best equated with the more complex IRT  and STST methods. There were few differences among the data collection designs when they were applied to samples of equivalent ability levels; the anchor-test design was essential for equating subtests using nonequivalent examinee groups. There was little advantage to be gained by increasing the sample size from 1,000 to 2,400 examinees. Equating accuracy was not markedly affected when subtest length was doubled, nor did it matter whether easy or difficult subtests were equated. (Author/BW)",

The second paper, &quot;Factors Common to High-Utilization Evaluations,&quot; by Ruskus and Alkin, identifies six of these factors: level of evaluator effort, evaluator's leadership behavior, user involvement, evaluation reporting, evaluator involvement in implementing recommendations, and user commitment to use. The final paper, &quot;Reflections on Evaluation  Costs: Direct and Indirect,&quot; by Alkin and Ruskus, describes how to identify and assign values to both direct and indirect cost components, and how costs should be considered in relation to benefits accrued from an evaluation.

        "description":"Evaluation can serve a variety of educational management questions, but an administrator's ability to use evaluation as a management tool depends not only upon his or her own perception of evaluation but also on the perceptions of other potential evaluation users in the system. Research has uncovered a variety of factors influencing an evaluation's use potential. These factors reflect human considerations, such as people's attitudes toward and expectations for the evaluation; context considerations, such as an evaluation's requirements within a particular setting; and evaluation considerations, such as procedures used and means of communicating information. The research demonstrates that an evaluation's use potential, and therefore its application as a management tool, can be  greatly enhanced if someone takes responsibility for organizing the evaluation to meet specified needs, for particular users, in light of the factors operating in the given setting. The research also suggests that a program-level administrator is in the most strategic position to assume this responsibility. When a program evaluation is being considered, therefore, the administrator needs to decide on its various audiences, determine their questions and information needs, and anticipate the uses they are likely to make of the information.

The study took place in a large urban school district (in the Southeast) that is heavily committed to and involved in staff development. Following descriptions and discussions of: (1) how power and authority are distributed in the system; (2) the functions of staff development and the motivations of participants; and (3) the capacity of staff development programs to maintain direction, maintain coordination, and exercise control over resources, two related arguments are advanced: (1) the way schools are presently organized places considerable pressure on the staff  development enterprise to keep things from getting worse and distracts attention from the intended purpose of staff development, which is to make things better, and (2) until the maintenance system of schools (i.e., the system that keeps things from getting worse) is considerably enriched, there is little likelihood that change-oriented staff development can systematically succeed. On the basis of the descriptive material and the analysis, some concrete suggestions are made regarding how staff development might be improved. Appended are materials relating to the initial research questions, program selection criteria, descriptions of the programs studied, and recommendations made by the researchers on the question of merit pay.

Although the project discussed was originally designed to isolate language-related difficulties that affect mathematical skills among bilingual Hispanic students, some problems shared by mainstream students were also uncovered. The tests used were designed to demonstrate the effect of verbal skills on logical ability and algebraic problem-solving ability. Patterns of thought manifested in the results of the written exams were then pursued further through clinical interviews. It is stressed that extant programs aimed at the preparation of minorities for technical education at college fall short by not  including language skills as an integral part of the program. Such an integrated program, it is suggested, would enhance students' problem-solving performances. The tabulated results of the exams are appended. (RDN)",

        "description":"Research indicates that Hispanic technical students exhibit patterns of performance in problem solving tasks that are clearly distinct from those exhibited by Anglo students. This may be because problem solvers working problems in a nonnative language are in more danger of misinterpreting problems due to sentence construction, jargon, etc., than native speakers. These conclusions come from studying the performance of a group of 60 bilingual Hispanic students and a control group of 73 nonminority Anglo students, most of whom were engineering majors. Often, Hispanic students misinterpreted problems, even when familiar with all the vocabulary words used in the problem. In these cases, students necessarily translated a problem into mathematical terminology incorrectly, but in a  manner totally consistent with the misinterpretation. Furthermore, Hispanic students were at a disadvantage in solving problems with speed, as measured by the number of questions not reached due to time constraints. These findings suggest that Hispanics would benefit most from problem solving courses that emphasize speed and accuracy in translating a word problem into mathematical notation. (KH)",

The data (derived from school records and from a questionnaire to which 162 elementary teachers responded) showed more experienced teachers as reporting less frequent drug use and fighting. These teachers also held less positive attitudes toward within-school suspension and corporal punishment. More educated teachers reported less bad language from students, less personal use of verbal reprimands and corporal punishment, and more personal use of talk, counseling, or parent involvement and extra assignments as disciplinary  techniques. Lower student socioeconomic status (SES) and/or a lower percentage of white students in a school was associated with more frequent reportings of disruptive or violent behavior. Teachers in lower SES and/or white-percentage schools more frequently endorsed physical or verbal punishment or removal of students. Teachers in higher SES and/or white-percentage schools favored extra assignments as a disciplinary technique. Finally, grade or age of students was found to be positively associated with teacher perceptions of more verbal impertinence, failures to do homework, and truancy, and teachers of higher grades were more likely to use suspension than corporal punishment as a disciplinary technique.

Five targets of change are analyzed: presumptions of logic, socialization processes, differential participation, constant variables, and corruptions of feedback.

The status of coordination in Fiscal 1983, the last year of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), is analyzed in order to lay the groundwork for future assessments of the effectiveness of the new Federal Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) in improving coordination. Specific mechanisms to promote coordination as well as factors hampering it are reviewed. The highest levels of coordination are found to have been with public education agencies and public employment. The most striking finding for future  employment and training systems is said to be the low level of coordination encountered with the Work Incentive (WIN) program, which was also the program with the fewest coordination mechanisms. It is determined that coordination between CETA Prime Sponsors and other agencies was generally good, although the presence of coordinating structures was not always accompanied by mechanisms to promote the results of coordination. The report concludes by recommending that further attention be paid to factors that have promoted and impeded coordination between Prime Sponsors and the public Employment Service. (RDN)",

The main categories of programs and legislation described are: (1) those bearing on teenage parents and education; (2) pre-school programs; (3) day care; (4) welfare; (5) social services; (6) child support enforcement; (7) earned income tax credit; (8) employment and training; (9) health; (10) family planning; (11) abortion; (12) adolescent family life demonstration projects; (13) food and nutrition programs; (14) housing; (15) runaway youth; and (16) child abuse, neglect, prevention, and treatment. It is concluded that many different programs can be relevant to teens who are sexually active, pregnant, or parents. Many of  the intervention programs are costly, particularly the remedial interventions aimed at teenagers who are already parents. It is argued, however, that given the frequent reliance of teenage parents on welfare and other types of public assistance and the difficult economic and social circumstances under which teenage parents so frequently raise their families, it is more cost effective in the broadest sense of the term to assist teenagers to prevent unwanted pregnancies and to provide remedial assistance when preventive efforts fail.

        "description":"A two-step procedure is described and used to revise a multidimensional inventory in its developmental stages. First, the latent factors influencing the observed variables on the inventory are determined and justified using the following five methods: Kaiser's criterion, root staring, examination of difference values, examination of root mean square off-diagonal residuals and alpha coefficients. The second step, determining the factor pattern, consists of examining selected factor solutions for stability and simplicity of variables. Each of these methods is considered separately, and it is suggested that the conglomerate of methods be used in the initial stages of questionnaire development, with the final decision based on theoretical significance and parsimony. These procedures  are illustrated with data from the initial form of the Competitiveness Inventory, a self-report, sport-specific achievement orientation inventory. The inventory was administered to physical education skills classes at the University of Iowa during spring semester 1984 (n=237), and again during spring semester, 1985 (n=218). Independent exploratory factor analyses were performed on each sample with the use of Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS) and Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences-X (SPSS-X). Results revealed a stable three-factor pattern across samples, and suggested that 25 of the original 32 items be retained for the revised version of the Competitiveness Inventory. (Author)",

Like many projects funded under the Basic Skills program, CROSSROADS was terminated after two years even though it had been funded with the expectation of four years for program development and demonstration. Subjects of the evaluation were 166 tutees from four junior high schools in Long Beach, California. Progress rates of the tutees were measured by pre- and posttests, standardized tests, school grades and criterion referenced measures. Evaluation results suggested that tutees learned some basic skills but not enough to impact upon standardized test scores or grades. Results also suggested that  out-of-school basic skills programs will have a difficult time in producing substantial gains in basic skills in lower achieving children due to problems with tutee motivation and logistics of running out-of-school programs. Although the evaluation did not substantiate strongly the effectiveness of the CROSSROADS model for basic skill improvement, findings and issues are pertinent to efforts to improve basic skills and to educational policies and evaluation practice.

The purpose of this study was primarily to assess interrater agreement on the WISC-R Administration Observational Checklist (WAOC), a new observational instrument that can be used by an observer to evaluate all components of WISC-R administration. A secondary purpose of the study was to evaluate two WISC-R administrations of five students enrolled in a graduate course in psychoeducational assessment. Based on a total of 10 observations by two raters, Cohen's Kappa was calculated for 29 of the measures on the checklist. The values for 22 of the measures were significant (p greater than .05). The difference in mean scores  for the first and second observations of the students did not quite reach statistical significance because of the small number of subjects and because of a ceiling effect for one student who scored highest on the first observation. However, after receiving feedback, students showed improvement on a number of the measures. WAOC enables the observer to pinpoint examiner errors and to give specific feedback regarding those errors.

Two main lines of interest research are identified: (1) research activities rooted in the tradition of differential psychology emphasizing vocational interests, traits, and attitudes; and (2) research based on a new educationally oriented theory of interest, which defines interest as specific form of a relationship between a person and an object from the environment (PO). The PO-relationship involves internal and external actions, as well as an enduring disposition towards an object. Three research approaches include the formation of persistance and selectivity in interest development; specific interest objects such as literature and academic  subjects; and ontogenetic development of interests. The longitudinal study collected data about the object-related activities and social behavior of young children. Results indicated common PO-relationships involving role playing, tinkering, painting, and construction games. There were marked differences in their object preference structure (one or two highly preferred objects versus several equally-preferred ones). Most PO-relationships were more characterized by an activity type than a specific object type. Both the educational and social environments influenced the development of PO-relationships. (GDC)",

The score distributions were systematically varied to represent the common circumstances of a military training situation using criterion-referenced mastery tests. Three 20-item tests were administered to 110 simulated subjects. The cutting score on each test was 10 items correct. Three databases were constructed for normal, bimodal, and skewed score distributions. Five item analysis statistics were calculated: the p statistic, two versions of the upper-lower group statistics, the phi coefficient, and the point-biserial correlation. Analysis of variance and t-tests were used to estimate differences between the discrimination index values. With normal data, the  second upper-lower statistic produced the largest discrimination values, point-biserial next, and phi coefficient and the first upper-lower produced identical, least discriminating values. Similar results were obtained for the bimodal discrimination indices. The skewed distribution analysis was slightly different, with the first upper-lower results larger than the phi coefficients. The second upper-lower method was not significantly different from the point-biserial correlation. (Suggestions for choosing a method are summarized in a matrix and a decision tree). (GDC)",

Effect size was calculated for 165 out of 232 submittals reviewed by JDRP from 1980 through 1983. Results indicated the largest variance in effect size was explained by content area (highest effect size in natural science and lowest in reading, language arts, and mathematics); and secondly, by reported annual operating funds (less than $100,000 had higher effect size). Other program characteristics related to large effect size were gifted participants, regular classroom setting, urban or suburban setting, and  behavioral versus attitudinal or affective objectives. Lowest effect sizes were associated with handicapped audiences and special facilities. Locally developed tests, external evaluators, and randomized evaluation designs were associated with higher effect sizes. The combination of program and evaluation features which accounted for effect size were type of test, formula used to calculate effect size, type of objective, and evaluator affiliation. It was concluded that effect size data should not be interpreted simplistically; facile comparisons of the absolute values of effect sizes can tbe misleading. Several tables are provided.

Molenaar has embraced a pragmatic viewpoint on Bayesian methods, using both empirical and pure approaches to solve educational research problems. Molenaar presented a taxonomy of Bayesian procedures. Current Dutch research involves nonparametric Bayesian procedures, formalization of prior belief, reporting of the results, and evaluation applications. Van der Linden listed a wide array of testing problems to which decision theory is being applied in the Netherlands. De Gruijter and Mooijaart have made important contributions in least squares Bayesian estimation, and Lewis has clarified  difficulties in implementing the hierarchical Bayesian model. Researchers testing Rasch Model assumptions include Van den Wollenberg and Roskam and Jansen. Recent item bias research by Mellenbergh provides a sound method for making inferences about differential item performance between groups. De Gruijter discussed a number of useful applications of generalizability theory, including criterion referenced tests, cutting scores, analysis of ratings, equated scores, and test construction.

        "description":"The hierarchical clustering technique was used to differentiate college dropouts from persisters, and to determine how student clusters differ from one another on relevant outcome variables. Subjects were 618 freshmen who entered a community college with the intention of completing a two-year associate degree. There were 432 persisters who returned for the last three semesters, and 186 non-persisters who did not. Four variables which were found to differentiate persisters and non-persisters were entered into a hierarchical clustering program (PROC CLUSTER in SAS): (1) age; (2) degree objective; (3) scores on writing placement tests; and (4) scores on mathematics placement tests. Five clusters were developed, according to academic readiness, performance, and persistence. Analysis  of variance and chi square tests were performed. Dependent variables included age; sex; ethnic status; grade point average; placement test scores in reading, mathematics, and writing; and percentage of first semester courses completed. A comparison of the predictive value of the clustering technique and of placement tests indicated that clustering was not superior in diagnostic sensitivity or specificity. Although the distribution of persisters and non-persisters was significantly different across clusters, the hierarchical clustering patterns did not appear to have sufficient predictive validity as a screening method.

        "description":"The effectiveness of an Education Consolidation Improvement Act Chapter 1 program was studied in a large urban school district. A common problem in evaluating remedial programs is that pretest/posttest achievement gains often indicate the effects of the entire curriculum, rather than those specific to the remedial class. In this district, over 50,000 Chapter 1 students were enrolled in more than 250 elementary schools. A conceptually simple method was needed for studying the effects of the remedial program versus the core curriculum. School regressions, residuals, mean residuals for Chapter 1 students at each school, and a number of mean residuals were computed from a database containing pretest and posttest scores. Residuals from within-school regressions were used to model the  effect of the entire curriculum. Each school's mean residual indexed the effectiveness of its own Chapter 1 program. Results indicated one-third of the school's mean residuals for Chapter 1 students were positive. A large correlation matrix of variables which might explain the variance patterns was not conclusive. Only a few variables were modestly correlated with the residuals. In addition, few of the explanatory variables correlated with each other as expected. Measuring teacher characteristics might have been helpful in this project. (GDC)",

        "description":"Linking Outcomes to Organizational Planning (LOOP) was initiated during the 1984-85 school year in the Austin (Texas) Independent School District. LOOP was designed to ensure that evaluation, research, and informal findings became part of the instructional planning loop; to provide information to the Superintendent on progress toward priorities and to focus staff on the goals; and to provide a reporting format. Conditions for success included a clear mandate from the Superintendent, and designation of a key person to follow through and provide reports. LOOP procedures were integrated into established procedures. Findings for action were generated by diverse sources, including evaluation reports, construction progress reports, and committees. LOOP has ten steps: (1) identify  relevant evaluation finding; (2) establish goal; (3) assign responsibility for meeting the goal; (4) identify means of achieving the goal; (5) update activity status and action required, using the data processing system; (6) have continual monitoring of progress by Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE); (7) ORE to make monthly and annual reports; (8) Superintendent and Cabinet to provide feedback regarding progress toward each goal; (9) Superintendent and Cabinet to declare that the goal has been met; and (10) Superintendent to report to Board and Public. Although a great deal of effort was involved, LOOP has been effective. About two-thirds of the document consists of an appendix containing monthly and other reports on LOOP activities for selected priorities especially those involving  achievment gains and computers.

        "description":"In certain situations, grade equivalent scores are the most appropriate statistic available for reporting achievement test data. It is noted that testing practitioners have found that raw scores, normal curve equivalents, stanines, and standard scores are very useful. However, it is best to convert to either grade equivalents or percentiles before communicating them to lay audiences. In the Austin, Texas Independent School District, both grade equivalents and percentiles are routinely reported to high school students' parents. Elementary school parents receive percentile scores routinely, but may request grade equivalents. Both percentiles and grade equivalents are often misinterpreted; the shortcomings of percentiles are merely less well known. Seven critical questions that can  be used to decide whether achievement test results should be reported in grade equivalent or percentile scores are presented and briefly discussed. These questions can be located along two dimensions: comparison standard and time. The five standards of comparison are: (1) grade level; (2) peers; (3) all students, all grades; (4) self; and (5) students at the same achievement level. The two criteria involving time periods are: achievement status to date; and pretest posttest gain. Appendices include a 1977 publication describing myths in interpreting grade equivalent scores and an information kit containing training materials on grade equivalents, percentiles, and norming a standardized test.

Significant biases were noted between raters, between years, and between elementary and secondary teacher ratings. To adjust for these biases, each teacher's raw score average was converted to a z-score, and adjusted for the factors associated with bias. The final z-score was used to determine selection for the Career Ladder; quota systems were not used. A small correlation was noted between teachers' z-scores and elementary school students' reading and mathematics achievement on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills. Teachers' raw scores were less able to predict student achievement. However, z-scores were  not well received. This technique was eventually abandoned due to: (1) dissatisfaction and distrust; (2) changes in legislation and confused communication; (3) the non-selection of some key teachers; (4) differing goals of the teachers' associations; and (5) the provision of additional funding for a greater number of career ladder teachers, which made z-scores unnecessary.

Discriminant analysis was used, classifying students according to grade point average, sex, ethnicity, and involvement in serious disciplinary incidents. Those with the greatest risk of dropping out were identified. Courses were divided into three categories: above average, average, or below average in holding power. Classes with above average holding power  included Spanish, introductory algebra, world history, dance, photography, biology, drawing and painting, and varsity sports. Courses with below average holding power included drama, Spanish for native speakers, fundamentals of mathematics, field sports, and electronics. It was noted that high risk students enrolling for band remained at higher risk than those who participated in varsity sports. Due to the informal nature of this study, it is suggested that conclusions should be drawn cautiously. (GDC)",

Achievement trends for Black, Hispanic, and White subgroups, as well as those defined by geographic region or sex, were similar to nationwide trends. From 1979 to 1984, students' writing skills showed improvement, particularly at ages 13 and 17. However, achievement remained low in 1984; only 38 percent of the 17-year  olds produced a well-organized and detailed descriptive essay, and only 20 percent wrote an effective persuasive letter. Imaginative writing improved for all ages. Results also indicated that although greater attention was focused on writing instruction in 1984 than in 1974, the actual amount of writing done by students remained about the same. Data tables, graphs, a summary of NAEP procedures, and students' writing samples showing different levels of expertise are included. (GDC)",

For this first national assessment of computer skills, it was necessary to consider the existing expertise of school staff, the current curriculum, the rapidly changing nature of computer science, and educators' different definitions of computer competence. Generally, educators agree that students need an exposure to computing that enables them both to experience the power of computing and to use that power to solve significant and interesting problems. Measurement objectives involve both paper-and-pencil tests of cognitive ability, as well as the practical  ability to use a computer to solve problems. Three categories of cognitive objectives include knowledge, operation, and problem solving and design. Eight applications areas include word processing, database management, laboratory instrumentation, telecommunications, graphics, music generation, spreadsheets, and models and simulations. Programming objectives involve elements of a language; structures of data and control; and program planning, design, and testing. A number of items are illustrated.

They were installed and implemented in 1984. Due to budget constraints, the PLATO program was dropped from the study. The DEGEM system will be evaluated during the second year of the project and is not included here. The primary application of the ILS was to provide Chapter 1 students with supplemental instruction in reading, language arts, and mathematics through computer assisted instruction (CAI). The evaluation compared the four systems' effectiveness.  Aspects of the evaluation included the match between ILS, curriculum content, and standardized achievement test content; instructional and technical characteristics; documentation; management systems; diagnostic placement; programming; staffing and training; cost effectiveness; and student and teacher perceptions of value. Results indicated the CAI programs were under-utilized during their first year, largely due to staffing patterns. Mathematics impact was generally greater than reading. The importance of a full-time laboratory operator was repeatedly noted. (GDC)",

        "description":"At the request of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Educational Research and Improvement, the Panel to Evaluate the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) was established in 1985 by the National Academy of Sciences. This report culminates an extensive two-year study of NCES and reflects the panel's broad view of the center's serious problems. The study had four major aspects: (1) to review, describe, and assess existing data quality and quality assurance processes; (2) to review, describe, and assess program content and services and procedures used for establishing priorities consistent with the Congressional mandate; (3) to review and assess the timeliness of data collected and disseminated; and (4) to identify issues hindering NCES in the successful  accomplishment of its mission. The panel recognized that the center will require increased funding, but funding requests should be judged against the progress of the center in meeting standards; and reflect the expected expansion of data collection. The panel's comprehensive recommendations addressed the following areas: (1) mission, role, and responsibilities; (2) content and direction of data collection programs; (3) establishing a frame of reference; (4) the advisory council; (5) improving data quality (redesigning the elementary/secondary data programs, reducing error, and statistical standards); (6) timeliness; (7) staff and budget resources; (8) contracting out; and (9) publications policy. The panel recommended that serious consideration be given to abolishing the center and  finding other means to obtain and disseminate education data if wide-ranging actions are not undertaken to change both the image and reality of the center. Appendices include the center's organizational structure and biographical sketches of panel and staff. (LMO)",

The report focuses on two areas: (1) monitoring the cognitive and affective impact of Project Concern over the current school year; and (2) examining the extent to which the reading and mathematics achievement gains of various groups of Project Concern students at Grades 3, 4, and 5 were sustained over time. The report provides detailed information regarding the evaluation design, procedures, and findings for these two areas. The different focuses of the report include student achievement (viewed absolutely, in relation to a national norm, and as sustained over time) and student attitudes toward school and learning.  Progress is reported in most of these areas, and overall the study supported the claim that Project Concern students have generally maintained and enhanced their achievement performances over time.

        "description":"While desegregation is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for ensuring either equity or quality education for minorities, the evidence is convincing that it is \"educationally more difficult\" to improve student achievement in segregated schools. Desegregation offers the opportunity to enhance the quality of education, particularly when the definition of \"quality education\" extends beyond simply academic achievement. This paper describes the characteristics of schools and classrooms in which quality integrated education is most likely to occur. The conditions and practices that seem to differentiate academically effective schools from ineffective ones can be grouped into five categories: (1) teacher behavior and instructional practices, (2) leadership behavior and  organizational characteristics, (3) learning environments, (4) learning resources, and (5) parent involvement. When school systems desegregate, changes occur in the community's attitude toward and relationship with schools; in addition, changes occur in the context and circumstances in which instructional and educational programs are presented. Increased attention must be directed toward parent involvement, school size, coherence of the curriculum, student discipline, the development of schoolwide norms which support achievement and order, and the other challenges of student diversity.

The information includes: (1) what CSBG funds are used for and whether CSBG-supported services duplicate other local social service programs, (2) what role CSBG funds have in the opinions of local service providers, (3) what impact terminating CSBG might have on the services provided by these local agencies, and (4) what the State and Federal roles are in administering CSBG. The report also contains two case studies of community action agencies (CAAs)--one rural and one urban--which describe the roles they have in their communities and how the issues raised during the reauthorization process  could affect them. General findings based on field work in eight states and 16 local communities indicate that: (1) CSBG funds primarily support a variety of direct services but also fund administrative functions of CAAs; (2) CSBG-supported services satisfied unmet needs and complemented services offered by local social service agencies rather than duplicated them; (3) loss of CSBG funds (without replacement) would reduce staff, consolidate operations, and reduce or eliminate services; and (4) State and Federal involvement consists of various types of oversight and assistance.

The study is designed to investigate the relationship between type and extent of desegre- gation activity and the resultant level of desegregation in the schools. This study is valuable for a number of reasons. First, the existing research literature has not helped our understanding of this particular question. The contractor, Unicon, has made excellent efforts to improve on the data with which it was originally supplied. It has hired a specialist in individual desegregation plans to search court records and Department of Justice records for details of plans. Other data collection efforts should be to consider  data from other sources and to conduct a phone survey and follow-up of districts for which available records do not indicate the presence of a plan. By concentrating on how established patterns of student and population movement are altered by intervening plans of different types, the Unicon analytical plans will be able to obtain estimates of policy effects that are reasonably free of the contamination of extraneous factors. Many specific aspects of the analysis have yet to be worked out, but none of them are unusual. The Unicon researchers are experienced, knowledgeable, and skilled. In summary, this is perhaps the most important research activity that the Commission could undertake. (KH)",

This paper discusses whether the current or proposed reforms and strategies are meeting, or can meet, the needs and potential of Hispanic youth. It is divided into three parts. Part 1 provides a demographic rationale for paying greater attention to the education problems of Hispanic youth and describes four types of Hispanic students in terms of school performance and other factors. Part 2 focuses on educational policy developments in the five States visited by the NCSSH--those with the largest Hispanic populations. Following a discussion of the status, origin and drawbacks of different  kinds of reforms, this part offers a focused examination of the effects of the different reforms on the different types of students introduced in Part 1. Part 3 discusses the inadequacy of current reforms and offers suggestions for changes beyond the ones that already have been implied. Not until a school has an orderly climate and the beginning of a school culture of concern for everyone can the school faculty begin to raise academic standards and expectations of students.

Gary Orfield, member of the project's advisory group, had charged that the study was too narrowly focused, ignoring the concern for the effects of desegregation on black and Hispanic children; however, it is pointed out that the shortcomings of the study to which Orfield pointed were due mainly to budget constraints and considerations for a manageable scope rather than a lack of concern. Preceding a historical review of the project are responses to Orfield's major accusations, point by point. Based on a careful  examination of Orfield's charges and the facts gathered relating to these charges, it is concluded that Orfield made accusations without foundation and was involved in questionable conduct. Appended to the memo are a letter from Clarence M. Pendleton, Chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and a statement by Professor Peter Mieszkowski, study evaluator, both defending Unicon's competence to conduct the study. (ETS)",

The first discusses the historical shifts in reform efforts to address, alternately, &quot;relevance&quot; and &quot;excellence.&quot; It finds that high school students are now more bored and apathetic than committed to excellence, but they stay in school for instrumental reasons: to get better jobs, to get into college, etc. The second section focuses on students' reasons for withdrawing from school, common characteristics of dropouts, and the consequences of dropping out. School attitude is the major reason cited for leaving school, and students most likely to drop out are: Hispanic and black, from families with low socioeconomic status or where the father is  absent, and often from families who have frequently moved from one school to another. High school dropouts are far less likely than graduates to attend postsecondary school or to be employed. The third section describes several programs offered by California school districts which have some expectation of influencing the decisions of youth to stay in school. These include continuation high schools, work experience programs, and independent study programs. The fourth section analyzes survey data to assess the effects of retention programs in students' decisions. The final section summarizes conclusions and offers recommendations which emphasize giving students a choice of commitments that demand active involvement and effort.

        "description":"Following a brief discussion of the policies which have led to the focus on magnet schools as tools for both school improvement and desegregation, this paper brings together existing research in order to answer the following question: what is the best design for magnet schools to be the most effective for desegregation? Magnet schools have only a limited effect due to the small population which they serve; consequently, they must be part of a larger desegregation strategy. The current challenge for many urban schools will be to develop strategies to attract whites to historically black schools. Usually school features such as an image of excellence, a special curriculum, a charismatic principal, a good faculty, and an attractive facility draw white students. A high rate of  community participation, comprehensive plans, clear-cut standards and definite timetables also enhance the possibility for effective desegregation. Creating and sustaining good race relations requires: (1) arrangements that minimize the visibility of low achievement and reward individual effort; (2) a faculty that emphasizes student social relations; and (3) structures that foster interracial contact by school staff and generate collective planning. Desegregation through any method is not merely a planning issue, but requires daily decisions which can either promote or prevent integration.

        "description":"The increasing number of black students in private schools has been stimulated partly by concern about the adequacy of the public schools; a desire by parents for greater choice about, and control over, their children's schooling; and a desire to find schools with values similar to their own. Private school efforts to draw minority students have also contributed to this shift. Contrary to the commonly held view that only middle class black families choose private schools for their children, a 1980 census shows that 100,000 black students from families living in poverty attend private schools, which is only slightly less than the number of all blacks enrolled in private schools. Furthermore, a growing percentage of minority students pay full tuition. Several major studies of the  1980s indicate higher standardized achievement test scores of black students in private schools than those in public schools; however, a variety of other factors, particularly socioeconomic status, limit the comparability of data. The qualilty of education varies, although factors such as the level of teacher training, years of teaching experience, and the materials available appear to decrease as the number of black students increase. The level of desegregation appears to be decreasing in private schools: the number of black teachers has not increased with minority enrollments and many inner city private schools are becoming increasingly segregated (predominantly black).

The following trends and issues in school programs and practices specifically related to urban and minority education are examined: urban responses to the reform commission reports; urban and minority students and private schooling; effective schooling programs; curricular issues related to urban, minority, and poor students; compensatory education programs; school violence; dropout programs and practices; school-corporate alliances; parent participation in schooling; and programs related to new immigrants. The four  equity concerns which are highlighted include: desegregation effects, magnet schooling, bilingual education, and sex equity. There are small encouraging signs that the schools are educating urban students better than they did a decade ago: dropout rates for all groups but Hispanics are down; standardized achievement test scores have risen slightly; and efforts to help parent participation in schooling through at-home teaching have enhanced the educational process. Yet many special needs of urban students go unmet, including such basic needs as housing, nutrition, and health care. (ETS)",

        "description":"To study the social and economic conditions where black farmers live, 342 southern counties, each having at least 25 black farmers, were identified. The counties were divided into five categories, four of which reflected the most common commodity type of black-operated farm and one which did not exhibit any common black-operated farm type. Most black farmers, it was found, live in slowly growing counties where nonfarm employment opportunities are limited. Social and economic conditions of blacks varied considerably among the regions, but blacks always lagged behind whites. Poverty rates among blacks ranged from 56.3 percent in the Delta Crop region (parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi) to 36.3 percent in the Atlantic Tobacco region (parts of North Carolina, South Carolina,  Virginia). Unemployment among black adults ranged from 15.1 percent in the Delta Crop region to 8.9 percent in the East Texas Beef region (parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas). Growth in jobs between 1970 and 1980 ranged from 4.4 percent in the Delta Crop region to 29.9 percent in the East Texas Beef region. The findings suggest that many black farm families would be better off financially if they left agriculture. Most black-operated farms are very small and cannot provide enough income to adequately support a family. More policies are needed which encourage economic growth in depressed rural areas for those who decide to leave farming. More education and job training in these areas could also help. (KH)",

Chapter 3 presents demographic information of the families who came to the CHP. It contrasts the families in mediation with those who are not. Chapter 4 describes the legal process called Children in Need of Services, and the typical approaches and strategies judges use in handling these cases. Chapter 5 describes the mediation process, and Chapter 6 outlines the issues in mediation and compares the process to court and counseling. Chapter 7 presents the  families' view of mediation: their estimates of its effectiveness and its impact on communication and family functioning. Chapter 8 describes the characteristics of the mediators, their motivations, their perceptions of the families, and their understanding of the process. Chapter 9 compares the process by which the court and the CHP handle these cases and assesses mediation's impact on court caseloads. Chapter 10 compares the CHP with the role and work of the Children's Panels in Scotland. Chapter 11 summarizes the report and points out the implications for juvenile justice, social welfare policy, and the theory of mediation.

        "description":"This study attempts to determine the degree of economic self-sufficiency achieved by Southeast Asian refugees who have arrived in the United States since October 1978. Three groups of refugees (Vietnamese, Chinese from Vietnam, and lowland Lao) were interviewed in five sites across the country. The two particular aspects of economic self-sufficiency which were investigated were: (1) whether the household had anyone within it receiving public cash assistance, and (2) how the total income of the household (including assistance and earnings) compared to the official poverty level. Factors influencing economic self-sufficiency include household composition, multi-wage earner strategies, and English proficiency upon arrival in the U.S. While the refugees may have been industrious and  able to secure jobs which have moved them steadily out of poverty, the jobs held are primarily low in socioeconomic status and predominantly in peripheral rather than core sector employment. Consequently, 12 percent of the households living on earned income are impoverished. Furthermore, the economic improvement has been due to multiple-job strategies and not because individuals advanced or secured better paying jobs. While the refugees may have been successful in making ends meet, the relationship between this rapid achievement of immediate self-sufficiency and the maintenance of long-term self-sufficiency remains to be seen.

        "description":"This paper addresses the important but relatively understudied problem of immigrants' use of transfer payments. First it documents differentials in the propensity of natives and immigrants to receive public assistance income using 1980 census data. Descriptive tabulations revealed considerable differences between Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in poverty rates, household income, and public assistance usage. Overall, immigrants were found to have only a slightly higher aggregate rate of public assistance recipiency than natives. Multivariate logistic regression analyses, however, revealed that immigrants were, other things equal, considerably less likely than natives to become welfare dependents. Also, except for Vietnam era Indochinese refugees, allegations that recent  immigrants use welfare at higher rates than earlier arrivals were unsupported. Findings therefore challenge the popular notion that immigrants prefer welfare to work, and that an amnesty program, such as that proposed in the Simpson legislation, will spawn a rush for public assistance benefits. The findings that low education and limited English skills increase the probability of receiving income transfers suggest that investment in resettlement programs which emphasize improving the employability of new immigrants would help reduce the extent and level of welfare benefits paid to immigrants. Appendices include descriptive tabulations regarding public assistance recipients. (Author/ETS)",

        "description":"This paper investigates the influence of racial and ethnic composition of labor markets on earnings inequality among Black, Hispanic, Asian, and white men to determine whether the influence of minority regional concentration on earnings differs by educational level. Consistent with other studies, this analysis, based on the 1980 Public Use Microdata Samples, produced negative additive effects of such concentration on the earnings in 1979 of nonwhite and Hispanic men. Results showed that minority workers lose financially from the labor market concentration of other nonwhites, whereas whites benefit, no matter what the educational level. This finding suggests that both competition and discrimination operate to economically differentiate workers along racial and ethnic lines.  Furthermore, educational level widened rather than narrowed white-nonwhite earnings differences. As expected, whites benefit most from the presence of a large minority work force, while blacks lose the most. However, results with respect to Hispanics and Asians are somewhat ambiguous. This suggests that their distinction from whites is based largely on ethnicity rather than race and further implies that Asians and Hispanics, but not blacks, may eventually reach socioeconomic parity with whites as they advance in their cultural assimilation.

The second section includes 1984-85 data, based on monthly reports submitted by high school guidance departments, on dropouts' age, sex, ethnicity, reason for leaving school, and current status. The third section analyzes patterns and reasons for dropping out in a small sample of 1984-85 dropouts. It draws on findings from an in-depth study of the dropouts' cumulative records and focuses on achievement, absenteeism, retention, and teachers' comments. Finally, the fourth section presents 1984  comprehensive tests of basic skills (CTBS) scores of those students scoring in the bottom quartile, the population considered most likely to drop out. In summary, it is said that dropouts usually show problems at a relatively early age. Thus, intervention efforts--such as remedial assistance--should be offered early, before students find it too difficult to catch up. An appendix describes four model dropout intervention programs.

Chapter 1 describes the author's reasons for conducting research in Atlanta and how she acquired contacts for reaching the specific population during the fieldwork stage (which occurred between September 1969 and July 1970). Chapter 2 discusses the research site and sample (a neighborhood consisting of 71 males and 91 females, with average household income of slightly over $25,000). The methods used for collecting private and public data are also described. Chapter 3 presents an overview of Negro residential patterns in Atlanta from 1860 to 1983, and analyzes their impact on public school mixing. Chapter 4 focuses on church activities within Atlanta's  black subsociety. It compares the functions of two churches, several social organizations, and the Coordinating Council of Northwest Clubs, and relates them to the adaptation of blacks in society. Chapter 5 discusses social interactions within one neighborhood (called &quot;Golden Towers&quot;). Chapter 6 focuses on life within homes. Findings on home styles and furnishings, and their relationship to family life, are reported. Chapter 7 deals with the function of food patterns and ritual in Golden Towers. Chapter 8 assesses marital roles in the neighborhood, and Chapter 9 focuses on the interrelationships of parents and children, stepparents and stepchildren, siblings, and grandparents and grandchildren. Finally, Chapter 10 provides a general interpretation of the fieldwork. A six-page bibliography  concludes the document. (KH)",

The study also found that more people experience &quot;less severe&quot; harassment (such as sexual comments) than &quot;more severe&quot; harassment (such as sexual assault). About 19 percent of the workers said they had been sexually harassed as  state civil service employees; about 89 percent of these employees were women. Only about half of the workers surveyed were aware of a sexual harassment policy and only half knew that their department had a discrimination complaint process. Although most workers believed that their departments would care about them and enforce policies if they were harassed at work and filed a complaint, they thought the process would not be very swift and were not completely sure that they would not suffer retaliation. The study concluded that the majority of state employees had not been harassed and had a very positive attitude toward their employer; those workers who were harassed, however, tended to be left without adequate information and support.

Included among these are whether or not to automate at all, the effects of automation on employees, requirements imposed by automation on the physical environment, effects of automation on the total organization, and effects on clientele. The reasons behind the success or failure of a computerized office system are many. Some key reasons are the following: failure of top management to back the concept and provide leadership, infighting and questions over turf and control, workers who fear job loss and workers who reject the new technology, incompetence in planning and implementing the system, lack of justification for the system, and failure to apply positive managerial skills. To be successful in  implementing office automation, management must base any decision to automate on need, resolve the effects of automation on employees, revise the existing physical environment of the office, study and come to terms with the effects of automation on the total organization, and address the effects of office automation on the office clientele.

        "description":"This study describes and assesses the early years of implementation of Title II-A of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) in regard to its services to women. Title II of JTPA is the major Federal program intervention--funded at about 1.8 billion dollars annually--aimed at providing employment and training services for the economically disadvantaged. For this study, data were gathered through the review of the records of a sample of 25 JTPA sites. The study found that the emphasis on high placement/low cost performance has generally operated as a disincentive to targeting services on particular groups of clients, particularly those that might require supportive services or a combination of training services. In addition, the severely reduced allocation of Federal resources to  employment and training services over the past five years has lessened the inclination of program administrators to focus local JTPA programs on specific issues or groups of eligibles; thus, services for women specified in the legislation have not received high priority in the implementation. Specially tailored programming for women was limited to a very small percentage of training dollars. Hard-to-serve target groups such as displaced homemakers and teenaged parents were only very rarely offered special services. However, other research projects have shown that projects offered to women, especially to disadvantaged groups and welfare recipients, have been quite successful in raising women's earnings. Such programs should be used as examples in determining the future thrust of JTPA's  programs for women. (KC)",

        "description":"The demonstration project described in this report was designed to explore the value of job clubs in preparing two-year college students with disabilities for the transition from school to work. The demonstration sites were Chicago City-Wide College (CCC), Columbus Technical Institute (CTI) (Ohio), and the Community Colleges of Rhode Island (CCRI) (Warwick, Rhode Island). National Center for Research in Vocational Education staff began the project by providing necessary resource materials, basic activity guidelines for the job clubs, an orientation meeting for the directors of the offices of disabled student services at the sites, and ongoing support. Project evaluation was conducted through monthly reports, final reports, site visits, and a final meeting. A total of 74 students  with disabilities were served by the three sites. The job clubs at CTI and CCRI served students with a diverse array of disabilities, while the CCC job club served students with developmental disabilities. Because of the nature of the problems of its enrollees, CCC had the least success in helping students to find employment. CTI placed more emphasis on job development than the other two sites. At CTI, 10 of the 13 members completing the job club found employment, while at CCRI, 11 of 20 completers found work. CCRI's job club more closely resembled a typical job club than did the other two; i.e., CCRI did not give unusual emphasis to direct placement or personal counseling. Results of pre- and posttests suggest that students who completed the job club activities learned considerably more  about job-seeking skills and the world of work than they had when they entered the job club. The study concluded that job clubs for students with disabilities appear to be a practical, effective solution to the transition problems of these students. (KC)",

        "description":"A study examined the various laws and practices in six states regarding nonmonetary eligibility for state unemployment insurance programs and assessed the effects of these laws and policies on the states' ability to identify and reject unemployment insurance claimants who fail to meet the requirements. Eligibility for unemployment insurance in all six states was based on two sets of criteria: initial monetary and nonmonetary qualification requirements (which are based on previous employment) and continuing eligibility conditions (which are exhibited through continuing attachment to the labor market). The ability of a given state to deny benefits to ineligible claimants was found to depend on the effectiveness with which the state detects determination issues rather than on the  consistency with which its determinations lead to denials. Two important practices contribute to high determination rates. The first is initiation of the determination process on the basis of information from several actors, and the second is an insistence upon obtaining simple factual information from employers on the reason for separation. The severity of penalties affects administrative behavior during the determination process as well as the behavior of potential claimants. Also important are comprehensive and detailed written policies. A broad view should be taken of the types of information that justify inquiry, and the information available to the adjudicator responsible for decision making should be maximized. (MN)",

        "description":"The place and importance of implementation in the life cycle of Army training programs is frequently misunderstood. Typically, a program's life cycle is thought of as research, development, and use. If implementation is thought of at all, it is regarded as an event, not a process. Many worthwhile programs have failed because the implementation process was neglected. Implementation should be regarded as a high-risk period in a program's life cycle. The implementation stage must be viewed as an organizational research and development stage in which the user decides where a program fits into the organization's priorities and the developer and user work together to plot a mutual accommodation of the program to the organization and the organization to the program. Planning for  implementation of a training program involves deciding what actions are required to field, sustain, and support the program; what agencies should have responsibility for these actions; and how the cooperation of these agencies can be obtained. The analysis-of-fit model that has been developed to facilitate the accommodation process calls for fidelity and sufficiency evaluations to discover changes that are required in the following aspects of training program implementation: organizational arrangements, individual know-how, organizational rules, and individual commitment. The second phase of the model includes the following strategies for accomplishing the program's prerequisite goals: assistance, education, power, and persuasion. (MN)",

        "description":"The Configurational Theory of Innovation Diffusion, Planned Change, and Development, or the CLER model, can be an effective tool for planning change events such as those involved in developing or improving a vocational education program. The C in the CLER model stands for configurations and configurational relationships among and between the social entities involved in any dissemination event, and the L stands for linkages within and between the various configurations. The E stands for the environment(s) surrounding the configurations constituting the planner (innovator) system and the client (adopter) system. Finally, the R stands for resources available to the planner system to promote the dissemination and to the client system for incorporation of the innovation being  disseminated. The concepts of configuration mapping and linkage typing are both a part of the structural theory of this model. The CLER model recognizes four configurations: individuals; groups; institutions or organizations; and cultures, subcultures, and communities. Configuration mapping is the process of establishing the boundaries for the planner system and the adopter system involved in a change episode, and linkage is the mutual stance between innovators and adopters who are able to receive or reject information and/or influence each other. Configuration mapping and linkage typing can and have been used together in several developed and developing nations to facilitate development, delivery, and improvement of vocational programs.

The first country reported on is Ethiopia, where signs of a capitalist society were evident in that officially Marxist country, where literacy education was still a priority in the midst of a waning famine. Ethiopia had conducted continuous &quot;campaigns for literacy&quot; that had succeeded despite lack of resources. Next, the planning for a literacy broadcasting system to provide radio support to literacy in Malawi is described. In India, political corruption and official neglect make the progress of literacy education doubtful. However, literacy may come to be inevitable, though the progress is slow. A workshop in Kenya showed that literacy education was  progressing slowly, serving 350,000 adults in about 1,300 centers that year (80 percent being women), but that official support from the highest government levels seemed to be waning. Finally, adult literacy programs in several areas of Tanzania are described. The report concludes that literacy is a basic need and a powerful force that will inevitably come to all peoples because it is innately desired by all. (KC)",

        "description":"A first step toward thinking about job design issues involves consideration of three questions. They are (1) what kinds of changes occur when electronic tools are adopted in the workplace?, (2) whose jobs change and how?, and (3) who plays a role in job design? Answers can be drawn from data and observations from two Rand Corporation studies concerning the implementation of information technology in the workplace. Managers report moderate or major changes in 72 percent of the work groups who acquire electronic tools. Managers frequently mention changes in performance standards and job titles and descriptions. Generally, clerical jobs are upgraded and given titles reflecting new job responsibilities. Few changes are found in professional jobs despite drastic changes in how a job  is done. Managers play the most important role in redesigning clerical jobs. In contrast, professional jobs are redesigned by the individual involved. Reasons for these patterns are that not all organizations accept responsibility for employee adaptation to technological change; due to the unionization of many clerical jobs, formal changes are more likely to occur in clerical than professional jobs; managers manage clerical and professional workers differently; and managers often have a narrow view of the technology.

        "description":"Three studies compared the characteristics, preparation, and job satisfaction of male and female vocational agriculture teachers. The first was a national survey of teacher educators and administrators from 64 institutions (of 79 originally contacted) that prepare high school agriculture teachers. The other two studies examined the entire population of California high school vocational agriculture teachers who received their credentials between 1975 and 1984. Despite the drastic decline in the number of graduates from credential programs over the past 10 years, the percentage placed in high school teaching programs has remained fairly stable. Women have a consistently lower placement rate than men despite women's slightly higher availability. The placement problems of women  varied with the region of the country. Although the California men were more likely than women to use their credentials, men and women were not significantly different in such areas as length of tenure, likelihood to switch schools or quit, or ability to handle a single-person department. Women still experience incidences of discrimination and generally have more difficulty in finding jobs and attaining acceptance as vocational agriculture teachers than do their male counterparts. A high percentage of credential recipients never teach high school, and many quit teaching fairly quickly. For those persons that remain in teaching, however, the level of satisfaction is quite high.

        "description":"This study established a cost-benefit analysis model for use by local school practitioners to assist in efforts to determine the economic outcomes of their vocational education programs. The model, the components of which were costs, process, and benefits, was established with the assistance of a panel of experts that included a local school administrator. Once established, the model was implemented within a local school division using programs from four different vocational service areas. The costs were determined by using school records for the previous year and prorated according to use by vocational education. Components of costs were personnel, building, equipment, materials and supplies, administration, travel, services, utilities, and maintenance. The process was the  actual conduct of the programs. The benefits were determined by the income from graduates' salary, income earned from cooperative placement of students, and income from the provision of services by the program to the public. The findings from use of the model indicate that three of the four vocational programs had positive economic outcomes. The panel of experts determined that the model was both usable and transportable. The researchers recommended the use of the model to assist local school practitioners in determining economic outcomes and making decisions based upon such outcomes in vocational education.

        "description":"Recently, various national commissions have expressed concerns about the failure of the nation's schools to develop in students appropriate levels of competence in science and technology. As a complement to the school system, the 4-H program can be an asset for improving children's academic performance. In fact, such 4-H programs can be a second chance for students to learn more about science and technology. 4-H is the largest informal youth education program in the United States, with approximately 5 million members. Designing and implementing 4-H programs to be responsive to the needs of academic education would seem to be very appropriate to the mission of Extension 4-H. Extension 4-H programs embody the practical application of land-grant university knowledge by participants.  From this base, 4-H programs can be developed to complement academic education. Many state 4-H programs are considering efforts to offer more science and technology programs. 4-H could also provide more summer programs in science and technology in out-of-school environments. Increasing the science and technology content of 4-H will give an impetus to academic education while contribution to the credibility, prestige, and public support of the state Cooperative Extension Services.

        "description":"Publications have been one of the primary delivery methods used by the Cooperative Extension Service. However, concerns have been expressed by Extension administrators about such problems as lack of new publications to address emerging demands, low supplies of useful publications, overproduced and/or outdated publications, inadequate budgets, and publications that are printed for the wrong reasons. To address some of these concerns at the program management and administrative level, a model for publication review is proposed. The model suggests the criteria for publication review by the program area, level of organization, and the subject-matter discipline. The model suggests that target audiences, duplication, and usefulness need to be reviewed at both the program and the  discipline level of the organization. Factors to be considered in publication review include program priorities, cost, adequate supplies, target audience, duplication, usefulness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness. These review criteria for Extension publications consider the pluralistic nature of Extension programs, characteristics of audiences, budget constraints, and writers' biases. To implement the review criteria, administrators at program level and subject-matter specialists who are developing publications should have guidelines based on them. A review committee should be used to examine Extension publications before they reach the printing process. (KC)",

        "description":"The Extension organization faces a new challenge to develop and maintain partnerships at the local level, bringing together people, programs, and resources. Although the Extension Service already operates under the concept of a partnership between federal, state, and local governments, the federal partner has created a vacuum in this three-way partnership through budget cuts. If Extension is going to attempt to serve the most important needs of the current information society, then the vacuum must be filled by other civic service organizations at the local level. Although partnerships already exist between Extension and other organizations, most of them are short-term and temporary. They often become fragmented after the planning stage. The following conditions are required for  development and maintenance of partnerships in Extension: (1) generate awareness of the importance of working together; (2) develop short- and long-term program partnerships; (3) agree upon goals and objectives of programs; (4) clearly define sources of contributions and responsibility; and (5) share equally in credit or blame. Extension is increasingly being asked to help in the programs of civic service organizations, and with its unique partnership with governments, Extension can undertake a wide variety of partnership efforts to help people to help themselves in attaining a higher quality of life and creating excellence in Extension.

It must blend and interrelate the various areas to provide core competencies, employment skills, and employability skills in a truly integrated and comprehensive educational program. Academic and vocational education must not be placed in conflict with one another; rather, the secondary vocational curriculum should be redesigned in such a way as to allow for the extrapolation of academic competencies from the vocational curriculum. What is needed is an integrated curriculum approach focusing on the development of academic skills in an applied setting. Th regional area vocational school is particularly suited to such a curriculum. Whether offered at a comprehensive  high school or area vocational school, vocational education must place more emphasis on codeveloping programs with local businesses and preparing students for the inevitable retraining that they will need throughout their working lives as the relentless pace of high technology reshapes the labor market every 5 to 10 years. Because vocational education is not a training program but rather an educational program preparing students to set the direction of their own lives and careers, it must integrate the job skills currently sought by employers with sound training in the basic skills, including technological literacy and career development skills.

        "description":"Although disabled students need the same comprehensive assistance in making the transition from school to work as their nondisabled counterparts, most disabled youth, and particulary those with severe disabilities, do not receive adequate assistance in this area. This situation can be remedied by approaching the transition to employment as a process with a clear objective. The process should begin early, be individualized, involve all communication techniques to convince potential students that they could succeed employment goal. The school-to-work transition can be visualized in terms of three bridges, each of which serves a different population. Some disabled students will move into employment without special services, some will need time-limited services, and yet others will  require ongoing services. Because the individuals belonging to the first group are not tied to specific programs, no evaluation statistics exist concerning their long-term adjustment to employment and adult life. The second bridge, temporary services that lead to employment, generally involves a program of coordinated interagency counseling services that include a work experience component. This work experience may be provided according to two models, the train/place and the place/train approaches. Despite research documenting the superiority of the first approach with severely disabled clients, the second model is still the most widely used. The key to the success of the third bridge (transition with ongoing services) is developing combinations of ongoing support linked with local  services. (MN)",

The competencies upon which these modules are based were identified and verified through research as being important to successful vocational teaching at both the secondary and postsecondary levels of instruction. The modules are suitable for the preparation of teachers and other occupational trainers in all occupational areas. This module describes the factors that the teacher must consider when planning for educational resources (i.e., tools, materials, equipment) needed for lessons. It is designed to help teachers acquire the skills necessary to develop a systematic approach to the task of projecting the need for  and acquiring instructional tools, materials, and supplies so that the vocational-technical program will run smoothly and efficiently. The module contains a terminal objective, two enabling objectives, a list of outside resources, and three learning experiences. Each learning experience contains an enabling objective, activities, information, and a self-check with model answers. The final learning experience is an actual teaching situation in which the prospective teacher is to project instructional resource needs and be assessed by a resource person. (KC)",

        "description":"The study described in this report was conducted to identify the barriers and facilitators to establishing a system of linkages between vocational education and apprenticeship programs. Following an extensive review of literature that showed various barriers to linkages and described some facilitating steps, data were collected through an initial open-ended interview and later through a structured questionnaire that was developed from the responses given to interview items. Forty-six people in vocational education and apprenticeship administration were interviewed, and the resultant survey was mailed to a sample of 288 persons--vocational education personnel and administrators, apprenticeship administrators, and apprenticeship instructors. A total of 106 surveys (38 percent) were  returned. The results of the questionnaire contributed information regarding priorities for effecting successful linkage arrangements and suggested efficient, effective, and attainable mechanisms for addressing potential sources of conflict. Some of the barriers cited by respondents were (1) existing organizational practices and procedures, (2) lack of domain consensus, (3) personnel attitudes and perceptions, and (4) lack of communication and awareness. Steps to address these barriers were suggested by respondents. Their ideas are summarized in a manual on implementation of linkages between vocational education and apprenticeships that was produced by this project. (KC)",

In addition, the manual provides assistance in making important first contacts so that the conditions that facilitate linkage can be maximized. Procedures for determination of the content of the linkage agreement and the development of the process to accomplish the activities also are provided.

Differences existed between the secondary and postsecondary level regarding classroom time spent on identified outcomes. Almost two-thirds of postsecondary programs were devoted to development of technical skills compared to just over one-third of secondary programs. Educators at both levels indicated technical skills should receive less time, thus allowing more time to be spent on all other outcomes. Respondents felt that approximately 20 percent of the time should be spent on basic skills at both levels. At the secondary level, the remaining 50  percent of time would be distributed among affective, occupational survival, job search, and entrepreneurial skills. At the postsecondary level, 30 percent of the time would be spent on these outcomes. Respondents thought area vocational center programs should be similar to community college programs concerning the amount of time spent on outcomes. All outcomes appeared to be appropriate at secondary and postsecondary levels. At the secondary level a more even distribution of time across all outcomes was indicated. At the postsecondary level, focus would be on technical skills. (YLB)",

The literature review yielded a list of 85 information components that was confirmed by the validation survey and enlarged by surveys of principals, counselors, students, and parents. Of the five career information systems presented by vendors, four were rated satisfactory and just passing. It was decided that the state should pursue the  development and utilization of career information delivery systems. No single system should be adopted; however, all systems considered for use should undergo some sort of approval process. Activities such as staff development workshops and printed communications should be developed as soon as possible, and a career information delivery system coordinating office should be created to oversee the coordination and continued improvement of career information systems for vocational students.

        "description":"This paper presents a synthesis of the literature reporting the experiences nationally of alternative schools, particularly in the realm of preventing school dropouts and reaching those who have already left school. Characteristics of alternative schools are described, including structure, reputation, and purposes. The dropout problem is discussed, including dropouts' dislike of school, indicators associated with potential dropouts, and potential dropouts' discipline problems. Characteristics of alternative schools are presented in detail. It is noted that: (1) most alternative schools are located away from the regular high schools; (2) alternative schools' programming attempts to foster academic and social comforts; (3) friendly relationships between students and teachers are  stressed; and (4) experiential learning is emphasized. The effects of alternative schools on potential dropouts are discussed. These effects include success in retaining potential dropouts in school, reduction in truancy, accumulation of high school credits, and improved student attitudes and behavior. Elements of successful alternative schools are presented in these categories: size, choice, autonomy, and varied learning opportunites. The wide variance in these schools' costs is discussed. In conclusion, alternative school-based dropout programs are recommended for their probable success. A select bibliography with 46 entries is included. (ABL)",

        "description":"Recently, research has begun to identify the social cognitive dysfunctions that aggressive children display. Using noninteractive laboratory tasks, aggressive children were found to perceive more hostile intentions from others in ambiguous situations than did nonaggressive children. Research has not investigated if this bias occurs in truly interactive settings. This study hypothesizes that aggressive boys and nonaggresive boys will have differences in their absolute perceptions of their own and their peer partners' aggressiveness, and in their attributions for relative responsibility for aggression in actual social interactions. Aggressive (n=20) and nonaggressive (n=18) boys were selected from fourth and fifth grades at four elementary schools. Aggressive and nonaggressive  behavior was identified by their teachers. Results indicated that aggressive boys did display different attributional processes about perceived aggression than did nonaggressive boys in actual social interactions. Perhaps the most notable finding involved the differential ways, in opposite status pairs, in which aggressive boys attributed relatively greater aggression to their peer partner than to themselves, while nonaggressive boys displayed the opposite pattern by perceiving themselves as being more aggressive than their partners. Aggressive boys' awareness of their own behavior may be enhanced in an intervention by using a role-playing procedure which incorporates their own and peers' behavior. (ABL)",

Lengthy, unstructured interviews were conducted with 12 college students who ranged in age from 18 to 37. Data were gathered on family communication and affection patterns, authority or power relations, coalition formation, cohesiveness and solidarity, and the development of trust and commitment. Several of the subjects had experienced a custody shift, most often occurring because the father sought and won custody. A common reaction to parental divorce was a drawing together of the sibling group. Factors affecting stepsibling relations were: (1) differential treatment by fathers and stepmothers  or by stepfathers and mothers; (2) strained relations between stepsiblings while visiting the second home; and (3) differential treatment of \"own\" children versus stepchildren. Shared experiences, respect, and general liking served as a basis for stepsibling closeness. Subjects' family lives exhibited disruption. Negative feelings were more likely to be directed towards stepparents than toward stepsiblings. (ABL)",

During the last decade, a number of studies have tested the effectiveness of school-based social skill training programs designed to promote positive peer relationships and peer acceptance. Social skills training is a generic label for short-term structured interventions that use instructions and demonstrations, behavioral rehearsal, and performance feedback to teach children specific positive social interaction strategies. Although  this technique has been used successfully for unpopular children, it may also be a beneficial treatment for rejected children who show high levels of aggressive or negative social behavior. Studies have shown that social skills training improves the behavioral characteristics of unpopular or rejected children. (ABL)",

Adolescents' understanding of religion and their commitment to it seem to differ sharply from those of children. It has been proposed that adolescents are likely to change, expand, or abandon their religious beliefs because of parental or peer pressure, cognitive development, or existential anxiety. Early, middle, and late adolescents (N=390) completed a questionnaire assessing family demographics and religious background, beliefs, practices, and experience; existential questioning; and closeness to family and peers. The results indicated that parents' religiousness was positively related to all aspects of adolescent religiousness, but there  was little evidence of peer influence on religiousness. Existential questioning was positively associated with beliefs and private religious practices, but not with public religious practices or religious experience. Social aspects of religion appeared to be associated with increased commitment, particularly for subjects with close family ties. There were no significant sex differences in any aspect of religious commitment or change. These findings suggest that adolescents who are close to their parents are likely to adhere to the parents' belief system, even in the face of personal doubts. (Author/NB)",

Prevention programs have focused on identifying and serving high-risk groups and on preventive education. A study was conducted to examine issues related to child abuse. Four groups of women were studied. Women (N=10) in group 1 had been court-ordered to counseling for child abuse, or endangerment, and were referred to a women's counseling group. Group 2 women (N=14), also court-ordered to counseling, were referred to a parenting class. Group 3 women (N=11) were voluntary clients in individual counseling. Group 4 women (N=12) received no counseling and served as a control group. All subjects completed a  questionnaire designed to provide a profile of the subjects. Three findings are of particular interest: (1) on questions concerning abuse, there appeared to be a consistent pattern of statistical significance for the women's counseling group, followed in order by the voluntary group, the parenting group, and the control group; (2) some data of clear significance about teenage mothers appeared evident, supporting literature on the negative long-term effects of teenage pregnancy; and (3) the findings support the general literature concerning indicators regarding child abuse.

Counseling and psychotherapy are not different from other types of social interaction in this regard. Counselors influence clients and clients influence counselors. This study investigated the dynamics and patterning of social influence and relational control between a counselor and client across a 12-session counseling case. Counselor and client verbal utterances were coded in terms of their implied relational positions (one-up, one-down, one-across) using Heatherington's (1985) modification of Erickson and Rogers' (1973) relational coding system. A measure of the degree of dependence/contingency between counselor and client responses served as an index of social influence and  relational control. Variations in the degree of contingency between responses were plotted across the 12 sessions and evidenced three distinct phases of the counseling process. Results indicated the vast majority of responses were one-across, responses which minimize or neutralize the relational control aspect of communication. The counselor was shown to be more domineering than the client, though not necessarily dominant. Although this study was based on a single case, it did confirm previous research.

The chronically ill elderly, who absorb an ever-growing proportion of our public and private resources, are of particular concern. This study analyzes findings from a major demonstration and evaluation project which studied the consequences of using incentive payments to change admission and outcome patterns for Medicaid patients in nursing homes. Incentive payments were provided to encourage nursing homes to admit highly dependent Medicaid residents, to improve the nature of nursing home care by setting goals, and to encourage more appropriate discharges by encouraging institutions to provide case management  service. The experiment was carried out in 36 proprietary, Medicaid-certified, skilled nursing homes in San Diego County, California, with a combined Medicaid inpatient census of about 3,600 residents. Homes were divided into control and treatment groups. Incentive payments offered to the treatment group were designed to achieve study objectives. Results of the discharge-incentive payments could not be clearly described in terms of success or failure. A high percentage of those with discharge plans were successfully discharged to a lower level of care. However, the facilities that participated tended to discharge to lower level of care institutional settings. The incentive payment system appeared to result in some facilities finding ways to overcome discharge barriers. (ABL)",

The NMCES obtained information on private insurance policies in force in 1977 from the employers and insurance companies of a nationally representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized population. A brief discussion of the financing of health care through private health insurance and the importance of employer-sponsored plans is included. A detailed description of insurance benefits of the population under age 65 in the United States is provided. Their insurance is characterized in terms of the inclusion of specific health services, the provisions of basic and major medical insurance, and the benefits applicable to expenses for a variety  of health services. The distribution of insurance characteristics is described in general and in relation to group enrollment, employment, and the characteristics of insured persons. The description of private health insurance in the United States incorporates more recent data from other sources to complement the more detailed and comprehensive estimates from NMCES. Eleven summary tables, 75 tables, and 13 figures are included in the text. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Weaknesses are apparent in two very popular informal reading comprehension measures. The Informal Reading Inventory (IRI) tests comprehension through questions only, while the Reading Miscue Inventory (RMI) is too cumbersome for the average classroom instructor to administer. Since both measures offer instructors ways of collecting data, they may effectively be merged into an Informal Reading Assessment Inventory (IRAI), bringing together processes from both inventories. The oral reading component of the IRAI may be used to check learners' reading behaviors, such as recall of material via retelling, language usage, and recoding. The silent reading component allows learners the private opportunity to interact with written material during an uninterrupted period of time and to  present understanding of the material through predetermined criteria in a predetermined manner. The following guidelines are suggested for preparing and administering the IRAI: (1) select several types of materials for oral reading, long enough to elicit at least 25 oral miscues; (2) compute the readability of the selections using at least two formulas; (3) devise criteria for evaluation; (4) prepare a script for miscue coding; (5) have a cassette tape player available; (6) establish rapport with the learner; (7) have the learner read an entire selection aloud, while coding miscues, taping the reading if necessary; (8) have the learner respond to comprehension criteria; and (9) administer the silent reading comprehension measure using selections of 450-500 words.

They cling to the metaphor of mind as machine, an engine built from smaller to increasingly larger parts. To counteract this dangerous, damaging mechanistic metaphor, educators need to develop new metaphors, in particular metaphors that conceptualize reading as a whole-brain process involving interaction and synchronization between the right and left cerebral hemispheres. This metaphor can be supported not merely by inferences from research into the reading process, but by  research on hemispheric and whole brain functioning and, indirectly, by various studies of so-called dyslexia. To promote the more efficient teaching of reading, teachers need to (1) advocate and exemplify in their teaching a holistic approach to reading instruction; (2) investigate techniques and technology for promoting the simultaneous, synchronous use of both brain hemispheres; and (3) capitalize upon the popular interest in hemispheric processing to convey to other educators and to administrators, parents, and the public that reading is a whole brain process.

Four of the 13 books averaged within the sixth grade reading ability level, and 4 required a reading ability level of eighth grade or above.

Results support earlier findings that teachers can be trained to be more explicit in their explanations and that such explicitness is related to improved student awareness of lesson content.

Two different methods for teaching reading were used: (1) a global method using the Houghton Mifflin basal reading program, and (2) a code method using the New Reading System, which emphasizes word decoding skills along with comprehension skills. Core data were collected with children over a three-year period from first through third grade. Measures included reaction times for oral reading of individual words and for judgments of word meanings, comprehension of sentences and passages, coding of errors for sensitivity to context and fidelity to the phonemic code, and subtest scores from achievement tests. Results indicated a relationship between word  recognition efficiency early in learning and reading comprehension performance later on. The two different teaching approaches resulted in substantial qualitative differences in acquisition of word recognition ability. These differences in oral reading disappeared by the end of third grade. The findings do not provide a basis for choosing between code and global methods, but they do suggest that neither method sufficiently develops word recognition efficiency.

        "description":"Defining calibration of comprehension as the correlation between subjective assessments of knowledge gained from reading and performance on an objective test, this paper draws from literature, as well as the findings of original experiments, to examine issues related to the subject . The paper first documents the claim that poor calibration is the rule rather than the exception, and that poor calibration is also typical in at least one other domain, problem solving. It suggests that the high levels of calibration reported in studies on the calibration of probabilities and feeling-of-knowing research may be dependent on using feedback from taking the test to assess the probability of correct performance on the test. The paper next presents two experiments demonstrating that poor  calibration is not associated with a particular type of performance test, but is found with inference tests, verbatim recognition tests, and idea recognition tests. It further shows that poor calibration cannot be attributed to unreliable testing procedures. The paper then offers evidence from three experiments indicating that a likely reason for poor calibration is that subjects assess familiarity with the general domain of a text instead of assessing knowledge gained from a particular text. Next, it demonstrates that calibration of comprehension can be enhanced if subjects are given a pretest that provides self-generated feedback--but that even this ability is limited. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for theories of representation of knowledge  gaining from reading. Sample materials used in the experiments are appended.

A study traced the development of working memory span and examined the relationship between metacognitive knowledge about reading and memory, M-space, and working memory performance in skilled and less-skilled readers. Subjects, 32 second, fourth, and sixth grade children, completed a series of memory and metacognition measures and M-space tasks. Results substantiated a developmental increase in  working memory span performance. The pattern of grade and reader effects found for the span tasks suggests that the trend in working memory performance resulted from an increase in the processing efficiency of mental operations, rather than from an increase in the total processing space. Metacognitive ability was marginally related to working memory performance. (FL)",

Forty-nine children in the second month of first grade were presented a fictional narrative in which were embedded 18 target nouns classified as high-scripted, medium-scripted, or low-scripted. Subjects then viewed pictures of the nouns, viewed both pictures and printed labels of the nouns, or viewed pictures and read and copied the printed labels. They then answered 18 questions, tapping their memories for 6 cued and 12 noncued nouns, immediately after hearing the story and at 2 later times. The results indicated that children's knowledge is well organized in a scripted form. Not only was recall for both cued and noncued high-scripted nouns  significantly greater than recall for medium-scripted and low-scripted nouns in all three sessions, but also recall of the highly scripted noncued nouns did not decline over sessions. The results also demonstrated that experience with a written code does not promote better performance on a memory task. The same procedure was administered to 17 children in their final month of third grade. The results showed no evidence of recall facilitation due to the labeling treatments.

The textbook from a biology course in which all but three of the subjects were enrolled was the source for development of vocabulary and reading exercises used in the study. The microcomputer aspect of the course consisted of (1) training in use of the computer as a learning tool, (2) personalized microcomputer vocabulary development, (3) evaluation of effectiveness of microcomputerized content vocabulary drill programs, and (4) speed reading and comprehension drills. Initial training in the use of the computer appeared to be satisfactory  for success in the class assignments. The subsequent word processing lecture/demonstration proved disappointing--only two of the subjects began immediately to learn to use the word processor, largely due to mid-term demands on student time. The results of the vocabulary development indicated that instruction in the mechanics of operation must occur as closely as possible to the time of actual performance of those mechanics, as those who received the lecture two days earlier required constant monitoring and had several false starts or were found to have typed incorrectly large amounts of text.

Limitations of \"exact match\" curriculum designs in contemporary attempts to provide computerized interaction are surveyed and critiqued, and the importance of drill and practice to the development of language skills is emphasized. It is proposed that open-ended curriculum designs, which are process oriented, may help counter the limitations in developing adequate interactive programs. Finally, research questions in the development of artificial intelligence natural language systems are presented as central to the problem of\"intelligent\" human/computer interaction. The concluding comments assert that computers must be taught to simulate the same cognitive processes as occur in humans if meaningful interaction is to take place. (JD)",

The test, which was given to 25 college juniors and seniors, consisted of 29 regularly spelled pseudo or nonsense words to be pronounced aloud by the subjects. Results indicated that the skilled adult readers in this study scored substantially better than the elementary students tested by Durkin in 1984. Phonics ability improved with increasing grade levels in the Durkin study, and it continued to increase at the college level. The study concluded that phonics skill increases implicitly beyond formal elementary school phonics and reading instruction and that phonics skill is a differentiated function that  increases upward as reading proficiency develops. Furthermore, the results suggest that the performance standards for elementary school children should be lowered to between 50% and 60% because (1) these standards would be more consistent with the average performance of elementary school readers, and (2) excessive classroom drill on synthetic phonics skills to reach unrealistic levels of performance is inconsistent with the development of implicit use of phonics rules that occurs through increased reading of connected texts.

The results indicated the following: (1) stories from all three groups contain attributes of settings, character, and action, although the manner in which these are presented differs; (2) the groups place different emphases on action and  event, with the Vietnamese students appearing more concerned with presenting context for their stories than did the other groups; (3) when a plot is present, the stories show characteristic beginnings and happy endings; (4) the Vietnamese prefer including the events which bring about the telling of the story in the first place; (5) the Arabic students prefer using more detailed description than the other two groups, and (6) the native speaking subjects in both grades showed the same pattern for storytelling--little introductory detail, little digression to attributes of characters or setting, little evidence of reflection on action, and a clear forward movement as the sequence of events occurs.

The paper first explores some of the shortcomings that historians and sociologists share, noting that deviants have been regarded as people at the margins of clearly marked, relatively unchanging societal boundaries, when in fact the lines marking off deviance from conformity are typically fluid. The paper then discusses crises of symbols, in which deviance brings together in a sense of outrage an otherwise diverse community, and illustrates the point by using the crisis of symbols precipitated by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and  other radical Black leaders, and the reconciliation of the crisis achieved by three American news magazines. The rhetorical strategies used to dilute their radicalism and achieve the reconciliation are then explored: contraposing--juxtaposing the subject with opposing symbols; contradistinguishing--contrasting the subject with a counterpart to establish the subject's credentials by calling those of the counterpart into question; consanquinity--manipulating symbols to erase symbolically the distinctions between two figures; reincorporation--the gradual absorption into the mainstream of once radical leaders or institutions; and conversion--depiction of deviants who return to the fold. The paper concludes by noting that media depictions of deviance serve to reaffirm American society as  constituted. Thirty-four footnotes are appended. (HTH)",

Two international problems have blocked the widespread establishment of DBS systems: that of international broadcasting via DBS and that of access to the &quot;geosynchronous orbits&quot; (GSO). While the UN became bogged down in the free flow of information vs. the national sovereignty question and Unesco began to concentrate on the New World Information Order issue, the ITU moved ahead with  the formulation of DBS regulation based on technical parameters. The history of efforts to formulate international DBS regulations suggests several implications for the regulatory environment, specifically that (1) future success will depend on the willingness of nations to cooperate and compromise; (2) Western countries are likely to stay in ITU; (3) as long as strictly technical problems and issues exist, the ITU will continue to be the forum in which further DBS regulations are created; and (4) technological advances and economic developments will complicate the creation of further DBS regulations.

For example, &quot;MS&quot; magazine directs its communication to feminist readers, and as a part of this, regularly reprints advertisements and news clipping taken from mainstream media in its &quot;No Comment&quot; section. This section provides opportunities for &quot;oppositional decoding,&quot; or the ability of a reader to understand the intended meaning of discourse, but to decode the message in a contrary way. Examples of media selections that might be found in the &quot;No Comment&quot; section are those that treat women in terms of their husband, regard women as unimportant to their husbands, exploit pictures of women, use sexual entendres or puns to sell goods and services, suggest that women enjoy sexual violence or abuse,  illustrate male dominance, stereotype differences between boys and girls or men and women, depict women as stupid, recommend that women improve their bodies to attract or keep men, portray women as men's property, or mock, challenge, or condemn feminism. The consistent oppositional decoding of these images of women and of the relationship of women and men helps to maintain the social practices and structure of feminism, but does not necessarily change either the encoding or decoding process taking place within mainstream ideology. Perhaps changing major ideological systems cannot occur without access and commitment to an alternative, oppositional definition of reality, and alternative publications of specific cultural groups offer ways in which oppositional thinking may be taught and  learned.

        "author":["Wicks, Robert H."],
        "description":"Schema theory may be significant in determining if and how news audiences process information. For any given news topic, people have from none to many schemata (cognitive structures that represent organized knowledge about a given concept or type of stimulus abstracted from prior experience) upon which to draw. Models of how schemata are used should illustrate a process, and in the case of news media and information processing, the process may be associated with effective information transmission and retention between the news media and the individuals. A \"data-pool\" model offered by D. A. Norman and D. G. Bobrow traces the process by which schemata are activated, but fails to explain adequately the precise channels through which specific types of information must pass during  information processing. It also cannot be tested adequately for its merit. An 11-stage process model for schema theory developed by R. Axelrod provides for processing of information based on a series of \"yes\" or \"no\" questions. This model has an \"escape valve\" or a means for departure of information without interpretation. The R. Hastie information processing model suggests that people must react to an event in one of two ways: either find an appropriate schema or begin the construction of a new schema. Since research in the area of mass media information processing is relatively new, it seems best to work with a model that can be easily operationalized, moving later to more complex plans. In view of this, the Hastie model offers the greatest utility for mass communications researchers. A  five-page list of references concludes the document. (SRT)",

Responses to inquiries were solicited from state press association managers. Analysis of the responses received, as well as secondary sources, identified current legislation and categorized major elements of state open-meeting law content. Results suggest that it is difficult to draw any generalizations regarding the laws since they vary greatly from state to state; they are constantly being updated; they are qualified by court decisions and attorneys' general opinions; and they are affected by other legislation and state constitutional requirements. In theory the laws have been designed to facilitate access; in  practice there often has been a disparity between the intent and application of open-meeting laws. Although progress has been made toward the establishment of effective open-meeting legislation, there is much to be accomplished. Further study in both behavioral and legal research on topics concerning freedom of information is needed. (DF)",

While a truly integrated English department would put equal emphasis upon composition, language, literature, and reading, two-year college curricula have emphasized composition and challenged literature's place. A reader-based model for teaching literary texts decentralizes the lecturer's role while helping the student make observations and inferences within a discourse of knowledge. Problem solving, comprehension, and cultural literacy must be taught within a content area, not as discrete exercises. Scholars argue that teaching writing while confronting literary text would bring together the technical skills of composition, the cultural knowledge within the linguistic form,  and the cultural content literature has to offer. Recent research supports this argument. Sharing first drafts and using summaries as focusing exercises encourage the habit of frequent writing. Literacy depends on specific, finite, sometimes superficial knowledge. There are many reasons to include literature in two-year college curricula so that students, rather than being assigned exercises in writing, can be taught to respond to a unified method of reading and making meaning of what they read.

        "description":"Poetry was used in a college English class to teach figurative language, connotation, denotation, and the need for close attention to vocabulary. However, students were often bored by traditional poetry. Using computer programs like \"Compupoem,\"\"Poetrywriter,\"\"Lifesongs,\" and \"Haikuku,\" students were introduced to computer poetry and created their own poetry. Students' reactions were enthusiastic and they often became more interested in studying the poetry of others. Some other programs that have been or could be used in beginning college English courses are \"The Shakespeare Library,\" which--among other things--provides an on-screen color-coded chart of the interrelationships of characters in any one of the 37 plays, and \"LITterms: A Tutorial for Enjoying Literature,\" which  provides many different ways for students to learn literary terms using colors and graphics. It seems that most students like computers for writing, learn from well-written computer assisted instruction (CAI) lessons, and can be inspired by programs such as \"Poetrywriter\" and \"Compupoem\" to think about and then try to write poetry.

The undergraduates who taught both lessons self-evaluated the pattern book lesson as being more positive and effective than the lesson using a traditionally structured book. The student teachers' preference for the pattern book was the result of positive reactions from  the children in terms of creativity and independence in easily writing their own pattern stories. The pattern stories written by the primary children reflected more creative and critical thinking in terms of story development than the stories they wrote in a traditional format.

Subjects, 28 English language arts teachers, were invited to participate in a 5-week summer writing workshop, for which they received university credit and stipends. Participants were screened on the basis of exemplary teaching, writing ability, and interpersonal skills, and completed the Writing Apprehension Test at the beginning of the project. Teachers were required to produce six writing assignments, three of which were presented in an ambiguous manner, and three of which were presented unambiguously. Immediately following the submission of each paper, the teachers completed a 12-statement attitude scale to  measure apprehension on the previously submitted writing assignment. Results showed that ambiguity affected low apprehensive writers slightly more than it did high apprehensive writers. In addition, apprehension tended to remain more constant across modes of discourse with high apprehensive writers than with low apprehensive writers. Finally, practice seemed to have no measurable effect on levels of apprehension. (DF)",

These are further subdivided into 18 specific skills, which are generally presented to teachers as a single intervention, or comprehensive training program, which usually takes four days, spaced two to five weeks from preceding and subsequent training days. During the time between training days participating teachers collected data on the effectiveness of the various techniques by recording their  perceptions of changes in student behavior, which they then used to make informed decisions as to which techniques worked or did not work well for them. These data were used for the evaluation. Subjects for the evaluation were 77 students drawn from four sites where the thinking skills program was pilot tested: a large suburban school district, a small rural school district, a large rural district, and a single elementary school. For one site, the trainer used protocol analysis to analyze the information obtained from student interviews. The results indicated that all 18 of the skills involved in the program produced measurable effects in student behavior. (Results for each of the 18 skills are included.) (HTH)",

The information also helps the instructor to devise peer groups composed of students with complementary composing styles.

        "description":"Basic writers often experience difficulties when trying to articulate ideas in writing that are more specific, systematic, and fully developed than their speech. The writers must learn how to put their thinking into the appropriate forms and expressions necessary to address an academic audience. Noting that the natural working of the human mind seems to develop ideas in traditional rhetorical modes, such as definition, classification, comparison, and cause-and-effect, F. D'angelo has presented a systematic list of 10 overlapping static and progressive logical patterns of arrangement. When students want to develop an idea in one of these patterns, they need to consider how to organize their information and to choose expressions and grammatical forms that relate to the parts of the  patterns or networks. M. A. K. Halliday and R. Hasan have suggested a valuable system of terms that express relationships between sentences. Cohesion requires understanding the relationships of ideas and also mastering grammar and punctuation, especially punctuation of complete sentences. In explaining his system for identifying cues to intellectual processes, L. O'Dell discusses focus, classification, change, and temporal and logical sequence. (A chart entitled &quot;Development by Cohesion, Structure, and Content,&quot; derived from the ideas of the above authors and designed to structure systematically the forms and expressions that constitute the appropriate content of a basic writing class, is included.)

Subjects completed achievement tests, cognitive processing tasks, and a computerized spelling test, which consisted of 30 words selected on the basis of familiarity and predictability. After hearing each word orally and used in a sentence, subjects spelled the word on the computer, then rated their familiarity with the word and perceived spelling of the word. Scores on the spelling tests were  analyzed as a function of spelling ability, general cognitive processing, and more global spelling factors. Low versus high ability group analyses did not demonstrate differences in general cognitive processing. Group analyses did, however, reveal differences in patterns of correct spelling and phonetic errors as a function of word familiarity and predictability. Regression analyses also revealed that correct spelling by high ability spellers was best predicted by variables measuring use of phonetic and sequential segmentation strategies. Correct spelling by low ability spellers was best represented by memory for whole words and for letter sequences. (HTH)",

A writer using a computer and a pool of heuristic applications has available a range of strategies appropriate to both different rhetorical situations and to various moments within the writing process. The computer can help the writer to become more aware of options by prompting with a series of randomly selected heuristics, allowing the teacher to intervene earlier and more effectively in the writing process than is typically the case. An assignment programmed into the computer enables the  writer to begin the heuristic activity immediately and the teacher to be present, influencing how student writers first represent the writing problem to themselves. The computer allows teachers to offer a variety of heuristic strategies and to be present to the writer at the time when most needed--during the composing process itself.

        "description":"A study compared the effects of two writing tasks (short answer exercises and analytic essay writing) with no writing on high school students' understanding of concepts from prose passages. Baseline data on typical patterns of instruction and students' approaches to writing were obtained using observation and case studies in two history classes, one with advanced students, the other with average ability students. Once the sense of context had been established, 22 students from both classes participated in a structured study that included reading history textbook passages and completing writing tasks related to information in the passages, or doing no writing at all. Several learning measures were used, including a measure of concept knowledge. Results from the observational stage  indicated that the teachers' intention of implementing writing as learning was co-opted by an academic approach that required certainty and correctness. This approach overlooked students' need to explore new ideas more tentatively, especially for the average ability students. Results from the experimental stage revealed a significant interaction effect for class and writing task at the level of organization of the knowledge measures, with the average ability students imposing more organization on their passage knowledge with essay writing than the advanced ability class.

The first chapter describes the tasks and evaluation criteria used in the study and highlights results of the study, including the following: (1) although many students appeared to know the basic elements of analytic writing, such writing was difficult for students in all grades; (2) while most students could express their points of view in persuasive writing, many had difficulty providing evidence for those viewpoints; (3) students had less difficulty with  tasks requiring short responses based on personal experience; (4) students found it moderately difficult to write well-developed stories; (5) home environment is related to writing achievement; (6) students who indicated writing three or more reports and essays during a 6-week period had higher achievement levels than students who reported not writing during that time period; (7) students' positive attitudes toward writing deteriorate steadily across the grades; (8) students reported that their teachers are more likely to mark mistakes than to show an interest in what they write or to make suggestions for the next paper; and (9) content area writing increases between grades four and eight, and decreases again in senior high school. The next four chapters provide specific achievement data  by grade level for informative, persuasive, and imaginative writing, and for writing performance among various demographic subgroups. The remaining three chapters focus on students' responses to questions concerning writing and writing instruction, specifically, their values and attitudes toward writing, how they manage the writing process, and what they write and the help they receive.

        "description":"A series of studies were conducted to develop a communication openness measure (COM) based on the concept of openness as specific message sending and receiving behaviors. A model of communication behaviors was first developed, consisting of three parts--who communicates to whom, how, and about what? Based on the model, two forms of a 120-item questionnaire were constructed. The first asked whether each of the 120 behaviors was characteristic of open communication, the second asked if they were characteristic of closed behavior. Both forms of the questionnaire were completed by 141 members of the Industrial Communication Council, and by 292 students in a freshman communication course. Analysis resulted in the identification of 48 open communication behaviors and 7 closed  behaviors. The subsequent COM contained 55 Likert type items, which field testing then reduced to 19. This 19-item COM was then completed by 495 nurses, and further analysis reduced the instrument to 13 items. The final COM was shown to have excellent reliability and adequate validity. The process of developing this instrument suggested the following conclusions: (1) communication openness is a central variable in organizational communication; (2) open communication behaviors involve asking for information, listening to information, and acting on information; (3) given the nature of open communication behaviors, subordinates are generally open to their superiors; (4) open communication is a vehicle for handling nonroutine and negative information; and (5) open communication is not  synonymous with disclosure, and is a receiver-oriented concept rather than a sender-oriented one.

Students need this instruction most at the beginning of their higher educational career, for these skills will be necessary throughout and beyond their college education. Although many basic course textbooks offer little or no assistance to the student reader trying to do research in an academic library, many libraries have orientation programs suitable for students in basic courses. For example, students at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst are provided with practice in library usage by an instructing team that includes both faculty members and library personnel.  Orientation begins with an introduction to the building and its services. Instruction includes a brief description of the Library of Congress classification scheme, and exercises using the \"Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature,\"\"Social Sciences Index,\" the card catalog, and encyclopedias. Students also write annotated bibliographies. This library instruction has proven valuable to many of the students, who become more confident of their ability to find and use information in the library. (SRT)",

Following an introduction that distinguishes between relatively simple problems and those that are more complex, the paper first discusses techniques for managing group processes for complex problem-solving, including the complexity of the problem, the communication among the participants in the problem-solving, and the resources available to the group. Next, the paper identifies necessary components of group facilitation for complex problem-solving, including definite control of group  process; problem identification preceding generation of alternatives; and use of tested, behaviorally and technically balanced group methodologies. The paper then analyzes five variables in the interactive management process, including computer hardware, software, and peripheral equipment and a specially designed room. The paper concludes by noting that this program, built around the three components of effective problem resolution of intelligence, design, and choice, is a logical method of solving complex problems.

        "description":"Scientific researchers traditionally have held that the use of data represents a test of hypotheses or theories. Social psychologist William McGuire has developed a contrary position, arguing that instead of testing hypotheses and theories, research merely specifies their limitations, generality, and assumptions. McGuire's contextualism suggests that all hypotheses and theories, even contradictory ones, are both true and false in different situations. Such an approach implies a partial resolution to the empirical/humanistic debate over mass media effects research. As an empiricist, McGuire maintains that data are needed to evaluate theory; as a humanist, he holds that data do not represent the only source of knowledge. Mass media researchers have long used strategies consistent  with contextualism, and it does not necessarily imply numerous and dramatic changes in methods of those who have recognized the transitional and processual nature of mass communication. It does suggest relatively profound changes in the interpretations researchers place on empirical evidence, however. Because of the complexity of social phenomena, time and space often will limit the applicability of research findings. Therefore, researchers of media effects should exercise caution in the answers they offer to questions of applied social importance. A 7-page reference list is appended. (FL)",

It has achieved this status largely because several key assumptions have not been challenged or assessed empirically. These assumptions are that CA (1) is a pervasive social phenomenon, (2) affects external outcomes of communication, (3) is a scientifically useful construct, and (4) is caused by apprehension about communicating. To assess these assumptions, an alternative construct, evaluation apprehension (EA), has been explicated, operationalized, and contrasted with CA. Defined as a learned predisposition about how the threat of evaluation is managed in social interaction, EA was examined in a series of six studies involving college students. The  studies revealed that EA predicted more variance than CA in a variety of criterion variables, including communication performance, student success, self-esteem, classroom proxemics, occupational preference, and rewards for communication. The results suggest that EA is more likely to be the true causal agent in stress reactions to communicating than CA. References, tables and figures are appended. (FL)",

Those who read an unrepresentative news story about a single European or South American nation made less accurate judgments  about an average characteristic of all countries in either region than did control participants who read no story.

In conceptualizing the relationship between social structure and human agency, critical theorists have attempted to walk a fine line between structural determinism and individualistic voluntarism by developing ideas such as the &quot;duality of structure&quot; or the &quot;double articulation of social structure and human agency.&quot; While these ideas are theoretically appealing, their empirical applications are not easily made. A review of the literature reveals the ways various authors have theorized the relationship between structure and agency, including structuralism, individualism,  structuration, and critical structuralism. These theories, however, have created problems for organizational communication research, including conceptual difficulties related to multilevel analysis and practical methodological problems that arise when researchers attempt to move from the level of theory to the level of research and action. The literature proposes several strategies for dealing with these problems, among them the use of (1) ideal types, (2) abstraction, and (3) a focus on the extremes of conditions.

        "description":"A study focused on the effect of assigned social decision rule on the process and product of mock jury deliberations. Subjects, 360 college students, were randomly assigned to six-member juries under three decision rule conditions: unanimity, five-sixths majority, and two-thirds majority. After viewing a videotape of a criminal trial, each subject completed a predeliberation questionnaire about the arguments advanced by the prosecution and defense during the trial. They then deliberated until the assigned social decision rule was reached. Following deliberation, each subject completed a postdeliberation questionnaire about the prosecution and defense arguments generated during the deliberations. Results showed significant differences in the amount of time spent in deliberation by  the three assigned conditions, with the more strict decision rules requiring the greatest time in deliberation. Decision rules also affected juror verdict preferences, with the five-sixths majority juries showing preferences for less severe verdicts. The findings are consistent with the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Burch v. Louisiana,&quot; which disallowed less than unanimous decisions in small juries. References and materials used in the study are appended. These include the pre- and post-deliberation questionnaires, pre- and post-deliberation decision forms; instructions to jurors under all three decision rules, and eight data tables. (FL)",

The purpose was to compare the findings with those of an earlier study with prospective teachers. Subjects were 541 elementary and secondary school teachers, each with two or more years of teaching experience. All subjects completed a packet of survey instruments that elicited demographic information as well as teacher use of specific behavior alteration techniques. They were then given four student misbehavior scenarios reflecting (1) common discipline problems, (2) both active and passive misbehavior types, and (3) moderate to severe  misbehavior intensity. Results showed that experienced teachers used a greater frequency and diversity of behavior alteration techniques than did the prospective teachers in the earlier study. In addition, unlike the prospective teachers, experienced teachers' reports of strategy use were, in part, a function of misbehavior type, teacher gender, and grade taught.

        "description":"This 3-year project aimed to improve delivery of support and instructional services among 33 West Virginia county school districts in implementing special education mandates. The participating school districts are within the service area of West Virginia University. The introduction details each year's objectives. &quot;Year one&quot; pursued needs assessment and pilot training; &quot;year two&quot; involved workshop training; and &quot;year three&quot; provided followup and dissemination. Section 1 discusses inservice training for development of administrative teams. Needs assessment analyses determined problem areas among districts in providing effective special education services. Section 2 discusses administrative challenges and gives examples of workshop materials and procedures, including the use of  role-playing. Administrative topics are as follows: (1) communication and coordination; (2) planning and budgeting; and (3) facilities, transportation, and equipment. Section 3 details inservice processes of two sessions for members to identify individual county needs in planning development. County consultants facilitated communication and acted as resources for technical assistance and evaluation. Figures present data on consultants' procedures and inservice members' participation. An analysis considers project effectiveness. Workshop evaluation forms and lists of teams are included. One result brought about by the involvement of district personnel in planning is that increased responsibilities and involvement should promote positive attitudes toward programs and cooperation throughout  district organization. Districts and the university continue to cooperate. Districts in West Virginia have exceeded special education compliance in striving for quality. Needs assessment instruments, 10 pages of references, and a list of 13 audiovisual resources are appended. (CJH)",

        "description":"Changing student demographics, legislation improving standards and access, and increasing community expectations are creating instability in the nation's education system. Also, public confidence in schools' effectiveness has eroded. This treatise draws on sociology, corporate studies, and effective schools research to understand how education systems operate in a nonrational world. After contrasting decision-making processes in two fictitious school districts representing rational and nonrational organizational models, the study advances the latter as a more accurate and logical interpretation of reality. Two chapters further refine nonrationality in terms of decentralized goals, power, decision-making, external environment, and teaching process. Later chapters examine school  organizational culture, strategic planning, empowerment, and leadership applications. The final two chapters apply nonrational theory to schools, showing how efficacy and integrity can be restored to schools in an era of change. The analysis shows that school organization need not be based on outmoded, centralized procedures that don't work. Instead, a school's central mission can accommodate multiple and competing goals, compromise, an open-ended power structure, a volatile environment, a wide range of teaching methods, and tenuously connected policies and classroom procedures.

        "description":"The education reform movement has inspired an impressive array of school improvement programs. This article categorizes these intitiatives, summarizes policy directions, explores recent state curriculum guidelines and Northwest trends, and discusses implementation challenges. According to an Education Commission of the States study, most initiatives focus on the classroom as the unit of change, require districts and schools to establish clear academic goals, and involve collections of student data to measure progress. The 50-state study also notes trends such as major reforms and funding increases in California and Florida and a focus in other states on decentralization, database research, curriculum alignment, basic skills, and business and political involvement. Guidelines  differ, but most states are moving toward establishing detailed, skills-oriented, common learning curricula on which to base standards. Northwest and Pacific states' efforts echo these trends; information is given for Oregon, Alaska, Hawaii, Washington, Idaho, and Montana. Success of school improvement efforts will depend on how effectively state, district, and school levels work together and on interactions among policy, management, and service areas at each level. Raising curriculum standards may have both positive and negative effects on students. Along with higher achievement levels, schools might be facing increased numbers of droputs, more stratification, and less student choice. Included are 3 figures and 16 references. (MLH)",

This article summarizes five recent studies examining the practices and qualities comprising good instructional leadership. A Seattle study by Richard L. Andrews disclosed a statistical correlation between student gains in reading and mathematics and teachers' perceptions of their principal's effectiveness--especially in schools with many low-income students. Phillip Hallinger and Joseph Murphy found that a community's socioeconomic status heavily affected the behavior of effective instructional leaders and their choice of management style. In San Francisco, David C. Dwyer found that proficient instructional leaders act on personal beliefs and  values, as well as perceptions of their schools' and communities' needs. In Texas, William Rutherford and his associates studied the principal's impact on teachers' instructional improvement efforts. The most successful principals clearly communicated expectations, provided technical assistance, and monitored the results. Finally, Thomas Bird and Judith Warren Little showed that effective instructional leadership means cultivating and sustaining norms of civility, collegiality, and continuous improvement. A summary of each study is provided, together with full bibliographic and availability information. (MLH)",

The first phase, overcoming psychological resistance to the program, had three components: convincing staff, designing a plan ensuring staff control of events, and developing a climate to foster openness, trust, and risk-taking. To lessen teachers' fears, the district's five-year goal was announced as &quot;instructional improvement,&quot; not staff development. The second component involved creating groups to work on curriculum issues and send representatives to meet with the superintendent. As part of the climate-setting component, teacher and student forums were established, and administrators became responsible for modeling appropriate leadership qualities.  The second staff development phase used a product approach; teacher groups worked to develop a 5-year timeline for text selection and preparation of curriculum guides, lesson plans, and other materials. The school benefited from increased staff interaction, improved textbook evaluation, and enhanced subject area expertise. The third phase, a process approach, concerned improving teachers' instructional abilities and interpersonal skills. An inservice program involving negotiated personal growth contracts, released time, and tuition reimbursement was developed. The result has been improved student achievement and higher teacher morale. Appendices include a teacher questionnaire and statements on professional growth, curriculum development, and teacher tuition payment. (MLH)",

        "description":"In response to accountability pressures over the past several years, a body of research attempting to identify characteristics of effective schools has developed. Efforts to improve school climate or evaluate teachers solely according to &quot;effective school&quot; characteristics may be misguided. One problem is that school effectiveness may be the result of productive student achievment, not the cause. (A similar misinterpretation of student achievement/self-concept correlates occurred in the 1960s.) Second, educational outcomes should properly be focused on the real school worker, the student. Also, the evaluation process is time-consuming and a compromise at best. This article proposes matching a given situation with one of four supervisory styles: clinical supervision, cooperative  professional development, self-directed development, or administrative monitoring. Each style is applicable to one of four categories of teachers: the unfocused worker, the motivated but inexperienced teacher, the &quot;jaded&quot; teacher, and the competent teacher. Situational supervision, based on student achievement levels, takes into account not just the person supervised, but the task assigned. The process is consistent with the situational leadership concept developed by Kenneth Blanchard. Included are four references. (MLH)",

        "description":"Raymond Callahan's superintendent vulnerability thesis suggests that school superintendent behavior is subject to the political winds of local school boards, in turn dominated by the economic values of American businessmen. This thesis inspired a body of research termed &quot;dissatisfaction theory,&quot; which describes the sequence of events resulting in school board incumbent defeat and superintendent turnover. The Robertsdale School District ethnographic study of three years in a district's political life portrays a community's increasing discontent with its public schools, board, and superintendent. It describes citizens' frustration at being unrepresented and unheard and focuses on the campaign of a challenger who unseats an incumbent board member, eventually becomes board president,  and &quot;eases out&quot; the old superintendent. After illustrating the dissatisfaction theory model, this article evaluates numerous verification studies and offers conclusions and recommendations. The theory's most practical application is alerting beleaguered superintendents to potential causes of dissatisfaction. School officials and their boards need to be aware of socioeconomic changes and accompanying value shifts in their community that impact public education policy. The board must avoid elitism and heed special interest groups to prevent the recurrence of a disruptive, vicious cycle. Included are 1 figure and 33 references. (MLH)",

Prior to this announcement, Ontario had operated since the 1800s under a system that provided for the public funding of a dual system of Protestant and Catholic public elementary schools and a single system of nondenominational secondary schools. Since the majority of Ontario's residents were non-Catholic, this arrangement developed into a system of essentially nondenominational public elementary and secondary schools supplemented by alternative public, Catholic elementary schools and a scattering of private schools of various types. This system of alternatives is now being extended into secondary education. The change raises a number of legal and constitutional questions,  however. This paper reviews the historical factors behind the creation and development of Ontario's public school system, examines the constitutional issues raised in relation to Canada's Constitution Act of 1867 and the recently adopted Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, presents the findings of the Commission on Private Schools in Ontario (created when the decision to fund Catholic high schools was announced), discusses recent court decisions relevant to the issues, and suggests possible ways in which the debate may be resolved.

Chapter 3 reviews sets of teacher variables that three major research studies have associated with effective teaching. One of these sets of process variables is examined in  greater detail in chapter 4, with particular reference to middle school instruction. The fifth chapter proposes a four-step method of self-assessment for teachers, involving self-diagnosis by teachers; feedback from supervisors, students, and colleagues; the formulation of recommendations for change; and implementation of the changes.

The most successful students are those whose parents become actively engaged in the educational process at home and at school. To capitalize on potential parent involvement, principals need to understand the kinds of contributions parents want to make; become familiar with parents' availability, interests, knowledge, and skills; and develop a collaborative, nurturing environment that breaks down traditional barriers. A 1980 Southwest Educational Development Laboratory study launched a 6-year survey of over 4,000 educators and 3,000 parents in six states. Results suggest that elementary school principals support the general idea of parental participation,  but are less sanguine about its breadth and scope; most favor traditional parental roles (participating in open house functions, serving as school chaperones, and so forth). Principals were less supportive of parental assistance with governance and decision-making functions. Survey results analysis led to developing several instruments linking parent involvement with school improvement strategy and a set of recommendations for principals. Improving parent involvement is directly related to principals' attitudes and sincerity, the range of involvement opportunities, and the type of school environment. (MLH)",

The five steps are as follows: (1) to identify the problems toward which reforms are directed, (2) to identify the policies designed to address each problem, (3) to identify assumptions about the problems and the proposed solutions, (4) to review what is known about the problems and proposed policies, and (5) to identify other ways of looking at the problems and policies. The booklet illustrates the application of the five-step method by showing how it can be used to review school reform in general as well as more specific reform policies aimed at student testing, salary structures, and administrative training programs. The five-step method is advocated as one  aspect of a larger policy analysis process that could involve development of a policy analysis group with a carefully selected chairperson, research to obtain all relevant information, and adaptation of the five-step method to local needs. Among the issues policymakers will be facing in the near future are parental choice, the uses of electronic technology, the provision of educational services for dropouts and preschool children, and the relationship between education and economic development.

        "description":"Educators participating in school improvement efforts are likely to follow one of three paths toward implementation of changes, and the most successful projects cut across all three, according to two recent studies. The three processes parallel the three perspectives adopted in research on innovation: technical, emphasizing a rational approach to improving job effectiveness; political, highlighting the power relations involved in altering behavior; and cultural, stressing the norms and values shared by practitioners and the symbolic meanings attached to change efforts. Researchers conducted a 3-year, longitudinal study of 14 elementary and secondary schools undergoing curriculum changes and a 1-year study of three \"good\" high schools trying to become better. This research report  presents in chart form a model of a causal network that depicts the forces at work in schools implementing changes and shows how the three perspectives on innovation interact. The report then discusses the three typical pathways toward innovation and refers to the network model to explain the causal factors at work in each pathway. The report concludes that: (1) antecedent conditions significantly affect project success; and (2) the provision of encouragement and assistance and the alteration of rules and procedures are critical during the process of implementation.

These key elements and their sequencing and linkages form a general implementation structure that schools can adopt for their own implementation efforts. The research used a case study approach to analyze data from 10 states and about 40 schools between 1983 and 1985. The study sought to identify effective state school improvement  strategies, the conditions under which state strategies work effectively at the local level, and the methods by which effective strategies work. The effects of the state environment, the local environment, the state program, the local program, and program outcomes were examined. The state programs studied involved both instructional improvement programs and schoolwide improvement programs. This report reviews state and local environmental factors affecting success, then identifies influential variables at four stages of the implementation process: initiation, initial implementation, complete implementation, and institutionalization. The causal network in all four stages is presented in diagram form. (PGD)",

This report is intended as a resource for facilitating liaison mechanisms between the two sectors.

Debates center around states' responsibilities and parents' rights; courts have not provided clear legal guidance on philosophical questions. State regulations are questioned with the growth of home instruction and Christian schools. These legitimate conflicts of interest require resolution with minimal confrontation if students' needs are to be served. Section 2 recommends  four state liaison mechanisms: a liaison office; a coalition of private schools; private school representation on advisory committees; and working relationships in districts. On the national level, \"Koffee Klatches\" further dialog, and partnership activities have developed locally.

        "description":"As part of a foundation for a multilevel analysis of career ladder reform among educational employees in Utah, this paper focuses on policymaking from the state perspective. Career ladder policy decisions are determined primarily through state legislative action, which are executed by the state board of education. This paper describes policy decisions, examines processes through which decisions emerge, and discusses implications of the state's capacity to influence the development of career ladder programs. Data were acquired from legislative and agency documents, interest group files, and from 7 informal and 42 indepth interviews with legislators, legislative staff, executive staff, agency officials, and interest group representatives. In Utah, career ladder decisionmaking is  characterized by politicalization. Competing goals elicit conflict; for example, whether to break the lockstep salary schedule or to protect it. The impetus for career ladder enactment comes largely from the governor and legislators. Interest groups primarily exercise constraints on rules. Substantial delegated local capacities mitigate the impact of centralized mandates. Utah's policy commitment to the analysis of local district variance expresses confidence in districts' capacity to devise effective programs and enables the state to exert power in the evolution of career ladder reform. Four pages of references are appended. (CJH)",

The failure of scientific discipline to develop conclusively effective theories in many social fields, including supervision, suggests that the technical rational view of knowledge may not be capable of delivering answers to moral, ethical, political, and other complex questions. A more effective source of knowledge may lie in intuition and reflection on practical experience. This kind of knowledge is more closely associated with artistic than with scientific understanding. A new form of supervision called \"dialectical supervision\" jettisons the traditional dominant,  hierarchical, and instrumentalist approach to supervision in favor of an approach that stresses dialog, mutual effort toward common goals, acceptance of alternative strategies and interpretations, and a sharing of professional responsibility and power.

By eliminating the power of the nonteaching supervisor to prescribe procedures for improving teaching, clinical supervision places responsibility and authority for instructional improvement in the hands of the practicing teacher. This transfer of power also results in a shift away from reliance on outside, nonteaching experts for improvement strategies and toward reliance on teachers' collaborative analysis of what is successful in their own practice. Thus empowered, teachers can no longer blame others for the failure of improvements that they  themselves may not have implemented effectively. Instead, they are impelled to move beyond rote behavior to a full analysis of their own methods, a conceptualization of the reasons that those methods work or fail to work, and an effort to develop or find techniques for enhancing their own instructional processes. Implementing processes like clinical supervision may encourage development of the democratic conditions under which such processes might best thrive. Forty-nine references are cited. (PGD)",

In general, the findings suggested that for SBCD to be a viable process the school must have a unique ethos and a distinct school philosophy and must also have the power to maintain pedagogic and economic autonomy. This report achieves the following: (1) cites the goals of the study (including obtaining the information noted above, developing a naturalistic model, and discerning possible contributions of SBCD to the educational system at large); (2) reviews the literature; (3) discusses the study methodology and findings; and (4) compares the findings with established theory. Fifteen references, two figures, and a table are provided. (PGD)",

        "description":"The parents of 746 children enrolled in grades from kindergarten through high school in 1985 were interviewed in a national study designed to identify factors affecting parent involvement in schools and education-related activities. Three kinds of parent involvement were measured: (1) willingness to visit the child's school three or more times during a year, or personalistic involvement; (2) active participation in a parent-teacher association, or supportive involvement; and (3) attentiveness to local school issues, or policy-oriented involvement. A logit analysis was conducted for each of these three types of involvement to develop three models of parental participation. The models revealed that the parent's gender was the strongest predictor of participation in all three cases,  that the parent's educational level was a strong predictor of policy-oriented involvement, and that the child's grade level was a strong predictor of personalistic and supportive involvement. The demands placed on parents' time did not appear to affect the impact of gender on participation. Parents of younger children proved more child-oriented; this factor affecting participation appeared unrelated to gender or to parents' educational levels. The study suggests that parental involvement is a multidimensional construct that deserves further examination. (PGD)",

        "description":"Confronted by complex and divisive issues and by groups seeking participation in policymaking, the Salt Lake City Board of Education adopted a shared governance policy in the middle 1970's. The policy mandated creation of two related councils at each school site. The School Improvement Council (SIC) consisted of the principal and specified school personnel; the School Community Council (SCC) incorporated the SIC and added parent-teacher association officers and other nominated parents. These councils had authority to make school level decisions by consensus within legal and district policy limits. To determine the effects of these councils, researchers used a comparative case study design to analyze council operations at four elementary, two intermediate, and two high schools.  Interviews, surveys, and a review of documents provided data. This report presents the findings, dealing with the following topics: (1) the character, roles, and attitudes of council participants; (2) the scope and salience of the issues addressed and the emphasis given to the budget, personnel matters, program goals, and program evaluation; (3) the dynamics of council agenda-setting, conflict management, and response selection; and (4) the effects of council actions on school policy, school operations, educator-patron relationships, and individual council members.

Policymakers, in their talk, in their choices of symbols and metaphors, in their choices of strategies for dealing with conflict, reveal their own needs, their role orientations, their group affiliations, and their assumptions about how the decisionmaking process should occur. This paper draws on research conducted by the Alternate State Policy Mechanism (ASPM) study, which used common interviewing protocols and methods with people in comparable positions in six different state policy systems. Using data showing the relative influence rankings of a wide range of policy actors (including lobbyists and bureaucrats), this paper  focuses on the words of policymakers--their modes of expression and obfuscation--as well as their rituals, assumptions about appropriate behavior, and sanctioning systems as a means of understanding power and policy systems at the state level. The paper also identifies the commonalities and significant differences displayed in the relative rankings of influence of policy groups in the different states. The data collection instrument used in the survey findings for each state and four pages of references are appended. (IW)",

In five of these districts, selected for their diversity on a number of variables (state, region, size, labor history, contract, and union affiliation), documents were analyzed, offices and schools visited, and interviews conducted with 187 teachers, principals, union leaders, and central office administrators. The analysis of contract contents suggests that (1) collective bargaining agreements are neither as comprehensive nor prescriptive as some might believe; (2) much contract language about staffing specifies the prerogatives of management; (3) in some cases,  contract language increased the standards of staffing beyond those prescribed by state law; (4) seniority was less prominent than expected; and (5) principals' rights to manage the staffing of their schools were not clearly defined by contract. Studying reform in the five sample districts revealed that districts with a history of cooperative relationships dealt more successfully with initiatives for change. Proposals more likely to be adopted were those with local origins and support for more time for instruction, more stability for schools, and more instructional autonomy for teachers. (MLF)",

Transition planning for the college bound learning disabled student needs to include the design of a relevant high school curriculum based on the requisite entry level skills that have been identified as important for success in college settings. At the same time, curriculum referenced assessment procedures that focus on these skills need to be developed and implemented in order to link assessment results with instructional planning. Student progress with the curriculum or individualized education program (IEP) designed from the assessments must also be monitored and  further adapted to the student's individual needs, if necessary. The curriculum or IEP must also be evaluated to determine followup needs for the student's successful transition to college. (Author/CB)",

        "description":"Many learning disabled secondary school students have difficulties with text organization in both subject area reading and expository writing. Problems may include difficulty in following the main ideas in text, recognizing the main text topics and their interrelationships, or recognizing the subordinate and superordinate ideas and examples. Often, recall ability is poor and writing skills are inadequate. Several concepts derived from current theories and research in text processing can provide a guide for the improvement of instruction in both reading and writing for learning disabled secondary school students. The microstructure model of text comprehension allows students to transform sentences into their underlying microstructure propositions which express the surface  structure information of the passage. Research on the skills involved in summarizing a text has shown that an important aspect of text processing involves the ability to identify main topics of the text and their interrelatedness. Another line of research has emphasized the central role of topic structure processing in reading and writing. Text structure or organization has been found to have a major role in the recognition and recall of main ideas in text. Research has also indicated that the recognition and use of objective textual cues to the relevant information in a text contributes to the identification of the important ideas and their interrelatedness. Instructional programs based on these concepts have the potential for improving both the comprehension and recall of expository  material and the quality of expository writing for learning disabled secondary students, thus enhancing their opportunities for success in academic settings.

Study objectives were to determine: (1) educational and residential consequences of deinstitutionalization; (2) the stability of community placements; (3) the direction of movement (to more or less restrictive environments) of the deinstitutionalization; and (4) the impact of federal and state special education policies on deinstitutionalized children. Study methods included interviews with parents and the community in which the children were based, review of clinical records, and case studies. Information was collected on characteristics of the children and their families, residential  placement outcomes, education service outcomes, and the effects of community placement on families. A major conclusion was that deinstitutionalization of children has been enough of a success to justify its full continuation, but that the broader goal of full social integration or &quot;communitization&quot; has not been fully achieved. Social policy recommendations included the following: develop state-wide management information systems for previously institutionalized individuals; create mechanisms to help families make informed decisions; support policies aimed at the prevention of institutionalization; create incentives and enforce policies that encourage increased social integration in educational and residential settings; and create multiple approaches to the support of families of  deinstitutionalized children.

LAMP consists of 100 developmental lessons for young students with learning disabilities or language problems. The lessons are included in this document and contain sequential exercises on the following five levels: (1) sequencing letter and alphabet symbols; (2) common action words; (3) initial consonant patterns; (4) complex word patterns; and (5) rhymes and jingles. The exercises are based on the rationale that the acquisition of linguistic auditory memory patterns are intrinsic components of the reading process. The LAMP exercises first require the student to listen  carefully and make kinesthetic contact with the symbol sequences to be learned. Through repeated systematic rhythmic imitation, finger tracing and verbalization, the student begins to feel and acquire the pattern. Then copying, writing, visualization, and chalk board activities are gradually introduced to reinforce learning and retention. The manual suggests that these LAMP exercises should at first be used to supplement the total program, and, as students progress, that other activities be introduced to supplement the LAMP exercises. Two appendices contain instructions for a set of alphabet card exercises (with card samples), and a list of supplementary resource materials. Forty-five references are also provided. (CB)",

Both of these women experienced special education classes throughout their educational careers. Gender issues in the special education classroom, peer influence and relationships, and teacher student relationships were among areas covered in the interviews. A major difference between the two subjects was that one went to a school which was only for children with disabilities, while the other subject started school the year that Public Law 94-142 (Education for All Handicapped Children Act) was implemented. Both subjects felt that school did not prepare them  for the real world; both were still struggling to adjust to the work world and to find appropriate employment. Study results suggest the importance of interaction of the disabled with nonhandicapped peers and point out the lack of strong role models for handicapped females. It is concluded that career opportunities, vocational experiences, and training should begin early and continue throughout the high school years and that parents, school personnel, and disabled consumers of services should work together to transition the student to the adult world of work or further education.

        "description":"Developmental dyslexia is a specific learning disability characterized by difficulty in learning to read. Some dyslexics also may have difficulty learning to write, to spell, and to speak or work with numbers. Some researchers estimate that as many as 15 percent of American students may be classified as dyslexic. Children with dyslexia are not all alike--the only trait they share is that they read at levels significantly lower than is typical for children of their age and intelligence. Most experts agree that a number of factors probably work in combination to produce this disorder; possible causes of dyslexia may be grouped under three broad categories: educational, psychological, and biological. Educational causes may include teaching methods, the nature of the English  language, and interpretation of intelligence tests. The usual treatment for dyslexic students is to modify teaching methods and the educational environment based on the specific learning problems of the individual dyslexic student. The prognosis for dyslexic students is mixed because there is a wide diversity of symptoms and degrees of severity. However, it is clear that an effective remedial program is very crucial and that early diagnosis and treatment are essential. (CB)",

The introduction notes the value the dramatic arts can have for students, suggests that special education often focuses primarily on the student's inabilities rather than abilities, and notes that career and job-seeking skills can be learned through drama. Three major program steps are included. The section on Program Step 1, &quot;Theatre Games,&quot; offers teachers guidance for leading specific group games, body warm-ups, activities to get in touch with one's senses, and games with partners. The next program step is &quot;Teaching Dramatic Structure through Short Skits&quot; with suggestions for choosing a skit script, introducing the script, directing a short script,  teaching character and plot analysis, preparing for performance jitters, and directing longer multiple scene scripts. The final program step is &quot;Improvisation.&quot; This step covers the dramatic structure used in improvisations, suggested non-verbal and verbal improvisation exercises, inventing improvisations, and using improvisation to develop social skills for daily living. Two final sections cover playwriting and script development and program planning tips. Appendices contain brief essays by teachers using the program, a student essay, and a sample improvised script on the subject of job finding. (DB)",

Sample scoring sheets for both individuals and group recordkeeping are provided. In the translation phase the assessment information is analyzed to identify the method by which the child learns most effectively and the skills which the child is ready to master. This information is shared with the  parents and incorporated into the individualized education program (IEP). The final step is utilization of the VPAS, with instruction geared toward the meeting of weekly objectives. The VPAS scoring system can be used with many disciplines and other assessment instruments.

The sample was evaluated for LD using selected learning-based measures. Two separate scales were used to classify emotional disorder. Classification of LD according to perceptual, visual-motor, achievement, and intelligence discrepancies (irrespective of emotional disorder) discriminated among three groups of children: those with no learning difficulties, those with learning problems, and those with learning disabilities. Emotional variables were unable to distinguish the LD groups, and learning variables were unable to distinguish the groups according to  level of emotional disturbance. Among conclusions reached were the following: (1) There is little support for a strong linear relationship between LD and ED; (2) The notion that LD children will have a greater degree of emotional difficulties than their non-LD counterparts is not supported by the data; (3) The notion that learning problems (as distinct from learning disabilities) occur in higher numbers among ED children is not disputed. Independent diagnosis and multiple intervention strategies are recommended. The continuing use of exclusionary and hierarchical classifications with reference to emotional disorder in the diagnosis of learning disability appears to be unwarranted. (JW)",

It is argued that they occur as prepositional phrases that are obligatorily incorporated into the verb in a specific way. The constructions containing indirect objects are examined in the framework of relational grammar, with the claim that they occur in simple clauses and in clauses with Benefactive-3 Advancement, 2-3 Retreat (personal and impersonal), and (impersonal) Inversion. It is noted that 3-chomeurs, which sometimes occur, are markedly different from final indirect objects. It is also concluded that all of these claims are novel for Mazatec, and that such constructions have never before been posited  for any Otomanguean language. (Author/MSE)",

Learners should acquire basic inquiry skills very early in their second-language career, premitting their active movement deeper into the language and permitting them to ask a native speaker what is being discussed, where things are, how to get needed objects, and how to find out what they should or should not say in a given context. In this case, communicative competence is a  realistic objective because strong student motivation already exists. Learning activities leading to inquiry skills should be carefully sequenced from the outset, moving from mechanical learning to free communication through mechanical drills, meaningful drills, communicative drills, and communicative interaction and developing cognition, perception, abstraction, and interaction capabilities. It is possible to provide a wide variety of activities for practice in relatively natural pseudo-communication in class. Sample activities and a four-page bibliography are included. (MSE)",

The selection of texts appropriate for beginning students involves examination of the texts themselves and consideration of the students' linguistic and cultural preparation for confronting them, including exposure to a number of the structures and much of the vocabulary, and possession of a \"script\" to help them make intelligent guesses about what they do not know. In addition, the activities in which the texts will be used should be carefully planned. One way to do this is to analyze and organize activities according to the number of productive demands they make.  Tasks with few production demands include multiple-choice, fill-ins, true-false, cloze, and matching and arranging sentences in sequence. Tasks with many productive demands include open-ended questions, true-false statements in which the false statement must be changed to reflect the truth, and oral and written summaries. Level I and II texts can be treated in a purely receptive way and used very early in language instruction, and the same texts can and should be used later for more demanding comprehension activities and then for production.

An important means of encouraging good writing is the provision of good readers during the composition stage. A Swedish undergraduate course in English as a second language uses peer readers during the prewriting and revision stages. During prewriting, peer group work is used for brainstorming for ideas and for selecting, grouping, and organizing the ideas to make an outline. During revision of the first draft, peers respond helpfully to the ideas, presentation, and language in each other's essays. A survey found that most students reacted favorably to the use of peer group interaction, attributing  changes in their own writing to the peer group sessions and providing suggestions to their classmates during those periods. A few felt they had not learned anything from the sessions. The technique encourages the students to resolve common and basic language errors early in the process and among themselves, enabling the teacher to concentrate on style and coherence; moreover, it is a useful practice for students planning to teach.

The decentration hypothesis, which predicts that children who habitually direct their attention to word meaning would concentrate better at analyzing a spoken form without meaning (a pseudo-word) and would perform better on pseudo-words than on existing, structurally similar words, was tested. Results provide strong evidence that an onset-rime distinction is relevant for the process of segmentation, and word meaning seemed to have no influence, suggesting that the decentration hypothesis can be abandoned as an explanation for segmentation difficulties. It is concluded that effects of length and syllabic  boundary can be explained by the disruptive effect of consonant clusters, which are not only difficult to segment by themselves but also adversely affect the processing of segments earlier in the word, and that a simple, strictly serial model for segmentation is not adequate. The results also indicate that an articulatory rather than phonological code is the object of segmentation. (MSE)",

        "author":["Graham, C. Ray"],
        "description":"Research suggests that assimilative motivation is largely responsible for the development of native-like speech in both first and second languages. Analysis of anecdotal evidence of early bilingual development, studies of dialect acquisition, bilingual immersion programs, and studies of language pidginization illustrating the development of assimilative motivation in children shows that this motivation begins to decrease in adolescence in most speakers. This does not assume that learners must be assimilatively motivated in order to develop a high second language proficiency level, because many learners who are instrumentally motivated develop enough second language facility to satisfy communicative language function requirements. However, without assimilative motivation, these  learners are not likely to acquire all the characteristics of native-like speech. If the effects of assimilative motivation are to be understood thoroughly, actual observational studies must be performed on subjects of varying ages placed in diverse second language environments. Only through direct observation of individuals immersed for extended periods of time can the quality and quantity of interaction between second language learners and second language community members be measured.

A greater understanding of these attitudes was sought in studies carried out in Hong Kong. Chinese teachers of EFL participated in a workshop that attempted to retrain teachers' attitudes for the purpose of bringing about a more communicative orientation to the teaching of English. The retraining workshop had teachers interacting face-to-face in small groups, role playing, and participating in persuasion activities. Questionnaire results about the workshop indicated that teacher behavior can be categorized as either transmissive (teacher's role is to evaluate and correct  learners on established criteria) or as interpretive (teachers's role is to help learner shape his own knowledge). Further conclusions pointed out that attitudes will not change by implementing teacher training programs. One possible future remedy to strengthen the EFL curriculum would be to devise a program to accommodate the already existing attitudinal norms. (TR)",

        "description":"A functional-notational syllabus was developed for use in Papua New Guinea because the English language needs and terminal competence of students in that country are more easily identifiable in terms of functional-notional categories than of language structures. The syllabus for grades 7-10 is divided into units or topics of language uses, and each language use is described in terms of its communicative purpose and concepts involved. Whenever possible, language uses are linked to the subject areas where they are used or needed frequently. The most typical forms in which the uses are realized are listed or shown in a model. The topic is broken into specific classroom objectives that are graded from passive identification through discrimination to active production, incorporating  the necessary reading and writing skills. There is no teaching of language structure as such, and structures are taught only as the means of realization of language uses. The syllabus is based on a tentative analysis of the communicative and intellectual needs of an idealized Papua New Guinean school leaver. Problems occurring with the new system include political, bureaucratic, and academic barriers, difficulty in finding appropriate teachers and in training teachers in the functional approach, lack of instructional materials, and mistrust among proponents of conventional teaching methods.

These programs meet some of the  criteria for an artificially intelligent tutoring system in that they (1) are not limited by the need to input a single correct answer, but respond meaningfully to a wide variety of correct and incorrect answers; (2) gain and use information from users by either asking questions or making their own analysis of input; (3) in some cases respond to input in terms of global paragraph meaning, as a human being would; and (4) can help the student evaluate his own writing in a simulated human fashion.

While professionals in English as a second language (ESL) are generally well-informed, they also find their opportunities to influence institutional policy and to contribute to the welfare and development of colleagues, international students, and themselves limited by a number of factors. IEP faculties are often isolated from the operations of the institution, including those related to placement, reporting relationships,  governance, and fiscal and academic responsibility. Institutional non-policy has become a common condition for IEPs, for largely political reasons. External agencies with an interest in accreditation and in international students' and ESL teachers' welfare provide standards and services that IEPs and institutions may take advantage of. As IEPs proliferate in higher education and in private enterprise, an emerging academic and humanistic concern for program governance, quality, integrity, and continuity should be addressed. (MSE)",

Psycholinguistic research has found that reading comprehension is not solely a result of text variables such as sentence complexity and length or vocabulary, but is largely dependent on reader variables, including language competence, and variables in method of testing and experimentation, since comprehension can be measured only indirectly. Much of the research has been psychometric and removed from real-life reading situations, and has not looked at the process of comprehending as distinguished from comprehension, the result. A group of educators in Sweden has taken a phenomenological approach, looking at the learning process and its  outcome instead of comprehending and comprehension. These studies call for a more holistic approach to learning and point to new directions in research on ESL content-area reading, such as examining the context from the student's perspective and comparing the learning processes and outcomes of nonnative readers' work in ESL and the native language. This approach would complement current psychometric experimentation and form a better basis for teaching English for academic purposes. (MSE)",

A successful Title VII program that developed and incorporated computer applications as a major program component within the bilingual teacher training sequence is described. Evaluation data are discussed in the context of the question of how to provide adequate coverage of the full range of competencies needed by bilingual teachers within the time constraints of conventional teacher education programs.

Teachers need to: (1) act on the feedback offered by the learners concerning how much of what they are being told is comprehensible, and (2) use caution in making assumptions about the learners' knowledge of the world, not taking for granted that non-native speakers are less knowledgeable than native speakers but first finding out how much they do know.

The results will allow governing boards to compare: types and levels of compensation in their institutions with those in similar institutions, total compensation levels provided by colleges, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations, and employment policies and practices of peer institutions. Questionnaires were completed by 1,328 two- and four-year colleges, universities, medical schools, and theological seminaries. Findings include: over two-thirds of the institutions hired CEOs from outside of their institutions/systems; 74% of the CEOs were not tenured;  three-quarters of the CEOs surveyed have contractual agreements; and 6% of the CEOs were minorities and 8% were women. Profiles of the participating institutions and the sample of CEOs are provided, along with trend line analyses showing salary levels of CEOs for each type of institution. Data are provided on the use of contracts and performance reviews and the award of tenure for CEOS, as well as various kinds of executive benefits and perquisites.

Three reasons for termination that are legitimate, nondiscriminatory, and acceptable in today's marketplace and courts are: cause (serious misconduct, dishonesty, unethical, or dangerous behavior); job elimination (reduction in force, economic conditions, retrenchment, merger, or shutdown); and poor performance (incompetence, missing key goals, and causing problems with others that drag down total performance of the unit). What to document when terminating an employee and the concept of outplacement (reemployment assistance) are addressed. In addition to considering a proposed severance package for a terminated employee, costs of carrying an unproductive or troublesome employee before  termination are noted, and advice is provided on avoiding complications after termination. Suggestions are offered concerning various aspects of termination, including the planning stage, convincing senior management and boards, communicating with colleagues and staff, and group terminations. Appendices include: an internal memo concerning reorganization and cutbacks, a termination checklist, a sample termination letter, and a statement of reference/rationale. (SW)",

The Bureau of Student Financial Aid introduced new comments into the edit system in 1979 and expanded the pre-established criteria (PEC) used to select students for validation. Study objectives were to assess: the impact of the processing system edits on applicant behavior; the adequacy of the PEC as effective indicators of misreporting; and the impact of validation effort on the correct award of BEOGs. In analyzing the processing system edits, the focus was the frequency and type of corrections to key application items, and the ability of applicants to  quickly meet the demands of the processing system and receive an eligibility determination. To determine the adequacy of PEC as indicators of misreporting, a sample of individuals selected for validation was compared with a randomly-selected sample. In assessing the impact of validation edits, a sample of validation applicants was compared with a similar sample of non-validation applicants. An error-prone model related to the validation system was also developed and compared with the existing PEC. (SW)",

The criteria concern: probationary operation, impact on other colleges, minimum enrollment, considerations of alternatives, cost-benefit analysis, an academic master plan, the ratio of full- to part-time staffing, state general fund support, academic resources of the sponsoring campus, involvement of other campuses, and community support. With two exceptions, it is concluded that the criteria approved by the trustees  provide an effective framework for the evaluation of permanent off-campus centers. When combined with the Commission's criteria, important aspects of a proposal will likely be adequately reviewed.

Trends in financial aid from 1973-1984 to 1984-1985 are addressed, including increases in loans, declines in federal aid, increases in institutional aid, increases in state aid, and revenue differences among institutions. The following state-funded programs are covered: California State Scholarships (Cal Grant A), Graduate Fellowships, the Educational Opportunity Program, California Educational Opportunity Grants (Cal Grant B), Occupational Educational and Training Grants (Cal Grant C), Bilingual Teacher Training  Grants, State University Grants, Board Financial Assistance Program, and Assumption Program of Loans for Education. Also considered are issues concerning institutionally funded aid and graduate student aid. Appendices include: recommendations of the 1980 Student Financial Aid Policy Study Group, recommendations to the legislature in response to Assembly Concurrent Resolution 81, and brief descriptions of financial aid legislation proposed during the 1985-1986 session of the California Legislature.

The rationale for the creation of federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs is considered, including state grant and scholarship programs, independent college programs, work-study programs, special purpose programs, and private financial support. A review of literature about the impact of student aid on equal educational opportunity, which spans 4 decades, covers the effects of aid programs on: access and choice, retention and persistence, and incentives and disincentives to save for college. Initially, federal programs aimed at rewarding veterans and reducing manpower shortages. More recently, they have aimed at removing financial barriers to higher education  for low income students, promoting wider choice of institutions, rewarding talented students, preserving the dual public-private system of U.S. higher education, and increasing international understanding. Research indicates that student aid contributes to greater access and choice, even though it has had little impact on the participation of low-income students. According to the literature, college attendance is a function of many factors, including parents' education and income, academic preparation and ability, and motivation and attitudes.

The effect of the guidelines if implemented in fiscal year (FY) 1986 are estimated. The analysis was based on data on guaranty agencies' sources and uses of funds for FYs 1982-1985, as well as review of recent studies and meetings with Department of Education and guaranty agency officials. This information was used to develop a methodology for setting reserve levels and to analyze the potential effect of alternative reserve guidelines on agency reserves. It is suggested that guidelines should set separate reserve levels for each agency, taking into  account the agency's potential to experience negative cash flow, which is largely determined by the value of its outstanding loan guarantee commitments and its single expense--claims paid to lenders. It is concluded that agency reserve limits could be set large enough to accommodate cash flow problems experienced in recent years, while not so large as to allow the accumulation of unnecessarily large reserves.

While the classroom lecture method is the method of choice for college teachers, one promising method for better learning of subject-matter content has been the Personalized System of Instruction, which emphasizes student involvement,  high expectations, and assessment and feedback. Problems arise when colleges that are primarily teaching institutions turn to faculty publication as their route to distinction. For undergraduate education to improve, teachers will need support of their colleges, including the commitment to evaluate teaching performance in decisions to hire, promote, and tenure faculty members.

Outcomes for humanities majors were also compared to social science, business, and education majors, as well as graduates who majored in interdisciplinary studies in the liberal arts and sciences. Data were obtained from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972, which involved surveys in spring 1972 and followups in the fall and winters of 1973, 1974, 1976, and 1979. Consideration was given to: family background (e.g., parents' education and occupation), students' self-concept, personal goals, academic performance in college, and the quality of the institution attended. Multivariate analysis was used to investigated three  dimensions of early career attainment: type of job obtained, income, and job satisfaction. Each occupation was also assigned a Duncan Socioeconomic prestige score. Additional study variables included work activities, supervisory responsibility, and personal career goals. Separate analyses were performed across majors by sex. It is concluded that while a sizable proportion of humanities graduates have not been launched on professional careers during the early post-college years, their work experiences have not been discouraging and have differed little from their contemporaries who majored in other fields. Detailed findings are presented, along with appendices that explain study variables and provide information on the number of bachelor's and master's degrees conferred, by major, for U.S.  colleges since 1968-1969 (reported in 2-year intervals).

The value of feedback and control, teacher-student interaction, and stress awareness is addressed. The literature on the relationship between teaching and learning identifies three specific roles: the teacher as human relations specialist, as facilitator, and as motivator. Ways in which teachers can give effective feedback include letting students know where they stand, providing written comments on students' work, and arranging personal meetings to discuss students' work. Various ways that teachers can  improve their relationships with students and enhance students' learning include providing structure at the onset of a course, encouraging class participation, and being open to mentoring roles. Teachers may also help students with stress reactions, maximize the outcome of meetings with students, and recognize severe stress that warrants referral to therapists/counselors. Faculty can recommend a number of strategies to students to increase learning: improving study habits and time management, learning positive self-talk, learning how to relax, and joining a student support group.

The relative effectiveness of alternative statistical procedures for estimating costs are also tested. Statistical cost estimation involves three basic parts: a model, a data set, and an estimation procedure. Actual data are used to assess whether the ridge techniques provide a viable alternative to the more familiar ordinary least squares approach within the collinear environment characteristics of translog models. The translog model that is used for the study generates marginal cost estimates for full-time and part-time students at two-year colleges. In every comparison conducted for the study, the ridge procedure was superior to the ordinary least squares  approach. Of importance were ridge improvements in the precision and stability of estimated coefficients, since marginal cost estimates were a function of a set of coefficients. In addition, the ridge regression provided a means for data and model exploration. Comparing ordinary least squares and ridge estimates, and especially by examining ridge traces and variance inflation factors, can also promote understanding of the effects of multicollinearity (i.e., highly correlated explanatory variables) in a given situation.

        "description":"The art of effective management is addressed, along with motivational factors that affect the way in which employees respond to management. To meet challenges for better production, organizational systems are taking into account the development of individual employees. Since human behavior must be fully understood to develop human resources, \"new design managers\" need to understand psychological needs and what motivates individuals. Therefore, at the heart of effective administration are working conditions designed to meet physical and psychological needs, and the astute skill exhibited in approaching employees in a way that causes them to be motivated. Eight of 16 motivational factors important to developing human resources for productivity are as follows: showing respect for  employees increases self-esteem and positive feelings; understanding that individual successes strengthen the total organization; rewarding and praising employees increases productivity; challenging workers and providing stimulating work provides the incentive to produce more; knowledge of progress is reinforcing; working for the same goals encourages teamwork; employees tend to identify with leaders who set desirable examples; and individuals are usually encouraged to work harder when they feel secure about their status.

The Demonstrator can promote understanding of spreadsheet concepts and applications, data organization and linkages, data format and screen design, and the potential for effective management reporting. The target audience was senior officials and executives responsible for planning and management activities; a secondary audience was those who teach about the use of microcomputers and about  software tools like LOTUS 1-2-3. Attention is directed to the following design considerations: primary purpose of the DSS Demonstrator, guiding philosophy, scope (applications), target audience, skill level, technical features of the software, standards, impact (i.e., knowledge of basic concepts and translating from an application of low interest to one of high interest); and the utility of the DSS Demonstrator (immediate usage of applications, expanding current templates, and learning aid).

The objective is to permit transfer of data in a more easily manipulable form. Attention is focused on the medium into which reports can be feasibly put, as well as ways in which the reports can be transmitted. The following four data storage media for transmitting Information Services reports to clients are considered: printed report, magnetic tape, floppy disk, mainframe computer disk. In addition to the medium to store the data, data transmission can be accomplished by hand delivery, U.S. mail, courier, facsimile, and telecommunications. Cost-related questions include: who absorbs the costs to develop new delivery  modes, who pays the costs to transmit data, and how costs are determined. Since costs, clientele, and the technology need to be considered before NCHEMS makes firm commitments to alternative delivery modes, pilot testing of different modes will be undertaken in fiscal year 1985.

The literature review covered student variables affecting retention rates, ethnic status and retention, institutional variables affecting persistence, and theoretical models that explain persistence. Full- and part-time students at the commuter university were tracked from fall 1982 through the beginning of the fall 1986 term. Information was gathered on fall 1982 grade point average (GPA) and cumulative GPA in 1986. For students who entered as freshmen, high school GPA and Scholastic Aptitude Test scores were obtained. Transfer GPA and credit hours were obtained for transfer students. Persistence was defined as either obtaining a  degree or being registered for the fall 1986 term. The analysis was done by class level, including remedial, freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior levels. Multiple discriminant analysis included the variables of gender and minority status. It was found that academic integration as measured by GPA was by far the best indicator of persistence. This finding was consistent with previous research on nontraditional students. However, retention patterns were somewhat affected by gender and minority status. Five data tables and a two-page list of references conclude the document. (SW)",

A census survey was conducted with 2,830 public and private two-year and four-year postsecondary institutions included in the Higher Education Directory. Availability of video and audio for instruction concentrated on whether there were various central reception/distribution facilities. Institutional support for instructional technologies was demonstrated in several ways, including consortia membership or services, faculty training programs and expert  assistance provided by institutions, and financial support or incentives for use. During 1984-1985, video, audio, and computer technologies were available in some form for instructional use by faculty and students in more than 90% of the institutions. Availability of most forms of equipment, particularly of larger or more sophisticated and expensive equipment, was substantially greater among public than private institutions.

Data was gathered through direct observation during training workshops and during actual use, logging of consulting phone calls, and interviews. Information was sought to determine the following: (1) the type of training that would produce the greatest amount of learning for these users and their preferred learning styles; (2) how frequently they accessed online help; (3) the number of consulting calls that could have been answered by online help and the learning styles of the frequent callers; (4) ways to improve online help; and (5) whether the time  invested in generating extensive online help was cost effective. Three preferred styles of learning were exhibited by users, and it was found that those with a guided discovery learning style were the most willing to access online help, users with a discovery learning style tended to enter an option to see what happened instead of accessing help, and the structured style learners were more nervous about using function keys and accessed online help the least. The context-sensitive help tended to be accessed when users were in trouble, and it seemed to be more frequently accessed and more useful to learners than the more general fixed-format help. It was also found that help that is context-sensitive (but not &quot;intelligent&quot;) does not require major increases in software development resources.  (DJR)",

Subjects were 20 male and 20 female sixth-grade students who were randomly assigned to same-sex pairs. All pairs were assigned to both experimental conditions, which consisted of playing the educational game, &quot;Dueling Digits.&quot; In the cooperative condition, students worked together to score 100 points within a 20-minute session; in the competitive condition, students worked individually and the winner was the one who scored 100 points first. Videotapes were made during the experimental sessions and students completed self-evaluative questionnaires at the  end of each session for both treatments. The statistical model used to analyze the data was analysis of variance with repeated measures. Findings indicated that competitive instructional contexts promoted more self-oriented and besting behaviors than a cooperative one, and that the cooperative instructional context promoted more other-oriented and positive behaviors, although some negative behaviors occurred in both contexts. The pairing of students by sex was not found to be a basic determinant of variance in student interaction.

The methodology includes four phases: local information-flow modeling, global information-flow modeling, conceptual schema design, and external schema modeling. These phases are intended to make maximum use of available information and user expertise, including the use of a previous needs analysis, and to prepare a firm foundation for physical database design and system implementation. The methodology recommends analysis from different points of view--organization, function, and event--in order to ensure that the logical database design accurately reflects the requirements of the entire population of future users. Also recommended is computer support from a data dictionary system in order to  conveniently and accurately handle the volume and complexity of design documentation and analysis. This report places the methodology in the context of the complete system life cycle, and an appendix of illustrations shows examples of how the four phases of the methodology can be implemented.

The purpose of this report is to provide a performance evaluation methodology, or benchmarking framework, to assist in the design and implementation of a wide variety of benchmark experiments. The methodology, which identifies criteria to be utilized in the design, execution, and analysis of a database system benchmark, has been applied to three different database systems representative of current minicomputer, microcomputer, and database machine architectures. This generalized methodology can apply to most database system designs. In addition to presenting a wide variety of possible considerations in the design and implementation of the  benchmark, this methodology can be applied to the evaluation of either a single system with several configurations, or to the comparison of several systems. A summary of the report identifies the three principal phases of a database system benchmark--benchmark design, execution, and analysis--and notes that no generalized methodology can provide a complete list of considerations for the design of an actual experiment.

        "description":"The Second National Survey of Instructional Uses of School Computers gathered information from more than 10,000 principals and computer-using teachers in a probability sample of over 2,300 U.S. elementary and secondary schools during the spring of 1985. Information was obtained through questionnaires and telephone interviews. The first of six to be issued from this survey, this report concentrates on basic numbers. In a typical school, during the 1984-85 school year, nearly half of the elementary and middle school pupils and as many as one-third of the high school students made some use of computers at school. One-fourth of all U.S. teachers used computers \"regularly\" with students during the year, and the amount of experience that any one computer-using student had with school  computers doubled between 1983 and 1985. Mathematics, language arts, computer literacy, programming, and business education were the major subjects for which computers were used. Computers used for school instruction can be found in classrooms, laboratories, libraries, offices, and hallways; they can be fixed or on mobile carts to rotate among several rooms. Students are getting more time to use computers because there are more computers at individual schools and each computer is used more. Computer laboratories are used for more hours of the week than are classroom or library computers, especially in elementary and middle schools, and the typical student working in a computer laboratory uses computers for about twice as much time as the typical computer user in a classroom. Data are  displayed in seven tables and nine figures. (DJR)",

It uses technology to deliver high quality, specially designed teaching materials to large numbers of adult students throughout Britain, and increasingly abroad, who study at home. The Open University's teaching system has remained basically unchanged since 1969; however, practical experience with three more recent technologies (interactive videodiscs, audio-graphic teleconferencing, and computer conferencing) has demonstrated the increased instructional power and the increased flexibility of some of the newer technologies. The instructional power comes from improved feedback and interaction for learners, and the increased flexibility comes from the ability of some of the new technologies  to exploit fully the range and power of the teacher at a distance, while providing individually adapted courses for individual learners. However, while such technologies are already available, it is likely to be a number of years before they are used on a large scale in higher education, not so much because of resistance from teachers and students, but because of the inability of large organizations to make the structural changes necessary for the successful implementation of such technologies on a large scale.

Research into new technology in education will become a priority as the use of technology will require large-scale investments. Research should be aimed at identifying appropriate teaching roles for different technologies; how media differ from one another in the way they present, represent, and organize knowledge; and how this relates to cognitive learning processes. Research will also be required in the methodology of cost-analysis to enable institutions to identify the nature of costs in using technologies and to compare differences between media  within the same system. Major changes will be required in the organization of teaching and administration, and research is needed to resolve questions about the best way to organize teaching when using the new technologies. Essentially, there will be a need for new approaches to research and for adequate, independent funding. (DJR)",

        "description":"For television to be used effectively, teachers need to reorganize their teaching to increase the children's interaction with the program material. One way of getting more participation is to preview and pre-record a program, stopping the replayed cassette at key points, questioning the class, and having them discuss the sequence just seen. Another suggestion is to select and edit extracts from video resource materials that are relevant to specific teaching needs, e.g., using a computer animation or an experiment. Once appropriate video materials have been identified, they can be combined with books or printed materials, and a range of questions or activities for individual learners or small groups can be designed. The last approach suggested would be to have children and  teachers create their own audiovisual materials, using low-cost cameras and editing equipment. Cooperation between staff members and reappraisal of the curriculum, with thought being given to other resources such as books and computing facilities, and how they can best be integrated with video, offers the best chance of using television successfully.

Television's presentational power gives it two unique teaching characteristics: its ability to provide learning materials otherwise unavailable to students, and its ability to enhance the learning process by providing powerful audiovisual images corresponding to certain aspects of cognitive processing. Learning materials available through television include demonstrations of experiments; explanations of concepts, principles or ideas involving movement over space and/or time; opportunities for students to make interpretations; development of skills analysis and application of  knowledge to case-study material; opportunity for use of archival audiovisual materials; and demonstration of the whole context in which processes take place. Television can help students to learn new skills and use knowledge that has been acquired through courses, life experiences, or new situations. Enhancing the learning process can be done through illustration (audiovisual images symbolizing concepts or ideas that can imprint themselves in learners' memory); modeling (concrete or physical models of abstract ideas); and supplantation (explicit images as substitutes for images students cannot generate on their own). New technological developments that enhance methods of delivery include broadcasting, videocassettes, videodiscs, cable, and satellite. (DJR)",

Originated by the Army Research Institute's Ft.

Final evaluation of the videodiscs included the administration of two tests, one designed to measure the acquisition of leadership skills, and the other a subjective preference test designed to measure user acceptance. Nine highly interactive videodisc training scenarios covering 20 leadership problems were produced. The  evaluation of the scenarios indicated that the videodisc method resulted in significantly greater learning of leadership principles, with the majority of students indicating that a combination of videodisc and role playing would be optimal for leadership training.

It is pointed out that one problem with using television is that it is a weak medium for providing diagnosis and feedback of student learning. Other conditions that must be satisfied include: the need to match the program structure and style to the needs of different audiences; the importance of suitable transmission times for broadcast television; and the need for students to appreciate the relevance of the television material to the rest of their studies. The changing nature and value of videodisks and videocassettes for distance learners as a result of such technological developments as satellite and cable television are noted. It is concluded that the information technology revolution is having profound effects on television as well, and  that computers and television can play complementary teaching roles and are best used in combination.

The seminar on &quot;Information Technology&quot; (IT) included Kenneth Ruthven's consideration of IT content and methodology; Tony Scott's presentation of the aims, course descriptions, and key features of The London Borough of Croydon's computer studies courses; and John Gardner's presentation on the teacher's role in raising the levels of IT literacy, clarification of the meaning of IT literacy, and the need for evaluation of IT techniques in education. The seminar on &quot;Implanting Innovation and Teacher Education&quot; included discussions of  changes that are needed/anticipated in education as a result of the availability and adoption of IT, the barriers to change, IT based materials, and the teacher's relationship with class members. The last seminar, on &quot;Artificial Intelligence and CAL Development,&quot; commenced with a consideration of a range of issues prepared by Bob Hart, which included the meaning of computer assisted learning (CAL); using the computer to help the child transcend physical and computational limits; the development of applications that transcend the traditional curriculum barriers; creative media; support for the teacher; program designs that allow children to break out of strait jackets of arbitrary structures; and the role of research. Other points discussed were reflected in a summary paper by Tony Scott  from which several excerpts are given in this report. Appendices include a list of attendees and a discussion of ways in which ITE plans to promote applications of artificial intelligence in education. (DJR)",

Operating systems, languages, and network options are addressed as component subsystems of a CBI laboratory system. The second section addresses the ways in which a CBI laboratory can be used to support technical training functions  including prerequisite skills remediation, independent study, job practice, testing, and refresher training. The third section discusses authoring languages and systems requirements for effective laboratory application and proposes government sponsored development in this area. The last section discusses CBI laboratory system configurations and specifically addresses such technical issues as graphics and simulation that must be considered when selecting a configuration.

        "description":"The proposal put forward in this presentation centers on the use of the microcomputer for the generation of educational research, both as a powerful tool for information collection and as a means for analyzing the generated data. The microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) principles described in this paper may be used in rural classroom settings as well as in a broader range of research, e.g., city- or state-wide studies. This presentation examines the MBL programming component and its application to a specific research question in special education: the identification of a processing disorder subtype of the learning disabled (LD) student population. The suggestions contained herein are intended for potential researchers who are familiar with microcomputers. Among the advantages of  subtype studies are that: (1) they are sensitive to the possibility that typical learners demonstrate cognitive processing strategies similar to those identified in non-typical learners; (2) they are less prone to errors arising from conclusions based on coincidental occurrences; and (3) they are less prone to statistical averaging difficulties encountered when comparing LD students with non-LD students. The increased availability of students resulting from moving the studies to the schools is an added advantage. Findings based on more broad-based locally-defined subgroups of LD students have promise for enhancing the understanding of the LD handicap and, as such, may lead to more effective individual educational plans. State offices of public instruction would particularly benefit from  such research in justifying current LD programs to budget conscious legislatures. An Applesoft BASIC program designed to evaluate the dependent variables of performance and reaction time is included as an illustrative analysis of an MBL program. Eight references are listed.

Given potential funding constraints, this 5-month study expanded its original scope--to assess the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the Bay Area Reference Center (BARC) and the Southern California Answering Network (SCAN)--to an examination of BARC and SCAN in the context of the existing reference referral system. This system involves local public libraries and 17 System Reference Centers to which reference questions are referred before they are passed along to BARC and SCAN. The study focused on: (1) defining the nature of reference-related services provided by BARC, SCAN, and the System Reference Centers; (2)  describing the major differences in reference services between BARC and SCAN and those of the System Reference Centers (e.g., unit cost, level of service); (3) determination of whether public libraries would be willing to allocate scarce resources to provide statewide access to information; and (4) the involvement of key stakeholders in the discussions and in the development of recommendations. In addition to a detailed discussion of the purpose of the study, its methodology, and the resources used, this report presents a summary of the findings, two models for reference referral that are proposed for a new organization structure, and a transition plan for the implementation of a new structure. Six tables and two figures are included in the body of the report, and ten survey tables  summarizing data collected during the study follow the text. (KM)",

        "description":"The Knowledge Network of Washington (KNOW-NET) Dissemination Project in Washington State from 1980 to 1985 is described prior to and following funding by the National Institute of Education. As a state capacity building project, KNOW-NET had five major components: (1) coordination/leadership; (2) building information resources; (3) building linkages; (4) treating equity issues; and (5) collaborative relationships. The number of clients increased over each of the 5 years, and client satisfaction reactions were consistent at 80% to 85%. Problems included the inability to provide clients with full documents and the need to provide continuing assistance in evaluating and applying information obtained. Project staff concluded that teachers and administrators will seek and use research  information in their school improvement projects when it is known to be accessible and assistance is provided with follow-up results. Following the termination of federal funds, the state legislature is looked to for continuation of information services to schools. Four appendices provide a list of selected uses of KNOW-NET research and development information by agency staff, a summary of numerical data from impact reports, a tally of satisfaction surveys, and the text of the Educational Information Clearinghouse bill which has been approved by the Senate of the State of Washington, but had not been passed by the House at the end of the 1985 session.

Task force findings revealed that 15.5% of the book collection is in a deteriorated condition, that problems exist in the control of heat and humidity in the environment, that the library is poorly prepared to cope with a disaster, and that procedural and organizational changes are needed to deal adequately with preservation issues. The report details 75 recommendations to the director, the most significant of which is the appointment of a preservation  officer. Other major recommendations concern environment, physical facilities and equipment; disaster preparedness and control; preservation decision-making and treatment; non-print materials, microforms and special collections; staff education and user awareness; organization; external relations; and grants.

        "description":"A variety of resources is needed to effectively carry out a comprehensive evaluation of any reasonably complex program of library instruction. At the State University College at Oswego, New York, the means and motivation for carrying out formal evaluation of a college library's instruction program were greatly enhanced when librarians cooperated with a campus research course. The library's program became a class project; faculty and staff shared their expertise; and these symbiotic efforts resulted in a fairly comprehensive evaluation project. The total evaluation process has included a faculty needs assessment, evaluation of current library instruction offered through freshman English and upper-level psychology courses, and feedback from graduating students. The research results  have prompted improvements in the library instruction program, and they form a basis for continuing evaluation. This case study suggests that librarians look to their campus environments for stimulus and help, since colleges are usually rich in resources needed for program evaluation. (Author/KM)",

The guide was designed to assist educators in teaching the topics of consumer credit and consumer credit protection to secondary and postsecondary students in various economics and business courses, as well as in adult and community education courses. The new sections can be used on their own or in combination with the other four sections comprising the original instructional unit. The first of the two sections focuses on the Truth in Lending Act, addressing the following topics: credit options, the provisions of the law, credit advertising, credit shopping, using open-end credit accounts, and economics of the Truth in Lending Act. The second section deals with the Fair Credit Billing Act,  covering the following topics: assessing the correctness of a monthly credit statement, provisions of the law, correcting billing errors, credit card transactions, and special credit card/debit card rules. Each section includes directions for use, an introduction, a list of key concepts and definitions of terms, an answer key, and information sheets which may serve as masters for overhead transparencies or instructional materials for students. Pretests are also included to help instructors assess student knowledge and select appropriate sections and topics. Introductory material pertinent to the entire instructional guide and replacement pages for the first four sections are provided. (EJV)",

        "description":"In winter 1985, a survey of all California community colleges was conducted to identify and describe the types of programs and services provided by the colleges to students with developmental disabilities (DD). Questionnaires mailed to all 106 community colleges yielded a 100% response rate. Study findings included the following: (1) 44% of the colleges operated formal programs for the developmentally disabled, and 31% provided informal services for the DD students; (2) the total DD student population exceeded 7000 students, with 92% enrolled in formal programs and receiving full services; (3) DD students were enrolled in off-campus programs rather than on-campus programs at a rate of 4:1, and enrolled in non-credit programs rather than credit programs at a rate of 5:1; (4) 50%  or more of the student referrals for a DD program came from parents/relatives, public schools and California's Regional Centers; and (5) 63% of the colleges administered normed, commercially available tests to program applicants. The study report concludes with six recommendations for improving DD services. Twenty-two tables supplement the text and appendices include additional tables and the survey instrument. (LAL)",

First, an executive summary describes the types of services typically provided by EOPS programs in the areas of management, outreach and recruitment, instructional development and services, counseling, transition, special activities, financial aid coordination, and staff development and training. Chapter 1 describes the Operational Program Review (OPR) process used in the study,  identifies the main sources of information about the programs under review, and offers a profile of EOPS students who participated in those programs. Chapter 2 presents an overview of the structured, planned activities conducted by the EOPS programs reviewed during the 1985-86 academic year. Finally, chapter 3 addresses the question of how to improve EOPS in the areas of program administration, image/awareness, coordination with college services, program plan, advisory committees, compliance with &quot;over and above&quot; regulations, facilities, outreach/recruitment, instructional development, counseling, transfer and transition activities, special activities, financial aid, and staff development. Specific recommendations are presented for each college reviewed. Appendices include data on EOPS  student demographics, educational goals, and high school graduation status for the 1984-85 and 1985-86 populations, and an abbreviated handbook of OPR procedures.

Following a review of the literature, an extensive list of course goals, content areas, and prior student preparation needs was formed into a questionnaire, which was administered to 12 full-time mathematics faculty, 52 full-time liberal and fine arts faculty, 25 part-time mathematics faculty, and a sample of 93 liberal arts and fine arts students. Study findings, based on responses from 12 full-time and 23 part-time mathematics teachers, 25 liberal/fine arts faculty, and 65 students, included the following: (1) each group, except the full-time mathematics faculty, agreed that course goals should include the  student's learning basic problem-solving steps that could be applied to any career field; (2) all groups felt students should complete some mathematics prior to enrolling in the liberal arts mathematics class, with all faculty groups indicating that arithmetic and beginning algebra should be part of students' prior experience; and (3) the following topics were supported by all groups for inclusion in the class: the fundamentals of mathematical reasoning and logic, functions and graphs, probability and &quot;odds,&quot; recent developments and discoveries in mathematics, computer technology, statistics, and methods of organization using sets.

This federal file would allow businesses and organizations that hire persons whose employment brings them into regular contact with children to have access to arrest or conviction records for the purpose of determining the suitability of job applicants. Testimony reflects the opinions and experiences of United States Senators, Congressmen, representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, district attorneys, doctors, directors of clinics and child care  centers, professional associations, and concerned parents. A substantial part of the hearings focus on federal assistance given to states to prevent abuse in child care facilities. Also included are excerpts from the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime; criteria for high quality early childhood programs developed by the National Association for the Education of Young Children; a statement submitted by the Washington, D.C. and Maryland Chapters of Society's League against Molestation; and an article on the scope, impact, and legal ramifications of sexual exploitation of children.

During treatment, disagreeing subjects resolved their disagreement in discussion. Subjects were individually post-tested twice and improvement in rule use was recorded. Findings indicated that interaction with a partner was not conducive to cognitive development. No significant improvement was found when equal rule and unequal rule groups were compared.

Subjects gave verbal directions to help another person find a hidden object, in this case, a small toy hidden under one of a number of cups. Two experimental conditions were set up, the first offering a relatively rich assortment of distinctive markings that could potentially be related to the array of cups, and the other not offering such distinctive markings. Generally, findings illustrate some aspects of developmental change in children's use of spatial information and suggest that some unique task-related contextual effects exist in the communicative problem presented to subjects. Major findings revealed that (1) the use of  self-reference increased with age; (2) the use of listener as a reference point increased with age, and exceeded self-reference for the two youngest groups; (3) the third-grade children used a reference system near the hiding location more than a more remote reference system, whereas first-graders showed an opposite preference; and (4) the cup array itself was used often as a reference system by all subjects, regardless of their age or the availability of other differentiated environmental cues.

A total of 64 children, equally distributed by sex, with 32 in kindergarten and 32 in fifth grade, were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions that crossed two levels of content cues with two levels of sound effects. The content cue conditions provided 35 seconds of additional information which indicated that a dream was occurring while the no content cue conditions did not. The content cue conditions were either preceded or not preceded by one-second sound effects. Visual attention was videotaped during each child's individual viewing session. After viewing, each child answered a 22-item multiple-choice recognition test of inferential, central-concrete, and incidental content.  Results demonstrated that sound effects increased attentional responsiveness and inferential recognition better than the content cues, particularly for the youngest children who have the greatest difficulty understanding televised stories.

Forty 5-year-olds and 40 7-year-olds from a small academic community generated exemplars from the animal and cartoon character domains and provided information about sets of animals and cartoon characters. It was found that the production of exemplars increased with age, and children tended to report more animals than cartoons. Interpretations of clusters evident in children's protocols were similar for each age and reflected prior knowledge. The production of information also increased with age, and varied according to type of information and domain. It was concluded that the findings provide evidence of age changes in  knowledge and serve as a critical base for future examinations of the influence of prior knowledge on memory. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Discussed are research methods used to measure developmental changes in children's reasoning about ability. While adults generally differentiate ability, effort, luck, and task difficulty as causes for success and failure, children progressively think that effort or outcome is ability (level 1), that effort is the cause of performance outcomes (level 2), that effort and ability are partially different (level 3), and that ability is capacity (level 4). Typically, level 1 thinking predominates among 5-year-old children, while most children advance to level 4 at about 11 or 12 years of age. Techniques used to identify and assess developmental levels in children's reasoning about ability required subjects to compare the abilities of two children who applied varied levels of effort  and achieved varied outcomes. In initial studies, films or videotapes were shown individually to subjects. Later research used a series of six pictures frequently depicting one child &quot;goofing off.&quot; This report illustrates and discusses examples of children's typical response protocols at each level of reasoning, reports rationale for key questions asked in the interview situation and for scoring procedures, and explores the relationship of reasoning level to other variables, such as expectations of teacher approval for effort and performance impairment after failure.

Some experts say that age alone is the best indicator of success. Others say that chronological age, mental age, intelligence quotient, readiness, emotional and social adjustment, or combinations of these factors are the indicators of success. A few experts say that age is not an indicator of success at all because each child can succeed if the school program meets individual needs. To explore these issues, an investigation compared the academic achievement at the third grade level of 20 early and 20 late entry kindergarten children. A statistically significant difference in achievement  was found, with the late entry students scoring significantly higher on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills than did those who entered kindergarten early. In addition, findings revealed that 61 percent of the students who were retained in elementary or placed in modified primary classes were within the early entry group at the time of admission to kindergarten.

After a brief introduction, major recommendations from previous research on parent involvement training for teachers are listed, and the need for additional training is pointed out. The process through which the guidelines and strategies were developed is described, assumptions guiding their development are stated, and definitions of terms used in the guidelines and strategy statements are provided. The guidelines and strategies concern parent involvement in two areas: support for children's learning, and shared educational decision-making.  Guidelines for each area focus on knowledge, understanding, and skills. Strategies for each area deal with preservice and inservice training.

        "description":"It is a common article of belief that each child is unique. Action based on this belief, though, is rare. Researchers have largely neglected the question of the causes of children's individual uniqueness. But, when difficulties and serious problems arise in the course of child rearing, causality is located in the dynamics of family functioning. Recent research on various problems suggests that such a narrow functionalist view of causation is inadequate and reasserts the existence and importance of individual differences and their effects. Individual differences in children have been investigated by Thomas, Chess, and Birch (1956, 1968, 1977), who identified individual characteristics of 1-month-old infants and explored the extent to which those characteristics remained constant  and influenced later psychological development. The researchers identified three temperament styles: the easy, difficult, and slow-to-warm child. Inheritability of individual characteristics of personality was researched by Buss and Plomin (1975) who found support for a genetic component in the temperament dimensions of emotionality, activity, sociability, but none for impulsivity. Both sets of authors advance an interactionist model of the relation between temperament and environment; other related studies support the interactionist view. Taken together, findings suggest specific ways that differences in children's temperament affect caretaker-child relationships and differences in parents' temperament affect their initial parenting practices.

        "description":"The nature and development of semantic processing in chess was investigated in a study involving younger players from 6 through 18 years of age. Efforts were directed toward establishing the assertion that skilled players' memory for chess positions depends largely upon the availability of pre-stored schema (PSS) that are both abstract and semantically organized. Subjects were players at the 1985 Tennessee Scholastic Chess Championship who had ratings of 1100 or above. In the first experiment, a total of 46 subjects participated in a midgame task and 48 participated in an endgame task. Subjects were shown target boards for 10 seconds, read accompanying context descriptions when appropriate, and reconstructed from memory as much of the display as possible. Performance was measured  by number of correctly placed pieces. In a second experiment, subjects were shown midgame positions they had viewed previously and were asked to reconstruct them, looking at the displayed model as often as necessary. Taken together, data from the memory and reconstruction tasks lend strong support to the general hypothesis that abstract, semantically organized PSSs are an important component of chess cognition, and to several special cases of that hypothesis. Data also disclosed age-related qualitative differences in the cognitive mechanisms for constructing representations of briefly presented chess positions. (RH)",

        "description":"Preschoolers are taken on many field trips during the course of their preschool experience. Yet, little research investigates the effects of such curricular offerings on children's developing social and intellectual skills. Intuitively, educators tend to agree that field trips are beneficial to children. However, findings of relevant studies are inconclusive on this point. The purpose of this study was to determine whether field trips with prior and follow-up activities had a more positive effect on black preschool children's test performance than did field trips without such activities. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) was used to assess treatment effects. A total of 52 urban black children between 4 and 5 years old were equally divided into an experimental group and a  comparison group and were taken on 6 weekly field trips to places such as the local zoo and selected museums. Activities provided to the experimental group included drawing, discussing what was experienced on a trip, and acting out what was observed during a trip. Prior to leaving, experimental group participants and their teachers discussed what they were going to experience. Items experienced on the trips were selected to match items on the PPVT. Findings indicated that children exposed to structured field trips achieved greater gains on the PPVT than did children exposed to the non-structured field trips. (RH)",

        "description":"Investigated were the role of mental imagery in children's logical reasoning and individual differences in children's use of imagery while reasoning. Fifth grade students assessed as being high imagers (HIS) and low imagers (LIS) completed conditional syllogisms of various kinds and were asked, after each of their responses, whether an image had occurred to them in the course of solving the problem. Results indicated that (1) HIS and LIS groups were differentiated in terms of their imagery reports when the content of the problem was low in imagery value; (2) both groups appeared to use imagery for inferences which do not yield either a definite \"yes\" or \"no\" conclusion; (3) for inferences of intermediate difficulty, LIS appeared to use imagery unsuccessfully, while HIS appeared  to use it successfully. This difference does not seem to be due to a general difference in ability, as both groups' performance on a different, difficult memory task was equivalent. It is thought that this difference may stem from the fact that LIS may not have adequate procedures for integrating imagery with abstract verbal processes. A number of other results of general interest are also reported and discussed. Taken together, results provide preliminary evidence that the imageability of material included in problems does not have a facilitative effect for all students. A three-page list of references, nine data tables, and seven graphs are appended. (RH)",

        "description":"Using a longitudinal data set obtained from 169 pre-adolescent children between the ages of 8 and 13 years, this study statistically divided locus of control into two independent components. The first component was noted as &quot;age-dependent&quot; (AD) and was determined by predicted values generated by regressing children's ages onto their locus of control scores. The second component was called &quot;age-independent&quot; (AI) and was determined by the residual scores from the regression analysis. The components were then used to identify clusters of items associated with AD and AI from the original 40-item pool of the research instrument. Both components showed a strong positive relationship with the general measure. Both defined similar score ranges and encompassed the full internal-external  range. One variable, Self Esteem, obtained a linear correlation of r=-.54 with AI and r=.00 with AD. Further analyses, utilizing multiple log-linear chi-square analyses with regard to Internal/External response patterns, demonstrated that the relationship between age and locus of control, while quite robust, is not necessarily linear. Earlier analyses of this scale may have obtained statistical artifacts associated with the binary structure of the scale. A six-point Likert scaling system is recommended for future use. It is speculated that similarities and differences between the locus of control components across cultures may clarify the distinction between the components. (RH)",

Deteriorating agricultural economy and mandated school reforms were found to have exacerbated rural school problems of maintaining quality programs in situations of declining enrollment and rising costs. The Rural Education Project sought to identify unique characteristics of small rural schools and to develop the capacity of the rural education community to address issues of rural education cooperatively. The Project established clusters of rural schools linked with institutions of higher education and state education agencies to improve local schools and to create a network of agencies involved in  rural educational development. Clusters provided staff and curriculum development, cooperative planning for resource sharing, instructional uses of microcomputers, and rural school involvement in economic development; in addition, participants discussed regional issues, and participated in research studies to provide information about rural education. The Project implemented and evaluated criteria for effective schools as outlined by another McREL project. The report lists useful elements of rural school improvement programs, guidelines for establishing clusters, examples of cluster activities, and nine characteristics of effective schools with corresponding results observed in two rural schools.

The Mid-Missouri Small School Consortium involved five rural school districts in efforts to incorporate microcomputers into school operations and curriculum and was distinctive in its use of the consortium concept to provide teacher in-service training. Contract Vocational Education: The Missouri Model evolved from a study of dropouts in three south central Missouri counties into a community-business-school cooperative program to provide rural students with vocational skills needed in their communities. The South Dakota Small Schools Cluster involved  six small school systems, McREL, and South Dakota State University in an effort to assist small schools in maintaining quality education at affordable prices when consolidation was not viable. Project Innovative Curriculum brought together four schools in south central Nebraska to concentrate on cooperative curriculum development, increase exchange of ideas among teachers, and encourage resource sharing. Each case study provides descriptions of schools and communities, problems which prompted the cluster's formation, cluster development and activities, program evaluation, conclusions about successful clusters and suggestions for implementation of the cluster approach.

National trends related to household size, family structure, women's participation in the labor force, and income distribution also impact on population characteristics. Census data serve as a major source of information to study changes in an area's population. To understand and use the census data, it is important to consider the geographic areas for which census data are issued; the items on the 1980  questionnaire; the various printed reports, computer tapes, and microfiche from the 1980 Census, and the information in each; and the organizations that make census data and other sources of demographic data available to the public.

A survey of CES' Community and Rural Development programs conducted in late 1985 and early 1986 identified a variety of CES activities related to economic development. At least half of the 56 respondents had worked on community surveys, economic analysis, business management, retention and expansion, and market studies. The most common approach reported was individual counseling followed by workshops and agent training. Specific CES programs in economic development include Ohio's retention and expansion program, Montana's programs to deal with declining agricultural  revenue, Washington's community surveys to obtain information for an economic development plan, and Georgia's computer-generated reports of county demography and economic status. CES is on the right track with its economic development programs, but challenges remain. Given the common needs of states, work at the regional level should be continued and expanded. Extension's different programs (home economics, farm management, and community economic development) should join forces to tackle economic problems and should be concerned with agriculture, the service sector, traditional and nonmanufacturing industry, and small business.

Major changes discovered in rural counties include rapid growth in manufacturing, increasing numbers of working women with children, and a steep rise in single-parent families; more people migrated into nonmetropolitan areas from metropolitan areas during the decade than moved in the opposite direction. Other  findings include: the service sector accounted for 73 percent of nonmetropolitan employment growth during the 1970s; over half the women with children worked outside the home in 1980 in both urban and rural areas; nonmetropolitan median income was only 79 percent of metropolitan income in 1979; poverty among the elderly fell nationwide from 27.3 percent in 1969 to 14.8 percent in 1979 and from 37 percent to 20.3 percent in nonmetropolitan areas.

Strategies to help correct general misapprehensions of the social scientist's role and usefulness include  producing and disseminating reports for the public media documenting social scientists' concrete contributions to development projects; participating as a status equal in all phases of project design, start-up, implementation, and evaluation; and establishing frequent, open, in-depth, multi-channeled communication at all levels of project functioning. To confront teamship and credibility issues, it is helpful to explain to teammates the guiding concepts and principles of the discipline and detail how these approaches inform research methodologies and specific project activities. Academic programs must be redefined and expanded for students of rural sociology and anthropology to prepare them for the multi-disciplinary arena. (NEC)",

        "description":"Farm and ranch operators in North Dakota (n=933) and Texas (n=1,020) were randomly surveyed in 1985 to determine the relationship of financial conditions to levels of off-farm employment by farm operators and spouses. The overall response rate was 75%. Off-farm employment was measured by number of days the farmer or spouse was employed off of the farm for 4 or more hours and by intention to obtain off-farm employment during the coming year. Debt-to-asset ratio and 1984 net cash farm income were used to measure amount of financial stress. Farm financial condition was not found to be significantly related to amount of off-farm employment. However, farmers and spouses with the highest debt-to-asset ratio who had started farming recently, had highest educational attainment, and who  were most pessimistic about chances of continuing farming were most likely to state intentions to seek off-farm employment during the coming year. Off-farm employment was most prevalent among farm families with lowest farm incomes who farmed rented land, had started farming recently, had higher levels of education, and had fewer persons in the household. Tables provide correlation matrix of survey variables and regression coefficients and logistic regression showing effects of independent variables on off-farm employment. (LFL)",

The program included the dissemination of energy curriculum materials, field trips, guest speakers, media production, and other energy education activities. Participants were required to develop a plan for instructional change in their own classrooms, to collect materials appropriate for use with their students, and to produce a videotape &quot;commercial&quot; convincing school districts and teachers of the need for energy education infusion into the curriculum. A questionnaire, &quot;Stages of Concern about the Innovation,&quot; was used as a pretest and posttest to document program  effectiveness. Results showed that KSECI participants gained knowledge and became more concerned about student outcomes and working with others following the Institute. Participants' evaluations of the Institute were mostly positive regarding materials, instructors, and field trips. The major criticism was that there was not enough time to explore materials and topics. (JHZ)",

        "description":"Questionnaires were mailed in 1986 to school board presidents in small rural districts across the United States in order to identify the characteristics of successful rural school superintendents and the qualities that rural school boards look for when hiring a superintendent. There were 93 usable responses from 28 states. Analysis of the responses showed that the major challenges confronting superintendents in small rural districts were those of securing adequate school funding and improving school curriculum. Of somewhat lesser concern were securing and retaining teachers and improving student academic achievement. School consolidation did not appear to be a major issue. The school board presidents felt that superintendents should be able to communicate well and work well with  staff, students, parents, and other community members. The ability to deal with school budgets, secure funds, and coordinate educational functions was also considered important. Honesty, integrity, good moral character, and a good personality were listed fairly frequently as important characteristics for a school superintendent. Interest and ability to live and work in a small community were also felt to contribute to a superintendent's effectiveness. (JHZ)",

The Mansfield Pennsylvania-Utah Teleteaching Project and the Delaware-Chenango Schools  network are examples of this technology. Interactive television via satellite is one of the fastest growing distance learning technologies, offering one-way video and two-way audio. Current programs include German by Satellite and Physics by Satellite from Oklahoma State University, TI-IN Network in Texas, Utah's Accelerated Learning of Spanish via Satellite Television Project, and the Telecommunications Project at Eastern Washington University.

It  transmits 20 different high school courses in daily live broadcasts using the teacher-present/student-recite method with audio interaction via telephone. The three programs offer exposure to learning experiences and technology not available in the subscribing schools, promote independent study skills, and present excellent instruction and materials. Weaknesses include communication difficulties between schools and program suppliers, lack of inservice training in two of the programs, and remote site equipment problems.

The four main sections of the OSU model are an economic account, a capital account, a demographic account, and a government account. The economic account is the driving force of the model and includes a community specific input-output model and a gravity model, which is employed to determine the service area of a community. A location quotient technique is applied to a regional or state input-output model. The community model is made dynamic through the use of equations that predict final demand over time. The  capital account allows for the simulation investment and its effects on the economy. The demographic account is a typical birth, death, population projection model with migration being an equalizer to match up people with available jobs in the economic sector. The government account estimates the need for services based on community service use co-efficients. This report illustrates the model by reporting its application with the community of Holdenville, Oklahoma. (JHZ)",

Comprehensive data is lacking in virtually all these areas, suggesting the need for a balance in  research across the entire agenda. The dearth of empirical studies on rural education is so broad as to beckon inquiry from university-based researchers, government agencies, professional organizations, and educators at the school level. The end result of research should be data and analysis that will help policy makers reach informed decisions about complex issues. Interest in rural education is growing, but it is unlikely to reach its full potential until a comprehensive and inclusive research literature on education in a rural setting is forthcoming. (JHZ)",

Teacher characteristics and contextual variables which were related to these attitudes and practices were also identified. The sample consisted of 51 graduates teaching full-time in the United States who received teacher certification within five years of the study. Results indicated significant differences between the undergraduate and post-degree graduates with respect to their attitudes toward inquiry. Post-Degree Program graduates held more positive  attitudes toward inquiry-oriented laboratory preparation. No significant differences were found between the two groups in their use of inquiry or effective management practices. Teachers rated high in their use of inquiry were more likely to be perceived by students as having positive student-teacher relationships and using effective management practices. In addition, these teachers felt they had no discipline problems and worked with administrators who provided sufficient support for discipline and instruction.

How each of the three curriculums was assessed is discussed. The intended and implemented content coverage is briefly discussed, with a table showing differences between the coverage for arithmetic, algebra, geometry, statistics, and measurement for 16 countries. Differences between student and teacher indices are shown in a table. The attained curriculum is discussed in detail, including appraisal by type of items. For most countries and for most mathematics topics, intention runs  ahead of implementation. Teachers agreed with students on what had been taught in algebra and measurement, but on the other three topics there were a large number of items showing discrepant results.

Using the resources of the planetarium and the real sky, the document provides a series of lessons that are intended to enable the participants to become more knowledgeable observers of the night sky. The course is divided into five two-hour sessions. Each session is composed of two segments. The first half of each session makes use of the planetarium, while the other uses either the classroom or the real sky. One of each of the five sessions deals with: (1) the constellations; (2) the celestial sphere; (3) the solar system; (4) a visit to an observatory; and (5) the location of the moon. The sections of the document which deal with the above topics  include an overview of the topic and descriptions of all of the activities to be done at home. The appendices contain sky maps, diagrams and planetary settings for the solar system session. (TW)",

A pre-post-test design with a three-way ANOVA analysis of treatment by time within subjects was used. Neither group was found to be significantly different from the other on the pre-test. Although both groups obtained significant gains on their post-test scores as contrasted with their pre-test scores, the cooperatively goal structured classroom demonstrated significantly higher achievement post-test scores than the individualistic group. The data strongly support theories concerning the effectiveness and motivation associated with inter-group competition of small cooperating groups. (Author)",

This framework offers a way of assessing the potential strength of such policies in terms of their prescriptiveness, consistency, authority and power. The framework has been applied to policies relating to elementary school mathematics in seven states: California, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and South Carolina. These states were systematically selected from the population of 50 states; structured interviews were used to obtain as complete documentation on each state as possible. The distinctive characteristics of each state are described, with particular attention to whether the states attempt to exert control  directly over teachers or indirectly through responsibilities placed on districts. Then the characteristics of the various types of policy are compared, including policies on instructional objectives and syllabi; student testing; student placement; textbooks; time allocation; and teacher qualifications. In conclusion, the study argues that these similarities and differences among state policies are likely to have important consequences for understanding the decisions that teachers make and the opportunities for students to learn.

        "description":"Science education has received increasing attention during the 1980s in both professional and public forums. This paper addresses three questions having to do with science teaching. The first question concerns student learning in science classes. The document proposes that science achievement is generally disappointing, especially if student understanding is evaluated rather than rote memorization. Four learning activities are presented and discussed for the purpose of indicating that many student difficulties can be attributed to the fact that science learning is a complex and difficult process of conceptual change. The second question addressed concerns science teachers' skills and preparation. A synthesis of recent studies describes some of the essential skills and knowledge  that teachers need to teach successfully for conceptual change to occur in students. Unfortunately, the data indicates that most elementary and secondary school teachers lack important components of those skills and knowledge. The third question concerns how science teaching can be improved, and in the last part of the paper a variety of possibilities for improving science education through professional development and improvements in curriculum materials is discussed. An annotated bibliography is included. (Author/TW)",

After background comments on the elementary school mathematics curriculum and the role of the teacher, the report focuses on sources of influence, beginning with an overview of five studies designed to determine how policies were developed and put into practice. Insights into the nature of content policymaking indicate that policies are relatively weak and fragmented when judged against the attributes of prescriptiveness, consistency, authority, and power. Nevertheless, they have influenced teacher practice, but not standardized that  practice. Textbooks are viewed as resources, rather than as determinants of the content to teach. Little evidence exists to support the supposition that standardized tests have any important influence on teachers' content decisions, but curriculum-embedded tests do have important effects. How students, their parents, and principals affect content decisions are discussed, followed by an analysis of teacher convictions and some thoughts on curriculum. Instruments used in the studies are in the appendices. (MNS)",

This document reports on a study in which academic achievement in competitive and reward-structured environments was examined in two high school sophomore level biology classes of equal academic ability. Each class was pretested and taught an identical unit of study, one in a competitive structure and one using a cooperative structure called the Group-Investigations Model. In this model groups of 5 or 6 students are formed for the study of a particular topic, and each student works on a subtopic for the group. At the end of 7 weeks both classes were post-tested. The results indicated that although both cooperative and competitive techniques obtained significantly  higher post-test scores than their pre-test scores, neither strategy was superior to the other in producing academic achievement. Results are discussed and compared to previous studies which have examined differences between cooperatively, competitively, and individually structured classroom environments. (Author/TW)",

In the second paper, \"Technology, Pynchon, and the Meaning of Death,\" Lance Schachterle explores novelist Thomas Pynchon's critique of technology and focuses on how the fear of death is  routinized by technology. \"Literature as Technology,\" by Joseph W. Slade, the third paper, notes the similarities between science and literature. Comments and responses to the three papers are offered by Edward J. Gallagher.

        "description":"The critical role of computers in scientific advancement is described in this panel report. With the growing range and complexity of problems that must be solved and with demands of new generations of computers and computer architecture, the importance of computational mathematics is increasing. Multidisciplinary teams are needed; these are found in most advanced and industrial laboratories, but rarely in universities. The existing educational opportunities are not producing the required personnel to meet substantial shortages. Therefore, the panel strongly recommends increased federal support for: (1) research in computational mathematics, methods, algorithms, and software for scientific computing; (2) the development of interdisciplinary research teams; (3) the establishment  and continued operation of a suitable research infrastructure for the teams; (4) graduate and post-doctoral students directly involved in the research of some interdisciplinary team; and (5) young researchers and cross-disciplinary visitors. In the second section, research opportunities in a number of mathematical areas are described. New modes of research are discussed next, followed by comments on educational needs and a final section on funding considerations. Appendices contain a list of related reports, information on laboratory facilities for scientific computing, and letters and position papers. (MNS)",

        "description":"The tremendous racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity that characterizes Western societies today presents both challenges and opportunities. Ethnic conflict and tension are inevitable consequences of pluralistic societies. People must learn to live with a degree of conflict and tension in a culturally diverse nation-state. However, citizens should also formulate policy and strategies to reduce ethnic conflicts and tensions. This can be achieved by formulating and implementing educational policies that promote the structural inclusion of all ethnic, racial, and cultural groups into the nation-state. While pluralism is a challenge to Western nation-states, it is also an opportunity. It provides a source of innovation and helps a society to perceive problems in new ways and to  develop innovative solutions. Structurally excluded ethnic and cultural groups also serve as a moral conscience for the nation-state by challenging it to close the gap between its democractic ideals and its social realities. To maximize the possibilities for benefits to result from cultural and ethnic diversity, the nation-state must validate the cultures of its diverse groups and help their members to develop clear reflective, and positive cultural, national, and global identifications. Two diagrams, \"The Expanding Identifications of Students\" and \"The Stages of Ethnic and Cultural Development\" are included, as is a 23 item bibliography. (CBS)",

This paper suggests a model for looking at the research and presents results from two projects which combine qualitative and quantitative measures to examine knowledge of global issues, international attitudes, and skills of negotiation among secondary school students. The model centers on the young person as an individual and pays special attention to the influences of school and family.

        "description":"The hard-cover basal textbook continues to dominate teaching and learning in elementary social studies, particularly as a reaction to reduced budgets, the back to basics movement, state-wide testing, and criticism of less traditional teaching practices. Two problem areas encountered by children when using social studies textbooks include lack of experiential background and the inherent difficulty of social studies content. Technical concepts may have little or no meaning unless specific vocabulary or concept development lessons precede use of the text by students. In order to improve this situation, teachers should clarify their objectives and consider the teaching suggestions provided in the textbook. Teachers should also: (1) develop the required background, (2) accommodate  varying reading levels, (3) provide direct instructional help, and (4) select learning activities to help students apply and extend the major concepts. The digest contains practical suggestions for developing each of these areas and for helping students extend the textbook concepts and apply them to their own life experiences; the suggestions include using textbook maps, wall maps, and globes; explaining the concept of time; devising a social studies glossary; and explaining why a textbook is used and what should be gained from it.

        "description":"The elementary art program level 1 (grades 1 and 2), level 2 (grades 3 and 4), and level 3 (grades 5 and 6) is a unified, sequential course which focuses on 4 major concepts of visual learning. The concepts are: reflection--the response to visual forms in nature, designed objects and artworks; depiction--the development of imagery based on observation of the visual world; composition--the organization of images and their qualities in the creation of unified statements; and expression--the use of art materials as a vehicle or medium for saying something in a meaningful way. Because each content area emphasizes a different aspect of art learning, teachers can design an art lesson using any of the 4 content areas as a nucleus from which learning in the other 3 areas can evolve. It  is necessary to see the relationships among the 4 content areas so each is appropriate for the students and their programs. The first section of the guide contains the scope and achievement charts for each objective and level. The second section of the guide contains concepts for the 3 levels in each content area. Each content area evolves from a simpler to more complex learning. Because of the structure of the guide, teachers need to refer to the preceding level's building blocks before beginning on a new level. (APG)",

An overview of such current educational issues as declining enrollments, \"back to basics\" emphasis, discipline and related problems, lack of preparation time for teachers, the need for continuing education, resource support, recognition for teachers, and the need for creative and productive leadership in schools is  presented. The topic of improving social studies instruction is discussed from the standpoints of teaching strategies, learning activities, and experience. Guidelines for selecting appropriate learning activities, instructional objectives for the social studies (attitude objectives, knowledge objectives, and skills objectives), curriculum development, and instructional methodology (scope and sequence, curriculum guides, inquiry based instruction, question types, and questioning techniques) are outlined.

The Constitution is not a sacred icon formulated by immortals, but rather a changing and controversial framework guided by a diverse group of practical politicians, sensitive to their own condition, willing to compromise, and able to borrow from the best political thought in the western world. Most importantly, they learned that power must be limited and carefully watched if liberty is to be preserved. Three issues constitute the origins, pervasiveness, and the heart of the Constitution for citizenship education: (1) separation of powers and checks and balances, designed to prevent corruption and protect liberty by  intentionally and necessarily forcing the branches of government to avoid quick and simple solutions; (2) federalism, the idea that states' rights protect against encroachment of federal authority and provide a governmental forum for local citizens; and (3) civil liberties, which most easily bring to the surface the tensions between liberty and power by raising the question of protection afforded by the Bill of Rights.

The first three articles of the Constitution reveal that \"we the people\" is determined by the states as well as the crucial issue of who may vote in our representative form of government. The Northwest Ordinance, taking a more enlightened view, included many of the rights currently taken for granted but not mentioned in the forthcoming Constitution. The Bill of Rights, no matter how necessary they seem for political rights, includes nothing about the definition of citizenship and does not mention Indians or Blacks. Clearly then the Constitution and its first ten  amendments excluded many from full participation in the political process. Not until Articles 15 and 19 were ratified could Blacks and women vote. Further discussion centers on the lowering of the voting age to 18 and the failure of an anti-discrimination amendment based on sex. Finally, the notion of representative democracy requires the fullest possible participation, but large numbers of people seldom vote. Yet that refusal to vote is also a right. (TRS)",

        "description":"James Madison's thoughts on various interpretations of the Constitution maintain that public opinion is the ultimate method of legitimizing the document. The Constitution must prevail against mere public opinion, but public opinion may be used to establish the meaning of the Constitution when conflicting interpretations exist. The public good and the public will determine the outcome of conflicts. The issue of internal improvements provided the foundation for Madison's belief that the majority could interpret the Constitution as it willed and could give Congress additional powers. The constitutional amendment process is the solution to the problem; however, Madison believed that the public will was a legitimate, but potentially harmful interpreter of the document. Though his true  conception of the public's right to amend is somewhat difficult to determine, Madison hoped that the national will would be expressed by official amendments to the Constitution rather than by interpretation of it. His contradictory use of public will as constitutional interpreter is illustrated by his contrasting conclusions on the national bank and internal improvements issues; he approved the former and vetoed the latter. Madison seems to have felt that he could give in to public opinion when there was an absolute need for certain legislation, but when the need was less pressing, he would hold out for an amendment. In time, it was the United States government (Congress, the Supreme Court, and the President) which would decide when public demands are important enough to justify foregoing  the amending process.

The study documents and estimates the fertility trend of Chiang Mai's population from existing sources of data. A demographic survey, in which a random sample of 3,805 ever married women from both urban and rural areas were interviewed using the World Fertility Survey questionnaire, was conducted. The socioeconomic characteristics and attitudes towards family size of Chiang Mai's urban and rural population are compared. The findings show that fertility has fallen rapidly in all sectors of the population and the decline is attributed to the introduction of family planning programs. The study  concludes that family planning programs are one of the best possible means of slowing population growth rates to desired low levels in both urban and rural population. (SY)",

Another premise is that because leisure has such meaning in one's life it becomes a social influence from which one makes life choices in accordance with leisure-centered self-concepts. Data for the study were generated from a previous study examining the relationship between affinity toward leisure and selected variables associated with middle age. Respondents consisted of 745 adults between the ages of 30 and 57. Life satisfaction was measured by the Adams modified Life Satisfaction Index-A. In addition, respondents indicated the number of hours per week spent  in leisure, the number of different leisure-related activities participated in weekly, and completed the Leisure Ethic Scale. Results are discussed in the light of the developmental and transitional stages of the subjects of the study. (JD)",

        "description":"The multicultural and bilingual population of California will continue to increase over the next decades, and as a result, the role of multicultural and bilingual education will increase in importance. Since the 1970s improvements have occurred in instructional materials, in program evaluation, and in teacher certification to meet the needs of California's bilingual population, but the point has not yet been reached where such changes have been wholly accepted and institutionalized. Bilingual training has been viewed as a facilitative mechanism, not as something central to the overall preparation or basic mission of teachers. Education must beginned to be viewed from the perspective of the learner, regardless of his or her language or race, and include native language and culture  as the first focal point of education. The cultural and historical lessons of education will include more than those provided by Protestant America and school will concentrate on a good basic education for all, built upon a notion of a common and shared human background. The emphasis on training educational personnel in cultural diversity must be continued and expanded; more teachers from more different ethnic backgrounds must be recruited; and teacher training should be solid and stress general education, subject matter concentration, professional pedagogical preparation, and field experience at the classroom level to be taught. Finally, fundamental changes are needed at the level of State education policy to ensure more recognition of cultural diversity and more attention to the limited  English speaking student. (KH)",

Among the opportunities are: (1) to help black students retain the ways of using language that are unique to their culture, while at the same time helping them to acquire the language of instruction and political power, standard English; (2) to take on a more political role in order to gain support for Standard English as a Second Dialect programs; (3) to develop training programs to help instructors understand Afro-American language from both linguistic and cultural perspectives, and to learn techniques for supplementing this native dialect with standard English skills; (4) to refine strategies and techniques for  teaching oral language and composition skills; and (5) to improve attitudes towards linguistic differences. Major challenges include: (1) avoiding the temptation to support the institutionalization of Black English without teaching black students how to use standard English; (2) providing substantive training for teachers, which includes knowledge of language acquisition, oral language drills, and knowing how to identify and remedy miscues in writing and reading caused by the interference of Black English; and (3) applying the vast and growing body of research on Black English to the teaching of language.

        "author":["Ochoa, Alberto M."],
        "description":"As California moves to become the only large industrial State with a numerical majority composed of non-whites, the quality of education and institutional expectations for non-white children diminishes. For example, Hispanic students in California are members of the fastest growing ethnic group in the nation and in the State, but, in 1981, 77% of all Hispanic students attending California public schools were underachieving. Compared to white pupils, Hispanic students were twice as likely to repeat grades, drop out, and read below grade level. Moreover, they have limited access to curricular programs which stress college preparation, particularly in the math and science areas. Those able to enroll in college are more likely than Whites to attend two-year institutions as part-time  students. In California, only 7% of Hispanics who enter college each year are likely to receive a bachelor's degree. Similar evidence of educational inequity and neglect can be provided for Blacks and American Indians. Among the practices and policies which limit access and lessen the expected outcomes of non-white students are those that: promote monolingualism, suggest the dominant values of society to be superior to others, establish low academic expectations for students based on their social, linguistic, and economic background, view linguistic and cultural differences as deficits and problems to be remediated, and track students for limited career options. Current policies do promote equities of resources, but policies promoting equality of expectations and treatment remain to be  developed. Recommendations for practice and policy development are outlined. (KH)",

        "description":"As complaints about the lack of discipline in schools increase, more educators are turning to student conduct codes as one component of a discipline program. In setting up an effective conduct code, the top priority should be clear communication of rules. To ensure this, all relevant parties--administrators, teachers, parents, and students--should be represented when schoolwide rules are being developed. At the classroom level, teachers and students should work together to create a code consisting of no more than five or six rules consistent with schoolwide policies. Behaviors can be dealt with in three ways: (1) reinforced; (2) dealt with using constructive alternatives to punishment; or (3) punished. Rules are not followed unless consequences are applied for complying with them  and for violating them. However, if too many behaviors have punitive consequences, the punishment loses its effectiveness. At the same time, tangible reinforcements for rule-following behavior should be gradually phased out--so that such behavior will become a habit not dependent on reward. Selection of the actual consequences of bad behavior to be used in the classroom should involve student input and administrative approval, and must allow for individual student differences and promote equity. The discipline program should be reviewed and revised as necessary each year. (KH)",

Among the major findings reported are that 22.5% of the respondents said education was one of the most important issues facing Minnesota today; 83.1% rated Minnesota public schools as good or excellent; and 55.4% said increasing teacher salaries was an acceptable way to reform schools. A proposal to test  students' skills through annual standardized tests was supported by 90%, and 70% opposed statewide open enrollment policies. Three-quarters of the respondents said they would be willing to forego a portion of a proposed tax cut if the money went to improving public schools, and 64% agreed with the present State policy of giving aid to private schools through tuition tax credits and other programs. According to 68.2% of the respondents, the problems of public education today are based on the general problems of society. (KH)",

The third section synthesizes the conclusions of the first two sections, combines them with the principal findings extracted from a review of over 100 related research studies, and recommends a series of preventive  strategies. Major findings of the study are that students may be led to drop out by a combination of factors involving school environment, home-school relations, and student attitudes. Statewide, a majority of Hispanic students achieved minimum acceptable levels of performance on the MEAP. Appended are a list of participating schools, questionnaires, and procedures.

It also describes some characteristics of family householders and adult family members related to income-earning capacity, such as age, education, work disability, labor force status, occupation, and weeks worked. To illustrate how the characteristics of these families differ from or coincide with those of the majority of southern nonmetropolitan families, the report compares blacks and whites by poverty status and family type. Black families are three times as likely to be poor as white families. Southern nonmetropolitan black families, especially female householder families, continue to have a high incidence of poverty. Black family members had  much higher unemployment rates than did whites in all poverty status and family type categories. Factors associated with poverty among black families include low educational attainment, high unemployment rates, young or old age, low-wage occupations, lack of participation in the labor force, and lack of employment opportunities. Measures to help solve the poverty problem include: (1) increased and improved schooling; (2) economic development programs such as enterprise zones; (3) job training; (4) daycare for preschool children of single parents; and (5) improvements in public assistance programs.

Poverty data are cross-classified by such characteristics as race, family relationship, type of residence, education, work experience, and type of income received. Estimates in the report were developed from two sample frames: one from the 1970 census, and the other from the 1980 census. General findings are described in a brief introduction, but the bulk of the report consists of statistical tables, organized into three groups: trends in poverty population, persons, and families. A major finding was that the poverty rate declined for both whites and blacks between 1983 and 1984. No statistically  significant changes were recorded in the number or percent of Spanish-origin persons in poverty. Between 1983 and 1984, the total number of poor families declined as did the number of poor married-couple families. The number of persons below the poverty level and the poverty rate declined in the South and West Regions, while the Northeast and Midwest Regions did not experience any significant changes. The poverty rate for the South was 16.2 percent, higher than any other region. Four appendices consist of: definitions, explanation, and discussion of the comparability of data; description of the source and reliability of data; an analysis of the problem of underreporting of income; and facsimiles of the March 1985 current Population Survey questionnaires.

Companies vary in their approach to training, ranging from highly informal to highly formal. The many new trends in industrial training may be analyzed in four dimensions: in-house education programs, educational and training facilities, degree-granting institutions, and satellite universities. Most employers responding to a National Center for Research in Vocational Education survey on trends in industrial training state that technology dictates the initial outline of training needs. Training was found to occur both in-house and at the customer's site. Popular training trends included teletraining, computer-based training, creative uses of  videodiscs, touch-screen data entry techniques, increased use of adult education techniques, interpersonal and similar skills training, and small-group training. Vocational training programs for skilled workers must keep pace with the constantly changing needs of industry, help students develop preemployment qualifications, avoid adopting or clinging to provincial attitudes and practices that are inconsistent with the realities affecting firms hiring vocational graduates, and prepare workers to assume more responsibility for updating themselves as new technological developments and practices affect their occupations.

The sample included 408 respondents (60 percent of the 677 DISCOVER and SIGI sites surveyed). Multivariate log-linear models were used to analyze data in five areas of systems use, and univariate analyses were used in two other areas. Results suggested that institutionally  based factors, not software-based factors, were largely determining how DISCOVER and SIGI were used. However, it was noted that software-based factors, such as system theory bases, might be emphasized more by researchers, developers, and practitioners in order to maximize the impact of computer-assisted career guidance systems.

        "description":"Cognitive structuring was implemented by showing 30 subjects a 10-minute videotape that presented Holland's (1985) model of the world of work before they used an interactive computer-assisted guidance system (DISCOVER). The effect of prior structuring was assessed in terms of a subject's representation of the world of work, occupational certainty, and vocational identity. The subjects were 90 volunteer clients who came to a university career resource center for vocational counseling. Two treatment groups and a control group were used: pretest, cognitive structuring, and DISCOVER; pretest and DISCOVER; and DISCOVER only. The results indicated that subjects who assimilated the Holland model prior to using DISCOVER were more homogeneous in sorting 36 randomly selected occupations  into related clusters and were more homogeneous in the number of occupational alternatives they listed on a posttest. Subjects who used DISCOVER without cognitive structuring became significantly more assured of their vocational identity (i.e., goals, interests, personality), while the cognitive structuring group did not become so assured. Occupational certainty was unaffected by any treatment. The cognitive structuring experience prior to subjects' use of DISCOVER encouraged them to add occupations to consider when they had few alternatives and to eliminate occupations to consider when they had many. The use of cognitive structuring and DISCOVER may therefore prove useful in vocational counseling of adults, although more research is needed. (Author/KC)",

This technical report highlights similarities and differences between the two computer-assisted guidance systems so that service providers may make informed choices concerning the adoption of such systems. The following features were compared: (1) user friendliness (human factors), (2) information for career decision making, (3) decision processes on which programs are based, (4) support materials, (5) differential cost analysis, and (6) limitations. The bulk of the report consists of tables that compare the two systems on these six factors and sub-elements of them. The information about the systems was  gathered from the manuals provided by the respective firms (American College Testing Program and Educational Testing Service) that market them, interviews with the firms' staff members, and the collective experiences of the authors as they and their clients interacted with the systems. Cost estimates for the two systems are given, but no conclusions about the relative superiority of either of the systems are offered. (KC)",

The introduction discusses the purposes of drawing together the case studies--to indicate how Australian government policy concerned with school-to-work transition was implemented at the local level and to make an assessment of the success of such local initiatives. The case study focuses on the Enterprise Education program for year 10 students, which consisted of study in the core areas as well as projects based on specific business ventures. In addition to describing methods used to construct the case study, the document portrays how such a program was conceived, put into action, and now fits into the school's everyday  activities. Teacher and administrator comments and narratives describe getting started, curriculum decision-making procedures, planning process, finalizing planning, characteristics of the initiation phase, coordinators' roles, and use of core teachers (English and social studies, mathematics, science). Views of students and unit supervisors are then provided. Evaluation information is provided in terms of the original aims of the program.

The basic building block required for analysis of most of these topics is the collection and recording of basic client-level data by supported employment  projects around the country on program participants, services provided, and outcomes experienced by clients. The issue of consistency versus variation as it applies to developing a data collection strategy and implementation plan is discussed. The questions of who collects data, maintains a client-level database, aggregates the data and generates summary reporting measures, and analyzes the data are addressed. Also covered are timing issues and perspectives on project and state accountability.

It discusses partnerships and presents suggested procedures for establishing partnerships. Nine action plans that represent a variety of innovative approaches to partnerships are highlighted. The guide also illustrates a common  model for program content. Each component of the model that may be carried out by the service delivery area or one or more service-providers or contractors and can involve CBOs and vocational school counseling programs is described. An outline for a training activity related to CBO/vocational education/JTPA partnerships is provided that can be used to develop a local workshop or seminar. Appendixes include directories of state directors of vocational education and of adult education, descriptions of nine CBOs, information on and addresses for the National Network for Curriculum Coordination in Vocational-Technical Education, and sample forms.

        "author":["Kerka, Sandra"],
        "description":"Recent advances in cognitive psychology provide insights into thinking processes and learning behavior that can help teachers prepare students for the demands of the workplace. Studies of successful students have found that the depth of their information processing is directly related to the quality of their learning outcomes. That is, more successful students classify, compare, contrast, analyze, and synthesize information with the goal of comprehension rather than memorization. The importance of individual cognitive differences suggests that students should be taught the cognitive processes or strategies that contribute to successful performance. Therefore, the content of vocational education needs to be expanded to include problem-solving, self-monitoring, and learning skills.  Vocational education should teach an integrated knowledge base of generic core concepts, procedures, pattern recognition, and specific vocational skills. Vocational educators can accomplish this by specifying cognitive skills as explicit goals or objectives; combining direct, indirect, and introspective instructional strategies; integrating strategies to help students learn by rule, discovery, and reflection; and serving as mediators for students as they think about thinking and the successful and unsuccessful thinking processes that they use. Curriculum planners should bear these same concerns in mind when developing learning and problem-solving strategies for curriculum components and selecting curriculum materials. (MN)",

        "author":["Harrison, Cheryl"],
        "description":"Disruptive behavior, which can range from tardiness to violence against classmates or staff members, is a growing problem in adult basic education (ABE). Many feel that this is because ABE programs have begun serving young adults below the age of 18 who are quite different from their more mature classmates both psychologically and emotionally. Five basic techniques that ABE instructors can use to minimize classroom disruption in a positive manner are (1) communicating that the teacher is aware of everything occurring within the room; (2) demonstrating smoothness, both within a lesson and in transitions between lessons; (3) altering groups frequently and holding groups accountable for their own learning; (4) arousing challenges; and (5) providing seat work variety and challenge.  The instructionally effective program is not only academically successful, but safe as well, and the key to an instructionally effective school is a committed, active leader. ABE programs can change in a way that limits disruptive student behavior. The commitment to change must be headed by a strong academic and disciplinary leader, and staff cooperation is vital. Even if age segregation of students is not deemed necessary, educators must still be sensitive to the different stages of adulthood and must learn how to address the distinctive concerns of each age group of adult students served by a particular program.

        "description":"Because career development is a lifelong process, adults frequently need career planning assistance. The adult education classroom is a natural environment for individuals to seek and receive help with career planning. Given the heterogeneity of the adult population, the career development needs of adults vary widely. While many adults only need information in order to make career decisions, others need help in developing more positive self-images, increasing their ability to use resources, and improving their decision-making skills. Although many career development activities should be carried out in conjunction with a counselor, teachers may appropriately engage in activities that support or enhance adult career planning by (1) planning and providing appropriate instructional  activities and (2) serving as a source of information about other career development and planning services. In the area of instruction, adult educators can provide attitudinal support and knowledge by including information and experiences that link educational activities to specific vocational or occupational tasks. Because teachers have ongoing contact with their students, they can play a key role in helping adults access and use career planning information and can also serve as &quot;networkers&quot; who provide links between adult career development and counseling services, both within the institution and the community.

        "description":"Research indicates that the family has a great influence on a child's employment and educational decisions. Family-oriented career development programs are needed for several reasons. Parents indirectly increase their children's career options and career development by enhancing their own employability and career planning skills. Research documents the influence of parental role models; because children are generally in closer contact with parents or other family members than with anyone else, family members are in a good position to serve as resource persons for their children. A wide variety of family-oriented career development programs, each focusing on audience-specific needs, is required. Audience-specific programs could be designed to address the needs posed by the  employment outlook in a given geographical area, a special need (such as limited English ability), or a given disability. Practitioners can respond to the need for family-oriented career education by developing a comprehensive plan for counselor interventions that revolves around helping young adults recognize the influence of family and increase their personal autonomy through a three-step exploration of self, educational/occupational information, and relationships with family and significant others. The parental role in the career development process should be a dual one that involves serving as a guide or resource person for one's own children and an advocate of increased career educational opportunities for all children.

        "description":"A study examined the feasibility of using television to promote adult literacy and adult basic education (ABE) in South Africa. Following a review of the literature on the experience abroad in using television to promote adult literacy, a preliminary report arguing the case for using television to promote adult literacy and ABE in South Africa was prepared and sent to a wide range of specialists and practitioners in the field for their comments. Although the project aroused the interest and support of a majority of the consultants, reservations and arguments raised against the project were substantial. Therefore, execution of the project in its original form could not be recommended. However, because the consultants were unanimous in their feeling that using television to promote  ABE is urgently needed, it was recommended that serious consideration be given to the possibility of establishing a research and resource center to support adult literacy and ABE programs in industry. Appendixes to this report make up nearly half the document. They include the literature review on experience abroad in using television in ABE; the preliminary report on the use of television in education and training; data on the distribution of formal education levels among adults in South Africa, the changing structure of the working population, and the occupational structure of the South African labor force; and an assessment of the need for literacy in industry.

          "And Others"],
        "description":"The purpose of this pilot study was to describe the participation of farm women in farm work in one California country. Women from 228 farms, approximately 55 percent of the farms in Yolo County, California, were interviewed by telephone concerning their efforts and roles on the family farm. The study found that the main criterion of whether or not the women actively participate on the farm appears not to be farm size as much as the need for the extra work women supply as part of the family unit. Thus, the woman is less likely to be involved in the operation when labor can be sufficiently tapped through the husband, the male children, the extended family, or hired help. On the other hand, if such sources of labor are unavailable or if the husband has an off-farm job, then the  woman can be expected to have a greater degree of involvement in each of the three dimensions of farming: decision making, production tasks, and management support services. The study also found that women who are more involved tend to be better educated, younger, and more cognizant of problems encountered by farm women. They are also more likely to live on the farm and to perceive technology as having increased female activity in farming. The study concluded that women participate in farming much more than is generally recognized. Given current trends, their involvement in both decision making and task participation will continue to grow. Besides these two crucial areas, women contribute to farming by working outside jobs to help support marginal farm operations.

The task force formulated 23 recommendations pertaining to program administration, curriculum, resources and supportive services, and staff training and certification. Included among these were the following: state and local policy should provide for student  transportation to clinical work sites, HOE program managers should take immediate steps to form affiliations with health care delivery sites, deviations from program standards should be assessed systematically to determine their impact on students in HOE, consideration should be given to the idea of offering academically oriented students credit for early exploration of health occupations careers, health industry and HOE teacher salary scales should be monitored regularly to keep the two competitive, and the HOE teacher's certificate renewal process should be relevant to the teaching task and technical area.

Two major sources were used to compile information about standard, pilot, revised, and developing basic skills programs: (1) data files from the Training and Doctrine Command, Enlisted Master File, and Defense Manpower Document Center; and (2) field visits to Army posts in the United States, Germany, and Panama. During these visits, program activities were observed and administrators, teachers, participants, graduates, noncommissioned officers, and commanders were administered questionnaires and interviewed. The studies found that all programs improve soldiers' basic skills; however, many soldiers graduate from basic skills programs without achieving criterion scores on  standard tests. Soldiers show greater enthusiasm for job-related curricula than for materials lacking military content and express positive opinions about teachers. Factors common to all programs that may influence their effectiveness are teachers' lack of specialized training and experience, the wide range of skill levels within classes, and reduced resources and personnel turbulence resulting from the low-bid system. The Department of the Army can use the findings of this evaluation to guide future decisions concerning the Basic Skills Education Program. (KC)",

Title II-A, which accounts for about 50 percent of the funds appropriated under JTPA, provides job training for the economically disadvantaged. The report is based on management information and direct observations from 25 local service delivery areas (SDAs) in 15 states, together with telephone interviews with key JTPA officials in a separate group of 32 SDAs. During the October 1983-June 1984 period of the study, the SDAs under study substantially outperformed the Federal standards regarding placement rates and cost per placement for adults and welfare recipients. Some 68 percent of adult enrollees obtained jobs, bettering the standard  of 55 percent, as did 60 percent of welfare recipients, compared to a 39 percent standard. However, the average wage ae per adult placement of $4.80 fell below the Federal standard of $4.91. Moreover, the SDAs did not meet the Federal standards for positive terminations of youth, attaining 74 percent instead of the 82 percent called for. JTPA management practices generally led to a better public image for employment and training programs. However, SDAs were most likely to fund relatively simple and brief training programs and to have high-but-hidden administrative costs. The implementation of JTPA has resulted in an emphasis on helping those most likely to be employed to take the last few steps needed for placement. However, it has chosen to pay less attention to those who need the most  help in finding work. The key role of business representatives resulted in more efficiency but removed attempts to help those most in need. (KC)",

Two new dimensions were added to the discussion: the effects of race and of educational background on lifetime labor force behavior. The new figures were calculated from information collected in the Current Population Survey. The worklife expectancy of adult men held relatively steady, while that of women continued to edge upward. For both sexes, indications were that many retirement decisions were being reversed. Race seemed to have more bearing on worklife patterns of men than of women. Minority men were both more likely to leave the labor force and less likely to reenter than whites. The racial differential for women affected timing of movement more than it did  overall volume. Educational attainment was the more important factor affecting worklife patterns of women. Women appeared to reap twice as much \"payoff\" from additional schooling as do men. Their additional training appeared to drive up the opportunity costs of alternative activities, encouraging longer and more continuous careers for those who pursued higher education. For both sexes, higher education was associated with later retirement. (Twenty-two tables present the analyzed data. A technical appendix describes methodology.) (YLB)",

A reader survey of the audience of the three FOCUS Bulletins highlighting the 309/310 projects that were published by the project between November 1985 and March 1986 collected information on readership, readers' interests, and effectiveness (how well information provided matched reader interests). Following the narrative portion of the final report are the descriptions of the 21 exemplary projects. These contain name, area, project director, year,  organization, issue, contact, telephone, audience, panel review, sub-area, components, cost, and comments. Copies of the three bulletins and a copy of the evaluation form for the bulletins are also provided. (YLB)",

        "description":"Unfortunately, many students have negative feelings toward mathematics that can lead to math anxiety and subsequent poor performance in or avoidance of mathematics classes. These feelings may have been brought about by negative math classroom experiences, negative parental attitudes toward math, or societal stereotyping of mathematics. The notions that math (1) is a male domain and (2) requires logic, not intuition, are both myths. The learning of mathematics is a developmental process that takes time and practice. Negative attitudes toward or anxiety over mathematics can be altered by establishing a supportive classroom environment, using concrete manipulative materials to help bridge the gap between concrete learning and abstract thought, using a variety of teaching techniques,  and addressing the student's personal attitudes toward math. (This guide includes a worksheet that is intended to assist students in confronting their math anxiety. It contains information on how to take charge of one's own study, classroom, and test environments; create success; and distinguish the facts about learning math from the myths.) (MN)",

The centers selected in this study represent a 10 percent random sample of centers in the United States as of January 1979. Results of the survey indicated that one-half of the examinees were 21 years old or younger. Nearly 70 percent of the candidates had completed the 10th grade or higher before leaving school. More than 75 percent reported grades of &quot;C&quot; or higher  while enrolled in high school. About 80 percent of the examinees did prepare in some manner for the tests; however, actual reported out-of-pocket expenses for preparation were relatively low. Further, 90 percent reported that they regularly read books, magazines, or newspapers, and 60 percent cited &quot;general knowledge&quot; as their most important reason for reading.

A study was conducted to assess the impact that passing the GED tests has on adults' employment and participation in educational activities. During April and May of 1980, the GED Testing Service collected data on a nationally representative sample of 12,646 GED candidates. Approximately 75 percent of this sample agreed to participate in a follow-up study. In October 1981, a 20 percent random sample of this group (N=1906) were surveyed with a response rate of 24 percent (N=458). Results indicated that 71 percent of the respondents passed the test in April or May of 1980 with an  additional 15 percent passing during the 18 months prior to the follow-up survey. The GED candidates were extremely positive about their GED experience, since 95 percent would probably take the tests again if they were starting over. More people expected the GED to help them achieve a new job (75 percent) than improve their situation (e.g., salary increase) in their current job (about 30 percent). In fact, the GED credential was more helpful to these people in obtaining a new job (52 percent) than in improving their situation in their current job (about 20 percent). More people expected the GED credential to help in attaining admittance to educational institutions (51 percent) than to on-the-job training (24 percent). During the 18 months following the initial survey, 45 percent of the  respondents were students in some type of educational program. More than 75 percent plan to attend an educational program in the future. The survey instrument is appended. (Author/KC)",

The budgets are based on national weighted average estimates of all costs associated with the particular enterprise. Cash receipts are also weighted and show expected sales for the given average yield.

        "description":"Almost one-sixth of all U.S. farming households suffered net income losses in 1984, while about one-ninth had total incomes of more than $60,000. This disparity in a relatively high income year for the agricultural sector as a whole demonstrated the importance of income distribution in determining the overall financial well-being of farm operators and their households. Most of the average farming household's income earned on the farm came in the form of the rental value of farm dwellings, home consumption of farm-produced food, and wages and benefits operators paid themselves and their household. In 1984, about three-fifths of the total income earned by farming households came from off-farm sources. The income gap between farm operator households and nonfarm households had  narrowed somewhat over time, but farm operator household incomes were still generally lower. Average incomes tended to mask differences, however, because farm households had a higher proportion of households in both the lowest and highest income group than did nonfarm households. More than two-fifths of all U.S. farms had total annual sales of less than $10,000. Farms in the Delta States had the lowest average incomes in 1984, Pacific States farms the highest. (YLB)",

Breimyer) is a structured argument for comprehensive tax reform that increases the equity of the income tax system among farmers. &quot;A Comparison of Effects of the Current Tax Law through the Tax Reform Act of 1984 and the 1985 Proposed Tax Act on Commercial Farms in Texas, Mississippi, and Illinois&quot; (Clair J. Nixon, James W. Richardson) presents a mathematical programming model of farms representing southern and midwestern agriculture. &quot;Tax and Agricultural Policy: Interlinkages and Reform&quot; (Kenneth Baum, et al.) provides a comprehensive examination of  tax policy and commodity policy interrelationships. &quot;Farmer Preferences for Tax Reform Issues Using Multi-Chotomous Logit Analysis&quot; (Daniel M. Otto, Gregory D. Hanson) presents a large survey of farmer attitudes toward tax reform and tax policy effects in agriculture. &quot;Effects of Income Tax Reform on Agriculture: Review and New Evidence&quot; (Sermin D. Hardesty, Hoy F. Carman) evaluates symposium findings within the context of research regarding agricultural response to changing income tax law. (YLB)",

Measures of net operating margin, net cash income to the farm family unit, and equity are employed as indicators of a farm operator's financial strength. Effects of interest expenses on cash income are also examined. A discussion of research objectives precedes a review of related studies of the financial condition of U.S. farmers. The next two sections define the net operating margin criterion and its use in evaluating the financial condition of farm businesses or enterprises and define income to the family unit, or cash available for family living and principal repayment or investment, and its use in assessing the farm family  unit's financial condition. The following two sections examine the effects of interest expenses on cash income and assess a farm's ability to withstand negative income shocks based on its net worth or equity. The conclusions section cites heterogeneity among U.S. agricultural producers as a major problem confounding farm policy and policy analysis and shows that about 345,000 producers had negative family cash income (FCI), 310,000 had FCI greater than $40,000, and 68,000 had FCI over $100,000.

        "description":"Research analyzed adoption of erosion control practices by farm operators in two counties in each of four states: Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee, and Washington. Analysis was based on farm survey data and technical and financial assistance information from county Soil Conservation Service (SCS) and Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service records. Factors affecting farmers' adoption of soil conservation practices varied by owned and rented land and by state. The differences among states, tenure classes, and various dependent variables left little basis for a model that could predict adoption of practices in the areas studied. Each state contained unique characteristics; therefore, no uniform guidelines for erosion control programs appeared appropriate. Some variables  were common. Strong statistical agreement was indicated that rented land on the farms surveyed was not enrolled in the erosion control targeting program at the same rate as was owned land. Previous conservation efforts and participation in previous SCS programs had a generally significant and positive effect on adoption. Other variables provided mixed signals as to strength and direction of impact on adoption. (YLB)",

        "description":"Two issues were analyzed--the changing characteristics of early pension recipients and the costs of early retirement. The analyses covered men and women aged 50 and older and were based primarily on data from the Census Bureau's March 1984 Current Population Survey. Findings showed that the percentage of the population receiving employer-sponsored pensions at ages younger than 65 had increased rapidly. Individuals with employer-sponsored pension income had much lower labor-force participation rates than nonrecipients of the same age and sex. While the majority of early pension recipients who did not work appeared to be voluntarily retired, a significant minority below age 62 had retired due to disability or poor health. Early retirement represented a potentially significant loss  in federal tax revenues. Some recent legislative changes reduced incentives for early retirement and removed obstacles to older worker employment. Additional proposed changes would further remove some financial incentives to retire early in public and private plans. The importance of the adoption of further public policies to encourage later retirement was seen as depending not only on future economic growth but also on unforeseeable economic or demographic circumstances that might alter the current view of what policies will be needed in the next century.

        "description":"This paper defines professional certification as a voluntary process regulated by a profession to measure competencies possessed by its practitioners. A hierarchy of motives for certification is illustrated, and its importance for the fields of adult education and human resource development (HRD) is emphasized. The evolution of the concept of professionalization is presented from four perspectives: philosophical, nontraditional, characteristic, and developmental. Adult education and HRD's status as professions is examined, and the attempts of these fields to develop a fully accepted body of knowledge, a set of practitioner competencies, and a program of professional certification are described. The paper addresses such certification issues as type of administrative approach,  identification and validation of competencies, evaluation criteria, grandfathering, recertification, and revocability. Also discussed are positive implications (enhancement of the profession, recognition and increased earning potential for practitioners, and standardization) and negative implications (fragmentation, financial and human costs, and legal difficulties). Finally, the following nine-stage model for developing a professional certification program is presented: (1) identification of purposes or motives, (2) identification of essential competencies, (3) establishment of procedures, (4) identification of prospective candidates, (5) response to identified issues, (6) establishment of criteria, (7) marketing of the program, (8) evaluation and modification of the program, and (9)  remarketing of the program.

        "description":"This monograph examines factors associated with adults' nonparticipation in organized learning. A deterrent to participation is defined as a reason contributing to an adult's decision not to engage in learning activities. First, existing models and theories that attempt to explain participation behavior are described. These include three recent approaches that attempted to combine dispositional, situational, and environmental factors into composite models of participation: Rubenson's Recruitment Paradigm, Cross' Chain-of-Response Model, and Darkenwald and Merriam's Psychosocial Interaction Model. The literature review explores the effect on participation of demographic and nondemographic variables. Because the research shows that these variables of and by themselves are not  deterrents to participation, the monograph explores the evolution and refinement of the factors affecting educational participation and concludes that (1) \"deterrents\" is a multidimensional concept encompassing clusters of variables; (2) these variables are influenced by the prospective learners' perceptions of their magnitude; and (3) the impact of these variables on behavior varies according to individual characteristics and life circumstances. The last section addresses strategies to overcome these deterrents, including specific examples of successful approaches to stimulating participation, particularly among reentry women, the elderly, the educationally disadvantaged, and rural adults.

        "description":"Vocational education is an important component of the bridge leading from school to employment for special needs youth. Studies indicate that special needs youth are not being adequately prepared for work. Unemployment and underemployment of special needs youth seem to stem from three causes: lack of interpersonal skills, lack of job-related academic skills, and lack of specific vocational skills. Besides vocational education, the other major components of the school-to-work transition are special education, vocational rehabilitation, Job Training Partnership Act agencies, and developmental disabilities agencies. The services available from these agencies, together with information from studies on the employment preparation of special needs youth, should be carefully considered  in determining the role of vocational education in the transition process. Suggested roles include (1) assisting with assessment of interests and skills; (2) providing a setting for occupational exploration; (3) assisting with basic academic skills instruction; (4) developing job-related interpersonal skills; (5) training in clusters of vocationally related skills; and (6) providing work experiences. Proposed program models for delivering instruction in interpersonal, basic academic, and specific vocational skills promote a comprehensive approach to address each skill area. Typical forms include a separate vocational special needs class, regular vocational classes with support materials, regular vocational classes with resource teachers, and regular vocational classes in cooperation with  the special education classroom.

Five crucial factors in effective programs are identified. \"Equity and Legal Issues in Correctional Education\" by Paul Moke discusses inmates' right to treatment, freedom from illegal conditions of confinement, equity for females, educational access  for special populations, and constitutional and statutory duties of correctional educators. In \"The Learning Handicapped Adult Offender,\" Robert B. Rutherford, Jr., and C. Michael Nelson address the legal mandate for serving this population, prevalence of handicapping conditions, and components of effective programs. In the fourth chapter, John W. Waidley focuses on \"Vocational Education, Industries, and Career Education in Corrections.\" Societal beliefs regarding work and its ability to \"cure\" criminals and prevent recidivism are examined.

The paper next reviews recent national reports on education, focusing on what these reports say about vocational education. Because vocational education's traditional role no longer appears viable, a new role is proposed--the development of balanced occupational programs that enable students to acquire broad, transferable skills for employment and personal use. The modifications this will require in vocational institutions are outlined. The remainder of  this paper describes one approach to this new mission--New York State's restructured secondary vocational curriculum. Discussed first is the process whereby the new diploma requirements and occupational education sequences were developed. Detailed descriptions of the new program include foundations in grades K-6, programs in grades 9 through 12, and occupationally related courses for general education credit. The descriptions include key skills and competencies, scheduling options, sequence requirements, and discussion of state standards and modifications in teacher education.

        "description":"The mission of vocational education has always been to provide a skilled work force for society. As society and work evolve through the influence of demographic, social, economic, technological, and political changes, the essential purposes of vocational education must be made appropriate for the emerging advanced technical society. To devise scenarios for creating preferred alternative futures, a combination of three perspectives can be used. The futuristic perspective involves assessing society and work by forecasting what can be, what is likely to be, and what should be. In the holistic perspective, an audit of current conditions considers the implications of a global economy, international competition, and scientific advances for vocational education. The outcomes perspective  is derived from research on outcomes of education that yields new criteria for evaluation of education and training. From these perspectives, alternatives can be developed involving increased or diminished emphasis on vocational education. Staffing the education and training system of the future thus revolves around such issues as vocational teacher supply and demand, recruitment, and retention. The transition to an advanced technical society necessitates the redesign of the education and training system through (1) policy targeted at research and human resource development, (2) leadership that can implement the concepts of strategic planning to create visions and preferred scenarios, and (3) cooperation of a broad range of institutions and education and training providers in the  realization of these visions.

A study was conducted to explore continuity in intellectual functioning over time in advanced old age, continuity in life satisfaction during the same period, the relationship between these two constructs, and how they are affected by whether the subjects are young-old, old-old, or very-old. Subjects were from the Berkeley Older Generation Study and were the parents of the 1928-1929 Guidance Study and Berkeley Growth Study children. In 1968-1969 and again in 1982-1983, subjects completed: (1) the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale; (2) a life satisfaction measure rating zest versus apathy, resolution and  fortitude, congruence of goals, self-concept, and mood tone; and (3) five measures of intellectual functioning (intelligence, mental alertness, speed of mental processes, accuracy in thinking, and use of language). At the last follow-up, 61 subjects were aged 75-84 (old-old) and 29 subjects were aged 85-93 (very-old). The results revealed important changes in intellectual functioning and continuity in life satisfaction in advanced old age. Declines were found for most of the oldest people, yet individual differences were apparent in both the old-old and the very-old groups. No predictive relationship between life satisfaction and intelligence over time was found. Future research will examine possible sex differences, the influence of the constructs of such variables as health, and the  possibility of non-linearity over time. (NB)",

Interviews conducted in 1968-1969 (young-old) and in 1982-1984 (old-old) collected in-depth information on friendship patterns and involvement in community activities, health, marital status, church attendance, and family relationships. The results regarding social relationships revealed a general  pattern of continuing involvement, with 74% of subjects showing no decrease in involvement from young-old (60-75) to old-old age (85+ years). There was continued social involvement with no changes in the amount of club activity or church attendance or in the sociability or importance older persons gave to friendship. Sex differences were found, with men being significantly less likely than women to report that they still wanted friends; they also reported fewer new friends and less contact with friends. A comparison of the old-old (75-84) with the very-old revealed that involvement outside the family was lower for the oldest individuals and that such involvement declined over time for both groups. These results suggest that social relationships are highly variable in the years of old age.  While there was stability for the group as a whole, individual differences were striking. (NB)",

        "description":"Since the early 1950's the principal prescriptive model in the psychological study of decision making has been maximization of Subjective Expected Utility (SEU). This SEU maximization has come to be regarded as a description of how people go about making decisions. However, while observed decision processes sometimes resemble the SEU model, decisions appear to be made in an intuitive manner much more frequently. An alternative decision theory is called Image Theory. In this theory, four images (self, trajectory, projected and action) are parts of an overall scheme the decision maker has about what he/she is doing and why. Self-image refers to one's principles; trajectory image to the agenda of goals; projected image to the time table for achieving goals; and action image to the  roster of plans for achieving goals. Decisions are adoption decisions or progress decisions. Decisions are made like the SEU model, or in most cases, on the basis of how well the potential adoptee (a candidate goal or plan) is compatible with the principles of the self-image, the goals that already exist on the trajectory image, and in the case of plans, the plans that already exist on the action image. This compatibility governs most decisions. Several research studies on decision making have demonstrated the importance of compatibility and self-image. It must be recognized that people's on-line self-image, their principles, wield power over their actions. (ABL)",

        "description":"Cognitive psychology has been considered to be at the vortex of a revolution in psychology. Schools of humanism and existentialism were originally needed as reactions to the narrowness of behaviorism. The &quot;reactions&quot; in psychology continue to be relevant and needed, particularly existential psychology. The qualities of consiousness in existential and cognitive psychology illustrate the differing views of human reasoning. Three qualities are fundamental to existentialism and phenomenology: (1) the ability to be aware of or reflect upon one's self or existence; (2) the ability to voluntarily direct one's thought and actions; and (3) the goal-directed or telic nature of consciousness. Consciousness appears to have two general meanings for the cognitive scientist: consciousness of  one's environment and consciousness of one's self (metacognition). Cognitive psychology relies on demonstrative or logical reasoning. Existential psychology emphasizes dialectical reasoning. If consciousness is a foundational conception for both cognitive and existential psychology as exponents claim, then wide differences exist in general theorizing. Cognitive scientists have succeeded in drawing psychology's attention to the mind, but their explanations seem to merely extend the deterministic, mechanistic, and demonstrative assumptions of behaviorism. The key to unlocking a consciousness that is truly aware, responsible, and intentional is to add dialectical reasoning to one's explanation of human mentation. (ABL)",

        "description":"Life event measurement in the Arizona State University Life Events and Aging project includes monthly assessments of both major and small life events. Major events are measured using a 96-item Psychiatric Epidemiological Research Instrument (PERI) Major Life Events Scale which concentrates on health issues and events in the experiential domain of older adults. Small events are assessed using a 199-item Older Adults Version of the Inventory of Small Life Events (ISLE). Both scales contain items in the areas of social life, finances, household, love and marriage, crime and legal matters, health and illness, employment, and school. The PERI also contains a section on family while the ISLE contains sections on children and grandchildren, extended family, recreation, religion, and  transportation. The addition of a small events measure has several advantages over research measuring only major events. Preliminary data from 239 subjects showed a high test-retest correlation for both major and small health events from the first to second interview. Other findings revealed that: (1) three-quarters of the recurrent undesirable small events were due to health events; (2) event indices properly reflected group assignments for bereaved subjects (N=61), disabled subjects (N=62), and controls (N=123); and (3) there was a consistent relationship between major health events and both factors of the mental health construct.

The results indicated that high stress was associated with high social support. Other findings suggest that high stress interferes with vocational exploration and certainty regarding one's tentatively chosen field of study. The present results offer some validity of the PDI. Attitudes toward men and women, however, seemed relatively free from bias resulting from life stress.

A study was conducted to examine the effect of smoking counselors on the initial impressions of potential clients, both nonsmoking and smoking, and to determine these subjects' expectations of therapeutic gain. Subjects were 27 smoking and 27 nonsmoking female undergraduates who were randomly assigned to conditions and counselors. Subjects viewed a videotape of a male counselor in  either a smoking or nonsmoking condition in a counseling session with an off-camera female client. Subjects completed the Counselor Rating Form, a modified Counselor Confidence Ratings form, the Relationship Inventory, and a post-experimental questionnaire. The results revealed that neither the counselor's nor the subject's smoking had any bearing on the subject's judgments concerning the counselor's personal characteristics, subject's expectancies for obtaining help with specific problems, perceived quality of the client-therapist relationship, or subject's judgments of the therapist as an emerging counselor.

Subjects were asked to describe  their impressions of the therapist from seeing the office and hearing a description of the counseling situation. The results revealed that the \"No smoking\" request had no influence on the subjects' impressions and that low stress subjects were more willing to self-disclose. Subjects reported feeling that female therapists were more qualified, but high stress subjects felt less safe with female therapists than with male therapists. Males generally felt safer with therapists than females did. (Implications for practitioners and for research are discussed.) (Author/NB)",

This study investigated the hypothesis that stress caused by a technological disaster would be higher months after the incident than stress following a natural disaster. Levels of stress and feelings of helplessness were compared for three subject groups: (1) 27 residents of a community immediately adjacent to a leaking toxic waste dump; (2) 23 residents of a community which had been flooded; and (3) a demographically similar comparison group (n=27). Stress was measured using the Symptom  Checklist: 90R (a self-report measure of emotional and physiologic distress), a proofreading task as a performance measure, and analyses of urinary catecholamines measuring physiological arousal. Questionnaires of life events, demographics, and background characteristics were used to control for other sources of stress. The results revealed that residents of the landfill neighborhood exhibited higher levels of stress across self-report, behavioral, and biochemical domains of measurement than did residents of either the flood neighborhood or the comparison neighborhood. These landfill residents also reported feelings of helplessness more frequently than did flood victims or the comparison group. Although this disaster study was essentially a case study, the hypothesis that technological  disasters are more likely to cause chronic stress than are natural disasters was supported. (ABL)",

A study was conducted to determine whether preschool children's ability to correctly access a cognitive network about alcoholic beverages can be related to differences in family exposure to alcohol. Preschoolers (N=57) between the ages of 2.5 and 6 years were asked to try to identify nine substances first by smell alone and then again with photographs as cues. Three of the substances were beer, wine, and whiskey. Parents completed a Food and Beverage Questionnaire and a demographic questionnaire. The results demonstrated that virtually all of the preschoolers were able to provide accurate verbal labels for substances used primarily by adults that were presented only by smell. Older  children performed better on the task than did younger children, although nearly all of the children were successful at correctly identifying at least one of the three alcoholic beverages. Children with heavier drinking parents correctly identified alcoholic beverages by smell more accurately, and with fewer cues, than did children from homes where less drinking occurred. These results demonstrated that the development of cognitive structures for alcohol occurs very early in the child's life. These findings have serious prevention implications and suggest that models of adolescent deviance probably need to take greater account of earlier individual differences in learning and the cognitive consequences that result from such differences.

In the second half of the document, the concepts of cultural harmony and conflict are introduced and contrasted to ambiguity. The treatment of ambiguity is shown to be a key to understanding the differences between these first two paradigms. It is noted that ambiguity also points to a blindspot, an essential third paradigm as yet unexplored by organizational cultural researchers.  A way out of the dilemma caused by the existence of these competing paradigms is offered.

        "description":"This report presents a practical guide to the prevention of women's alcohol problems. It is intended for use by individuals interested in incorporating prevention measures into the workplace, schools, treatment facilities, and other settings, and for women interested in reducing the risks of alcohol problems or preventing existing problems from developing further. A section on women's alcohol problems discusses social drinkers, problem drinkers, and alcoholics. Three levels of prevention are defined. The section on primary prevention presents five tools for reducing the incidence of alcohol problems in women and for stopping the problem before it starts: (1) risk factor recognition; (2) the media; (3) legislation and regulation; (4) community action groups; and (5) health  education programs. The section on secondary prevention, early problem detection to prevent the disease from fully developing, presents four tools: alcohol programs for special risk groups, employee assistance programs, breaking the silence of denial, and assessment by physicians and other helping professionals. Tools identified in the section on tertiary prevention, designed to help alcoholics stop drinking, are denial syndrome recognition, direct alcoholism intervention, removal of treatment barriers, and provision for women's special treatment needs. The summary notes one final tool, removal of the misplaced stigma associated with alcoholic women. A brief list of references and a list of prevention messages for women are included. (NB)",

        "author":["Worell, Judith"],
        "description":"This paper examines psychological and social issues for single mothers in the context of therapeutic strategies for effective intervention. Never married, previously married, and Lesbian mothers are considered in terms of sociocultural myths and sources of stigma; research findings related to these myths; and interventions targeting the single-mother family, the community, and governmental policies that influence legislation affecting these families. Sources of societal stigma are discussed which are related to morality, sex-role violation, and victimization. Dispelling myths related to these areas requires careful consideration of the major sources of stress impinging on these families: economic stress, social isolation, and role-strain. It is suggested that mental health  interventions treat these families in the context of the massive effects of poverty, societal oppression, and victimization. Therapeutic strategies that include only the psychological processes of the single mother will fail to address the larger context of her social situation and will further contribute to her victimization and despair. Interventions must be preventive, remediative, educative, and aimed at involving community resources. Therapists are encouraged to become knowledgeable about single mothers and the economic and legal issues facing them, and to take an active role as mediators and advocates. Research requirements discussed include increased attention to models of prevention and intervention into the factors that facilitate the strength and well-being of single-mother  families. Forty references are included. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"No investigation has directly conceptualized or measured student engagement in secondary schools. Rather it must be inferred elliptically from other investigations of students who disengage, dropout, or are alienated. Engagement has been defined as existing when students are participating in the activities offered as a part of the school program; disengagement as the extent to which students refrain from participating in school activities. A conceptual framework of engagement includes the following: (1) engagement is the attitude leading to and participation in the school's programs; (2) engagement has multiple interactive determinants; (3) engagement will have an impact on many student and school outcomes including achievement, academic knowledge, and social behavior; and (4)  research on engagement should be longitudinal rather than cross-sectional. Psychological characteristics of the student, family characteristics, school characteristics, and teacher characteristics affect student engagement. Engagement has no real theory, direct assessment tools, nor systematic research. Clearly a student's engagement in his schooling can be a complex state of perception or a way of acting. Many of its antecedents are deeply rooted in the larger society, the family, and in the school and classroom. In this sense much of engagement seems immutable. Yet, there are identifiable characteristics of schooling that, if varied, can result in enhanced participation. (ABL)",

        "description":"This paper presents high-cost illness data from the first public use data file released on the 1977 National Medical Care Expenditure Survey. Characteristics of families which incurred out-of-pocket expenditures for personal health services that exceeded 5, 10, and 20 percent of their income in 1977 are described including: (1) demographics; (2) use of health care services; (3) total and out-of-pocket expenses, and (4) sources of payment. Findings are presented that depict families with a high ratio of out-of-pocket expenses to income as being more likely to be headed by someone under 18 or over 65 years of age, unemployed, and with lower income. Implications of the findings are examined, including the identification of two distinct types of families that have high out-of-pocket  expenses: those for whom a high-cost illness resulted in high personal expenses in spite of good insurance coverage, and those for whom relatively small out-of-pocket expenses represented a high percentage of their income due to a combination of low income and inadequate health care coverage. The issue of catastrophic health care expense is addressed. The appendices describe the calculation and interpretation of relative errors and the method used to calculate the standard errors, the formation of confidence intervals, and the evaluation of differences among estimates. Two figures and 34 data tables are included. (NB)",

        "description":"Many studies have documented the importance of family and friends in providing long-term care to the elderly. A study conducted in 1982 examined a nationally representative probability sample of informal caregivers assisting frail and/or disabled elderly persons in an effort to develop a descriptive profile of the informal caregiver. Data were drawn from the Informal Caregivers Survey, a component of the National Long-Term Care Survey (LTCS). From October 1982 through January 1983, interviews were conducted with 1,924 persons aged 14 years and older who were identified by the elderly participants of the LTCS as providing unpaid assistance with at least one activity of daily living. The results revealed that informal caregivers to the disabled elderly were predominantly female and  that three-quarters of them lived with the care recipient. The findings suggest that caregivers as well as care recipients are a vulnerable group since one-third of the cargivers were over age 65, reported incomes in the poor to near-poor category, and described their health status as fair or poor. Less than 10 percent of the caregivers reported purchasing services. Evidence was also found of competing familial and employment demands among a subgroup of caregivers. References and five data tables are appended. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"The mood-dependent retrieval hypothesis states that mood will enhance recall by acting as a recall cue if the stimuli have been learned initially in the same mood. Material learned in a happy mood will be best recalled when the person returns to a happy mood; the same holds for a sad mood. Mood-dependent retrieval effect has been regulary demonstrated but has also regularly failed to replicate in a laboratory setting. Relations between mood states, states in general, and memory are not well understood. A first possible specification of what causes the mood-dependent retrieval effect is experimenter demand. An important precondition for obtaining the mood-dependent retrieval effect is to insure strong mood-inductions. Another moderator of mood-dependent retrieval may be whether or  not retrieval cues alternative to mood, such as the room, are available to cue recall. Item-mood associations can be heightened using to-be-remembered stimuli that can be perceived as causing the mood or by having subjects generate their own items for recall while in the particular mood. None of these factors suggested to explain mood-dependent retrieval can do so by itself.

        "description":"Research on the role of life events in human development has revealed the importance of cognitive processes in pre- and post-event coping. Prior research, however, has primarily studied the role of a priori, theoretical or experientially developed cognitive taxonomies in transition coping. A study was conducted to explore the underlying cognitive dimensions associated with one major type of life event (divorce) through multidimensional scaling analyses. Subjects were 46 college students, approximately one-half of whom had experienced a divorce or separation in their families. Subjects sorted 111 statements, generated from an earlier sample of separated adults who listed questions they had asked themselves about their divorce, into categories according to the perceived meanings of  the statements. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analyses of these similarity judgments revealed that a three-dimensional solution best portrayed the structure of the data: (1) attribution versus action; (2) self versus other focus; and (3) psychological versus practical coping issues. The methodological limitations and counseling implications of the results are discussed. (Author/ABL)",

The terms congregate housing, continuing care retirement centers, and life care communities are defined. Community surveys, the market and regulations affecting congregate housing, financing of housing, and national organizations interested in this topic are discussed. The methodology used in community surveys is presented in detail. Findings of these surveys are presented in tables and discussions of the following topics: (1) features and services considered important by those interested and  financially eligible for retirement center living; (2) building and apartment styles and sizes preferred by interested and financially eligible individuals; (3) distance interested and financially qualified individuals are willing to move for desired features and services; (4) degree to which interested and financially qualified individuals are ready to move to a retirement center; (5) type of sponsorship preferred by interested and financially qualified individuals; (6) characteristics which differentiate between those who prefer a rental plan and those who prefer a life care facility; (7) concerns expressed by those who are financially eligible but not interested in retirement center living; and (8) health center days used in life care communities.

Psychologists interested in dealing with this industry will have to be aggressive. Important considerations include the following: (1) managers make decisions about finances, products, and services which impact older persons; (2) these entrepreneurs create and manage capital which makes new living and health care options available; (3) psychologists should try to learn from those who have been in the business; (4) potential clients for psychologists include entrepreneurs trying to enter the industry; (5) many who want information do not want to pay for it; (6) large companies do not want consultants, but want to hire  their own people; and (7) small companies are more interested in consultants' data than are large companies. Psychologists working with industrial clients should read industry journals and attend industry meetings; identify practitioners' information needs and supply that information; make recommendations based on data, experience, and current psychological and gerontological information; and accept a timetable. Industrial parties should be sure the psychologist knows what they want, anticipate questions, share insight, insist on understandable terminology, give a deadline, and insist on discussions of implications. By working with industry, psychologists can contribute to the creation of better long-term care settings. (ABL)",

        "description":"For members of the elderly housing industry, important questions concern how people decide to become residents of a particular senior community, how they function after they move in, and how they feel about their experience in the community. Scientists can design and conduct research to answer these questions. In an elderly housing facility, management must maintain control of the operation of the facility but residents must feel they are in control of their lives. Since these feelings of control are important to residents' satisfaction, management needs to help residents maintain the kinds of control they need. An evaluation procedure measuring internal health of senior communities has been developed by the Foundation for Aging Research of Clearwater, Florida. This evaluation  determines if residents are dissatisfied, what training staff needs, priorities for improvements, impact of current programs and policies, and effectiveness of various communities under the same management. The evaluation assesses attitudes of residents, staff, management, and board members. The same questions are asked of all groups. Large differences of opinion suggest problem areas. Past studies have shown that residents' satisfaction is most dependent on their perception of staff caring about them as people. Staff, on the other hand, believe residents' satisfaction to be most dependent on interesting activities. Residents felt more in control of their lives than staff perceived them to be. This type of research can be useful and addresses specific questions for which owners and  managers need answers. (ABL)",

        "description":"Whether one is working with clients in a clinic or students in school, it is useful to have a psychological framework within which behavioral observations and diagnostic considerations can be integrated and understood. One such approach begins with the assumption that each person has: (1) a self (a sense of personal existence); (2) a self-concept (an idea of personal identity); (3) a certain level of self-esteem (feelings of personal worth); and (4) an ego (one's personal gauge of psychological and emotional strength). In assessing positive and negative ego resolution, the behaviors under consideration can be examined in terms of appropriateness for the situation and the person's age, intensity of the behavior, and duration of the behavior. Awareness of clients' strengths and  weaknesses in the self's development can facilitate the counselor's diagnostic efforts by helping him/her to recognize psychosocial stages where negative ego qualities are most dominant and plan treatment with these needs in mind. Individuals may need counseling treatment to understand the self-as-object (physical, social, emotional, and intellectual attributes) and the self-as-doer (perceiving, performing, thinking, and remembering functions). Diagnosis of self-concept strengths and weaknesses are useful in designing effective treatment programs and counseling approaches. (ABL)",

Meta-analyses have made and can continue to make contributions to the study of the psychology of women in these areas: (1) meta-analyses indicate psychological gender differences are small; (2) meta-analysis can be used to test the effect of sex of researchers on outcome of research; (3) validity in gender difference research can be addressed by meta-analysis; (4) meta-analysis can test competing  theories and conceptualizations.

        "description":"In a study of the effects of time restrictions and passage access on reading comprehension, 128 college freshmen enrolled in two different developmental reading courses were divided into 4 groups of 32 subjects each. (Tests used to assess reading ability at the college level are usually either power tests with liberal time limits, or speed tests, which are strictly timed. Both provide access to the passage.) Group 1 had no passage access and no time limit; group 2 had no passage access and a 15 minute limit; group 3 had passage access and no time limit; and group 4 had passage access and a 15 minute limit. The results of this study conflict with those of other research, which support the findings that increased time restrictions do not yield higher test scores while passage  access does. The two groups who had no time restrictions scored significantly higher than those with a 15 minute limit, and the two groups who had no passage access did just as well as the two groups who were permitted access. Across all groups there were no significant differences between comprehension and retention scores. Several conclusions might be drawn from these results. Developmental college students have problems processing connected discourse and, as a result, their metacognitive abilities are weak. Though unrestricted time limits are often impossible, perhaps unrestricted time on reading tests would be beneficial. More research on developmental college students must be done before accurate conclusions can be drawn. (SRT)",

        "author":["Liebling, Cheryl Rappaport"],
        "description":"Acknowledging that the literary quality of children's stories strongly affects reading comprehension and interest in reading, a study examined how inside view (the insight an author provides about a character's thoughts and feelings) affects the presentation of character beliefs and plans. The study was based on the following premises: (1) basal readers often include adaptations of original fiction that have been altered for readability and/or length; (2) especially when altered for length, these adaptations leave out much of the inside view that can affect communication between author and reader and, thereby, reading comprehension; and (3) inside view can be examined using interacting plans analysis, which focuses on character-to-character interaction, highlighting the  interdependent character plans and the critical beliefs which the real reader must comprehend if the text is to be interpreted as the real author intends. Using this interacting plans analysis, the story &quot;Freckle Juice&quot; by J. Blume was compared line by line with an adapted basal version to determine whether event structure, character plans, and inside view of the original were retained in the adaptation, which deleted approximately one-third of the original but did not alter vocabulary or sentence structure. The study concluded that deletions do not necessarily affect comprehension of main events, but may make it more difficult to understand why characters act in certain ways. Adaptations may remove subtle features, such as inside view, which make the original more interesting and  comprehensible. (A three-page bibliography, figures illustrating interacting plans, and a table outlining deletions are appended.) (SRT)",

The results indicated that the majority of respondents read stories on request at bedtime, usually reading the book and  looking at the pictures, as well as pausing periodically to ask questions about the story. Most children asked for a specific story, parents' book selection usually reflected their childhood favorites, and mothers responded most often to the child's request for a story. Most parents read to their child daily, and gifts, bookstores, and public libraries were the sources for most children's books. Parents'childhood experiences provided information about reading readiness activities, and pointing to and reading signs was the most frequently mentioned &quot;other&quot; activity. Finally, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was the favorite television program; most children watched one or more hours of television per day, and most respondents considered themselves good reading role models for their child.

        "description":"A study examined the interrelationship among print-related skills developed prior to formal reading instruction and social class differences in these skills in 33 middle-class and working-class children attending one of two high quality, reading-oriented kindergarten classes. Two hypotheses were generated: (1) that correlations would emerge among measures reflecting grasp of sound-symbol correspondence, phonemic awareness, how print language functions, and decontextualized language ability; and (2) that social class differences would be a factor for measures of decontextualized language and grasp of sound-symbol correspondences, but not for measures of abilities focused on in the kindergarten, such as print concepts and general understanding of how books function. Subjects,  assessed as low socioeconomic status (SES) or high SES on the basis of their parents' employment status, were tested in three to four sessions of 15 to 20 minutes each. The results indicated that phonemic awareness, print decoding, print production, and literacy interrelate positively and significantly, but have generally low or negative correlations with the oral language composites. These results suggest that preschool reading readiness may include many different abilities, however highly related to one another. Gender had no significant main effect, but middle-class subjects scored significantly higher on all the prereading composite scores than did working-class subjects, suggesting that attendance at high quality nursery/kindergarten classes was not sufficient to equalize the skills  of the two social groups.

        "description":"Text linguistics can make significant theoretical and practical contributions for writing teachers. Borrowing from classical rhetoric and cognitive psychology, text linguists investigate defining text, creating text grammars, and identifying communicative aspects of text. To show how these investigations are useful for writing teachers, this report presents two studies that apply two basic issues in text linguistics--Grice's Cooperative Principle and schema theory--to common situations in writing classes. Text linguistics offers ideas on how to integrate the product/text into the process approaches prevalent in composition research and practice, and text linguistics seeks to create paradigms and identify rules about well-formed texts that teachers can appreciate as theoretical  constructs and use as teaching aids. Speech act theory extends the ability of writing and communication instructors to analyze and evaluate communication situations and aids the discovery of where, how, and what the language used in instructional comments communicates. Schema theory is an analysis of text processing created jointly by cognitive psychologists and text linguists. The findings of a study involving a four-part writing task, assigned to an experimental class and scored by a panel of writing teachers, indicate that schema transfer from a narrative passage can be used as an effective activity for English as a second language (ESL) students to learn how underlying propositions in a text form an important part of that text's coherence. Further studies based on textual concerns  with schema-coherence relationships should be undertaken in all phases of writing research--from native speakers' revision processes to ESL writing. Appendices include: a nine-page list of references; a sample of an English 101 student essay, a student rating sheet, and two sample essays from the schema transfer experiment. (SRT)",

Four types of third-party usage are: citizen participation, outside investigation, adversarial advocacy, and employee dissemination. Third-party credibility as a public relations strategy to counter the negative effects of hostility is increasing in use and sophistication. However, it is far from being a panacea for it requires a serious degree of commitment on the part of management and a deep involvement of third parties in the organization's operations. The risks that are involved in this strategy are many and must be understood fully and weighted carefully before proceeding. Included in the study is  the use made of oustide investigators by E.F. Hutton and the General Public Utilities Service Corporation, which operates the nuclear generating plant at Three Mile Island. (SRT)",

        "author":["Wicks, Robert H."],
        "description":"The fields of social and cognitive psychology and political science have offered several experimental designs for assessing the presence, type, and complexity of scripts (memory structures used to encode knowledge of an action) or event schemata. Script measurement is a potentially valuable tool for the study of information and news processing because the mass media typically present action-based sequences similar in nature to scripts. Most of the studies aimed at demonstrating the presence of a schema rely on hypothetical passages and indirect measurement strategies based on recall tests, clustering of related concepts, and inference based on prior knowledge. The study of information processing has focused on consensual or shared schemata--similar images for action-based or  event stimuli shared by people in general. Media researchers are especially concerned with the assumption that people select specific schemata when processing various types of information supplied by the media--politics, sports, and weather, for example. The external validity of schema measurement has not been sufficiently assessed, though internal validity is rarely a problem in properly conducted experimental research characterized as a posttest only control group design. For the study of news and information processing, external validity should be sought using real news and information for stimulus material rather than hypothetical passages. References are included.

        "description":"Since the most pervasive ethic of American journalism is that of objective news reporting (the apparently impartial reporting of verifiable data from a detached point of view), a study examined how and to what extent general news reports differed over time in terms of objective reporting. The news content in six representative daily newspapers for three 10-year periods (1865-1874, 1905-1914, and 1925-1934) was analyzed according to the following criteria for objective news reporting: it contains only verifiable assertions, does not make claims to significance, and avoids statements of prediction, value, advocacy, or inductive generalizations without clear attribution to source. For the analysis 360 news reports--120 from each time period--were coded from 90 weekday issues of the  newspapers. Findings indicated that objective news reports increased progressively from the earliest period to the later period for each of the newspapers. Wire news had no statistical effect on whether the news reporting was objective or nonobjective in any of the three time periods. Use of authoritative news sources and the inverted pyramid format ascended with the objective story, though the inverted pyramid appears to have made a faster ascent. The data also indicate that New York journalism was no less objective than that of other areas. While a study of these time periods provided revealing data, further study is needed to investigate the progression of these aspects of the news report between 1874 and 1905. Five data tables and a four-page list of references conclude the document.  (SRT)",

Vande Kopple are collections of disparate structures instead of principled systems--they do not contain rules to explain the interdependencies of their categories. Metadiscourse should be redefined as a category within the larger context of speech act theory. Specifically, metadiscourse consists of the elements in a sentence that convey illocutionary content in either fully or partially explicit form. By limiting the term &quot;metadiscourse&quot; to those constituents that convey illocutionary content, metadiscourse can become a clearly delineated category that functions within the larger context of speech act theory, thus allowing use of the research that speech act theorists have been conducting for over 30  years and providing a principled framework in which to conduct further study.

        "description":"Students dislike writing essay examinations as much as teachers dislike reading them. Perhaps no alternatives to the essay exam exist, but certainly the task can be lessened by altering the format of the essay exam. In an education class at a California university, students select in advance one essay question from a list of several, and field test their rough drafts in a peer revision group. They then rewrite their essays and submit them to the instructor with the rough draft and the peer group comments. Each question is composed of three parts: (1) the message, or subject matter to be assessed; (2) the voice, the point of view and emotional tone the student must assume in conveying the message; and (3) the audience, the specific individual to whom the student is writing. The  interrelationship among the message, voice, and audience makes the essay examination experience more challenging and moves it into the realm of real-world communication. Instructors evaluate each essay on a ten-point scale and students then show the instructors' comments to the peer evaluators for contrast with theirs. Over the course of two or three essay examinations of this type, the peer evaluation group members become more helpful to one another. This use of voice and audience constraints in the writing of essay examinations turns an otherwise torpid activity into a vital learning process. (Examples of questions with the voice, audience, and message delineated are included.) (HTH)",

        "description":"Critical thinking comprises the mental processes, strategies, and representations people use to solve problems, make decisions, and learn new concepts. The study of critical thinking combines the educational, philosophical, and psychological traditions of thought. R. Ennis offers a philosophical taxonomy suggesting that critical thinking results from the interaction of a set of dispositions toward critical thinking with a set of abilities for critical thinking, while R. Sternberg's psychological taxonomy defines the skills involved in critical thinking to be of three kinds: metacomponents, performance components, and knowledge-acquisition components. Bloom's taxonomy of education puts knowledge at the lowest level, followed by comprehension, application, analysis, and synthesis,  with evaluation at the highest level. Tests for measuring critical thinking also come from the philosophical and psychological areas. The Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal, the Cornell Critical Thinking Test, and the New Jersey Test of Reasoning Skills are derived from the philosophical tradition. The Triarchic Test of Intellectual Skills is psychologically derived, but does not try to separate critical thinking from intelligence. Programs for training critical thinking include Copi's 1978 course in logic, Bransford and Stein's 1984 course called \"The Ideal Problem Solver,\" Sternberg's 1986 \"Understanding and Increasing Intelligence,\" and Whimbey and Lochhead's 1982 \"Problem Solving and Comprehension.\" Educators current concern with critical thinking offers students a new chance  for developing critical thinking skills, but training must be brought into all aspects of the classroom to be successful.

        "description":"Considering gender as an organizing force in the world of magazines is productive both because it allows historians to organize nineteenth and twentieth century magazines according to focus and because examining the relationship between gender targeting and actual audience response can reveal the validity of magazine makers' gender-role assumptions and expectations. The two major themes that emerge from this consideration involve the relationship between advertising and gender segmentation in magazine production and the relationship between gender-segmented magazine production and audience response. From the beginning of mass circulation magazine production, the desire to reach large numbers of women across the nation led advertisers to support the creation of separate magazines  for women. Magazine producers used the cultural concept of separate spheres as the rationale for creating gender-targeted magazines. Men's magazines have been more numerous, more specifically focused, and less stable than women's magazines because men were not recognized as major consumers until the 1940s, when magazines began to rely more heavily on advertising. But men's magazines have remained more content specific than women's magazines. The twentieth century magazine industry still features gender marketing along traditional lines and enough audience support exists to warrant continued segmentation. Sex role broadening may affect the magazine industry in the future. (SRT)",

The study addressed two questions: (1) What percentage of textbook paragraphs contains material important for understanding major textbook concepts? and (2) How important are formal main ideas for a substantive understanding of textbook material? Chapters from three textbooks representing mainstream sociology texts were examined. Areas covered by the chapters include culture, the family, and social inequality, topics treated somewhat uniformly in most mainstream textbooks. To distinguish between &quot;substantive&quot; and &quot;useful&quot; material, the number of paragraphs in each chapter containing substantive material was compared  with the total number of paragraphs in each chapter. Location of paragraphs without substantive material and the kind of material contained therein were also noted. Results of analysis indicated that large numbers of paragraphs contained no substantive ideas; the importance of finding main ideas, which were significant 79% to 91% of the time; and the need to study supporting details in order to gain understanding of important material. In most of the paragraphs containing important information, one or more supporting details were needed to understand what was being said, while the formal main idea was sometimes too general and contained little of value for understanding the subject matter.

        "description":"A writer's audience may sometimes be actual readers (real individuals) or implied readers (the reader role the text imposes). Intended readers are individuals the writer expects will actually read the text while the addressed readers are those to whom the writer directs his or her comments--an important distinction in academic writing. For example, a student may write a paper with his or her sociology instructor as the intended audience, but with other English teachers as the addressed audience. Successful student writers understand the need to have a good grasp of who their addressed reader is and to choose their tone and rhetorical strategies based on their sense of this addressed reader. They know that the addressed reader may be someone different from the intended reader, and  they have developed strategies for temporarily forgetting their intended readers in favor of the addressed reader when appropriate. Writers' awareness of actual readers leads them to analyze the audience, but awareness of implied readers leads them to continually reread and mold the emerging text to evoke the desired audience reactions, expectations, and attitudes. Community college freshmen appear to know little about how to create and sustain any purposeful role for a reader. These students must be shown how effective writers create an implied reader as they write--a role for the reader to adopt while reading. Writing for a more general audience, although sometimes more difficult, may lead writers to explore the material more deeply. Writing for a narrower audience may stifle any  tendency to achieve new insights or to find more complex integrations of the material at hand.

After examining how handwriting is currently being taught, the digest discusses research supporting various kinds of printing instruction--block, italic, D'Nealian--prior to instruction in cursive. Research evidence indicates that printing styles do not make a difference but teaching printing should be retained in the lower grades because printing more closely resembles the letters found in typeset books. The digest then looks at the distinction between neatness and legibility in printing, making a case for moving all students, whatever the quality of their printing, into cursive instruction at  the same time. Next, the digest explores the use of wide-lined paper and &quot;fat&quot; beginner's pencils, suggesting that the former is helpful while the latter is not.

        "description":"The Scopes trial of 1925 drew many reporters to Dayton, Tennessee, to report on what they expected would be the final blow to ignorant fundamentalism. They came with many preconceived notions about Dayton, the people of Dayton, William Jennings Bryan, and creationism. Close examination of pretrial, trial, and posttrial coverage in eight newspapers--the &quot;New York Times,&quot;&quot;New York American,&quot;&quot;Chicago Tribune,&quot;&quot;Washington Post,&quot;&quot;Baltimore Sun,&quot;&quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot;&quot;Arkansas Gazette,&quot; and &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;--revealed that most reporters presupposed evolution as a scientific fact, the residents of Dayton as ignorant, and the Bible as highly errant. In reality, pro-evolution books were readily available in Dayton, while the key issue in the trial for Tennesseans was not free  speech, but rather parental control over school curricula. The anti-evolution bill was seen as a way to forbid proselytizing for an as yet unproven evolutionary faith. The journalists covering the trial rarely tried to explain the complexity of the situation and the issue. The result was highly biased trial coverage that depicted Bryan as an inept prosecutor who saw himself as a type of Old Testament crusader. In general, the reporters who praised open-mindedness in their writing were themselves closed-minded when confronted with a world view opposed to their own. They incorrectly portrayed the evolution-creation debate as a battle between intelligence and stupidity and, as a result, the stereotypes they created persist today. (SRT)",

It analyzes the strike in terms of the culture as an interpretive system and includes a textual analysis of local press coverage that assesses the use of symbols to make sense of the strike. The monograph asserts that black anarchy was the symbol for the strike, paternalism the symbol for efforts to end the strike by the city council, and the outside agitator the symbol for King. It also contends that Mayor Henry Loeb was interpreted by whites as a heroic leader, benevolently  protecting the black man; that blacks saw Loeb as plantation owner-reincarnate; and that P.J. Ciampa, a national union officer, was a symbol of immense power in the culture, and seen as a latter-day carpetbagger who exploited the black garbage collectors. The monograph concludes that the newspapers, the &quot;Commercial Appeal&quot; and the &quot;Press-Scimitar,&quot; defined the strike culturally using the themes and concepts that historically have ordered experience in Southern culture.

Case types in the typology were (1) need-plan, which argues for the need to change the status quo; (2) comparative advantage, which argues that a suggested proposal will provide benefits beyond those of the current system; and (3) goals criteria, which offers a policy proposal that explicitly rejects the status quo goals or their priority. In addition, the typology contained dimensions of case fit, including agreement by both sides on the type of case presented and the way to address it, agreement to case type but not fit, and disagreement on both  dimensions. Transcriptions of the negotiating sessions were analyzed by plotting the development of arguments and issues. Results indicated that comparative advantage cases emerged more frequently than did the other types of cases, and that problem solving or integrative bargaining evolved from disagreement on case type or case fit that led both sides to search for alternative proposals. Agreement on case type and case fit that remained constant throughout the sessions led to settlements derived from trade-offs.

        "author":["Stygall, Gail"],
        "description":"Writing instructors who teach argument are familiar with the dilemma of conflicting metaphors: those who teach writing with a process approach may structure their teaching through a growth or benevolent nature metaphor, but cannot deny the tenacity of the &quot;argument as war&quot; metaphor. Breaking this war metaphor requires that ethics become a major consideration in teaching written argument. Stephen Toulmin's model of argument provides an alternative to Rogerian persuasion for achieving an ethical dimension in argument instruction and to classical deductive argument. A Toulmin structure, at the college level, demands a minimum of four parts: data, warrant, backing, and claim. Toulmin's model suggests that facts are constrained by the context of their field or discipline, and that one  must first determine the argument field and its corresponding warrants and backing (the reasons why some facts are considered and others are not), before one can arrive at facts, or salient data. In addition to learning the Toulmin model, students must be involved in the evaluation and sorting of data into fields. Students can use this model of analysis to read and respond to arguments written by peers. Thus the act of arguing, rather than forming around the war metaphor, can form around a garden metaphor--cycles, growth, fertilization, flowering, seeding, and weeding. (An illustration of the Toulmin model is included.) (HTH)",

        "description":"To achieve effective intercultural communication, participants must understand how behavioral differences may lead to miscommunication. Such behavioral differences can be illustrated by Arab and American nonverbal behavior. Individualism is the ideal for the American middle class, whereas Arabs are motivated by public opinion. Yet in the Arab world, losing control in public is more excusable than it is in the Western world. Arabs also use a wide range of gestures with subtle physical differences that amount to great semantic variants, and these are generally the same throughout the Middle East. For example, the thumb-forefinger circle with remaining three fingers extended upwards has been borrowed from the West to indicate &quot;OK,&quot; for which meaning the signing hand is shaken a  couple of times gently. Without the shaking, the gesture is interpreted as an obscene female genital reference. Paralingual aspects of communication are sometimes even more elusive and prone to misunderstanding than gestures. A single tongue click as opposed to a multiple click, for example, is an Arab alternative to an eyebrow raise, head toss, or head shake, all of which may indicate &quot;no.&quot; Arabs have also developed the ability to retreat into themselves to accommodate their need for privacy. Americans, on the other hand, create privacy by physically retreating and by closing doors. Other differences can be found in cultural values and notions. It is incumbent on the individual business person to examine personal style and ideas for these cultural implications and biases. (Paradigms that  enable analyses of gestural and paralinguistic communication are suggested, and a four-page bibliography and extensive tables comparing Arab and American nonverbal behavior are included.)

        "description":"Communicative behavior conveys two messages: (1) content, and (2) how the recipient of the communication is to behave with regard to the content, or &quot;relational communication.&quot; How the recipient responds to relational communication defines what form the relationship will take--either complementary or symmetrical. In a complementary relationship the two participants are unequal; one initiates action and the other follows. In a symmetrical relationship the participants are equal; each mirrors the behavior of the other. Complementarity and symmetry can be thought of as opposite ends of a relationship continuum, which should be considered when a coding process attempts to operationalize complementarity and symmetry. The current model of coding relational communication, which is based  on the grammatical structure and response mode of a message, cannot adequately represent relationships on the complementarity/symmetry continuum. Therefore, the topic following/not following schema, designed in hopes of describing such relationships, uses the specific topic sequence as its basis of indicating complementarity/symmetry. Each speaking turn is rated as either a topic following response or a topic not following response, based on its relationship to the previous topic. Both coding systems are interactional in nature and the resulting codes are identical to a large extent; they will probably yield similar results except in less normal relationships, such as psychotherapy.

        "description":"To formulate, justify, and establish priorities for high school debate goals, one must consider only those things that debate can uniquely offer to participating students. The most important goal that debate offers is the development of critical thinking. Educators must continue to develop critical thinkers who can anticipate, discover, and prevent abuses from harming individuals and society. A second goal is fostering academic advancement and improvement. The skills students acquire in debate are easily applied to other academic disciplines. Students also learn the value of extensive and intense study of an issue, gaining increased exposure to many different ideas and resources and expanding their intellectual horizons. The third goal is development of communication skills,  making students adaptable to many styles and allowing the development of complex argumentation. Three secondary goals, although not as educational in nature as the first three, contain immeasurable social worth and allow forensic educators to promote their activity to interested students. The first is elevated challenges, while the second is exceptional experiences, such as chances to become acquainted with opponents and to travel. The final goal is the training that debate offers for future occupations. To meet all of the above goals, debate educators must recognize and encourage diversity in their programs, while coaches need to place the educational aspects of debate above the competitive aspects, thus protecting the integrity and goals established for debate.

On the other hand, inept and incompetent communicative actions constitute the reticence syndrome, clearly a construct defined through behaviors. Noting that it is important that communication researchers compare and distinguish between these cognitive-affective and behavior constructs, a study examined the relationship of behaviors to CA and to reticence. Undergraduate basic communication students completed the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (PRCA-24) and the Verbal Reticence Scale two-weeks prior to participating in randomly selected and assigned dyadic interactions. Subjects in the  dyads participated for eight minutes with confederates who were trained to react neutrally and consistently with all partners in a &quot;get acquainted&quot; activity. Interactions were videotaped. Participants then completed the Communication Apprehension Index. Five behaviors consistently reported as indicative of CA or reticence were selected for coding: (1) number of words spoken, (2) lengthy pauses, (3) gaze avoidance, (4) disfluencies, and (5) disclaimers. The results did not support the hypothesis that behaviors would demonstrate stronger relationships with reticence than with trait CA. The conceptualization of CA as a cognitive construct is supported by the data, but the absence of behaviors correlating with reticence and the corresponding strong reticence/cognition relationship raises  questions regarding the definition of the reticence construct and its operationalization.

        "description":"In the personalized system of instruction (PSI) used in beginning communication courses at George Mason University (Virginia), the students do more than read text materials and master cognitive course objectives. They are encouraged to have experiences that reinforce what they read and to consider how these experiences relate to everyday life. The students are also required to do a substantial amount of writing. The COMM 100 Introduction to Communication course is a survey course with several goals for students: (1) to learn basic principles of communication, specifically, interpersonal, intercultural, group, public, and persuasive communication; (2) to communicate in order to reinforce newly learned ideas; (3) to master minimal skills of public speaking; (4) to write graded and  ungraded assignments; and (5) to understand the concept of free speech. To achieve these goals, students work at their own pace, proceeding to the next phase of the course without necessarily having mastered the previous phase. Many PSI courses rely heavily on testing, but this course has only three required examinations--required ungraded self-check tests--plus optional unit quizzes. The course also includes group work, which inhibits the self-paced nature of the course but reinforces the ideas learned through experiencing the act of communication.

        "description":"Utah's involvement with career ladders grew out of the nationwide educational reform movement. The plan was to improve learning by improving the quality of teachers. This could be done by retaining superior teachers, attracting higher quality recruits, and improving teachers' working conditions. In 1984 the Utah Legislature focused on performance-based merit pay and passed a bill authorizing $15,258,937 for district level career ladder plans. This paper studies four districts implementing such plans. Content analysis, on-site visits, interviews, and questionnaires were used to investigate factors influencing teacher acceptance of career ladder systems. Findings revealed teacher involvement, effective communication channels, administration involvement and support, and plan  flexibility as positively related to teacher acceptance. Complexity, restrictive eligibility quotas, and increased responsibilities outside the classroom negatively affected teacher acceptance. Recommendations included provision of inservice information sessions explaining issues and options and exploration of smaller-scale, decentralized career ladder systems. Included are 2 tables, 23 references, and 2 appendices made up of the pilot school questionnaire and responses. (MLH)",

        "description":"Women's participation in school administration is low and actually declining, despite legislation, affirmative action, and special programs. This article views the research guiding educational policy as useful, but concerned with ancillary issues. After a literature review of sex discrimination, administrator gender differences, role conflicts, and norms favoring men, this article addresses the informal criteria and organizational processes that favor men and hinder women. It describes a retrospective, ethnographic study of 25 women in educational administration careers. Data analysis reveals three career development stages. Women administrators begin as culturally defined, molding identities, behaviors, attitudes, and choices according to society's expectations. (In a school  environment, this means women remain teachers, and administrators are male.) If women teachers develop supports and incentives, they may pass through transition (a difficult resocialization process) and eventually become self-defined, competent, and placed in higher administrative positions. Analyzing women's careers according to organizational socialization theory provides useful perspectives for rethinking assumptions and formulating new questions. Besides showing women where the informal barriers lie, this theory shows policymakers and university-based educators what structures need alteration. Appended are 34 reference notes. (HLM)",

        "description":"This study is concerned with local educational agencies' interpretation of federal and state sex equity policies. After briefly discussing &quot;slippage&quot; that occurs as policy decisions move through federal and state systems, the article addresses legitimacy and implementation issues. Since sex equity policies have goals for altering administrative behaviors, programs, and procedures, educators' views and values are important. This article describes a survey of administration journals most often read by practitioners. Four female student analysts perused 50 issues of 4 journals published from 1972 to 1983. Their content analysis showed the types and amount of information obtained. Findings revealed that &quot;equal opportunity,&quot;&quot;equality,&quot; and &quot;equity&quot; usually referred to race, economic  background, and ethnicity, and seldom included sex. When equity articles did appear, most were geared toward strategies for women, not organizations. Of the four journals, &quot;Phi Delta Kappan&quot; had the most comprehensive coverage of sex equity issues. In general, practitioners' journals assigned these issues low priority. School administration is still fraught with norms, mobility systems, and stereotypes preventing women from attaining high positions. Elimination of sexism has not happened, and government enforcement has been undermined. Clearly, the analyzed journals are not contributing to practitioner's value transformation. Appended are three tables and 22 references. (MLH)",

        "description":"Women seeking education administration careers in the 1980's will find their employment opportunities limited by declining enrollments and unenforced affirmative action programs. The informal networks and sponsoring mechanisms aiding men's career mobility are generally unavailable to women. Universities can play a key role in developing pools of well-qualified women and helping school districts maximize their utilization in administration. Instead, women (and minorities) comprise only a tiny percentage of administrative positions. This paper explores the problems encountered by female and male graduate students at one education administration program. A survey eliciting background information on status, goals, and university and life experiences was mailed to 258 students  enrolled in the program between 1976 and 1980; the return rate was 70 percent. Findings show considerable sex differences among participants in this program. Women were older, had less financial support and lower positions and career goals, experienced sex discrimination, and were often divorced. By ignoring these differences, education administration programs are failing to meet their women students' training, support, and socialization needs. Results suggest that professionals, professors, and practitioners must examine further the university's role in training and supporting women. Included are 24 references. (MLH)",

The report elaborates on these categories, together with abilities and skills that K-8 principals develop with professional preparation and continuing activities. \"Experience and Education\" is the first of the four major categories of proficiencies; this section looks at the knowledge, expertise, and attitudes characteristic of the effective principal in four basic areas: child growth and development, training and learning processes, general knowledge, and school climate. Section 2,\"Leadership Proficiencies,\" includes the categories of leadership behavior, communication skills, and group processes. \"Supervisory Proficiencies,\" section 3, describes the principal's duties in relation to curriculum, instruction performance, and evaluation. The brief conclusion describes the principal's position as a continual learner. Appendixes provide two instruments to guide principals in assessing their own personal proficiencies and in establishing a plan for professional growth. Acknowledgments are included. (CJH)",

        "description":"The central theory of Paulo Freire's &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot; is that all human beings are capable of engaging in a dialogical encounter with their world. Application of this theory to the bitter civil war that occurred in Zimbabwe from 1972 to 1979 leads to four conclusions. First, the lack of educational opportunity for the Africans and the unwillingness of the Rhodesian Front (RF) government to engage in a dialog was a major cause of the war. The more the RF refused to engage in dialog with the Africans, the more the prospects of a serious conflict and a military confrontation increased. Second, good national educational policy and the practice of democracy must exist together. However, the RF never practiced democracy in its relations with the Africans because of its  belief that there are cultural differences that cannot be eliminated, and that belief became a justification for perpetuating oppression. Third, the only way the war could have been avoided was to have engaged the Africans in dialog about the educational process that would have led to dialog about other national issues. The fourth and last conclusion is that there comes a time when the oppressed use the limited education available to arouse a nationalistic feeling that motivates them to struggle for their own freedom. Substantiating material (32 footnotes and 1 table) is dispersed throughout the paper. (MLF)",

        "description":"The school spending model described in this report involves institutions and information based on the following reasoning. Where education spending must be approved by referenda, the school board seeks to obtain as large a budget as possible. Voters have to approve the budget proposal or accept the &quot;reversion&quot; level of spending--that statutorily mandated level of spending that prevails should a referendum fail. Since the budget-setters can use a low reversion level to threaten the voters into accepting higher expenditures, the institutional structure matters in the model. Knowledge of a lump-sum state grant will typically lower voters' desired levels of spending from local sources. Also, larger grants lead to larger reversions and diminish the threat available to the  budget-setters. The model, presented in a mathematical formula, was applied to a sample of 111 relatively large Oregon school districts for the 1971-72 school year. The data strongly suggest substantial underperception of state aid. This voter ignorance of state aid had the following effects: total spending was increased by some 30 percent in all districts; and, in the 40 percent of the districts that had reversions below the school closing threshold, the reversion effects and perception effects interacted to boost spending by an additional 15 percent.

        "description":"State education agencies are allowed to retain up to 20 percent of the funds they receive from the federal government through the block grant provisions of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act. A review by the General Accounting Office (GAO) of the United States of the uses to which these retained funds were put in California and Washington failed to determine the amount of block grant funds used for administration. The block grant regulations allow the states to use their own procedures for managing their block grant programs. As a result, no nationally applied set of definitions or classifications of programs or activities has been developed, nor have the accounting systems in the two states examined required that all programs using block grant funds use uniform  reporting procedures. Comparisons between states and among state programs are therefore practically impossible. The GAO did determine that the state education agency budgets in California and Washington rely less than the average state on federal aid, that the two states' budgets rely more on block grant funds, and that fewer block grant funds are used to administer the block grant program in these two states than in the average state. Some options for reducing use of block grant funds at the state agency level are offered. The letter requesting the GAO study is appended, as are tables of state and national financial data relevant to the report. (PGD)",

These plans are intended to direct resources toward improvement of educational programs and services, school management, and student achievement. The planning process is to include needs assessment, development of action plans, implementation planning, and evaluation in five areas: educational programs and services (curriculum and instruction), school management, personnel development, community and staff involvement, and the use of nondistrict resources. This document lists the outcomes desired in each of these five areas, the general processes to be followed to achieve the outcomes, and the specific activities  that school districts are required to follow in their long range planning efforts. The major focus of the text is on the specific items of documentation that districts must include in the plans submitted to the department of education. Districts are permitted to add to these required materials as they shape their plans to their own needs. Appendixes list definitions of terms, provide sample reporting formats and other forms, present guidelines for midpoint progress reports and final evaluations, describe the registration of plans, and list reporting requirements.

Cleveland Board of Education&quot; in 1981, which followed the Supreme Court precedent set in 1972 in &quot;Board of Regents v. Roth.&quot; The threshold question in due process is whether the individual has a liberty or a property interest at stake in continued employment. Although the Court dismissed Loudermill's complaint and that of another school employee, Donnelly, the central finding is that both employees had a property interest. School boards must provide tenured and nontenured employees reasons for discharge and an opportunity to respond. Most Americans can be considered &quot;employees-at-will,&quot; or  noncertified employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and are subject to the century-old doctrine that employment for an unspecified period of time permits termination at any time. The judicial trend to protect against arbitrary termination of at-will employees such as Loudermill and Donnelly reflects society's increasing expectations of fair treatment--basically limiting the employer's right to dismiss except for &quot;cause.&quot; Because the concept of due process is flexible, certain procedural issues remain unresolved.

Administrators and media specialist practitioners should become familiar with licensing agreements and copyright restrictions that accompany audiovisual and technological materials. The use of commercially produced videotapes for instructional purposes is governed by section 110, which allows audiovisual materials during curriculum-related activities on school property. This right is not diminished by &quot;For Home Use Only&quot; warning labels affixed by videotape distributors. Commercial videotapes, as all copyrighted works, are subject to prohibitions against unauthorized coping and/or distribution, with limited exceptions granted to libraries unable to  replace damaged or lost works. A problematic question pertains to the right of school libraries to allow users to view videotapes on library premises. Although viewing is in compliance with the section 110 exemption for schools, broader uses are questionable in light of the &quot;Redd Horne&quot; court ruling construction of the term &quot;publicly,&quot; which did not distinguish between a commercial venture such as Redd Horne, Inc. and a nonprofit educational enterprise in considering seriatim viewings as &quot;public&quot; showings.

In &quot;Pico,&quot; the issue was whether the amendment imposed limitations upon a school board's discretion to remove books from a school library. One ideological position promotes the First Amendment and an open society; a second position favors government dividing itself into special purposes and being vested with discretion to find the efficiencies to achieve its ends. The First Amendment positionists recognize the amendment's description as the indispensible  condition of other freedoms. The cases upholding the First Amendment seem to emphasize two themes: (1) the function of freedom of speech in individual expression and development, and (2) the value of freedom of expression in a representative democracy. Those in favor of government performing specialized functions prefer absolute discretion because the realities dictate discriminating choices so that government's primary mission is not disrupted. The limited open forum cases allow courts to invade these special purpose government entities so that the First Amendment can survive, given the fluctuations of government. (CJH)",

Academic administrators have realized that the reappointment, tenure, and promotion processes are an opportunity to assess faculty performance. The depressed faculty job market has resulted in a pool of talented applicants with whom a department can replace a nontenured faculty member whose performance proved unsatisfactory. Pressures for educational quality have caused institutions to demand more and higher quality publications, terminal degrees, and other measures of faculty performance. Application of higher standards has generally been upheld by  courts. Plaintiffs have usually argued that either the new requirements deny contractual or due process rights or that they constitute employment discrimination. Courts have ruled that both academic departments and administrators can unilaterally raise publications standards and apply them to faculty hired under old rules. Post-tenure review is opposed by the American Association of University Professors, though no direct litigation has resulted. Its legality may be challenged as enrollments decline and demands for accountability increase. Tenured faculty have perceived regulation of their time to influence position autonomy. While procedural protections of tenure persist, the institutional right to determine and to enforce performance expectations from faculty is unrelated to tenure.  (CJH)",

        "description":"Use of nationally standardized tests to determine teacher competency continues to be a subject for review in state and federal courts. School district policies have promoted minimum score requirements as a basis for employment decisions concerning certification, hiring, renewal, promotion, and merit pay. Legal challenges to these policies focus upon the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection and on the &quot;disparate impact&quot; provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The most often utilized objective test is the National Teacher's Examination. The extent to which districts can rely upon competency testing in setting policy is uncertain. Sole reliance on a test for making adverse employment decisions, or setting salary differentials or standards  for merit pay, however, remains a suspect practice particularly where discrimination is at issue. Legal challenges may increase as teachers' unions and civil rights groups target testing in situations other than certification. School boards should draft testing policies that correspond to appropriate educational objectives. Employees should be advised of identified deficiencies and should be provided with opportunities for reexamination. Despite reluctance to intervene in educational policymaking, judges often are sensitive to employment litigation that cross-cuts social issues. To minimize complications, an agreement between parties may permit equitable use of competency examinations. (CJH)",

        "description":"Neil Devins, in part 1 of this chapter, discusses state regulation of home instruction. A different perspective on this subject is presented by Perry A. Zirkel in part 2. Parents have claimed that state regulations deprive them of their right, protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to direct their children's upbringing. States claim that children must be ensured of education and of socialization; however, the \"Duro v. District Attorney\" decision too strongly emphasized the state's interest. The decision represents a shift from \"Wisconsin v. Yoder,\" which sought to balance the religious liberty interest of the Amish community and that of the state. The line separating permissible from intrusive state regulations is unclear. The extent of parental  authority must be discerned through an entanglement of state court decisions. Zirkel argues that lower courts' decisions have been relatively consistent in rejecting constitutional amendment rights for parents. Contrary to Devins' contention, courts have narrowly interpreted the \"Wisconsin v. Yoder\" ruling to reject parents' free exercise challenges against state statutes. Many court decisions have rejected parental nonreligious constitutional challenges. Without constitutional mandates, the issues of regulatory standards are a slippery but central concern. (CJH)",

State litigation focuses primarily on equal protection provisions and on constitutional working. The 1976 \"Serrano v. Priest\" decision in California has given the finance reform movement impetus from its assertion that an equal protection clause is in violation if the amount of school district revenue per pupil is a function of the district's wealth rather than that of the state. The countervailing argument centers on the state's objective of local control. Wording of constitutional provisions are often vague and inconsistently applied from state to state. Three states have failed to comply with their constitutional requirements, the precedent set by the 1973\"Robinson v. Cahill\" decision in New Jersey. A state's legislative and executive branches--not the courts--are responsible for devising and implementing finance program revisions. Promotion of local control generally will not survive the required constitutional test when education is determined to be a state's fundamental interest. Litigation has drawn attention to finance system inequities, but it should be used in conjunction with other efforts to achieve action by state executive and legislative branches of government.

Many states have implemented paper-pencil tests, most of which were prepared by Educational Testing Service and National Evaluation Systems. Problem areas to consider when certification tests are used to mandate the quality of teacher education programs include: (1) A wedge can develop between the institution and the state department of education. (2) Teaching toward passing the test may occur when a university's instructional program is being evaluated. (3) Excellent programs are not necessarily reflected by test results. (4) Quality may not truly be improved. Requiring certification tests in hiring procedures includes these issues:  (1) Shortages in certain teaching fields can develop where many candidates are not passing tests. (2) Certification complications can result, causing delay for applicants. (3) It is uncertain that, with the use of tests, more competent teachers will be hired. (4) Minorities and protected groups may be disproportionately screened from teaching. Testing programs do not necessarily create a positive national image for a state. Negative images can develop within a state when, for example, some institutions display better test performances than others. Recommendations include exploration and projection of issues and problems. If the decision is made to test, then it should be done &quot;to the minimum.&quot; Twenty-seven references are included.

The programs on discipline are aimed at classroom management, alternatives for the disruptive, conflict resolution, student peer support, and crime intervention. The drug and alcohol programs involve substance abuse centers, chemical health intervention, curricular offerings, a registry of staff development programs, and Students against Driving Drunk, a national student organization. The programs for increasing student achievement focus on study skills and work habits, peer supervision, study and tutoring centers, instructional techniques for team  learning, management of time and content, and the development of staff awareness of the power of expectations. The section on student attendance reviews an alternative program, four district attendance policies, and a student attendance review committee. Each program description covers program characteristics, initiation dates, program accomplishments, costs, and sources for additional information. The programs offered apply to elementary education, secondary education, or both. Classroom-, school-, and district-level programs are included. (PGD)",

        "description":"Expectations that international efforts to promote education would lead to widespread economic development faltered in the late 1970's as educational theorists became increasingly aware of the realities of inadequate resources, underestimated self-interest among the economically and politically powerful, and incompletely comprehended relationships among education, development, economic capacity, and cultural attitudes. Early interests in achieving equity have waned, national and international resources for social improvement have shrunk, and efforts at decentralization of planning and policymaking have been revealed in many instances as cosmetic at best. Rather than fall into cynicism, however, leaders and policymskers can take advantage of recent developments to begin a more  realistic effort to encourage educational and economic improvement. These developments include new understanding of linkages between education and other social conditions, promising results from nontraditional experiments in linking education and economic development, continued demand for education among Third World populations, and improved awareness of the inadequacies of research once assumed to have global application. By following the lead of these developments, an activist agenda can be implemented, based on practice rather than theory. (PGD)",

The first chapter discusses why teacher evaluations are useful, what processes for evaluation can be followed, how state and local policymakers can enhance the usefulness of teacher evaluation, and why evaluation programs must be continuously updated. Chapter 2 briefly describes evaluation systems used in five states: an internship program in Kansas, career ladders in Arizona and Tennessee, Mississippi's Accountability/Instructional Model, and New Mexico's Staff Accountability Plan. Georgia's teacher evaluation program is described in detail in chapter 3. Among the aspects of Georgia's program that are covered are  teacher testing in basic skills, general knowledge, professional education, and specific subject areas; the use of norm- and criterion-referenced tests; certification and testing; on-the-job assessment; the selection and training of evaluators; the scheduling of evaluations; and staff development efforts aimed at meeting demonstrated needs.

        "description":"Equity in education first meant equal access to schools; in the early 20th Century it came to mean access to schools supported by equal resources; and more recently it has come to mean access to schools providing equally effective educational processes. Assertions that student achievement is affected more strongly by external factors than by education have led to research on effective schools. Among the variables found to affect student achievement have been school leadership, student body composition, emphasis on academics, classroom and time management, parental involvement, and staff development. These variables relate more closely to educational processes than to resources, suggesting that equality of access to processes is a significant concern. In less developed countries  the effects of the variables affecting achievement are considerably modified by budgetary limitations and cultural differences, but the variables significant in developed countries also tend to be significant in less developed countries. The school effectiveness findings suggest that school level efforts to provide processes appropriate to the population should not be hampered by government policies aimed at equalizing resources, implementing change, or developing the staff. The research also suggests that improvements should be made in preparing administrators for effective school leadership. Seventy-six references are cited. (PGD)",

Between 1965-66 and 1978-79, the number of Catholic elementary schools has decreased, although other private elementary schools have increased. Lay teachers continue to replace religious community members and diocesan clergy. In 1984-85 about 80 percent of the faculty at Catholic elementary schools were lay teachers. Of the 169 dioceses in 1984-85, 100 (60 percent) supplied useable data about their sources of revenue: about 46 percent from the parish, 41 percent from tuition, and 13 percent from other sources. On the basis of about 83 percent of the schools reporting, over half charge $500 or more for tuition. In 1970-71, 72  percent of the schools charged less than $100. Catholic elementary schools spent about $2 billion for operating expenses in 1984-85. Despite fewer students and schools, higher salaries and other costs led to the national per pupil cost in 1984-85 of $947, a 21 percent increase over 1982-83. Annual increases in expenditure per student have averaged about 10 percent in the decade since 1972-73. The financial value of the services contributed by religious community members and diocesan clergy is not included in these costs. (MLF)",

The paper focuses on the processes through which an organization's historically evolved culture is modified and augmented by administrators as they organize themselves and others. The first section demonstrates that the process of organization can be seen as a form of cultural action through which shared social realities and assumptions are created, renegotiated, or terminated. The second section considers power and structure--two key resources  typically used to control the significant and legitimate aspects of educational institutions. Section 3 illustrates the role administrators play in distributing cultural knowledge (or &quot;cultural capital&quot;) during the educational process. Finally, it is argued that despite some limitations, cultural analysis of administrative talk and other actions is crucial to fully understanding the nature and consequences of the concepts of &quot;organization&quot; and &quot;development.&quot; (PGD)",

Three main classifications of victims' rights litigation are differentiated in chapter 5--lawsuits by victims against perpetrators, by perpetrators against victims, and by victims against third parties. Chapter 6 considers  schools as defendants in victims' rights litigation, and reviews various types of immunity.

This paper provides a brief look at the development of the ESB and describes its basic features. The ESB serves for diagnosing problems, opening up communication, evaluating improvement programs, and providing some indicators of a school's organizational health. Many school characteristics cited in the effective schools literature are measured by the ESB, though some characteristics unsuited to measurement are not. The ESB permits development of a comprehensive rather than a unidimensional image of the school. Among the characteristics tested are school-site leadership, use of instructional time,  establishment of goals and expectations, recognition of academic achievement, parental involvement, orderliness and security of the environment, performance monitoring methods, collegiality and collaboration, staff development, teacher-student relations, student participation, the sense of community, and district support. The standard of effectiveness is extended to include character development as well as academic achievement. Practical questions about the ESB are posed and answered. Appended are samples of graphs displaying ESB findings, tables of the ESB scales and their meanings, and a three-page list of references. (PGD)",

Strategies for intervening to prevent truancy from becoming habitual are presented next, and then methods for coping with chronic truancy are offered. Four currently operating programs for responding to truancy are described and contact persons named. The paper next considers strategies related to dropping out,  beginning with strategies for prevention. Intervention strategies are presented next, followed by methods for dealing with chronic or permanent dropouts. Four dropout programs are described and addresses for further information provided. The strategies suggested involve the schools, the community, and legal and judicial authorities. The activities include organizing a truancy prevention committee, having a clearly stated truancy policy, improving communication, providing student counseling, offering special training for teachers and staff, setting up alternative educational programs, and cooperating with juvenile authorities.

This booklet's first chapter considers the need for discipline in schools and recent trends in student behavior and national concern. The second chapter examines the changing role of the school and the application of tort law, criminal law, parental responsibility law, and state constitutional law in the school setting. Chapter 3 distinguishes between criminal and noncriminal behavior, reviews appropriate sanctions for each, and discusses the school's responsibility for keeping records and  developing responses to patterns of misbehavior. This chapter also defines terms used to describe criminal acts. The fourth chapter presents 10 rules to follow when developing student discipline regulations.

        "description":"This report presents the results of one of the first empirical investigations of how a tax subsidy for tuition costs actually influences parents' school choices. It provides data about subsidy costs, utilization, and effects in Minnesota, the first state to have a tuition subsidy pass judicial review at all levels of the court system. The study also examines the effects of other state aid policies on nonpublic school operations and on parent choice of school, and it investigates the process by which parents make schooling choices. Findings suggest that the tax deduction has little or no effect on parental choice, while disproportionately benefiting upper-income households and parents who would have made the same schooling choices in the absence of the deduction. A reimbursable  tax credit would be accessible to more parents than a tax deduction, while an educational voucher, representing &quot;up front&quot; cash, would have even greater effects on parents' school choices. However, other policies that directly increase access to schooling alternatives, such as lower immediate costs and free bus transportation, have the most effect on the schooling choices of low and moderate income parents. An appendix presents the selection and disposition of survey samples. Two pages of references and numerous tables are included. (IW)",

        "description":"Both Protestant and Catholic residents of Ontario's school districts have historically had the right to establish separate public elementary school boards and schools, and to levy taxes to support those schools, under most conditions. Only recently have all major political parties in Ontario agreed to funding Catholic public secondary schools through grade 13, in addition to the nondenominational public secondary schools. This agreement has led to questions about the levels and types of choice that are granted to various educational constituencies and about whether granting the rights to a separate school system for Catholics violates Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms or preserves the expressly stated constitutional rights of the Catholics. Court tests of these matters are  pending. The Ontario situation suggests several propositions about choice in education that can serve as topics for discussion: (1) choice means exclusion, (2) choice reduces public control, (3) choice implies economic direction, (4) choice implies transfer of resources, (5) increased choice for some means decreased choice for others, (6) choice is not uniform, (7) choice depends on accessible information, (8) choice awakens religious animosities, and (9) the courts must decide who has choice.

It was found that teachers used behavioral observations as a basis for making decisions more often than any other single source of information. Criterion-referenced measures provided the information used most often in developing individualized education programs (IEPs) and in monitoring student progress, while progress on previous IEP objectives was used most often in changing IEPs. Although it appears that evaluation and monitoring procedures exist, the extent to which they are used  systematically or regularly is questionable.

The state as a whole was consistent from year 1 to year 2 in terms of the percentage of children referred for screening. However, there was wide variation among individual districts. Three groups of districts were identified on the basis of the change in rates: (1) those whose rates increased considerably, (2) those whose rates decreased considerably, and (3) those whose rates stayed the same from year 1 to year 2. An attempt was made to identify variables that differentiated the groups. No differences were found among the three groups and the state as a whole, when compared on the basis of three district variables and four socioeconomic status  variables. In addition, no differences were found in terms of the screening practices employed by these groups. The need for further examination of factors that contribute to referral rate changes is discussed. Implications of the wide referral rate variation for individual children and for screening efficiency in general are also discussed. (Author/CL)",

Interviews were completed with 208 parents who participated in the process during January and February 1986. Fifty-eight percent of the parents belonged to non-Canadian cultural groups, including Portuguese, English, West Indian/African, and Chinese: the majority of their children were divided into six groups: elementary learning disability/reading clinic; elementary gifted; secondary (not gifted); physical handicaps, behavioral problems, and hearing problems; deferred; and not exceptional. In general, the parents interviewed evaluated the process very positively: they felt  comfortable and relaxed in meetings which they felt were open, professional, and informative. Problems did exist in some areas, including lack or unavailability of materials in the parents' native language, poor parent preparation and inadequate information, the length of the process, parental alienation from information sharing and decision making before, during, and after the procedural meetings, and the structure and procedures of the committee. Analysis of placement by cultural group indicated that Canadian and West Indian/African parents had the highest percentages of children in the elementary learning disability/reading clinic programs and that Portuguese, West Indian/African and Chinese parents had the lowest percentage of children in the elementary gifted programs.

Part I of this report summarizes the ACMRDD survey process, the method of the study, and the agency classification system used by the project. Part II presents study results in five sections: (1) analysis by type of agency (large or small, public or private, residential or nonresidential); (2) agency and client characteristics in the most recently surveyed agencies; (3) analysis of this data by type of agency; (4) the impact of previous surveys on the  agencies' success with accreditation; and (5) identification of critical accreditation standards. The third part of the report presents a summary, suggests additional research, and offers recommendations to the ACMRDD and to agencies seeking accreditation. Among recommendations for the use of the survey are improving and consolidating formats for data collection and modifying the survey application form to facilitate completion by the applicant agency and to consistently solicit relevant data. It is also recommended that those agencies comtemplating the survey should conduct a simulation of the actual survey experience. Twenty tables and 13 charts supplement the text, and eight appendices, making up nearly half the document, include survey and data collection formats, statistical summary  of agency and client characteristics, enumeration and ranking of critical standards, and enumeration of standards with which all agencies were assumed to be in compliance.

The differences seem to be due to the sociocultural background and previous learning experiences of the learners and the influence on teachers of recent theory in communicative language learning and teaching, and they are likely to influence the effectiveness of teaching strategies. It is the responsibility of the teacher to teach not only the language but also how to be a language learner, which includes convincing learners of the value of communicative classroom activities such as role playing and problem solving, through explanation, discussion, and  demonstration. It is only through sensitivity to the learners and their perception of the learning process, along with a willingness to consult and negotiate, that curriculum innovations are likely to be effective.

        "description":"Proficiency, which refers to a concept that is more complex than is generally acknowledged, is an overworked term in second language teaching that lacks a satisfactory operational definition. Linguistic knowledge is currently defined most often in terms of what an individual is able to do with the knowledge, as in the movement for competency-based education. The simple idea of proficiency as the ability to perform real-world tasks with a specified degree of skill becomes problematic when the issue of proficiency assessment arises. All proficiency scales assess a mixture of factors from diverse domains. Most of the performance factors have not been empirically validated to determine whether learners really do act in the ways described by the scales or to what degree the skills  mastered in one domain are transferable to another. The only performance factors subjected to empirical validation have been syntax and morphology, and it has been found that some aspects of proficiency descriptions conflict with what learners are able to do at other stages. Research into the divisibility of the construct of general proficiency has not been as fruitful as originally anticipated. Despite some valuable research, efforts at producing an operational definition of proficiency seem to be circular and will not be resolved without more empirical study. (MSE)",

The specific objective is for players to collect as many options as possible to improve his or her life. Two teams, one employed and one unemployed, are given money. The employed team is given cash, and the unemployed team is given Free Money and Free Food tickets. Players must buy necessities before buying options. By the end of the third round, players must have spent all their money. The principal  objective is to collect as many options as possible for improvement of their living standard. A follow-up discussion focuses on buying power and how it is affected by price changes and cuts in free money, and how it relates to quality of life and the players' own cultural values and reasons for leaving their home country.

        "description":"A readability formula for elementary Spanish instructional materials was developed by building on previous research, particularly in regard to the application of the Fry readability graph to Spanish language materials. The study began with the selection of average sentence length and number of syllables per 100 words as independent variables. Sample 100-word passages were selected from each grade level of ten different basal reader series used in the United States, Latin America, and Spain. The mean and standard deviation for average sentence length and number of syllables per passage were tabulated, and multiple regression analyses were performed for each series. Grade level was the dependent variable. A formula was derived from the analyses, and a readability graph was  generated by computer to eliminate the computation and simplify use of the procedure. It is suggested that the formula and graph provide a procedure as convenient for Spanish as the Fry graph is for English, and that it can serve as a guide for writing elementary level instructional materials in Spanish and for teachers in selecting materials.

        "description":"The foreign language faculty at College of Saint Scholastica Minnesota) developed and implemented 10-day Spanish and French immersion programs based on Peace Corps methodology as a means of affording students time for intensive study of those languages, improving students' fluency, and instituting a change in teaching methodology. The first program, in Spanish, had courses at beginning and intermediate levels; it was offered during the summer of 1984 to the college students and people from the Duluth community. The daily schedule, extending from 7:00 a.m. until after 8:00 p.m., included time for individual study, class activities, laboratory exercises, computer drills, physical and social activities, and one hour of personal time. At the end of 10 days, oral and written  examinations were given on the material that had been covered in class activities. Success with the Spanish program encouraged development of a French program, which was designed differently to accommodate older adult enrollees' different learning and scheduling needs. The French program had shorter lab periods, more frequent group sessions, and reading and writing exercises throughout the program. The older group covered 30 percent more material than a traditional class would have covered and somewhat less than a younger class would cover. A major accomplishement of this program was that the students overcame a fear of failure during the course. The faculty experienced changed attitudes and renewed enthusiasm toward teaching and, as a result, they have begun to implement minicourses.  (MSE)",

Mean scores for both groups were significantly higher than those for anglophone university students who had just completed an experimental psychology course in French. Scores on individual oral fluency and  communicative competence tests were significantly higher for early-entry than for late-entry students. Both groups achieved relatively high overall proficiency. Comparison with earlier years' findings for the same cohort suggest that differences between early- and late-entry students' proficiency may decrease as they progress through high school and that proficiency scores from grade 8 may be effective predictors of grade 12 results.

Results show a typical profile of a student who followed a bilingual educational path in high school, took a university program in arts or science, and had some job experience in which French was used. Most thought that French skills would be an asset in the job market and had confidence in their own language skills, despite some sense of decline in skills since leaving school. (MSE)",

The analysis also includes historical perspectives on the feminine, subjunctive, plural suffix, and prefix from late Latin and Old French. Extensive naturalness is found in this restricted corpus. The study concludes that the principal contribution of the natural approach is the maximization of the importance of iconicity of linguistic form, an aspect recognized but minimized in recent linguistic study, and that natural morphology  appears to be a promising framework for both synchronic and diachronic morphological investigation in such areas as suppletion, verb stem allomorphy, and the rise of prefixation in nouns and verbs.

When Japanese people communicate with Americans in English, this kind of association often causes problems, and those related to color are a large, important group that Japanese people must understand in order to communicate successfully with Americans. Americans seem to have a greater awareness of color than do Japanese people, with more terms for colors and shades and more color associations. Americans and Japanese do not necessarily use the same color terms for the  same objects. They share some color associations, but many are different, and Japanese people are often not familiar with color connotations in American culture and daily life, such as the association of blue with depression, obscenity, nobility, loyalty, strictness, and lack of oxygen. Since the use of color terminology is frequently based on cultural convention rather than descriptions of reality, Japanese who communicate with Americans need to learn the patterns and significance of color expressions in American culture.

        "description":"Teaching a second language and culture means teaching culturally different patterns of perception, communication, and effect. When teachers of English as a second language develop sensitivity to what students bring to the classroom and understand the students' reasons for their actions, their teaching can aid and not hinder students' full development. Teachers can show acceptance and respect for real cultural differences by planning appropriate teaching materials and by recognizing the child from another culture as a learning resource with wider experiences than most of his or her classmates. This attitude and approach maximize further learning about the native language and allows students to take pride in their heritage. Linguistic bias and damage from ethnocentrism can be  erased by helping students interact successfully in a cross-cultural setting rather than in a culture-bound intellectual atmosphere. To understand international students' situations, those who teach them must value cultural diversity and not interpret being different as being deprived. It is very important for teachers to admit the humanness of all people, to become knowledgeable about the world community, and to understand the cultural barriers to effective communication. Because foreign students in the United States often feel very threatened, their comfort should be a primary consideration for language teachers.

Little of the existing research on bilingualism is generalizable to U.S. minority language groups. However, one study of children in a bilingual program designed to see if intellectual abilities are related to the student's degree of bilingualism rather than to compare bilingual and monolingual children found that a positive relation exists between bilingualism and various abilities, such as the ability to think abstractly about language and to think nonverbally. In addition, the correlation between the students' abilities in the two languages developed in the bilingual education program  became stronger in the course of the program, supporting the idea of the interdependence of the languages of the bilingual. While these results do not suggest that bilingualism is a valuable educational intervention strategy in itself, they do argue for increased research in cross-language skill transfer and the role of bilingualism in academic learning.

Hundreds of thousands of BE and ESL teachers currently need training to accommodate program staffing needs. Over half the states have developed BE and/or ESL teacher certification requirements, but the requirements vary. A variety of teacher competency guidelines for curriculum design and teacher certification have been produced. Most do not require specialized courses but the need for them is increasingly evident, at the same time that there is pressure to shorten the process leading to certification. In most cases, separate programs are designed for BE and ESL teachers, but there is often  substantial coursework overlap and an integrated approach is recommended. It is also necessary to bring elements of BE/ESL training into the mainstream teacher education curriculum. Assessment issues, which have not yet been addressed generally by the states, include program entrance requirements for English proficiency and measurement of proficiency in the two languages appropriate for classroom language use. Despite the relative inexperience of university faculty in BE/ESL teacher training, there are many professionals in higher education who are interested in institutionalizing BE/ESL training and strengthening the link between research and the classroom.

Because of a shift to a global economy in which there is sharp international competition, it is in the nation's interest to strengthen science education; however, there is a shortage of engineers, scientists, and mathematicians with advanced degrees to staff colleges and government and industry laboratories. Attracting students into these fields is an important policy issue. NSF has a new program to provide instructional equipment to colleges. To develop scientific and  technical talent, NSF sponsors the Research in Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions Program. For faculty, there are opportunities to join an existing NSF-supported project or to serve on NSF review panels, advisory committees, and rotator program officer positions. A special committee of NSF is conducting public hearings on the state of undergraduate science and engineering education. The federal research and development budget for the mid-1980s is briefly discussed. (SW)",

It is suggested that developmental courses be supplements to regular academic courses. In starting a new developmental program, three factors are important: commitment of the school's faculty and administration to the program's success, adequate financial support, and a full-time director. Admission issues concern placement criteria, as well as whether developmental programs should be voluntary or mandatory. Classes are usually taught in a traditional classroom or a laboratory setting. In either case, class size needs to be low (i.e., 15 students). The bottom line in evaluating a developmental program is whether it enables underprepared students to acquire skills necessary to  complete college. The areas in which remediation generally is provided include reading, writing, mathematics, and study skills. Personnel involved in developmental programs include the faculty, counselors, and tutors. Students who tend to need these programs include: foreign students, including refugees who have to overcome language and cultural barriers; athletes who have been given scholarships but who have academic deficiencies; minority students from disadvantaged backgrounds; and handicapped students who did not have access to adequate preparation.

The model was based on a pilot study with 131 faculty at the University of Central Florida. It was found that 91% of teaching faculty create 100% of the tests they use to evaluate student performance. The faculty seemed to use course descriptions fairly regularly to develop course objectives. Faculty do not use a taxonomy in developing teacher-made test. However, few faculty obtain data on the reliability of their testing devices. According to the model, faculty members would have a good course description from which they would develop realistic and attainable course objectives. The course objectives would then be used to develop classroom and exit examinations,  as well as course content. A taxonomy of testing, such as Bloom's, should then be used as a guide to constructing tests. Reliability data derived from test evaluation should be used to improve instruction and the measuring devise itself. Since tests determine whether the student has mastered educational objectives, use of this model would be a part of a quality assurance program. The model would also provide one objective and measurable input to the complex process of faculty evaluation. (SW)",

Called the Course Development Model, it was an outgrowth of a 1985 pilot study conducted at the University of Central Florida. The study found that more than 100 faculty who completed a questionnaire did not properly design nor adequately evaluate the tests they developed for their classes. Objectives of the model are to improve accountability, develop better testing instruments, and improve the instructional process. The model requires that course descriptions contained in college catalogs describe course content in concrete terms that would enable an instructor to derive sound course objectives. The course objectives can then be used to  develop the tests and measuring devices used to evaluate student performance and learning. The model requires that a test construction taxonomy, such as Bloom's, be used as a guide to develop these tests. The final step is the evaluation of tests and measuring instruments for reliability and validity. The model promotes accountability without requiring the faculty member to give up independence. Use of the model will not only improve evaluation of student performance, but will help the professor improve instruction. The model will also be helpful in faculty evaluation. (SW)",

Also considered are faculty hiring practices, perceptions about institutional status, changes in enrollment and finances, and international components of academic programs. A total of 365 two-year and four-year colleges and universities responded to the study questionnaire, and the data were statistically adjusted to represent national trends. Findings on the general status of colleges highlight a variety of problems: enrollments are steady or down for the majority of institutions; financial pressures are evident and are creating other problems, including inadequate student aid and uncomfortable levels of  faculty compensation. Most schools have been reevaluating their curricular offerings during the past few years, and many have made changes in programs. College administrators do not currently have a definite sense of what is the best focus for assessment, and many feel existing evaluation instruments are not suitable to the broad educational purposes they consider to be appropriate outcomes of undergraduate study. Detailed statistical tables, the questionnaire, and technical notes are included. (SW)",

Productivity ratios were computed by dividing the average number of Ph.D.s conferred per year (1951-1980) by the average number of bachelor's degrees conferred per year (1946-1976) for each institution. Liberal arts colleges constitute about half of the most productive institutions. Very large proportions of undergraduates at the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology earned Ph.D.s. For science Ph.D.s, the leading technical institutions were highly productive in Ph.D. production, along with a significant number of liberal arts colleges. Liberal arts colleges that were high in science Ph.D. productivity (Reed College,  Haverford College, Swarthmore College, and Oberlin College) are also among the most productive in the humanities. Data are also provided on the productivity of certain women's colleges, variation in productivity across Ph.D. fields, Ph.D. productivity adjusted for institutional size, the geographic distribution of highly productive institutions, and productivity for each of the Ph.D. fields for several groups of colleges (the Seven Sisters colleges, the Big Ten universities, and the Ivy League universities).

NCHEMS has also built a base of standardized software to increase the productive capability of the NCHEMS staff. Enhancements to the standard software available at NCHEMS have been accomplished through: in-house development of new programs, addition of enhancements to in-house developed programs, and installing or enhancing externally-purchased programs. The most critical of new programs developed in-house is used to  calculate and assign institutional classification according to the system developed at NCHEMS in the late 1970s. Frequent demand for counts of degree programs of different sorts led to the development of a general purpose program to generate a master file containing counts at the four-digit level for all bachelor, master, and doctoral programs recorded in the Higher Education General Information Survey earned degrees survey.

The survey, which was undertaken as part of the University of Michigan's Professional Preparation Project, received responses from 2,230 faculty from 732 programs in 346 different colleges. The framework of the survey included several types of influences on professional preparation that may affect educational programs: external influences (from society or the professional community), those from within the university but from outside the professional program, and internal influences. Findings include: faculty in nursing, education, social work, library science, and journalism perceived much less support  from society than did faculty in architecture, business, engineering, law, and pharmacy; faculty in different professional fields also reported differences in influence exercised by their professional community, primarily through the accrediting agency. Information was also obtained on the roles preferred by faculty (e.g., administrative, teaching, scholarship). Faculty also responded to statements about the outcomes a professional program graduate should achieve. Eleven potential outcomes were identified and classified as professional competencies and professional attitudes. (SW)",

The methods illustrate four phases of inquiry: conceptualization or model-building; data gathering techniques; data representation; and data analysis. For the university's learning task project, the development of a conceptual framework moved from a focus on one kind of knowledge structure to two kinds, from a set of study knowledge structures to a set of study intellectual skills, and from questions about the relationship of knowledge structures and intellectual skills to the question of what constitutes a discipline. The university has been investigating the use of semi-structured interviews with review by a third party and confirmation by the  interviewed of the report based on the interview. One type of graphic representation that has been useful includes a tree structure of the most closely related concepts in a course in rank order. Data analysis involved testing the construct validity of Perry's scheme of intellectual development in the college years. Four developmental stages were postulated. A questionnaire was administered to first- and second-year students to determine convergence of measures within a stage and divergence between stages. Two pages of references conclude the document.

The majority reported growth and development in all general and nursing academic areas. Graduate surveys of the same students studied factors influencing their choice of jobs, satisfaction with job-related factors, involvement in patient care decisions, and the impact of cost-containment measures on nursing practice. Most students were employed in hospitals and indicated that they felt adequately prepared for assuming their first nursing position. (Author/SW)",

Title IV of the Act, which authorizes student financial aid programs, is the focus. The Pell Grant program is aimed at the lower-income student, and the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program leverages private capital through federal guarantees. The campus-based programs and the State Student Incentive Grant program, which encourages states to set up their own grant programs, have provided aid to needy students and to middle income students who were ineligible for basic grants. During the reauthorization process, one of the major issues is who should be provided student aid. Discussion centered on whether or not eligibility should  be restricted on the basis of income. A concern is whether to ration the available aid to first-time students, or whether to provide aid to older students who are returning for continuing education and career development. Subsidies to students receiving aid through the GSL program and loan repayment are additional issues, as are rationing student aid on the basis of cost of education, and the priorities of access to college versus choice. Other programs under the act include international education, cooperative education, institutional aid, and TRIO programs. (SW)",

Programs that are less common aim at students who are underprepared or not highly motivated to attend college. These programs are usually intended to help minority students. Requirements that public colleges report students' performance to high schools from which they graduated exist in some states, and some colleges send such information to schools on a regular basis. Other programs that are designed to increase student preparation and motivation for college focus on:  career counseling and orientation to college life, and college-school programs both within and outside of schools. Programs for gifted and talented students include early admission, joint enrollment, summer enrollment, Saturday programs, summer camps, competitions, and research and internship positions.

General conclusions based on these state and national surveys include: citizens seem to support higher education and are willing to pay higher taxes to improve educational quality; minorities tend to express even more confidence and support for higher education than do whites; Americans still view aid to education as a priority item in their state and federal budget;  most citizens believe that access to college should be available to all qualified students; and citizens view higher education as an important asset to their state and nation. Results of public opinion polls are valuable for higher education planning, including alternative plans for financing further education for students. Opinion polls can also be effective public relations devices and can provide useful information when college administrators develop a marketing strategy for their institution. A summary of nine public opinion polls is included. (SW)",

Nine problems for these schools and centers concern: declining applications and enrollments for dental schools and many schools of pharmacy, nursing, and allied health programs; declining enrollment of minority and disadvantaged students as a result of rising tuitions and loan reductions; certain professions are pressing for higher academic levels of education; young practitioners continue to choose the more lucrative specialties in medicine; teaching hospitals are losing both paying patients and staffs to more competitive community hospitals; teaching hospitals are expected  to provide more indigent care; teaching hospitals may lose a portion of their teaching cost revenues from Medicare and from patients whose hospital bills are paid by business/industry; health professions curricula are oriented to younger patients rather than the elderly; and curricula emphasize illness rather than prevention. To respond to these problems, 23 recommendations are offered to state officials, boards of higher education, licensure boards, health planners and program managers, and leaders in academic health centers and professional schools.

The instrument presents situations that show the leader's concern for job relationships and tasks. Directors were defined as mid-level managers with key administrative and supervisory responsibilities. In addition to comparing age, gender, race, education, and income level of respondents and nonrespondents, LEAD scores of respondents were analyzed by gender, age (40 and under and 41 and over), income ($33,000 and under and $33,001 and over), and race (blacks and white). Most of the directors indicated task-oriented responses to the 12 situations described. Those individuals who appeared less task-oriented had a  background in the helping professions that, by training, emphasizes a less directive, less task-oriented approach to life situations, including program administration in higher education. Female directors were high on relationship and task. Directors over age 41 emphasized tasks more than younger directors, for whom relationships were important. Older directors were generally more consistent than younger directors in the relevance of the task. Better educated, older directors seemed more task-oriented and consistent than high school graduates and/or younger directors. (SW)",

Two groups of comparable, instruction-oriented institutions, one from the private sector and one from the public sector, were analyzed. Five issues were examined: resources dedicated to lower-division students, the economic impact of part-time students, the extent and nature of scale-related economies (diseconomies), the effect of management flexibility on resource allocation, and relative efficiency. Multivariate analysis was employed with data primarily from the Higher Education General Information Survey for fiscal year 1982. Findings include: the number of upper-division students is the most critical variable affecting economic behavior; undergraduate part-time students have an impact in the  instructional area that is probably more than commensurate with the credit-hour demands they create at private colleges but less than commensurate at public institutions; and both types of colleges would likely experience a decrease in average expenditures per student if they could increase enrollments, provided that additional students were distributed by level in about the same way as they currently are.

The model attempts to reconcile the perspectives of environmental determinism and managerial choice. The importance of the interplay of population characteristics that define an ecological niche is considered, including competition with the niche and organization types (e.g., entrepreneurs and prospectors, defenders and analyzers). The dynamics of adaptation at the population and organizational levels of analysis are covered in outline form. The role of individuals in formulating and  implementing strategic organizational responses to changing environmental conditions is also addressed, with attention to the impact of perceptions and attributions in the adaptation process, and the role of leaders. The concept of interpretive strategy as an important factor in the formulation and implementation of effective strategies is introduced, using research being conducted by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems.

Several subclasses of drugs were also covered: PCP and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), amyl and butyl nitrites, and barbiturates and methaqualone. Attention was focused on drug use at the higher frequency levels rather than whether respondents had ever used various drugs. Of concern were: age of first use; the seniors' own attitudes and  beliefs; and the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of others in the seniors' social environment, including perceived drug availability. The use of non-prescription stimulants, including diet pills, stay-awake pills, and pseudo-amphetamines were also reported, along with cocaine use among young people. Findings include sex differences in drug use, differences related to college plans, regional differences, and differences related to population density.

It was hypothesized that students instructed by the computer-aided instruction method would gain higher knowledge of the subject matter in terms of cognitive test scores than students instructed by the traditional method. Subjects were high school students in a vocational education program who were randomly selected and assigned to a control group (n=35) and an experimental group (n=35). Both groups received instruction on one area of BASIC programming in agriculture. The measuring instrument consisted of two identical forms of a test. The content validity of the test was determined by a  panel of experts. To determine the test-retest reliability of the test, it was administered to 10 undergraduate students in agriculture education at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, who retook the same test two weeks later. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was calculated, and the reliability coefficient was considered acceptable. The control group for the experiment received instruction via a lecture by the researcher, whereas the experimental group used the computer program for instruction. The pretest and posttest were administered to both groups prior to and following the instructional treatments. Results of an independent t-test performed on the test results for both groups indicate that the computer-aided instruction method was more effective than the  traditional method, but it is suggested that further studies should be done.

This guide identifies planning activities and describes steps district personnel can follow in developing their programs. It is organized according to five major steps in the planning process: (1) planning preliminary activities; (2) integrating computers into the curriculum; (3) delivering staff development services; (4) acquiring hardware and software; and (5) organizing and implementing the program. This publication may also be used as a reference manual, part of a staff development program, or in conjunction  with training seminars. The approach to computer education is curriculum based and focuses on ways in which the curriculum can be improved by use of the computer. Staff training is allocated according to curriculum priorities, and hardware and software acquisitions are matched to application needs. This guide provides a comprehensive program plan, not only to help users find solutions, but also to help practitioners develop their own responses to needs within their districts. (DJR)",

Information technology has great potential for knowledge processing, and should be valuable for teaching. However, although IT's impact on curriculum in higher education has already been substantial, it is still insufficient: the demand is rising for people with information technology related educational qualifications and training. Efforts are being made to encourage the introduction of teaching about information technology into the curriculum, and the number and range of courses offered has increased significantly, as well as the opportunity for students to experience using IT. Academics  and students alike are ambivalent about a high-technology academy. Although the attitudes of the academic staff will either facilitate or impede the adoption of IT, the national climate will be what moves institutions of higher education in the United Kingdom in the direction of a high-technology academy.

        "description":"This study investigated place location learning from a simulated environmental exploration experience in terms of two variables: gender (both cognitive and affective effects) and presence and/or type of accompanying map. Subjects were 120 fourth and fifth grade students, who were randomly selected and assigned after stratification on gender. The students played a computer adventure game--Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood--for 40 minutes with either a labels-plus-drawings map, a labels-only map, a drawings-only map, or no map at all. Contrary to findings from previous studies of gender differences in spatial abilities, spatial skills, and attitudes toward computer activities (most of which reported results favoring boys), no significant differences regarding gender were  found for either the cognitive or affective measures, and virtually all subjects enjoyed playing the game. As hypothesized, results showed that map groups scored significantly higher on a place location recall posttest than the no-map group, and that labels-plus drawings and labels-only groups outscored the other groups to a statistically significant degree. Follow-up tests 2 weeks after treatment showed high levels of retention of place location information. It is concluded that computer adventure game simulations of environmental exploration may represent an effective and enjoyable method for promoting place location learning for both sexes.

        "description":"This paper presents the results of two studies which were performed to assess the effects of the practice of an interactive video game on spatial visualization test scores. The first study used 70 Laval University undergraduate students as subjects, while subjects for the second study were 101 seventh grade students from the area of Quebec City. In both studies, all subjects were given a pretest and a posttest on the Space Relations Test of the Differential Aptitude Tests (French Canadian version). The experimental groups--one in each study--had eight sessions of playing the interactive video game Zaxxon; the control groups received no such treatment. In the adults' experiment, the 2 (group) by 2 (sex) analysis of covariance yielded a significant effect for group, no effect for  sex, and no interaction of group X sex, indicating that both men and women gained significantly and equally from playing Zaxxon. The adolescents' experiment revealed no significant result, and a re-examination of the procedure revealed several problems that may have contributed to these experimental inconsistencies. It is recommended that future studies in the area of training cognitive skills incorporate a more extended practice period, multiple training conditions, and be established on data assuring convergent validity between the game itself and the skills to be trained. A four-page reference list is provided. (Author/DJR)",

As an integral part of a specific policy setting process and a comprehensive planned change process, such analyses can provide school administrators with much needed information to guide their decisions concerning district-wide microcomputer use. Policy analysis steps include: (1) PIN (problem-issue-need) clarification; (2) question development; (3) data collection, analysis, and synthesis; and (4) identification of alternative policy options and their implications. One way to gain information about potential PINs is to have knowledgeable people report on the conditions in the district regarding uses of computers for instruction (e.g., problem solving, computer literacy,  and computer science) and for local and district-wide administrative and support services. Individual and overlapping PINs can become part of a three-point summary focusing on things that are not now PINs, those things that are PINs, and those things that are unknown. Questions can then be formulated to focus the policy analysis, for example, questions regarding curriculum impact, courseware development and evaluation, and teacher training. The specific procedures used will depend on the nature of the questions addressed and the resources available. While the formation of policy options and their implications should fall to the district superintendent and key staff, the details of implementation should be left to those who will be most directly involved. Finally, policy analysis can form  the basis of a systematic problem-solving approach to the formulation of policy options and subsequent planning for implementation.

The &quot;typical librarian,&quot; according to the data, married young and stayed married, has two children, received her professional education in her late 30s, works full-time, and finds that the only conflict between marriage and her professional and career development is the geographical limitation imposed by her spouse's job. There are no significant differences between the attitudes of single and married  librarians concerning the impact of marriage on careers. (Author/KM)",

A public access catalog (PAC) allows networking with other libraries, use of the Boolean search function, and the retrieval of bibliographic citations from a variety of access points. Moreover, PAC's have recently become more user friendly. The size of the collection input into a PAC determines the hardware needs (e.g., microcomputer- or minicomputer-based). A machine-readable database using full MARC format is recommended for compatibility in the event of interface with another PAC. In addition, the following factors must be considered when preparing a PAC: (1) the attitude of the staff; (2) method of record conversion; (3) hardware acquisition; (4) the effects of the  PAC on the library; and (5) appropriate file system operation. The value of an integrated library system, patron usage, and system management are other considerations which must be weighed. (KM)",

Section 1, &quot;Sources,&quot; is an annotated bibliography which focuses on the selection of those works that should constitute the main reference holdings in a small library or a desk (ready-reference) collection in a larger library. Sources have been limited to 76 currently available works which are priced reasonably and judged to be of excellent quality. An additional 50 reference works are cited in 27 notes. Topics covered are: (1) General Works; (2) Biography; (3) Religion; (4) Language; (5) Literature; (6) Visual and Performing Arts; (7) History; (8) Statistics; (9) Political Science and the Law; (10) Geography; (11) Careers and Education; (12) Business; (13) Social  Customs, Home Life, and Sports; and (14) Science and Technology. Section 2, &quot;Priority Ratings of Sources,&quot; is designed to help small libraries in the acquisition process. The sources listed in the bibliography are divided into 10 groups, with 20 sources, such as almanacs and encyclopedias, arranged according to required frequency of purchase (e.g., annually, biennially). The remaining 59 works are arranged in their order of importance. Section 3, &quot;Reference Works Exercises,&quot; is intended for library workers new to the reference staff or more experienced workers who wish to review the use of basic reference tools. Nine exercises, each with an informative introduction, require the use of a variety of reference sources. The guide is indexed by title and subject. (KM)",

        "description":"In 1983, Santa Monica College (SMC) created a task force to assess the college's need for child care services and to devise possible service models for consideration. Subcommittees were formed to address student and staff child care needs; ways of funding child care services; criteria for possible child care facilities and sites which met these criteria; and policies regarding such issues as limits of responsibility, evaluation of services, fees, and eligibility. The task force found: (1) there was a significant need for child care services among students and staff; (2) although child care services on some community college campuses have become self-supporting, setting up a center at SMC would require a commitment from the district of start-up costs and a percentage of  operational costs, which were estimated at $100,000 to $150,000; (3) the facility would need to be close to campus and to conform to licensing regulations; and (4) policy decisions need to be made concerning the philosophy of the center, general operating procedures, ratio of staff members' children to students' children, staffing, parent involvement, and operating expenses. Based on study findings, four options were identified for SMC: providing information and referral to existing services, providing an infant/toddler care center, providing a pre-school center, or providing a combination of services. Addenda include information on needs assessment methodology and findings, the survey instrument, anecdotal reports, descriptions of possible service models, analyses of two facilities, a  report on a survey of other California colleges, discussions of funding possibilities, SMC's policy statement regarding child care services in 1977-78, and miscellaneous suggestions.

Part 2 focuses on the changing nature of the community college in relation to lifelong learning, the adult learner, community services and continuing education, and the  small/rural community college. Finally, part 3 explores future directions for the curriculum, looking at the use of educational technologies in the development of comprehensive learning assistance centers; the involvement of community colleges in high technology training; the continuing value of individualized, self-paced instruction; and the effects of students and faculty on the curriculum.

        "description":"A synthesis is provided of the information collected between September 1984 and April 1985 by Operational Program Review (OPR) teams regarding 22 California community college Extended Opportunity Programs and Services (EOPS) programs. Chapter 1 explains the purposes and evaluation methods of OPRs, and outlines the general characteristics of the EOPS programs reviewed in 1984-85, looking at student demographics, goals, high school graduation status, and general profiles. Chapter 2 offers information on the EOPS; its intended clientele; its outreach, recruitment, counseling, tutoring, transfer transition, financial aid, and other services; and its personnel. Chapter 3 highlights the most outstanding strengths and exemplary features of the 22 programs, in the areas of: (1)  management services; (2) outreach services; (3) instructional development and services; (4) counseling services; (5) transition services; (6) special activities; and (7) financial aid. Chapter 4 looks at ways EOPS can be improved, pointing to the following major themes within the OPR findings: the need for more thorough documentation of program services, the importance of providing over-and-above services, the impact of campus politics on EOPS programs, and the need to coordinate and utilize the efforts of EOPS staff more efficiently. This chapter also lists and discusses specific recommendations for improvement by college in the areas of program administration, financial aid, outreach/recruitment, counseling, tutoring, other support services, EOPS in-service, funding of EOPS positions,  and image/awareness.

Data sources for the study included documents  available within the Chancellor's Office and interviews conducted with community college unit administrators and representatives of appropriate external entities. The study revealed problems related to poor data quality due to lack of conscientious reporting, and to ambiguity or inconsistency in data element definitions; the inability to do longitudinal studies; failure to meet data needs due to an inability to link data sets; lack of data use; lack of outcome measures; high costs of data collection; and lack of confidence in a coordinated information system.

Following introductory comments, course objectives are enumerated; i.e., develop a perspective of the two-year college as an organization and social institution; understand the nature of the two-year college; identify major issues facing the two-year college; and develop skill in using selected futures research methods. Methods for achieving these objectives are discussed next, including the formation of an in-class environmental scanning committee and OCCC planning committee; the use of probability-impact charts; the use of impact  networks; the use of environmental analyses; and the development of the plan for OCCC. Next, student evaluations of their experience are summarized. A 13-page bibliography of works on the two-year college is presented, organized by such topics as objectives and functions, history, instruction, students, faculty, administration, and the future of the two-year college.

Studies show that nearly half of the students enrolled in so-called transfer curricula may have no intention of transferring, and that sizeable percentages of students enrolled in occupational courses go on to baccalaureate-granting institutions. The fact that these classes carry transfer credit or are classified as job training classes is a function of college accreditation, staffing, and financing, having little to do with the perceptions or intentions of the students who are enrolled. Consequently, college effectiveness may be misrepresented by research findings which seem to show low transfer and job placement rates. New measures of  institutional functioning are needed to differentiate curriculum content, which could be more accurately represented by labels such as Liberal Arts (including Science, Social Science, Humanities, and Fine and Performing Arts) and Skills (including Basic, Recreational, and Occupational Skills) from student intent. Student intent can be measured separately, using categories such as to prepare for transfer; prepare for a new occupation; gain skills to retrain, remain current, or advance in a current occupation; or satisfy personal interests. Categorizing the curriculum according to content would promote understanding of the colleges' role in providing general education, basic skills training, recreational skills, and occupational education for their communities.

Of the 997 first-time test takers, three quarters passed the test. A study was conducted to follow 246 students who did not pass the CLAST through the following year to see if they reached their goal of passing the CLAST, and to assess the impact the test had on these students. A short survey was mailed to all 246 students, requesting information on their educational activities and goals; perceived reasons for not passing the CLAST the first time; subsequent success on the CLAST; reactions to failing the CLAST; and ways students  would prepare better for the test. Study findings, based on a 41% response rate, included the following: (1) students failing the CLAST differed from those who passed in several ways, including the number of English as a second language credits, performance in English courses, and performance in math; (2) 162 students (66%) retook the CLAST, and 53% of these students passed; (3) of the 158 students who reenrolled at MDCC, 26% were still at the college in fall 1985; (4) 23% of the group reported having changed their goals as a result of the test; (5) students' responses to their failing scores varied from &quot;upset,&quot; to &quot;surprise,&quot; to &quot;angry&quot;; and (6) students' reasons for their failing the CLAST were also varied, with some students stating that they did not take the test seriously, while  others judged the test as &quot;unfair.&quot; The questionnaire and student responses are appended.

        "description":"An extensive literature exists on what makes good teachers, focusing on their characteristics, their behaviors in the classroom, and the effects they have on their students. This literature points to three groups as being currently involved in defining good teachers: students, who, as research demonstrates, are reliable observers, fair and unbiased raters, and capable of describing the characteristics and behaviors of good teachers; external judges assessing student outcomes as the measure of educational effectiveness; and educational researchers, who through their counting, observing, experimenting, and surveying, attempt to provide generalizable definitions and criteria for teaching effectiveness. The literature on criteria for evaluating the quality of instruction is deficient  in several areas, lacking good discussion of what teachers are trying to accomplish, a constructive approach to applying research to the improvement of practice, and a body of information on how to conduct research in the classroom. The most useful approach to filling these gaps in the literature, while at the same time improving undergraduate instruction, involves teachers doing research in their own classrooms and learning laboratories as a means of evaluating their effectiveness as teachers while fostering intellectual stimulation and professional renewal. Examples of the kinds of classroom research projects that might be undertaken include an investigation of the dropout problem, whether review sessions before exams promote long-term retention, or whether particular teaching methods  are effective. While these kinds of projects do not generally call for complicated research methodologies, they should use acceptable standards of research practice if they are to have value in improving classroom teaching.

Definitions of access, selectivity, assessment, evaluation, success, standards, excellence, student potential, and self-concept are presented in chapter II. Chapter III explores indicators of access and selectivity, focusing on institutional statements of philosophy, mission, and objectives; geography and delivery systems; curricula; student services; faculty; costs; and students. The prognosis for the  changing dominance of access and selectivity is discussed in chapter IV, along with views concerning action needed for revitalizing the community college.

        "description":"In 1982, the Houston Community College System (HCCS) initiated a marketing study designed to identify the education and training needs of the business community in relation to the community college's newly implemented program of professional development seminars. Through a telephone survey of 127 Houston area companies employing 100 or more people, the study sought to: (1) identify major companies which could be potential users of the professional development seminars; (2) determine the image of HCCS as a provider of the seminars; (3) identify professional development seminars with the greatest potential for successful marketing; and (4) identify ways to communicate the availability and benefits of the seminars. Survey findings indicated a high level of interest in the seminars  and led to the development of several marketing tools and strategies, including a folder providing basic information about seminars; a quarterly newsletter; and increased networking with organizations. In 1986, a similar study was conducted of companies with 50 or more employees. This study revealed high levels of employer interest in outside training, a lack of concern with college credit among 72% of the companies, a need for flexibility of format, a willingness among respondents to pay for training, and support for the community college as a source of employee training. As a result of its marketing studies, HCCS has developed a planned approach to developing its services to the business community. (LAL)",

        "description":"The main purpose of this paper is to provide a basis for discussing issues associated with the process of &quot;going to scale&quot; with programs of early childhood development. &quot;Going to Scale&quot; programs are described as those that attempt to reach as many potential beneficiaries as possible at a regional, national, or even worldwide level. The first section of the paper summarizes results from three analyses of successful projects and programs in an attempt to identify barriers to scale and to specify conditions, characteristics, strategies and processes accompanying successful programs. The second section examines advantages and drawbacks of three broad approaches to achieving scale, while the third section draws implications for child development programs from the preceding two  sections. The final section discusses costs, organizational issues, the role of communications, evaluation, and some options for international organizations as they consider ways to increase the coverage and impact of early childhood development programs.

        "description":"Concerned generally with the preparation of youth for adulthood, this symposium presentation provides a paper that discusses the need for consumer education for Malaysian youth, and also two abstracts: the first reports findings of a study of adolescents' buying practices in Malaysia, and the second is a survey of university students' attitudes toward preparing adolescents for the responsibilities of adulthood. The discussion of the need for consumer education by Evelyn Hong explores (1) problems of the education system and of youth; major issues of consumer education, including problems of consumer culture and the young, problems of development needs, problems of basic needs, the environmental crisis in Malaysia; and (2) consumer education activities related to the subject areas  of the school curriculum and extracurricular activities. Also discussed are annual exhibitions by the Consumers' Association of Penang (CAP), CAP workshops for student representatives from consumer clubs, research paper competitions and surveys. Concluding remarks provide a list of difficulties faced in implementing consumer education in developing countries. The first abstract describes work done by Jariah Hj Masud and Rohani Abdullah. Participating in their study of the spending patterns and buying and saving practices of Malaysian adolescents were 4,287 Form IV pupils from 32 schools in eight Malaysian states. The second abstract describes work by Hulman Sinaga. This study of Malaysian university students' attitudes regarding the preparation of adolescents for the responsibilities of  adulthood concludes tentatively that Malaysian youth are not very well prepared for their future. Full papers of the abstracted studies are available through the editors of this conference. (RH)",

Children's responses to formal and informal curricula dealing with aspects of human diversity such as race, ethnicity, gender, and exceptionality, were analyzed, as were children's interaction patterns. The data revealed that although both programs emphasized acceptance of individual differences, few planned activities dealt with race or cultural diversity. Activities were more appropriate for \"human relations\" education than \"multicultural\" education. The use of nonsexist language and materials and teachers' attempts to prevent gender stereotyping were found to have positive, though limited, effects. Children at both centers appeared to accept their mainstreamed peers,  with cross-ability interactions improving over the year. (Author/HOD)",

        "description":"A study compared child care centers determined to be of high quality and low quality along three established indicators of quality: good adult/child ratio, caregiver continuity, and caregiver training in child development. The centers were all community centers who enrolled full tuition parents. Eighty-nine families with children aged 18, 24, 30, and 36 months participated in the study. The research team spent a year observing each center. Their observations revealed additional differences in high versus low quality child care centers. In the high quality centers, parents were involved in the day-to-day life of the center, children were more likely to be self-regulated, parents were invested in their child's compliance both at home and in the center, and parents were less  stressful and more satisfied with their child care. The findings suggest that not only do good things within child care go together but that working parents who have less stressful lives and are more competent and confident in their parenting are more likely to be associated with high quality than low quality child care.

        "description":"An extension of an earlier longitudinal study of thriving, average, or non-thriving kindergarten children, this study examined the intellectual, academic, social, self-directive, and temperamental characteristics of children from kindergarten to grade four. Fifty-four of the children were perceived by their junior or senior kindergarten teachers as &quot;thriving in terms of your goals&quot;; 64 were perceived as &quot;making average progress&quot;; and 50 as &quot;not as yet thriving&quot; in kindergarten. Forty-six children were in a junior kindergarten-grade 1-grade 3 cohort, while the remaining 112 children were in a senior kindergarten-grade 2-grade 4 cohort. Data obtained included test data on language, memory, and academic achievement; and teacher-rated data on self-direction, resistance to  distraction, social abilities, resistance to frustration, and risk-taking. Results indicated that differences between children perceived in kindergarten as thriving, average, or not thriving persisted through grade four for language, academic achievement, and teacher ratings of self-direction, resistance to distraction, and risk-taking. Achievement differences were greater for the senior-kindergarten-grade 4 cohort, but still significant for the junior-kindergarten-grade 3 cohort. Rating differences were of the same magnitude for both cohorts. Results of data analysis also concerned children who were perceived by grade three and four teachers to have changed in thrive status versus those who had not. Children &quot;shifting&quot; between average and thriving status or vice versa had corresponding  changes in achievement tests and teacher ratings. (Author/HOD)",

Children in each group received three versions of each task on concurrent days. It was hypothesized that the group highest in metamemorial knowledge would score highest on the five working memory tasks. Results indicated that metamemory performance consistently predicted performance on the memory span measures. Three of the memory span measures showed a significant between-group effect on metamemory, while the remaining two evidenced strong trends in that direction. Analysis of repeated measures revealed no significant trials effects,  indicating that no improvement in performance occurred across repeated presentations of the tasks. Implications for a metacognitive explanation of working memory processes and educational implications are discussed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Children's temporal comprehension was assessed after viewing a television program containing flashbacks that shifted the events to much earlier times. Flashbacks were marked or not marked with sound effects, and time relations were represented with either dreamy dissolves or abrupt camera cuts. A total of 64 children, equally distributed by sex and by grades kindergarten and first versus fourth and fifth, participated in individual viewing sessions. After viewing, children sequenced picture sets to assess temporal integration of the plot line and answered questions to assess comprehension of the flashbacks. Results indicated that young children understood temporal concepts best after viewing camera dissolves, but older boys understood concepts of real time best after viewing  camera cuts. The results suggest that formal features differentially activate mental skills, depending on children's age and the complexity of the comprehension task. (Author/RH)",

Most parents defined play as something for fun or amusement, while teachers saw it both as fun and as an opportunity for cognitive and social development. Both parents and teachers said they promoted play by providing a variety of materials and parents also said they played with their children. The majority of teachers did not view play as an integral part of the curriculum, but instead described a learn/play dichotomy. Parents did not support the idea of a large amount of time in preschool being spent in play. Children's favorite play activities according to children and their parents and teachers were  outdoor play, dramatic play, blocks, and art activities. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This study was designed to investigate the effects of child-centered group play sessions (using the play therapy interaction approach) and sex differences on self-control, free play, and sociometric ratings in young bilingual Puerto Rican children. The participants in the study were 48 bilingual Puerto Rican four- and five-year-old children from two predominately Hispanic Southeastern Pennsylvania urban communities. Analyses made of pre-test scores for the dependent measures yielded no significant differences among groups. The main anlayses consisted of three 2 (treatment) x 2 (sex) analyses of variance with repeated measures (ANOVA), using pre- and post-measures on self-control behaviors, free play ratings, and sociometric scores. Separate post hoc Tukey tests were run on each  of the three main dependent measures. Results showed that children who received group play sessions outperformed those in the control group on the self-control and free play rating scales; boys in the experimental treatment outperformed both girls in the experimental treatment and all children in the control group on the sociometric measure. The results were interpreted and discussed in terms of non-directive humanistic theories of play therapy (e.g., Rogerian) as they relate to intervention techniques for meeting personal and emotional needs of children in underserved minority groups.

The three major career education counseling elements of career exposure, work preparation, and basic skills development are described. The three strands of career exposure are discussed: self-awareness activities, providing job and role information, and decision-making/goal-attaining activities. Through written information, interview, and job site involvement, work preparation is described as providing students with practical experience and job option awareness.  Several programs which provide basic skills to youth who have left school prior to graduation (e.g., Adult Basic Education and General Equivalency Diploma) are reviewed. Grades at which the different elements should be implemented and how career education counseling is different for migrant youth are described. Discussions regarding community involvement, counselor responsibility, the incorporation of counseling elements into different curricula and existing programs, and a list of five existing migrant career education counseling programs conclude the document.

        "description":"This classic study is one of a series of reports of investigations carried out during 1936 and 1937 under the &quot;Project in Research in Universities&quot; of the Office of Education. The report describes work done during a 6-year period (1930-36) in a school for Spanish-speaking children where English (language, spelling, writing, reading) was not taught as a subject but was acquired incidentally in the course of normal childhood activities. The work described took place at La Jolla School--which had an enrollment of approximately 180 Mexican children--in Placentia, California. Chapters 1 and 2 discuss problems of educating non-English-speaking children; Chapter 3 focuses on the problems of the Mexican American child with sections on racial background and social status, income and  health handicaps, and school performance. Chapter 4 describes the school and its experimental curriculum based on four major subjects: (1) learning to play wholesome games; (2) learning to make things, both useful and ornamental; (3) learning to enjoy stories, songs, and pictures; and (4) learning about the environment affecting child life. In Chapter 5, which makes up nearly one-half the report, it is explained that English as studied in this project is largely limited to vocabulary. The chapter consists of a variety of vocabulary data collected at the school and presented in tabular form: oral vocabulary by teachers, oral and written vocabulary by pupils, and spelling and language errors by pupils. Extensive word lists and word frequencies are included along with discussion of  vocabulary and language learning. Concluding chapters cover educational philosophy and administration of the school and program evaluation issues. A 116-item bibliography concludes the document. (JHZ)",

        "description":"The concept and purpose of this facilitator guide is to provide the three facilitator groups of educators, park and resource management personnel, and parents of handicapped children with information on how to cooperatively design and implement an outdoor education program for handicapped students. Chapter 1 (contributed by Vicki Stayton) outlines historical perspectives on outdoor education and outdoor education for the disabled, rationale for outdoor education for the handicapped, program models (traditional, segregated, segregated/mainstreamed, mainstreamed, residential, and day), and future trends. Chapter 2 describes steps in the cooperative planning approach: conducting a needs assessment, exploring possible outdoor education program models, and designing and developing  curriculum. Chapter 3 reviews funding and financial considerations including identifying sources, writing proposals, and making presentations. Chapter 4 considers issues of legal liability. Chapter 5 addresses personnel preparation and training, working with parents, and program implementation in the areas of scheduling, transportation, medical care, diet/food service, health and safety, and outdoor ethics and stewardship. Chapter 6 (contributed by Katie Ahern McGuinnes and Terry D'Eugenio) focuses on accessibility, offering design guidelines and techniques for considering user needs (behavioral mapping, photography, role playing, bubble diagrams, sense scales, and model-making). Chapter 7 presents strategies for evaluation. Chapter 8 contains a bibliography on outdoor education program  planning, a list of audio-visual aides, and resources on overcoming attitudinal barriers and barrier-free environments. Each of the first 7 chapters includes a list of literature cited, and the text is illustrated with several photographs. Appendices contain sample forms and describe special population characteristics and implications for program planning. (NEC)",

        "description":"This teacher training guide provides information about Navajo cultural beliefs that conflict with learning in the dominant society's educational system. The guide offers rationales for the taboos and recommendations for providing appropriate learning situations, materials, and multicultural learning styles. Section 1 contains information on Navajo traditional taboos about snakes, green lizards, frogs, bears, coyotes, owls, lightning, fire at night, grave sites, rainbows, noise at night, baskets, playing ball, winter season rituals, death in the family, looking in the eye, outward affection to relatives, close contact, and advance planning. Section 2 discusses beliefs about questioning, talking, arrowheads, feathers, and Navajo clan and extended family relationships. Section 3  addresses educational problems for Navajo children due to the lifestyle their parents can provide within a contemporary economic crisis. Considered are economic impacts of lack of electricity, and hot running water, inadequate shelter, clothing, and educational materials, and problems of communication and transportation; geographic/weather impacts of road conditions, bussing, isolation, and inclement weather; social problems of limited parental support, or value for education, time concept, and unfamiliarity with curriculum, one-parent families, and poor self-image; impacts of educational rewards, education standards, policies, and curriculum; and health problem impacts of malnutrition, inadequate health clinic services, and limited juvenile counseling services. A final section provides  definitions of salient terms used in the guide. (NEC)",

Introductory remarks by task force members outline the bill's food assistance provisions, which include increased funding for food stamp programs, reauthorization of surplus commodity distribution, improvement of nutrition monitoring and education programs for low-income groups, and an employment and training program for food stamp recipients. This report includes transcriptions of the hearing proceedings and numerous prepared statements from health professionals, private citizens, and local program leaders. Testimony and answers to questions by Robert E. Leard of the Food  and Nutrition Service explain and defend the agency's food assistance programs and policies. Topics include definitions of hunger, health and nutritional status of the rural poor in Appalachia, infant mortality rates, health care during pregnancy, and health and nutrition for infants and young children.

        "description":"Evaluation of a 3-year transition education program at the Pingelly School in Western Australia used data from 29 students and staff interviews, direct observation, and document analysis to compare 4 projects established to improve the employability of students (in particular, Aboriginal students and girls who were at highest risk of being early school leavers with poor employment prospects) and to develop viable businesses which could be transferred into the community. The first project was based on horticulture; the second (called Pinten) produced high quality tea towels, wall hangings, and placemats for the Australian tourist market; the third involved production of wooden toys; and the fourth was based on paper making and carpet collage. The report focuses on the Pinten  project, presenting details of project origins, progress, and success; student perceptions of the project's usefulness and satisfaction, ownership, group cohesion and self-esteem; teacher reaction; role of the principal; and comparison to the other transition projects. Findings showed that the Pinten project generated high levels of student satisfaction with all aspects of the experience, teacher views ranged from conditional support to outright opposition, and there was significant reliance on the principal's enthusiasm and support. Evaluation results indicated that the remaining transition projects did not achieve the same positive outcome. (NEC)",

        "description":"A study of 1,497 nonmetropolitan counties was conducted to test the possible contribution of agricultural chemical use to cancer mortality rates in rural counties. The dependent variables were 20-year age-adjusted mortality rates for 1950 to 1969 for five categories of cancer: genital, urinary, lymphatic, respiratory, and digestive. Because sex and race are both recognized factors in cancer etiology, only rates for white males were used in the analysis. Significant associations were found between agricultural chemical use and four of the five types of cancer examined. Herbicides were positively and significantly associated with genital, lymphatic, and digestive cancer. Insecticides had a strong positive relationship to respiratory cancer. Fertilizer use was largely unrelated to  cancer mortality with the exception of a modest negative association with digestive cancer. Of the remaining social, economic, and demographic variables, foreign stock exhibited the largest and most consistent influence and was the strongest predictor of digestive cancer. Income and education were both significant in respiratory and digestive cancer, but of opposite sign. In spite of the limitations of this study, the findings are highly suggestive of the need for additional research on possible links between agricultural chemical use and county cancer mortality.

        "description":"Using data from the 1980 Census Public Use Microdata Sample, this paper examines characteristics of women who live alone and incidence of poverty in this group. Results show there are two distinct subgroups among women who live alone: the elderly, most of whom are widowed; and the young, many of whom are single or divorced. For both groups, about one in four is living in poverty. Small town and rural women are more likely to be poor than central city women. Least likely to be poor are women who live in suburbs. Nonwhite women are more likely to be poor than white women. There is a curvilinear pattern with age, with two-thirds of women under 20 and those 80 and older living in poverty. In a multivariate analysis of younger women, employment, education, and age explain most of the  variance in proportion in poverty. Education, having multiple sources of income, and race are the strongest explanatory variables for older women. Women have greater chances of living in poverty due to lower wage scales and dependence solely upon widow benefits. Government programs aimed at the elderly poor often fall short of raising them out of poverty. References, data tables, and graphs are appended. (Author/NEC)",

        "description":"A study of the characteristics of rural counties that gained or failed to gain young physicians examined location choices of all physicians who graduated from allopathic and osteopathic schools of medicine between 1974 and 1978 and were practicing in a primary care specialty in 2,111 rural counties in 1983. First, the characteristics of counties in which young physicians were located were compared with the characteristics of counties that failed to attract young physicians and significant differences were identified. The 1,228 gaining counties tended to have more population, higher population growth rates, greater population density, a better educated population, higher income, less agriculture, and more health resources than the 883 counties that did not gain a physician. The  findings suggest that there are differences between the counties selected by National Health Service Corps (NHSC) alumni and non-alumni and that, for NHSC alumni particularly, factors other that the characteristics of communities appear to intervene in the location decision. It seems likely that the NHSC service itself is one of those intervening variables. This is suggested by the fact that satisfaction with aspects of the NHSC experience is positively associated with a decision to choose rural and Health Manpower Shortage Area practice.

        "description":"A survey of young physicians in rural areas was conducted and information was gathered from other data sources and analyzed for three main purposes: (1) to evaluate the retention of National Health Service Corps (NHSC) alumni in Health Manpower Shortage Areas (HMSAs); (2) to document the distribution of NHSC alumni, Private Practice Option (PPO) physicians, and non-NHSC physicians in rural areas; and (3) to examine the practice patterns (e.g., use of auxiliary personnel, fee structures, patient characteristics) of NHSC alumni, non-alumni, and recent PPOs. The major conclusion of the analysis was that the NHSC has had an impact on the distribution of physician services in rural areas. Young physicians who fulfill an NHSC obligation in a rural HMSA and who remain in rural practice  are very likely to choose to practice in a HMSA. This is true even though NHSC alumni are less likely than non-alumni to have had any prior exposure to rural areas. In addition, NHSC alumni in HMSAs retain many of the practice patterns which are evident in NHSC sites and, consequently, may be more accessible to low income and working class populations in these areas.

Findings indicate: (1) the long-term trend toward larger farms and the decline in number of farms and farmers have resulted in a steady decline in number of retail establishments since 1948; (2) employment in the service sector has grown steadily since 1940; (3) Decatur County has held its older population because of its excellent medical facilities; (4) county elevators were temporarily  positively affected because of over production and low grain prices; (5) non-agricultural businesses not negatively affected by the farm crisis are the hospital, the nursing homes, drug stores, and food stores; (6) firms negatively affected include automobile dealers, hardware/appliance stores, and furniture stores; and (7) encouraged by their bankers, county agricultural extension agent, and suppliers, farmers have adopted survival strategies which include reducing machinery purchases, cutting operating expenses, participating in farm programs, taking out multi-peril insurance, and using sound accounting and borrowing practices. Twenty-five data tables are appended. (NEC)",

Three equations were hypothesized: (1) the quantity supply functions; (2) the quantity demand function; and (3) the quality demand function. The variables in the equations are education expenditures, percent of 9th grade students graduating in 4 years, 11th grade reading achievement test scores, mean per capita income, percent of adults 25 years old or older with a high school diploma, employment rate, rural or urban district, and percent of non-white population. The model was fitted with data obtained from the 1980-81 report on local government expenditures and from the 1980-81 state department of education publication on schools. The equations  were estimated with three stage least squares. The variation explained by the model (weighted R-squared) was .6328. Rank and order condition for identification were met. The results of the study suggest that decisions regarding education services can be meaningfully viewed as a simultaneous consideration of benefits and costs. (JHZ)",

Pre- and posttests were given to 150 students in grades 7-9 in the Mora Public Schools to assess: behavioral intent for accompanying drinking drivers and experimenting with pills, knowledge of alcoholic content of beverages, perceived impairment of driving ability from marijuana smoking, frequency of drinking to excess, and frequency of accompanying drinking drivers. Teachers kept logs of drug/alcohol related incidents. Treatment exercises were given to students after teachers received inservice training in their use. Health  promoting outcomes included favorable changes in behavioral intent for riding with impaired drivers. Interviews with teachers and officials suggested that health behavior variables such as peer pressure were not sufficiently impacted by treatment exercises. Previous attempts by health educators had failed in this close-knit, culturally isolated town; but, this program was accepted because the research team observed cultural strictures, was introduced by an accepted individual, and prompted community responsibility for resolving the problem. Appended tables include pre- and posttest results, sample reporting forms, and teacher reports of substance misuse incidents. (LFL)",

        "description":"Using survey responses and catalogue descriptions from 38 programs, the paper examines the current status of Chicano studies programs in four-year colleges/universities in the Southwest. Findings indicate many programs evolved from the civil rights legislation of the 1960s to address ethnic minority concerns and to offer curriculum in the humanities and social sciences but currently serve as a means for fulfilling Affirmative Action requirements and developing a community of Chicano scholars. Identified as problems affecting Chicano studies programs are low Chicano student enrollment, relatively poor student retention and completion of college degrees, paucity of Chicano faculty, and a negative environment for Affirmative Action. Most problems identified by Chicano respondents  appear to revolve around the perception of little support for Affirmative Action. Most Chicano studies programs need and want more Chicano faculty and students on their campuses. With more faculty present, the possibility of attracting (increasing enrollment) and serving (increasing retention) more Chicano students improves. Key components of an ideal program, as identified by the survey, include, in order of importance, better campus Affirmative Action, more trained (Ph.D.) Chicano scholars, greater funding, more &quot;activists&quot; (politically involved Chicano students), good &quot;educational&quot; services, a positive public image, and strong community ties.

All 20 participating teachers received instruction in the teaching of electricity but only ten were designated as the experimental group which was involved in an awareness program on the possibilities of sexism in the physical sciences. Results of this study showed that in the experimental classes, boys and girls in mixed-sex and single-sex groups exhibited the  same pattern of activity, whereas the control classes showed behavior differences in the mixed-sex group. It was concluded that single-sex grouping may be beneficial to girls' science education in cases where teachers have a low level of awareness and skills in relation to creating and maintaining a non-sexist learning environment.

        "description":"Most studies of children's solution processes on simple addition and subtraction word problems have used individual interviews or the analysis of error patterns on paper-and-pencil tests as the primary data-gathering techniques. The present paper reports an investigation in which the contribution of eye-movement data was explored for studying those aspects of the problem-solving process that are inaccessible with the methods mentioned above, especially the text-comprehension processes contributing to the construction of a problem representation, and the subject's decision-making processes in choosing a solution strategy. Eleven addition and subtraction word problems were administered individually to 9 high-ability and 11 low-ability first graders. For each problem, eye-movement  data were collected while children read and solved the tasks; afterwards they were asked to explain verbally how they arrived at their answer. Besides the usual findings concerning problem difficulty, solution strategies, typical errors and solution times, an anlysis of the gaze durations and the sequences of fixations is presented. In addition to some interesting findings concerning solution processes, the study also showed that eye-movement registration can be used easily with young children, and is appropriate for collecting data on their cognitive processes. Five pages of references and seven data tables conclude the document. (Author/MNS)",

Initially a review is presented of the components of scientific literacy and the findings of the Opportunity Systems in high school science study are summarized. The following sections consist of a form for organizing information on particular aspects of the science program and also a series of points to consider in relation to the questions posed. Topics addressed in the sections include: (1) science curriculum structure (offering suggestions for constructing a science course chain and program  alternatives); (2) exercises of opportunity (highlighting enrollment aspects); and (3) emphasis on scientific literacy in instruction (examining the factors of time and focus already given to components of scientific literacy).

It is an effort to translate the findings of a study of problem-solving instruction in grade 7 into a set of materials that provide teachers with new knowledge about mathematical problem solving, current instructional practices, and recommendations for problem-solving instruction. This booklet was designed to help teachers guide students in work with word problems of the type found routinely in mathematics textbooks. It introduces one way to think about problem solving that teachers may find useful as a framework for organizing instruction. It also suggests exercises, problems, and classroom activities to involve students in problem analysis, a critical stage of problem solving. Types of problems, relative  difficulty, and common errors are noted first, followed by a model of problem solving that splits the process into problem-analysis and problem-solution phases. Implications for instruction are discussed. Appendix A contains materials designed to involve students in four problem-analysis skills; for each skill, three to six student activities and a series of exercise questions are given. Appendix B lists whole number and fraction word problems as a resource for developing new activities and exercises. (MNS)",

To reach this goal, a computer assisted instruction (CAI) program on open sentences, incorporating knowledge about students' problem solving strategies and misconceptions, was constructed. Two studies are reported, the first to gain more insight into the process of problem solving and the second to evaluate the functioning of the CAI program in the classroom. In the first study, 339 pupils in grades 2 and 3 were given a test, followed by interviews with 16 high performers and 16 low performers. Their answer patterns are discussed, and models of knowledge, the diagnostic program, and the remedial program are described. In  the second study, the CAI program was evaluated with second-grade pupils in five schools. It was concluded that children can learn fundamental concepts relatively quickly with a computer program; one-third profited significantly. (MNS)",

Sixty children (15 in each grade, 2 through 5) at 5 elementary schools in Butte County, California, were individually administered 18 tasks designed to reveal their thinking about place value and part-whole relations. On six tasks children were to identify the number of objects represented by the individual digits in a two-place numeral. Seven fifth-graders, seven fourth-graders, two third-graders, and no second-graders were successful on all six tasks; 28 children failed to convincingly demonstrate any understanding of the tens digit. Success on prerequisite tasks measuring rational counting by tens, identifying the tens and ones places, partitioning  collections into a tens part and a ones part, and conserving grouped number were all found to be necessary for success on more than four digit-correspondence tasks. Understanding of part-whole relations as reflected by success on arithmetic word problems and on logical classification tasks was necessary for success on more than two digit-correspondence tasks. A five-stage model of the development of children's understanding of place value was then proposed. A three-page bibliography concludes the document. (MNS)",

The outcomes of the transformation for student learning and instruction are discussed. The findings suggest student gains in computational competence, mathematical effort, and attitude via concept-oriented instruction exceeded notably the gains of students in other classes where instruction was computationally oriented. The study employed field-research methods including observations, interviews, and the collection of student data across the project's three years to capture and describe the nature and effects of the instructional interventions. At the end of the intervention period, students and instruction were organized  in ways that focused student interest, attention, and involvement on the learning of mathematics. Many illustrative segments of classroom interactions are included.

Three of the programs are aimed at midcareer professionals; the fourth is aimed at recent college graduates who did not prepare to become teachers as undergraduates. All are small programs; they provide models for other institutions to follow. The programs are at Harvard University, the University of Massachusetts, the University of Vermont, and Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. The study was organized around six research questions: (1) What are the characteristics of these programs? (2) What are the characteristics of their students? (3) What attracted the students to the programs? (4) What are students' evaluations of the programs? (5) What are the  career plans and motivations of the students? and (6) What are the recommendations of the students for program design? After the six questions are answered, conclusions and recommendations are presented and five suggestions for further research are given. (MNS)",

Five concept maps representing 15 major content principles were developed. Two hundred twenty-six students from 12 schools in Maine were interviewed on marine science, natural resources and decision-making concepts and principles. Student knowledge was then classified according to correct concepts, missing concepts and misconceptions. Similarities and differences between the three grade levels were analyzed and compared to results of the Maine Assessment of Educational Progress in Science. The results indicated that the  students in the sample did learn a few basic marine and natural resource concepts in the elementary grades, but that there was little further assimilation of new concepts or differentiation of existing concepts as students progressed through the grades. The results are discussed with regard to possible implications for future marine science curricula. (TW)",

The ethical issue of family planning programs with elements of coercion (such as forced abortions) is raised. It is suggested that the critical element in United States foreign aid be voluntary family planning activities that do not violate certain basic principles of human rights. The relationship between population and key resources such as cropland, water, fertilizer, oil, technology  and climate is also discussed. Land-use changes associated with population growth, such as deforestation, which in turn affects soil erosion, climate and related environmental change, and consequently food production are highlighted. Additional issues raised include: the need to address poverty and employment, and the U.S. role in not only financing but also increasing awareness and receptivity to family planning programs in developing countries.

Organized in a similar fashion, all units include a statement of rationale; concepts and generalizations to be stressed; behavioral objectives; and three types of activities: initiating activities to introduce the unit, developmental activities to teach the heart of the unit, and culminating activities to conclude the unit. The unit topics include two overviews, one emphasizing Japan's interest in education, involvement in  international trade, and the structure of the government; the second reviewing Japan's geography, agriculture, people, and urban population. The topics also include Japanese industry, urban and rural society, land, culture, and lifestyle. An evaluation process and resources conclude the guide. (TRS)",

These countries rely on food imports and, increasingly, on food aid to meet minimum nutritional requirements for their populations.

Recurrent food emergencies, such as those recently affecting Ethiopia and the Sahel countries, may raise total food aid in 1990 by five to eight times the actual receipts annually in 1981-83. Improved policies and increased foreign exchange earnings could help about half of the study countries satisfy their consumption needs from domestic production.

A collegiate greek lettered organization was chosen for study due to the strong identity such organizations generally promote. The organizational culture is defined through description of organizational culture elements such as: environment, values, heroes, rites and rituals, and the cultural network. The described culture is then used as a perspective from which the conflict resolution communication is interpreted. While voting was the established procedure for conflict resolution and decision making, an informal hierarchy of influence existed. Factors determining this influence are: physical size,  a good wit, length of association, and office held in the fraternity. The one extensive period of contact with the fraternity was from March 1980 to August 1983. (SO)",

From a list of 607 North Dakota social studies teachers, ranging from grades 7 to 12 in both public and private schools, a target sample of 266 teachers was administered a questionnaire. All regions of the states, with at least one teacher form each school, were represented. One hundred sixty-eight teachers (63%) responded, yielding information on the amount of teaching, kinds of materials, types of teaching activities, and teachers' perceptions and opinions on teaching about East Asia in the schools. Detailed, question by question, analyses of the data, with accompanying statistical tables are presented. The findings indicate that teachers in North Dakota secondary schools do discuss or teach  about East Asia, most commonly in the history and geography classrooms; China and Japan were more likely to be taught than any other regions in East Asia, with the textoook being the dominant medium utilized. Implications of the findings were discussed. Appendices include the questionnaire, cover letter, and the geographic distribution of responses. (SY)",

With the underlying theme being the promotion of both unity and diversity, the digest discusses four aspects of the problem: (1) the meaning of education about ethnic diversity in the United States, which concentrates on core values; (2) reasons for its importance, which include enhancing students' self-concepts; (3) the place of ethnic diversity in the curriculum, which should permeate all levels; and (4) procedures for teaching about ethnic diversity in the United States, which suggest  seven approaches, including unbiased examination, comparisons, positive interpersonal relationships, community resources, reading programs, and value reinforcement.

        "description":"The purpose of the paper is to examine potential reasons for the lack of influence that reflective inquiry has had on social studies theory and to suggest an alternative perspective. The first two sections of the paper discuss the reasons for reflective inquiry's failure to impact on practice and include: (1) the interpretation of the inquiry model itself, which entails contradicting conceptions of Dewey's model such as the technical/procedural approach that has become rarefied with the steps of inquiry themselves emphasized over the process; and (2) the generally traditional practices of preservice teacher education, which hinge on the premise that teacher educators, while advocating reflective inquiry, do not practice this approach by example and do not furnish a laboratory  where such practice is modeled, experienced, and reflected upon. The third section of the paper advocates the need to adopt a critical theory perspective in social studies education by exploring what a preservice program based on a critical theory of education might contain, emphasize, and encourage. Three strategies of critical discourse (focusing on the social construction of knowledge and the nature of social life; emphasizing analytical skills instead of technical proficiency; and highlighting generic theories of teaching with an examination of personal theories of action resulting from beliefs and past experiences) and implications for teacher education are discussed. The paper concludes that proper preservice courses can be translated into good teaching practices. A three-page list  of references is included. (TRS)",

Covering a development period of approximately 1.5 years, the essay traces the step-by-step efforts of the National Archives to develop a supplemental teaching unit on the Constitution. The process included examining existing material packets; reviewing the professional literature; surveying current textbooks' handling of the Constitution; consulting archivists; selecting key documents; tracing the development of a single constitutional issue; and overcoming the problems of researching and writing the unit. Realizing few teachers will use the 35-document unit in  its entirety, the aim of the Constitutional Packet as conceived by the National Archives is to enable students to better understand and appreciate the Constitution, to enliven the key figures in its history, to demonstrate its impact upon their lives, and to realize that the Constitution is a living document.

Included is information with regard to who may teach religious education, how it is timetabled, and what provisions are made for those who dissent.  Also included is information on interpretations of &quot;religious education&quot; and the role of the school in the religious education of students, and some mention of the controversies surrounding that role.

        "description":"The use of computers in the classroom has been touted as an important innovation in education. This article features some recently developed software for use in teaching psychology and different approaches to classroom computer use. Uses of software packages for psychological research designs are included as are applications and limitations of computerized teaching tools. Advantages and disadvantages of word processing and statistics packages are described, and applications and recommendations for software use are presented. Two software programs which were specifically designed for instruction are reviewed. Psychworld, written for an introductory psychology class, is a fourteen set package involving a combination of graphics and text. Basic Electrophysiology is a home grown  program for advanced students, consisting of a series of programs aimed at teaching the student how nerve action potential occurs. Basic Electrophysiology is to be used on an individual basis, whereas some Psychworld modules could be used for large audiences. Since many people are developing excellent software but not marketing it, a Clearinghouse for Teaching/Learning Activities in Psychology has been established at the University of Southern Indiana (Evansville) to encourage the use of computer-oriented teaching aids. Using software for teaching and learning processes requires the instructor to assess student needs and software quality. Increasingly student needs and wants can be met by appropriate hardware and software. Figures from Basic Electrophysiology, a listing of areas of  psychology software developed for personal use, and an appendix which list programs written as teaching tools are included. (APG)",

        "description":"Using data from the 1960, 1970, and 1980 censuses of Thailand, this paper explores the changing pattern of internal migration. Throughout the period, the census indicates a high degree of stability. Lifetime migration shows a slight rise in each period; recently it has risen in inter- as opposed to intra-regional movement. Five year interprovincial migration increased between 1955-60 and 1965-70 but declined in 1975-80. Between 1970 and 1980 interprovincial migration declined while interregional movement increased. Rural to rural migration declined while urban to urban movement became prevalent. Thus, by 1975-80 internal population redistribution had changed considerably from 1955-1960. Bangkok, the North, and the South had gained population while the Central and Northeast  regions lost. Most recently, only Bangkok and the Central regions gained while the others lost population. The greatest loss was that of the Northeast, where net loss to Bangkok and the Central region alone accounted for three-fourths of the gains made by these two areas. These changing distributions are partly related to regional inequalities. Despite development efforts, the Northeast continues as the poorest region, while Bangkok and the contiguous provinces in the Central region profit from high levels of development and the capital's primacy. Migration patterns may also reflect greater reliance on temporary movement, in lieu of long-term migration, especially as transportation networks have improved. Thirty-three references conclude the document. (Author/APG)",

        "description":"Separate schools were introduced into Ontario between 1841 and 1867 when Upper Canada was joined with Lower Canada to form the United Province of Canada. The school acts of 1841 and 1843 outlined the basic arrangements by which either a Roman Catholic or a Protestant minority might establish a dissenting separate school board. Since the School Act of 1863 (usually referred to as the Scott Act), the separate school question has focused on two major issues: (1) the appropriate division of tax monies between the public and separate school systems; and (2) the involvement of separate schools in secondary education. The Tiny Township legal case of 1926-1928 resolved that Roman Catholic separate schools had no automatic constitutional right to offer the full range of secondary  education. Subsequent Roman Catholic campaigns for full funding of secondary education have taken a political rather than legal route. (Author/BZ)",

As editor of &quot;School and Society&quot; from 1953 to 1976, Brickman encouraged and published young scholars, many for the first time. For the Norwood educational reprint series he edited over 40 books, contributed substantive  articles to encyclopedias, and wrote numerous articles and reviews for professional journals. He held many visiting professorships and was a member of numerous committees.

Questions are raised about the adequacy of the informational base of the main reports on excellence and reform, and the role of research in assisting policymakers and educators as they carry out legislative mandates to improve the schools. To examine these issues, papers were commissioned from authorities in three fields: (1) improving teacher incentives and the quality of teaching; (2) the case of dropouts as a possible mismatch between excellence and equity; and (3) teaching and learning higher-order thinking skills in the schools. This report  summarizes the nine authors' assessments of the applicability of research in their specialities to the reports on reform and relevant actions around the country. In varying degrees this paper demonstrates that the links between research, policy, and action in the reform movement have been less than ideal. (JD)",

        "description":"Reading comprehension skills can be taught effectively across the curriculum leading to enhanced critical thinking and reading skills, as well as improved performance in content areas. Skilled readers plan their approach to the task at hand, monitor their learning as they read, apply strategies to foster learning, evaluate, and if necessary, revise their approach to learning from texts. The best approach to creating independent readers is to guide them in acquiring strategies for attacking texts on their own. Instructional procedures that introduce strategies as they are needed in the context of actually understanding texts, where the strategies are demonstrated over time, and where the student is fully informed of the purpose of the strategy, produce long-lasting, significant  improvements in reading comprehension scores. A description is presented of one such instructional program in which the techniques of expert scaffolding of materials and reciprocal teaching through dialogue are used. The dialogue includes spontaneous discussion and argument and four main comprehension-fostering activities: summarizing, questioning, clarifying, and predicating. Implications for curriculum reform in reading comprehension are discussed. A six-page list of references concludes the document. (JD)",

One type of reform being proposed for secondary schools is aimed at students and at the schools' power to make sorting judgments about students. Examples of these reforms are differentiated diplomas, minimal competency tests for graduation, reduced electives, and increased academic requirements. Such changes affect the students who will have to comply with these reforms and also affect the structure of the schools by giving them increased power to make judgments about students. Another type of proposed reform is aimed at the organizational aspects of schools. Such changes include curriculum reorganization, itemizing what is to be learned, what students are supposed to  accomplish, and how teachers and learning are to be evaluated. These processes will increase the number and power of administrators and supervisors, decrease the discretion of teachers and students, and increase the level of bureaucracy in schools. A more hierarchial, bureaucratically-governed educational structure is emerging. In such a situation, an increased number of judgments about students will be made, and it may be difficult to avoid lodging the more pejorative judgments against the economically poorer students.

A review of research on successful dropout prevention programs reveals four common characteristics: (1) they separate potential dropouts from other students; (2) they have strong vocational components; (3) they utilize out-of-class learning; and (4) they are intensive in the sense of providing small group or individualized instruction, having low student/teacher ratios, and offering more counseling than ordinary schools. A brief examination of West German secondary schools, which emphasize the \"dual system\" of apprenticeship combined with part-time vocational schooling, helps identify and elaborate upon issues related to the first three characteristics. While differentiation  among students may be a troubling practice because it can harm the achievements and self-evaluations of students identified as slower than average, the probable consequences of assignment to a lower group can be favorable. The practical, real life quality of vocational education is more comfortable and effective for marginal students than abstract academic education. Vocational education or manual training can serve as a vehicle for teaching academic and general skills rather than specific competence for employment. The assumption found in recent secondary education reform proposals that the classroom is always the best environment for learning is not supported by research. Marginal students who have not been successful in classrooms need planned opportunities to learn in other settings.  (JD)",

        "description":"A major lesson of the past decade's education reform measures and school improvement efforts is that educational change of almost any stripe is a problem of the smallest unit. It is a problem that turns on the incentives, attitudes, abilities, and responses of those ultimately responsible for seeing that initiatives for improvement translate into improved educational services for students. Teachers teaching in classrooms is what education is all about. Teachers teaching in classrooms determine the eventual result of reform policies; consequently, the spate of present policies that take direct aim at the competence of the teaching force must be assessed against the reality of the task. That reality encompasses the context within which teachers teach, the incentives to support  professional growth and commitment to a teaching career, and the factors that affect a teacher's ability to respond to incentives, to develop professionally, and to aspire to excellence in classroom practice. This essay undertakes such an analysis by looking at the context, incentives, and constraints of teaching and then by examining some of the most popular teacher reform policies against this reality.

Recent scientific and technological advances offer significant opportunities to implement more effective teaching of these skills. By investigating intellectual processes, cognitive science has led to a significantly better understanding of the underlying human thought processes responsible for good performance in complex domains. This paper describes briefly some of the opportunities made possible by these recent developments. Some important higher-order cognitive skills are identified and the evidence that these can be taught is discussed. It is pointed out that some current educational practices are ineffective or even harmful. Requirements needed for the  effective teaching of higher-order cognitive skills are described and practical suggestions are made for promoting such teaching.

For example, novice writers depend upon having knowledge already assembled in forms ready for written presentation, while experts can bring more complex knowledge-processing procedures to bear to transform knowledge into coherent and effective form. Data from a variety of research projects and from national assessments are presented which indicate that novice strategies prevail throughout the elementary and high school years and including, in many cases, the university years. In the second half of the paper, data from research that  aims to foster more expert strategies are presented. In the work reported, students are provided with explicit instruction in procedures used by experts, thus gaining knowledge about procedures that foster reflective analysis.

Talented people who enter teaching must now do so out of a positive attraction to teaching. Unfortunately, teaching has few positive attractions and those few it does have are relatively unimportant when contrasted with the attractions of other occupations. Public education cannot overcome the relatively deprived status the occupation imposes on present and prospective members until and unless comprehensive and fundamental changes occur in the way teachers are educated, evaluated, trained, motivated, and rewarded. Such changes cannot occur in one sector of the educational establishment (e.g., teacher  education) without corresponding changes in the other sectors of the educational establishment (e.g., teacher certification, teacher compensation, and systems for evaluating and rewarding teachers). This paper describes some of these conditions and suggests ways in which these might be changed. (JD)",

        "description":"An analysis of implementation of educational change distinguishes between three kinds of processes: mutual adaptation, cooptation, and nonimplementation. Mutual adaptation was defined as the process in which implementation was successful, and in which significant changes in participant attitudes, skills and behavior occurred. Implementation was characterized by a process in which project goals and methods were modified to suit the needs and interests of participants and in which participants changed to meet the requirements of the project. This paper elaborates and expands the definition of mutual adaptation to include: (1) the adaptive process of an innovative program and its implementers; and (2) the dynamic interaction between program developers and trainers, i.e., innovators  on the one hand, and program implementers on the other. The conceptualization of this definition is illustrated through the study of the implementation of an innovative instructional approach called &quot;Complex Instruction.&quot; It is demonstrated how this dynamic interaction between developers of educational innovations and its implementers has led to adaptations in the innovation, in the training model provided by the innovators, in the behaviors of the participants and in their organizational context. These adaptations have improved and strengthened the program and made it more effective. (JD)",

Subjects trained four days a week using high-intensity interval-type cycle exercises. Workouts included six 4-minute intervals cycling at 85 percent maximal oxygen uptake (VO sub 2 max), separated by 3-minute intervals of lower intensity cycling at 25% VO sub 2 max. AT and VO sub 2 max were assessed prior to and immediately following the 6-week program, and VO sub 2 max was reassessed weekly in the exercise group. A significant interaction effect was found for cycle ride time and for AT expressed in liters, mililiters, work rate, and as a percentage of max. Further analysis of the significant interaction effects revealed no significant pretest to posttest  differences in any variable in the control group, while the exercise group showed significant differences in these variables from pretest to posttest. Results suggest that, in women, high-intensity cycling exercise significantly increases physical work capacity (cycle ride time) and AT measures without substantial changes in VO sub 2 max parameters.

Interviews were conducted with 36 full-time women students who had returned to graduate school after a five-year lapse in their formal training. The women placed a high value on the cognitive and affective aspects of their recreational activities. However, the score concerning their behavioral attitudes were lower, indicating that incongruity existed between what the women thought and felt about recreation and what they did in regard to their actual activities. The greatest barriers to recreation were related to limited time, work and school being the highest priorities; and too much daily stress. The returning students said they participated less in  mass media, social, outdoor, sport, and hobby activities when they returned to school. The study suggested implications for those who may be programming for women who are returning to school. With the growing number of returning students, traditional student activity and sports programs may not be the best methods for supplementing the recreational needs of this group of students.

Four observational frameworks were proposed as being representative of subdisciplinary knowledge bases within the study of human movement. Laban and Lawrence's Effort-analysis framework (1974) proposes that the criteria for efficiency of human movement is the right proportion of weight, space, time, and control of movement. Cooper and Glassow's Kinesiological framework (1976) proposes that a similarity in joint actions and sequencing of the actions exists among skills within patterns of movements. Hay and Reid's Biomechanical (1982)  framework proposes theoretical models in the form of block diagrams to serve as the basis for identifying faults in a performance. Roberton and Halverson's (1984) Developmental framework proposes that common development of the biophysiologic system exists across individuals. Analysis of the observers' comments after observations of the videotaped skills indicated that the observational framework chosen depended upon the background, knowledge, and experience of the observer; that some observers used different observational models for the different skill sequences; and that those observers who used the same observational model often used the same language and descriptive phrases when discussing the skills.

Cues were prerecorded and could be heard only by the teacher through a mini-earphone. The subject was videotaped over a period of 18 class sessions during one year; activities taught ranged from locomotor skills, manipulative skills, elementary games, and year-end fitness testing. Tapes were analyzed to study the teacher's use of positive general behavior feedback and positive specific skill (motor skills) feedback. Results indicated that audio-cuing as a primary intervention  tactic can alter significantly the use of positive behavior feedback and positive specific skill feedback and that lasting effects of audio-cuing are variable across teaching behaviors. Changes in teaching behaviors can be established quickly and efficiently by way of audio-cuing, and audio-cuing can also alter at least two verbal teaching behaviors simultaneously. (CB)",

During observation of the tests, duration of peak force and average rate at which force was produced were monitored and recorded. The data suggested that rate of force development and duration of force development varied inversely from trial to trial within different targeted force conditions. Furthermore, partial correlational analysis demonstrated that this relationship was  independent of feedback from previous trials. It was concluded that some type of internal computation to adjust time and force parameters for one another takes place during the latency period occurring between when a subject decides to initiate a response and when the actual overt force is manifested.

In contrast, the Goldhammer-Cogan clinical supervision model involves the teacher in a collaborative process whereby both teacher and supervisor decide on observation objectives and changes in the teacher's classroom behavior following discussion of classroom observational data. Research relating to the implementation and results of these two models indicates that they are very different. This paper reviews that research in terms of: (1) effects of training; (2) model  usage by administrators and teachers; (3) the relationship of clinical supervision to student academic achievement; (4) model implementation; and (5) model costs.

The project provided regular seminar sessions addressing issues of multiethnic relevance presented by representatives of the ethnic and minority groups found in the school system. Regular assignments included readings and exposure to nonprint materials having multiethnic themes. Culminating activities required groups of participants to develop lesson plans and multicultural implementation plans for use in their schools. Throughout the project, education staff were exposed to the contributions of ethnic and minority groups, and they were encouraged to identify, analyze, and utilize multiethnic materials.  Teachers and other education personnel were presented strategies for resolving cross-cultural conflicts within the classroom. Evaluation of the project indicates that it does meet its major purpose: &quot;That greater exposure to cultural diversity through literature/folklore, multiethnic and legal history, and related topics would develop a greater appreciation and, therefore, greater empathy with the predominant ethnic and minority groups within the schools.&quot; Appendices include a multicultural attitude survey, lesson plan format with sample lesson plans, and a dissemination plan format with sample plans.

Local organizational choices and modifications, such as wise and careful selection of schools and effective liaisons between the school and college, could help to alleviate these problems. The teacher education curriculum should be modified to include multicultural education for preservice teachers.

These barriers are classified into three major areas: (1) an erroneous view of human nature; (2) injustice; and (3) fear of world unity. In a discussion of these barriers, it is noted that although the consciousness and conscience of the world is developing to the point where it will no longer tolerate violence and injustice, fear of world government is deeply felt and is almost universal. The role of education in overcoming these fears and barriers to peace are discussed. The history of education is described as an evolving process of teaching ever-expanding concepts of citizenship and knowledge. Examples are given of models that may serve as guides to developing, through  education, the means of overcoming resistance to the avenues that will lead to world peace. The United Nations is cited as an example of world cooperation, and the federation of states in the United States is proposed as a political model for world unity.

The residency focused on activities that incorporated concepts of aging into lessons dealing with dance, art, music, health education, language, and social studies. Older adults visited the classroom to take part in the activities and the students visited a retirement hotel and a nursing home. Dance was a focal point for the following reasons: (1) it is a lifelong activity that can bring people of all ages together; (2) it incorporates movement, human contact and fun; and (3) creative dance helps people to express themselves in ways other than through speaking and it helps people to overcome inhibitions. The purpose of  this project was to put people of different ages in touch with each other--not solely as caregivers to each other, but as equal partners sharing in many aspects of life with a chance to learn and dance together.

The following women were found to face obstacles to conventional 9-to-5 jobs: women needing child care, displaced homemakers who lack job training and experience, rural women, disabled women, and older women who encounter job discrimination. Advantages to home-based employment included absence of transportation time and costs, saving on clothes, and flexibility of controlling one's hours and schedule. Problems were conflicts between child demands and employer deadlines and usual interruptions. Terms and conditions of employment included payment on a piecework basis, considerably less pay than office counterparts, no benefits, and no guaranteed or stable flow of work.  Negative aspects of home-based work were misunderstanding and misuse of the concept of &quot;independent contractor,&quot; shifting of costs from employers to employees, and no opportunity for career advancement. Recommendations were (1) protection of home-based workers through modifications in the Revenue Act of 1982, review of Internal Revenue Service and Employment Standards Administration enforcement programs, and employer compliance with legal definitions of employees and independent contractors; (2) dissemination of information to homeworkers regarding legal and financial differences between office and home-based clerical work; and (3) expanded child care services.

An explanation of the bill first provides committee feelings regarding Title I, Education for American Competitiveness, which authorizes three types of educational programs to improve the knowledge and skills of current and future workers in areas that will enhance their productivity and competitiveness. Committee intent regarding Title II, Training for Industrial Competitiveness, is then set forth. Major focus is on the establishment of a new training program under Title IV of the Job Training Partnership Act that  specifically addresses the adjustment needs of workers who have lost their jobs because of their employers' inability to compete with imports or the loss of export markets. A section-by-section analysis of H.R. 4728, as reported, follows. Supplemental views are attached. (YLB)",

Principal topics were accomplishment of YVA's poverty goals; effects of YVA on the workstation, volunteerism, and the volunteer; and evidence of institutionalization of YVA. If measured by income of program participants, the projects could be considered weak in accomplishing YVA's poverty goals. YVA volunteers were important sources of support to the workstation in terms of the workstations' ability to increase services provided to the community. The YVA projects were considered highly successful in terms of promoting a spirit of volunteerism among  youth. YVA volunteers appeared to have gained important experience that will be useful in making the transition to becoming responsible community members. One YVA program objective was to develop self-sustaining volunteer opportunities for youth. Six projects reported full funding for the third year of operations; eight reported partial funding. Recommendations were continuation of volunteer opportunities for young Americans by ACTION and development of guidelines and technical assistance for recruiting low-income youth. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study analyzed the total (public and private) economic costs and benefits of three U.S. Department of Agriculture erosion control programs. These were the Conservation Technical Assistance Program, Great Plains Conservation Program, and Agricultural Conservation Program. Significant efforts at funding for current programs were directed to cropland that erodes at less than five tons per acre per year. Analysis showed benefits exceeding costs on cropland with erosion rates of about 15 tons per acre per year. Offsite benefits (enhanced fishing and recreation activities and reduced sediment removal costs for navigation) accounted for significant erosion control benefits and indicated the significance of public benefits from soil conservation efforts. Four possible ways to increase  the payoff from erosion control programs were suggested: (1) target public conservation funds to land with the highest erosion rates, (2) give increased recognition to offsite benefits, (3) provide conservation assistance based on the economic value of soil productivity loss and the value of reducing offsite damages rather than simply on physical erosion rates, and (4) expand the Conservation Reporting and Evaluation System to include data for estimating the full economic consequences and costs of conservation practices.

        "description":"The paucity of research on children's conceptions of mental illness seems surprising considering the recent interest in social cognition and person perception in children, and the contention that stereotypes of mental illness are learned in childhood. A study was conducted in a large midwestern city to survey the attitudes of children toward variations of temper tantrums that could be construed as a symptom of psychological disturbance. Children (N=72) attending grades 6, 8, and 11 at two non-coeducational (but related) private schools were given the Opinions about Behavior Survey which presented three variations of temper tantrums in pictorial form. Children were asked to rate the stimulus figures on measures of liking, frequency of the behavior in peers, locus of control, and  mental health, as well as 12 remediation items and 15 labeling items. A factor analysis revealed four labeling and three remediation factors. A repeated measures multivariate analysis found significant main effects for picture level, and significant univariate main effects for picture level for all variables except locus of cause and two remediation factors. There were no significant effects for grade or sex. Liking was highly correlated with good mental health and low frequency of inappropriate behavior. Continued research in the area of children's understanding of psychological disorder should help to explain the attitudes that children have toward their troubled peers in mainstreamed classrooms, how disturbed children view their own behavior, and how the adult's negative attitudes  toward the mentally ill develop.

        "author":["Grubb, Henry Jefferson"],
        "description":"Barlow (1981) lists nine reasons why clinical psychologists do not undertake research and why traditional research does not influence clinicians. These reasons focus on: (1) lack of access to a large subject pool; (2) manpower costs of conducting research; (3) financial costs of conducting research; (4) ethics; (5) research's overreliance on statistical significance; (6) difficulty in predicting a treatment's effectiveness with an individual from nomothetic research; (7) the practitioner's awareness that each client is different; (8) the practitioner's resistance to using factorial designs; and (9) the view that research may thwart clinician's effort to get clients better as quickly as possible. Intensive local observation, a series of single case studies using each patient seen  by a therapist as a self-contained experiment, may be one solution to closing the researcher-practitioner gap. A more basic underlying reason that clinicians do not engage in research, are not trusted by the public, and are ineffective is that graduate schools are training the wrong people to be clinical psychologists. Too much emphasis is placed on psychometric and standardized intelligence tests. Students in experimental psychology perform well because experimentation and statistics can be taught and learned. Psychotherapy is more difficult to teach and learn. If clinical psychology is to improve its effectiveness, it must put less emphasis on abilities like memorization and social conformity and must attract students who are emotionally mature, have lived less sheltered lives, and have  some knowledge of the world.

Three studies, two with methadone maintenance clients and one with former heroin addicts on probation or parole, which suggest the effectiveness of the workshop, are briefly reviewed. The philosophy of the workshop is explained and the need to build the client's self-confidence is stressed. A section on preparation for the workshop covers the topics of: (1)  facilities, equipment, and materials; (2) videotape equipment; (3) location of the workshop; (4) recruitment of workshop participants; (5) criteria for screening and selection of participants; (6) size of the workshop; (7) adapting the workshop to one person; (8) preparing the clinic staff; and (9) selecting workshop staff.

The first document, for the adult student, discusses how and why people blame each other, with emphasis on the current farm financial crisis. It is noted that blaming occurs primarily at the anger and depression stages of the loss cycle and that, when losing the family farm, farmers can feel blame coming from the community, from relatives with a love of the land, from spouses, and from the farmer himself. It is suggested that farmers can avoid feeling blame by realizing that factors beyond their control led to the crisis and by supportive interpersonal relationships. The second document is a leader's guide for a workshop which attempts to lift the shame and guilt from farming individuals and  families who are being blamed. Four activities are described including the following: (1) a discussion activity to accompany the videotape &quot;Dealing with Blame&quot;; (2) an activity and worksheet on understanding blame; (3) an activity and worksheet on interpersonal behavior and communication; and (4) an activity and worksheet on avoiding blame in farm families.

Introductory material reviews current views of the dropout problem, recent reports which address the issue of high-risk youth from a national perspective, and characteristics of high-risk youth. The bulk of this report focuses on identifying characteristics of effective practices for this population of potential dropouts. A literature review shows that there is no widely accepted set of evaluation criteria for judging the effectiveness of specific strategies. The paper discusses the work of Gary Wehlage and other researchers to reduce school  attrition, state and city school districts' dropout prevention program characteristics, and regional efforts. Also described are the findings from a questionnaire sent to administrators to identify successful programs their schools have used with high-risk youth. The effective programs share the following common characteristics. (1) a qualified, caring staff; (2) a relevant, meaningful curriculum based on real-life experiences and goals; (3) individualized instruction with low student/teacher ratio; and (4) the support and commitment of administrators. This list of successful program characteristics will be refined and incorporated into a checklist of strategies and related outcomes that are common to programs serving at-risk youth.

        "description":"According to sociological conventional wisdom, contact of the right kind in the right setting reduces stereotyping. Some research supports this hypothesis, some does not, and most can be challenged because the hypothesis conditions were not clearly met. This study attempted to meet the necessary conditions by using an unusually suitable setting, as well as refined measures of contact and of age, gender, and ethnic stereotyping. Interviews were conducted of 542 bridge players at the Ottawa-Hull branch of the American Contract Bridge League. Measures of contact were well indicated by the number of fellow players with whom a player was acquainted. Dimensions of age, gender, and ethnic stereotyping consisted of a set of semantic differentials. Respondents rated: (1) women as bridge  players, men as bridge players, and women in general; (2) older people as bridge players, younger people as bridge players, and older people in general; (3) French Canadians as bridge players and as people in general. All measures were self-reports except for one measure of skill. The results failed to support the hypothesis that contact reduces stereotyping. Neither the frequency and duration of activity nor the proportion of group members in weak and in strong ties reduced stereotyped perceptions. The findings suggest that involvement in the core of the subculture actually increases stereotyping in that core players were more willing than periphery players to give ratings for little-known groups and to give extreme ratings for well-known groups. Greater subcultural involvement,  experience, and communication only seemed to give greater confidence in applying general stereotypes to the specific setting. (NB)",

Students and school employees become victims when experiencing a crime against themselves or when threatened by the perpetration of a crime. On school grounds, these crimes are most often assaults, robberies, and extortion. Recent studies have highlighted the pervasiveness of victimization problems. Through legislation and court decisions, the student's right to a safe school environment has begun to be recognized. To deal with the problem of school safety, educators must assess the nature of their particular problem. A standardized reporting procedure of criminal and violent acts is required. Prevention strategies include clear school policies, workshops and seminars, peer-tutoring corps, adults on  campus, community committees, law-related education curricula, in-service training, special student activities, assertiveness training, safe corridor programs, buddy systems, and victim witness programs. Successful intervention strategies include teacher training, arbitration and mediation, community newsletters, and safe school legislation. Response strategies include immediate arrest and media contact, interagency crisis referral team, safe schools/internal affairs department, youth re-entry programs, victimization adjustment classes, school board policies, retraining alternatives, and schedule adjustments.

Academic issues have recently been in the public spotlight, but the quality of a child's education can be severely affected if the child is not in a safe environment. Crime and violence are a pervasive problem in schools, affecting both teachers and students. Recent surveys have shown discipline to be a major problem in the schools. Poor discipline can result from weak discipline policies. The high national dropout rate of 26% indicates that a large proportion of the adult population will face unemployment, menial jobs, and public assistance. Truancy may be related to daytime delinquency. Children's rights to a safe school environment are being recognized through  court decisions and legislation.

The  report includes sections on background information; objectives, scope, and methodology; outreach to previously denied claimants and terminated beneficiaries; and recruitment of psychiatrists and psychologists. Also included is a section on the implementation of new criteria which discusses difficulties in obtaining functional information, the increase in examiner workloads, adequacy of treatment, and referrals to rehabilitation.

        "description":"The aim of this study was to develop tools for screening and assessment of socio-medical effects of alcohol use which are simple and inexpensive enough to be used in any primary health care setting. A test protocol was prepared by a group of investigators from Australia, Bulgaria, Kenya, Mexico, Norway, and the United States. Based on a number of assessment procedures for negative consequences of alcohol use and current knowledge, information was collected from subjects in the following eight areas: (1) demographic data; (2) subjective complaints associated with excessive alcohol use; (3) clinical examination with emphasis on excessive alcohol use; (4) level of consumption of alcohol and prescribed drugs; (5) alcohol dependence syndrome; (6) social consequences of drinking; (7)  biochemical tests; and (8) patient self-evaluation. At hospitals, emergency units, and primary care facilities, health workers interviewed at least 180 male and female patients between the ages of 18 and 55 who were regular drinkers. A relatively large proportion of patients were infrequent drinkers. Variations among groups were considerable and dispersion within groups was large. A few carefully chosen items were shown to predict heavy consumption. The optimal screening instrument is not yet finished. However, this study suggests that simple questions and procedures pointing to potential harmful alcohol use can easily be included in medical routines.

        "description":"This report begins by recognizing that Australia's recent immigration, fertility, and mortality trends have resulted in a rapid increase not only in the numbers of older Australians but also in their proportion of the total population. After briefly reviewing the contemporary demographic aging of Australia's population and its likely course over the next two decades, this report examines the Australian social security system which is noncontributory and historically has focused on the alleviation of poverty rather than the replacement of earnings. The paper discusses the liberalization of the eligibility criteria for the age pension, widened access to government-subsidized or funded pensions, private superannuation, and the range of services available to the aged. The report  examines how these changes have contributed to modifying age at retirement, migration behavior, housing, and living arrangements of the elderly. Recent pressure to change the social security provisions for the aged is considered, some of the proposed changes are reviewed, and their possible effects upon the behavior and well-being of the Australian aged population are briefly addressed. It is argued that the present system disproportionately favors the better-off segments of the older population and that there exists a danger that these inequalities will be exacerbated, especially if a political strategy of across-the-board cutbacks in provisions is preferred to reductions in eligibility for support and services.

Part I of this document provides an overview of the literature and a preliminary explanation of the problems faced by child victims in the criminal justice system. The two chapters in this section show the current state of affairs and support the premise that child victims have special needs in the criminal justice system. Part II, Innovative Practice: Legal Issues and Practical Concerns, presents a discussion of popular techniques used to ameliorate some of these problems. The discussion of these innovations has been  divided into topic areas, with separate chapters examining: (1) competency of child witnesses; (2) exclusion of spectators; (3) attempts to avoid direct confrontation; (4) videotaped depositions and statements; (5) special exceptions to hearsay; (6) use of expert witnesses; (7) the victim advocate; and (8) streamlining the adjudication process. Each of these chapters includes a discussion of the legal and practical concerns that arise from these innovations. Part II includes a state-by-state chart of current statutory provisions relevant to child victims and witnesses and a list of complete citations for the statutes analyzed. Part III contains conclusions and establishes the need for further research in the field.

It is noted that child sexual abuse often goes unreported and unprosecuted. Problems faced and posed by child victims on the criminal justice system are reviewed. Legislative revisions, local reforms, and new techniques to alleviate these problems are discussed. The techniques discussed include: (1) enhancing a child's communication skills; (2) modifying the courtroom's physical environment to make it comfortable for the child; (3) preparing child victims to testify; (4) enactment of laws to permit child witnesses to have a supportive person present during court proceedings; (5) enactment of laws directing law enforcement, social service agencies, and prosecutors to  conduct joint investigations; and (6) enactment of laws attempting to expedite the adjudication process by giving precedence in trial scheduling to child sexual offense cases. Tables of the 50 states' statutory provisions relevant to child witnesses in sexual abuse cases and statutory citations for selected issues in child witness testimony are included. (ABL)",

Studies are reviewed which point to asymmetric differentiated functions and capacities of the two cerebral hemispheres in split-brain patients and in normal persons. The need for integrated hemispheric processing in teaching metaphors, visual imagery, and mind-mapping is discussed. The issue of right- and left-handedness is considered in studies of blood flow, inverted and noninverted writing posture, and familial versus nonfamilial left-handers. Lists of the functions of the two hemispheres of the brain as outlined by various authors are presented in a section on cerebral dominance and hemispheric  functions. The final sections of this paper address the implications of the reviewed research for childhood education and the possible identification of children with different cognitive learning styles. Findings are presented which suggest that for optimal cognitive functioning interhemispheric functioning is necessary. The implications of brain research for education in the arts are discussed. In a presentation of mental processes and brain waves, four basic EEG wave pattern categories are described. Two of these, theta and alpha waves, are then used as prototypes to describe variances in children's learning styles. A list of left- and right-minded characteristics that teachers and psychologists can use to look at children's behaviors in a new way is included.

By their very nature, textbooks can provide only limited coverage of a topic, and teachers must identify concepts that can be further developed by having children read trade books. This approach to content area instruction requires the teacher to be familiar with a great variety of children's books. To make selection easier, teachers can use annotated subject guide indices to current children's books. After the books are  selected and read by the teacher, they can be presented to the student and can be very effective if presented as a schema and interest builder before children read the text. Knowing which concepts and information will be met later in the textbooks, teachers reading stories orally can easily highlight key passages by reading them with particular emphasis. When stories are being read independently or in small groups, teachers can alert students to these passages prior to reading. Trade books are also effective as elaboration and extension of content and concept acquisition during and after reading the text. Finally, after reading trade books and textbooks, students should be engaged in activities that allow them to assess what they have learned, to interpret their knowledge in some way,  and, thereby, to personalize it.

        "description":"A study demonstrated how recordings of ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) activity can be used to study global aspects of complex cognitive processes that take place during the reading and encoding of connected discourse. The methods utilized allowed the study of complex cognitive processes within an ecologically valid paradigm (natural reading) and demonstrated that EEG activity in the alpha bandwidth is a reliable correlate of modal processing style, not just a measure of mental alertness. Right handed male and female college students read two poetry selections and were told that they would be expected to recall as much of the poem as possible (in any order they wished) immediately after reading the last stanza. Electrophysiological recordings were made during the reading of  each stanza from two parietal temporal sites that allowed for observations of differential hemisphere activation. Results support the notion that various &quot;cognitive styles&quot; differentially affect the encoding and recall of diverse prose material (expository text and poetry). A metacontrol system, entailing subcortical brain structures, and differential brain organization were implicated in observed cognitive style differences. The results suggest that curricula should be developed to meet the needs of at least the major types of cognitive styles which have been, and will be, identified by researchers in the next several years. Since the brain's metacontrol system is most adaptive when it has numerous strategies at its disposal, such as analytic and holistic strategies, teaching strategic  knowledge and cognitive flexibility should be stressed to all students.

        "description":"To explore ways to improve reading instruction, a study examined the relation of discussions about assigned reading to students' critical reading behavior and investigated the efficacy of coaching teachers on techniques for discussing the readings they assign. Five teachers from a rural Georgia high school, and their classes of 25 students each were videotaped as they used classroom texts, related study guides, and worksheets, and discussed the readings. Data analysis included transcribing the videotapes, coding the transcripts, and inspecting the data obtained. Results indicated that discussions were test-like events that served to cover the text content, but very few students participated actively in discussion and the central participant was the teacher. Teachers rarely  presented themselves as collaborators in the exploration of the content or admitted they did not know something. Coaching increased teachers' acknowledgement of students' responses, increased elaborate student responses, and decreased the number of response resignations. For three teachers, coaching increased the proportion of text connected talk, and the talk became more inferential and analytical. Little progress was made in fostering reference to other texts or hypothesizing and reasoning through divergent possibilities suggested by the text. A table of structural functions and text references in discussion and a segment of a coded transcript are included. (SRT)",

The subject of the passage read by the students was the settling of Anglo America; the subheadings in the passage listed names of major subtopics serving to identify part-to-whole relationships within the passage. Subjects also completed an 18-question multiple-choice retention test that contained two explicit text-based questions for each of the major sections of the passage. The results indicated no specific facilitative effect of heading on the answering of multiple-choice questions about the information contained in the individual text segments preceded by the heading. In fact,  in the case of detail retention test items, the inclusion of a heading for a text segment that was also followed by a question resulted in significantly poorer performance for some of the students. The results suggest that the appearance of any headings in the text may simply induce in subjects a strategy of trying to organize and interrelate the concepts in the text, and this strategy may then be applied to all sections of the passage regardless of whether they are preceded by a heading.

        "description":"The emphasis on promoting thinking skills in the classroom has fostered several trends, tendencies, and tensions. This movement has taken three directions: the teaching of thinking, teaching for thinking, and teaching about thinking. In the first, thinking is regarded as a process of developing a set amount of skills. The proponents of this approach are primarily state departments of education. The second fosters thinking skills in the specific context of school curricula. In the third, students are encouraged to become more conscious of their own mental processes as they study or solve problems. Students learn how to predict the outcome of their performance, to plan ahead, to apportion time and cognitive resources, and to monitor and edit more efficiently their efforts to learn.  This process is also known as metacognition. Tensions arise in both students and teachers as a result of this emphasis on thinking. Students tend to be passive and resist mental exertion, while teachers feel they have too much to do and too little support to nurture thinking in the classroom. Adapting some of the features of the National Writing Project into a program on thinking can alleviate some of these problems. To guide the kind of thinking processes selected for the program, five principles should be followed: (1) teach active learning, (2) articulate thinking, (3) structure thinking activities systematically, (4) motivate learning, and (5) evaluate continuously.

The stories were divided into five roughly equal parts. After reading each part, subjects completed affective reader response scales that measured suspense, curiosity about the past, curiosity about the future, surprise, and irony. After reading the entire story, the subjects completed a questionnaire dealing with such issues as overall liking, degree of completeness, and  degree of empathy. The overall pattern of results provided support for Brewer and Lichtenstein's structural-affect theory and showed that the reader response technique they developed for use with artifical texts could be used for natural texts. In addition, suspense and empathy were found to be particularly important variables in producing story liking for both American and Hungarian stories, and there were few differences in findings between the older stories and the more recent ones.

First, eye movement records show that the eyes pause longer on some words than on others, move various distances and directions between pauses, and exhibit patterns of movements indicating what is being attended to at different moments, what kinds of processing are taking place, and when processing difficulties arise. Second, eye movement data are useful in analyzing simultaneously collected data, such as brain wave records or oral reading protocols. Finally, eye movement data can  be used for controlling experimental manipulations during ongoing reading. The ability to control the nature of the stimulus pattern that is present on any given fixation during reading provides a powerful technique for studying the perceptual processes that are taking place. Research techniques involving the monitoring of eye movements provide powerful new ways of studying the characteristics of the reading process, even when eye movements themselves are not involved in the etiology of the reading disorder.

        "description":"Drawing upon those aspects of &quot;Becoming a Nation of Readers&quot; directly relevant to classroom teachers, this booklet suggests ideas for classroom practices, based on research, that will improve students' reading achievement. The booklet is organized around five instructional themes: defining reading, reading readiness, beginning reading, directed reading lessons, and reading and writing. It provides a brief overview of each theme, followed by a discussion and examples of suggested instructional strategies. Among the specific questions addressed in the booklet are the following: (1) How can reading readiness activities build on oral language? (2) How can phonics be taught in conjunction with meaning? (3) What background building activities are most effective in directed reading  lessons? and (4) What kinds of writing activities reinforce the reading-writing relationship? (FL)",

        "description":"Media content analysts seldom observe the principle that editorial omissions are as telling as what is published or broadcast; hence, the purpose of this paper is to explore, and thus stimulate debate about, editorial omissions or &quot;strategic silence.&quot; It is observed that as a concept, strategic silence embraces both tact and strategy--the former being an institution process that produces images and symbols appropriate to the larger process whereby journal and readers make sense of the world. It is further observed that although the resulting version of reality may be regarded as the end product of a conspiracy of silence, it should be understood as the production of meanings based not only upon manifest content but also upon ways in which some things are either not seen or not  recorded because of the social transaction between readers and producers of editorial matter. Next, the paper explores the discordance between historical and social science methods in terms of its implications for the search for strategic silence, which should be conducted in accord with tested historical principles of avoiding presentism and collating evidence. Finally, the paper offers illustrations of strategic silence drawn from a study of the symbolic portraits of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that were sketched by &quot;Time,&quot;&quot;Newsweek,&quot; and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; magazines.

        "description":"Holding enormous if controversial power as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), J. Edgar Hoover was sometimes controlled unexpectedly at the highest reaches of government, as illustrated by his failed attempt to obtain an Espionage Act indictment against the black press during World War II. Following anarchist bombings in 1919, Hoover pressed unsuccessfully for passage of a peacetime version of the sedition act to shut down black publications. Efforts by the Communists and Japanese to recruit black support, as well as increased criticism of discrimination by the black press, precipitated FBI investigations of black publications until the eve of the Second World War. Hoover sought his first Espionage Act indictment of the black press shortly after the bombing of  Pearl Harbor, enlisting the aid of the Justice Department. No publication had actually violated the Espionage Act, however, and an agreement was made between the Attorney General and a black publisher, circumventing the possibility of any indictment. Hoover persevered, and in 1943 mounted a major wartime attack on the black press with a report charging 43 publications with causing black discontent, but the report received no response from the administration. Two Supreme Court decisions supporting other radical publications eliminated any remaining hope of an indictment against the black press, and Hoover's final attempt at a wartime indictment in 1945 was refused by the Justice Department. While Hoover's racist views cannot be ignored, he did have valid reasons to investigate the black  press. The deciding factors for Hoover and the FBI were the unwavering constitutional views of the Attorney General and the Justice Department, without which black press history probably would have been very different.

All three featured a mixture of essays, verse, literary excerpts, foreign and domestic news, reports of births, deaths, and marriages, and other material. The study sought to determine if the publications portrayed women as political actors (much as the leading party newspapers of that era were doing), how they defined women's role, and if they challenged conventional wisdom on women's place. The analysis revealed that none of the magazines portrayed women as politically active in any meaningful way. Such  discussion was infrequent and isolated, and when it did occur, the connection had to be inferred because of the vague nature of the commentary. Generally, the message in the magazine was that women's place was in the home where the primary goal was to be amiable and compliant. Most talk of women influencing men was framed in relation to the reformation of women's manners and keeping them happy at home. Although women's education was discussed at length, the education was only utilitarian and limited to prevent women from rising above their husbands in any way or neglecting their &quot;natural&quot; duties. Overall, these publications were preservers of the status quo, rather than challengers of it. (HOD)",

Data indicated a tremendous diversity among newspapers regarding their refusal policy. Among the conclusions reached in the study are that southern newspapers tend to be the most conservative newspapers in the country, while southern advertising managers tended to be more conservative with respect to their absolute right to refuse any advertisement in a nonmonopoly situation. Once a policy has been established,  written or otherwise, it appears that companies or organizations may not even try to advertise in certain communities. In addition, newspapers want not only to continue the freedom of refusal they now have but also to extend that freedom to broadcasters as well.

        "description":"Since enrollment in journalism programs has become predominantly female, the field could benefit from an infusion of feminist theory that would change the way courses are taught. Female journalism students need to find suitable role models, acquire basic skills in writing, consider new ways of combining family life with their careers, and learn how to market their skills so they can compete with men. Feminist thinking in journalism education would raise the consciousness of women and enable them to insist on fair pay. More women faculty members are needed to help women students develop a professional identity. Women who possess basic English skills may find the language of newswriting foreign because it is based on male values of assertiveness, conflict, and controversy. Finally,  women students must be able to cope with the competitive job market; some women must adjust to returning to work after a pregnancy. One solution might be workshops and short courses to facilitate this return. A better solution would be to develop a greater commitment in women to their careers and to devising means to eliminate long career interruptions. Journalism curricula need examination to determine what structures for career preparation exist and to what degree content pertaining specifically to women should be incorporated. (SRT)",

        "description":"The Women's National Press Club (WNPC) existed in Washington, D.C., from 1919 to 1971 primarily because the National Press Club (NPC) refused to admit women. The WNPC offered mutual support in the face of male hostility. Women were virtually cut off from news sources; 20 women had Capitol press gallery privileges in 1879, but they were effectively excluded in 1880 when part-time correspondents were banned. The WNPC held luncheon meetings and invited speakers who gave the women a chance to obtain news stories and meet influential people. Leadership of the club was a hard fought honor and the women who became president exemplified journalistic competence and dedication. While most women journalists were confined to the society or women's pages, the NWPC presidents of the early  1930s held their own against male competitors, writing on politics, crime, courts, public affairs, and other front-page topics. Eleanor Roosevelt became a member in 1938 on the basis of her nationally syndicated column, &quot;My Day,&quot; though her application was protested by some because she did not earn her living by writing. The situation for women improved in the 1950s when they were allowed to sit in the gallery of the NPC, but space was limited and they could not hear or ask questions. In the 1960s the State Department insisted that women be permitted to participate, and finally, in 1971, the NPC decided to admit women. Although the WNPC admitted men in the 1970s and changed its name to the Washington Press Club in an effort to survive, in 1985 it merged with NPC. (SRT)",

For example, the predilection of inexperienced writers to see text as parts (words) rather than as whole (communication) can be reinforced by writing with computers, since only a small amount of text fits on the screen and the entire text is relatively inaccessible until a printout is made. Of even greater concern is the tendency of inexperienced writers to substitute and delete rather than add and rearrange words. The problem is heightened when students use text analysis programs, which concentrate on words rather than on the whole text. The inexperienced writer's concern  about rule violations is also reinforced by spelling checkers since they identify such a limited set of errors. Students need instruction in word processing functions that allow them to add and rearrange as well as to substitute and delete; class time should be spent on rearranging text using block movements. Analysis programs should not be run until concerns about the whole essay have been addressed through conferences and repeated revision sessions. In order to use word processing effectively, students must understand the principles of effective composition and apply those principles to writing with a word processor. (HOD)",

It was hypothesized that the majority of Japanese advertisements would use the traditional appeals of group, consensus, soft sell, veneration of the elderly, and traditional status and oneness with nature. If, however, advertising is attempting to shape social values for the commercial purposes of creating a Westernized or world consumer culture, it was expected that modern advertising appeals, such as individuality and independence, hard sell, youth and modernity, product merit, and manipulation of nature appeals would prevail. A sample of print advertisements from mass  circulation magazines (general interest news and female magazines) was examined. American advertisements served as a standard against which the degree of westernization of advertising appeals was compared. The results showed numerous differences between Japanese and American advertisements. However, differences observed were in degree rather than in kind. Advertisements in both countries implement to some extent the same ten basic advertising appeals. (HTH)",

The cancellation threshold against which these series could be judged was based upon final regular-season Nielsen ratings information. The data indicated that high production costs tend to raise the cancellation threshold, while higher revenues tend to lower it. Networks have recently renewed programs with ratings that would have marked the programs for cancellation ten years ago. This trend suggests that networks no longer have the ability or the desire to attain the rating shares they held in the early 1970s. One theory is that increases in the absolute number of TV households  make each rating point more valuable, thus helping sustain network revenues in the face of competition from new technologies, and overwhelming the cost increases over time and lowering the threshold of cancellation.

The first phase involved factor analyzing the various political media attention and interest questions into a set of summary variables that could be used subsequently in an interactive multiple regression model. The second phase involved designing a hierarchical multiple regression equation to help understand the relative contribution of each independent variable to the prediction of the dependent variable, political knowledge. The  results show that a person cognitively engaged with the political system, as expressed in a definite political orientation, is likely to know more about politics and be better equipped to learn more readily from political media. The data also added evidence that attention is an important variable in the process of learning from the mass media, and that political identity in terms of partisan support helps in predicting political knowledge.

        "description":"The literature implicating the media as responsible for the contagion of terrorist violence has grown rapidly, but, under scrutiny, it appears to contain no credible supporting evidence and fails to establish a cause-effect relationship. Some students of terrorism have borrowed conclusions from the literature about the effects of televised violence and crime on viewers and have attempted to project them onto the coverage of terrorism. But not all terrorism scholars fully embrace this view, and some cite the diffusion of innovations such as bombing techniques and technical training rather than media coverage as the contagion factor. Conclusions drawn from studies of diffusion of innovations in other situations do not provide much support for the view of the media as contagion  agents. This does not exonerate the media from excesses in coverage, although one important school of thought suggests that coverage may actually reduce the possibility of terrorist violence by removing terrorists' need to resort to violent acts to gain coverage. While it is probably inappropriate for journalists to interview terrorists while their group's terrorist acts are in progress, interviews not conducted during a specific event should be helpful. The chances of this idea being widely accepted, however, are very slim. Whatever the results of legitimate terrorist research, it will move closer to reality than the views that the media are wholly at fault and wholly blameless. (HTH)",

        "description":"Use of imaginative literature to inculcate a heightened awareness of stylistic choices can tangibly benefit student writing. One technique that can instill in students some sense of the work of writing as well as the power of stylistic choice and the resonance of English is to provide them with questions to be answered using passages from works being read in class. Students may tabulate such things as nouns versus verbs versus modifiers, length and structure of sentences, metaphors, alliteration, rhythm, pace, and tempo. Cynics might criticize this notion, but must concede that subjecting prose to the kind of close analysis usually reserved for poetry can teach students concepts they previously may have resisted. While this will not produce any new insights into an author's work,  the value of the exercise is in the exercise itself. Students have no trouble noticing the contrast in sentence length and structure in the prose of Faulkner and Hemingway. The significance of Hemingway's paratactic rhythms becomes far clearer when they are juxtaposed to Faulkner's crescendoes of clauses. In the short term, an exercise that clearly obliges students to see language in new ways must give them new things to say about words, syntax, and diction. In the long term, becoming aware of the difference that voice, for example, makes in a sentence and in a paragraph should bring a student writer closer to conscious decisions about word and verb tense choices in writing. (A list of questions on style and two passages from Hemingway and Faulkner are included.) (HTH)",

Directors, deans, chairs or curriculum coordinators at 40 institutions were asked to respond to a questionnaire and to include any information, brochures or other details that would describe the intent and purpose of their curricula. The results indicated that schools seem to be moving toward a common process of communication instruction. The vast majority of institutions specifically designated particular core  courses. Based upon the data gathered, it appeared that most core courses center around four conceptual or applied areas that are basic to all communication/mass communication fields: writing skills, communication survey or history, communication theory (blended with theory and research), and communication law and ethics.

Four major questions provide research focus: the types, sources, and purposes of change in high schools; the key units of change; the situational factors that influence change; and the method of managing change. The principal technique for data collection was face-to-face structured interviews with school administrators, department chairpersons, teachers, and office personnel. Tables and figures accompany the interview analysis in each report. Interviews sought informant insights on how change occurs and how  research on change can best be conducted. The four papers are: &quot;Change in High Schools: Roles and Reactions of Teachers&quot; (William L. Rutherford and Sheila C.

Investigators administered interview questions to 380 teachers of 18 selected high schools in 9 sites geographically dispersed across the nation. From taped interviews, 54 were chosen for study of teachers' roles in school change, their reactions to change, and factors that influenced those reactions. The 54 teachers reported a total of 155 changes that had influenced them during the previous two years. Data indicate that high school teachers are more likely to be recipients than initiators of change. As individuals working collaboratively, teachers were responsible for initiating 28.4 percent of changes, whereas 71.6 percent were begun by school administrators or sources outside the school.  In their reactions to changes, teachers were more likely to be positive than negative, thereby invalidating the common assumption that teachers are resistant to change. Investigation of influences on teacher reactions to change revealed that source of change was the most significant factor. This suggests that future research should identify the role teachers can and should assume to enhance school improvement efforts. (CJH)",

The report analyzes background research on the subject as well as popular perceptions, perceptions of teachers and administrators, and perceptions of department heads themselves concerning this particular teaching role. The finding is that, despite the general view that department heads occupy a \"driver's seat\" position, the most appropriate characterization is inconsistency in the way the role is operationalized across organizational structures and personnel. A variety of department head behaviors are gathered from personal interviews and organized into six roles: communicator, coordinator manager, emerging  assister, teacher improver, program improver, and evaluating administrator. Five functions of these roles are described in personal activity accounts by individual department heads. Department heads often operate within parameters that are difficult to define, do not receive adequate fiscal remuneration, and are not offered sufficient inservice training, all of which influence the nature of the six roles they may assume. The study concludes with a discussion of relationships with other department heads, district office, principal, and department teachers. Further research on the department head is needed because the role is a viable one for facilitating the change process. (CJH)",

Research reports documented changes and situational and leadership influences. Reports of management of change and the role played by the principal in facilitating change provided the most in-depth information for analysis. Roles of principals are grouped according to activity function, such as change facilitation, and  categorized. Tables and diagrams illustrate the analysis. A total of 215 statements related to 15 change facilitating roles of principals were identified. Principals most often performed a role related to vision and goal setting and least often related to the role of \"structuring of the school as a workplace.\" Schools that were more actively involved in change showed greater principal involvement with structuring the process. Data related to configurations of leadership and the change facilitating roles of principals support the contention that, despite the myriad roles that principals assume, they are capable of maximizing their time and decision making opportunities.

A subsequent section reports on life in the district office. Findings are consistent with previous studies. Office personnel are involved in a wide range of activities, and there is little clarity on the part of teachers and others about the scope and purposes of these  roles while district personnel themselves are often not able to clearly conceptualize their roles or even differentiate between line and staff positions. Further study is needed to derive trends about how such personnel are involved in change. The report concludes with two case study vignettes of district offices in action. Because of a lack of research information, ethnographic studies and development of standard role definitions are needed to define office personnel roles. Stereotypes of these roles that are held by the public and by teachers are not congruent with actual activities; differences in formal authority appear to be a critical factor in popular misconceptions.

Data from municipalities and province school systems were obtained from the Manitoba departments of education and municipal affairs. Investigation was carried out in five stages: theoretical determination of the net local property taxation requirement under varying values of tax credit, determination of actual property taxation requirements associated with respective value of the provincial property tax credit, determination of the net property taxation requirement by subtraction of the tax credit received by the municipality from gross or total property tax requirements, reorganization of data with school  regions to determine whether increased expenditures were incurred in the form of municipal or school expenditures, and examination of increased school expenditures to determine whether increase was caused by implementation of the property tax credit. The major finding is that school systems, whose taxes were being relieved, increased their demands for funds from local taxpayers in excess, capitalizing on the situation created by the tax credit plan. This unintended effect suggests that policymakers and interest groups should more carefully consider potential effects of such plans. Two tables of data are included. (CJH)",

        "description":"Interrelationships among policy issues facing education in 1978 and 1979 are explored in this paper. The policy issues covered are based on over 1,000 concerns raised during an issue identification project that involved reviewing documents and interviewing educators. These concerns were sorted into categories in a process that led inductively to a model of the events in education systems that generate statements of concern. That is, an event in one issue area will generate concerns affecting policy in another area, and these new concerns may be voiced in several forms. None of the issues is isolated; all either affect or are affected by others. The specific concepts addressed in this report consist sometimes of single issue areas and sometimes of clusters of issue areas forming a  larger concept area. The single or multiple concept areas covered are educational finance, equal educational opportunity, the loss of public confidence, the accountability movement, and the erosion of local control. Figures and tables demonstrate the relationships among issue areas and identify the concerns addressed. Appendixes provide an overview of the policy issue identification process and a report on the results of the concern-seeking interviews with educational policy makers. (PGD)",

        "description":"Structural equation models of annual federal expenditures for elementary and secondary education and for higher education were estimated using time-series data extending from 1947 to the later 1970s. The pattern of expenditures for elementary and secondary education proved to follow closely that for higher education. Factors affecting federal expenditures for elementary and secondary education either directly or indirectly (by affecting expenditures for higher education) have included which political party controlled the House of Representatives, the size of the federal budget surplus or deficit, the level of defense expenditures, and the number of arrests of persons under 18 years of age. Testing the forecasting accuracy of the models incorporating these factors revealed that  forecasts diminished in accuracy when extended beyond 1 year, that multivariate forecasting techniques proved superior to univariate forecasts based on linear regression, and that a three-period, moving average model performed better than multivariate models when absolute accuracy of single-year forecasts was the sole criterion. Multivariate models provided greater insight into factors influencing change in time series, however, and appeared likely to be more accurate when influencing factors undergo sudden change. Appendixes present illustrative figures. (PGD)",

        "description":"Concern about the thoroughness of surveys conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to collect descriptive data on the nation's nonpublic elementary and secondary schools prompted the NCES to conduct a validation study. A stratified random sample of 21 geographic areas was selected. Site visits were made to six of these areas and long-distance methods were used to search the rest. The study focused on the non-Catholic sector of private education because the list of Catholic schools was believed to be reasonably complete. Of almost 20,000 schools included in the NCES survey lists, 277 were located in these sampling areas. Several methods were employed and compared for seeking previously unlisted schools. These methods were based on governmental requirements  for registering schools, the use by schools of advertising, linking relationships with other religious and educational organizations, and public school records of student transfers to nonpublic schools. This report discusses the study's findings related to the reliability of NCES private school lists, the growth of private schools, the reliability of data from the original and more recent surveys, and effective methods for identifying schools. Appendixes--half of the report--provide supplementary tables and individual site reports for the six sites visited. (PGD)",

The current demand for excellence threatens black gains by proposing a system in which quality education is available only to the few through vouchers and tax credits that would support enrollment in private schools while serious reductions in federal support undermine the quality of the public education available to most minority students. An equitable program to enhance educational excellence should involve recruiting talented new teachers, training them effectively, retaining them once they have joined the profession, and encouraging their participation in educational improvement  efforts. Education must be made practically relevant, particularly to minority students. Parents must also be drawn in to provide encouragement and support for their children's educational efforts. (PGD)",

Field research and interview data are used to analyze implementation process variables, work structures, and career concepts. The study investigated problems educators consider important in the job design, the way they make sense of the reform, and mechanisms developed to handle conflicts and opportunities. Three main themes influencing plan implementation are career ladder tasks and educational impact, teacher opportunities for authority and decision-making, and career incentives. Each school had different experiences during the first year. Teachers responded in both schools with strong positive and negative feelings because  they could not isolate assessment of career ladders from influence on school improvement. Perception of communicative success was important for positive assessment. Teachers were positive about substantive authority and decision-making opportunities. Strong egalitarian norms caused opportunities for authority to be uncomfortable for everyone. As a career incentive, the redesign affected groups of teachers differently. Perceived fairness of the process was significant and accountability was vital to the confidence of teachers. Time is needed during beginning stages to adjust for personality factors, disruption of traditional work norms, and need for assertive leadership. A 14-item reference list concludes the paper.

The program is long-term, flexible, requires mutual agreement concerning objectives between individual employees and their supervisors, allows for coordination among the objectives of individuals within the organization, and permits involvement of all personnel. Remuneration under COAS is of two types: for objectives specified as requirements of the position according to school board policy, satisfactory performance should result in cost of living increases; for objectives adopted individually, extra pay should be tied to the degree to which these individual objectives are  met.

        "description":"This paper is a combination of two separate essays, both of which examine changes in standards for student and teacher performance in various states over the past two years. Part 1 examines changes in standards for graduation from high school and the introduction or expansion of statewide programs of testing. Changes in the overall units for graduation, in the mix of required courses, and in the extent of exit examinations are shown to have had an adverse effect on low achieving students, so methods are considered for retaining low achieving students through dropout prevention programs and through establishing effective learning environments. Thereafter, Part 1 summarizes what is known about the relationship between testing, achievement, and accountability in light of the  expansion of state testing programs. Part 2 addresses changes in standards for entering and remaining in the teaching profession, and includes a brief discussion of teacher salaries in relation to changes in standards. The objectives are to examine the assumption that the academic or intellectual abilities of the teacher work force are inadequate, and to assess the costs and benefits of some of the strategies for improving the teacher work force. Each major proposal for increasing teacher quality is explored for its ability to improve the mix of teachers. These proposals include raising entry-level requirements, raising salaries, waiving certification requirements, and removing unqualified or incompetent teachers. The section concludes with the observation that these reforms will cost a  considerable sum and may conflict with other manpower objectives. A 99-item bibliography concludes the document. (TE)",

The literature regarding environmental influences is then reviewed, and the last section of the paper summarizes the analysis and suggests specific areas for future research. The literature review suggests that the learning environment can enhance individual achievement somewhat, beyond the level expected given individual background traits. This enhancement occurs through altering the \"non-cognitive\" traits--by developing an atmosphere in which students are expected and feel able to achieve. The researchers' conceptual  model provides a framework to describe these influences, divided into factors of group norms and group relationships. It is suggested that school analysts should recognize the attachments to schools that students display and acknowledge that relationships within schools are often better described with a conflict model than a consensus model. The basis of conflict needs to be determined in order to enhance achievement. The task for researchers and school officials is understanding why this resistance to officially sanctioned norms occurs and how it may be adequately addressed to promote learning.

It can also enhance the reliability and validity of district-level studies. A review of existing texts of cost analysis and of studies of traditional cost analysis methods reveals their limited usefulness for district-level evaluators and strengthens the argument for the use of streamlined methods. This guide focuses primarily on two stages of a cost-outcome analysis: measurement of program costs and measurement of program outcomes. Measuring program costs involves: (1) listing program resources; (2) identifying resources representing direct cost to the district; and (3) determining  the cost of resources. The parameters of the program, the reliability of &quot;free&quot; resources, as well as present and annualized values need to be included in the total cost figure, and a sensitivity analysis should be conducted. Streamlining the measurement of program outlines involves attention to using a quasi-experimental design, evaluating a single program, and the use of one or more of four cost analysis methods: (1) cost-feasibility; (2) cost-utility; (3) cost-effectiveness; and (4) cost-benefit.

Recent national studies describe reduced intergovernmental conflicts, greater emphasis on  program improvement rather than on strict compliance, and programs customized to fit local circumstances. The Reagan Administration's qualitatively different use of the bully pulpit as a major, independent policy strategy has been inadequately examined by researchers. Future research on the federal role in the 1980s can contribute to literature on differential federal strategies. Researchers on the federal role in education should conduct assessments of origins and effects of modern use of the bully pulpit strategy to understand fully the effects of the administration's education policy. Ninety-four footnotes are appended. (CJH)",

        "description":"The debate over the nature of effects that new technologies will have on job skill requirements has consequences for public policy and education. Much of the controversy over how to prepare students for the workplace of the future arises because different questions are being addressed. This report examines the disparate visions and disagreements over current realities and trends, including, for example, the assumption that new technologies with heavy reliance on microcomputers will require an increasingly technical work force. These forecast disagreements suggest a lack of harmony with respect to a shared vision rather than flaws in the forecasts themselves. Policymakers must explore ways of altering current trends in order to pursue a course where technologies expand employment  possibilities, raise skill requirements, and fully utilize education of the work force. Three types of public policies can assist this task. Increased research on possiblities and their consequences should be encouraged. Second, employers, unions, workers, and government agencies can be informed about these alternative possibilities and consequences. Third, education should assume a more proactive role, responding not only to needs of the work place with such goals as technological literacy but also assuming the power to shape them.

The analyses are based on a data set integrated from several national data sources describing school districts in the 1970s. As hypothesized in the study, dependence on federal funding, which takes the form of complex and fragmented programs, generates more administrative positions and expenditures than do the other levels. State funding, which reflects legitimated and integrated state control over public education, creates the least administrative intensity. High levels of local funding, reflecting dependence on an environment that is complex but not highly formally organized, generates  intermediate levels of administrative staffing and funding.

        "description":"The study reported in this paper builds upon earlier research designed to examine issues associated with initiating an effective teacher evaluation effort and integrating it into district practices. The paper describes four districts which have made substantial progress in initiating and organizing teacher evaluation programs and presents the view that teacher evaluation is primarily an organizational problem, not a technical one. Introductory comments suggest that evaluation is central to teaching quality and educational reform but that interest in evaluation far outruns the level of effective practice. The four districts that successfully began programs are briefly described in chapter 2, as are lessons offered by the organizational processes involved. Chapter 3,\"Organizational Change for Teacher Evaluation,\" analyzes factors that promote implementation of evaluation programs, including trust between teachers and administrators and commitment to organizational improvement. Enabling conditions that combine to set the stage for a meaningful program are: a triggering event, environmental stability, strong leadership, and active teacher involvement. Chapter 4, \"Evaluation Processes and Procedures,\" concludes that, for most districts, teacher evaluation requires fundamental organizational change in values and practices. Chapter 5, \"Accountability and Improvement: Outcomes of Evaluation,\" details multiple outcomes associated with practices that have enabling characteristics. The conclusion discusses enabling conditions, planning and implementation  strategies, and self-evaluation activities. Twenty-six references are given. An addendum to the report contains five appendices, the first describing the study methodology and the other four presenting data gathered during program implementation in three California school districts--Santa Clara Unified, Mountain View-Los Altos, and Moraga--and one district in North Carolina, Charlotte-Mecklenberg. Included are descriptions of each district's setting, evaluation program strategy, staff development and teacher evaluation outcomes, remaining obstacles to overcome, and policy context. (CJH)",

        "description":"Research has shown that with thorough training, most teachers can acquire new skills and strategies to add to their instructional repertoires. However, the literature also identifies a frequent failure to transfer new knowledge to classroom practice among trainees. Building on previous research, the study reported here investigated the effects of peer coaching on the classroom application of new teaching techniques. A mixed design of group and subject comparisons was employed, sampling 21 teachers and 6 peer coaches in two school districts; student data were obtained from one class for each of the participating trainees. Data were gathered from observations, tests, teacher plans, and interviews. Major findings are as follows: (1) Peer coaches can be trained in a relatively brief  period to provide follow-up training to other teachers. For peer coaches, continuing access to training and continuing work on content training are important factors. (2) Peer coaching increased the transfer of training rate for coached teachers compared to uncoached teachers. (3) Students of coached teachers performed better on a concept attainment measure than did students of uncoached teachers. Because the integration of strategies with curriculum is still the most difficult element of transfer, training should focus on \"thinking\" with new models. Design and implementation of effective training systems require determined leadership by administrators. A 38-page training manual, which includes a definition of coaching and examples of problems, is appended. A 36-item reference list is  provided. (CJH)",

        "description":"This report investigates six differences in promotions to administrative positions in elementary and secondary education and assesses the influence of affirmative action and equal employment opportunity enforcement. Conclusions are based on longitudinal data from Oregon and New York for thousands of individual educators employed during the 1970's and on data gathered from discrimination complaints. The study focuses on whether apparent discrimination exists in the promotion structures for men and women in public education and whether federal and state equal employment opportunity and affirmative action policies have reduced apparent discrimination. The major finding is that significant apparent discrimination present in the early 1970's declined by more than half by the late  1970's and that equal employment opportunity enforcement contributed to the decline. Interpretations of the New York results are less conclusive than for Oregon because only federal Title IX enforcement was implemented in New York, thereby reducing the availability of complementary evidence in comparison to Oregon. Section 1 of the study sets out a model of promotions based on human capital theory, briefly discusses methods of measuring discrimination, and offers a framework for analyzing the influence of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action policies. Section 2 presents and evaluates the empirical results for the two states. Section 3 summarizes the major conclusions. (CJH)",

        "description":"Results of a study involving 450 teachers in three California school districts show that two sets of standards exist for judging the effectiveness of teacher unions. For union leaders, legitimacy means keeping promises to teachers by winning concessions from management and, at the same time, working toward a more credible and cooperative relationship with management. Teachers, however, perceive union status less as what unions are able to win than the apparent acceptance by the school board of the union as the teacher representative. Teachers' perceptions of the tone of labor relations also are strongly influenced by the way in which the administration is seen as treating the teachers themselves: being open and above board, reasonable, and innovative in school operations. The  results of four multiple regressions and a path analysis have significant implications for unions and administrators. Unions must shift efforts away from militant activities and toward interpreting teachers' needs for responsible administration. Administrators should be less concerned that the union threatens managerial rights and recognize the need for innovative programs and open policy making. Teachers want both legitimate unions and good schools, and they see no conflict in having both. Eight tables and a brief bibliography are included. (IW)",

Americans' concern about quality of education can be addressed by informative study of successful management of large corporations. Literature on improved teaching, effective schools, and school management is also useful. The study presents recommendations for staff recruitment and training and for face-to-face interactions among superintendents, principals, and teachers. The superintendent's operational model is enhanced by control of the educational management team. Expectations about change should be tempered by the fact that public schools  differ from private organizations. A corporation's chief executive officer is virtually a permanent fixture whereas the typical superintendent has a three-year contract period in which to show success for long-range plans. School are governed by public laws and procedures in contrast to the absence of such requirements in the private sector. Schools using the proposed management model, however, reveal superior results over time. A program developed for schools at Richmond, Virginia, embodies many of the report's recommendations.

In &quot;Wallace vs. Jaffree&quot; (1985), the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed its consistent opposition to organized school prayer by overturning an Alabama law authorizing silence for meditation or voluntary prayer. Whether compulsory or voluntary, prayer recitations are clearly prohibited. However, schools may require a moment of silence for reflection or meditation without violating the First Amendment. Statutes authorizing silence for &quot;meditation or prayer&quot; may be permissible. The Supreme Court had not yet ruled on prayer at school ceremonies;  lower courts have consistently applied the &quot;Lemon vs. Kurtzman&quot; three-part test requiring statutes to have a secular purpose and effect and avoid excessive entanglement with religion. Although the Jaffree case met the test, Justices Warren and Burger wrote dissenting opinions viewing prevention of an established national religion as the real issue. The Burger-Rehnquist stance may predominate if President Ronald Reagan appoints new Supreme Court justices who share his intent to reestablish school prayer. (MLH)",

Data were gathered from 1981-86, beginning with baseline data two years prior to, during, and two years after legislation. Research methods include a mailed questionnaire and a telephone survey. Tables summarize data results. Legislation is found to have affected vocational education curricula in terms of decrease in academic offerings and in the loss of teachers. Regionally, southern districts altered their curriculum more because of the new graduation requirements than did northern districts. Business education lost considerably fewer teachers and less  enrollment than did home economics and industrical education. Only those vocational education courses seen as relevant and preparatory for jobs survived the change. More vocational instructors were teaching in nonvocational areas. Respondents indicated that students would be better prepared for college as a result of reform but that more students may drop out. More students would be unprepared for the work world because of the decrease in vocational options, according to respondents. Study recommendations address concerns for student preparation. (CJH)",

        "description":"As exemplified by New Zealand, the nature of educational policy research is shaped by political and social factors that impinge upon the research environment. Following a description of the educational system and research funding methods, this paper analyzes three areas that affect policy research in New Zealand and addresses relevant social science research literature on public policy formation. In regard to the first area, responses from the central government indicate that the minister and his/her political party are able to alter the direction of policy research. The second area concerns the process of agenda setting within the department of education, which is determined by varying perceptions of priorities. Institutional arrangements can create a narrow concept of reform,  which has been characteristic of New Zealand's centralized educational system. Policy researchers have neglected to recognize that inherent ethnocentrism in the knowledge legitimation process causes a disjunction among diverse cultural groups. Applied research in Maori culture should derive its focus and concepts from indigeneous interpretations of reality rather than from European academic assumptions. Finally, the operating environment and in particular the influence of labor organizations representing teachers affect research in various ways. The challenge for policy research is to maintain integrity of purpose through an understanding of influential factors. Appended are 26 references. (CJH)",

        "description":"This paper explores the decision-making process leading to school district approval for staff development. A retrospective field study approach was used to investigate the decision of a small, rural school district in eastern Washington (enrollment 2,200) to adopt a comprehensive English composition teaching program throughout the curriculum. This case was chosen because the program scope required community-wide participation. Interviews with superintendents, principals, teachers, and others were conducted, and several relevant district documents were examined. Data were analyzed according to J. G. March and J. P. Olsen's &quot;garbage can&quot; model of decision making, defined as a series of choice opportunities in which a given project is one of several competing solutions addressing  numerous problems. Two implications may be drawn: (1) the &quot;garbage can&quot; model was definitely applicable to the decision-making process in a small, rural school district; and (2) results may help educators anticipate conditions under which staff development programs may be approved in similar settings. The interplay of March and Olsen's theoretical &quot;streams&quot; (choice opportunities, participants, problems, and solutions) may encourage other staff development advocates to initiate similar processes.

Data were obtained from existing publications and from a survey of transportation directors in California, Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. The report reviews literature relating to school transportation costs, describes the methodology used to collect data, and presents findings from the study and recommendations for legislative action. Factors such as the scope of state mandates, the extent of the transportation system,  practices concerning public versus private ownership of transportation fleets, and state reimbursement policies for school transportation were examined. Higher transportation cost per pupil was associated with more transportation mandates, more frequent use of smaller buses, greater miles traveled per pupil, and larger nonpublic school transportation systems. Lower cost per pupil was related to larger numbers of pupils transported, larger number of pupils transported per bus, larger percentages of district-owned versus private contractor transportation fleets, and the use of formula mechanisms that limited spending and encouraged efficiency in state transportation reimbursement.

The second chapter discusses the factors affecting the costs of performance pay plans. In addition to the costs of the rewards  themselves, administrators must consider the costs of planning the program and evaluating the teachers. It must also be realized that the costs of a program will include the costs associated with lowered morale and increased staff turnover if the program proves unsatisfactory to the teachers.

This booklet explores these legal considerations, focusing on authority, conflicts with existing law, and processes for ensuring fairness and equity. The first chapter covers the delegation of authority and limitations of authority for policy-making, noting the roles played by state legislatures, state boards of education, and local educational agencies. The second chapter looks at the law on tenure and collective bargaining, pointing out that laws and regulations governing teacher improvement plans  must conform to the existing laws or these laws must be changed. Chapter 3 considers due process requirements and the elements in the adversarial process. Federal and state civil rights laws protecting teachers from discriminatory treatment are the subject of the fourth chapter. Notes discuss the relevance of specific court cases to the topics addressed in the text. (PGD)",

        "description":"A review of fiscal and political trends in the late 1970's made it appear that support for education would slip measurably, but a resurgence of national interest in education in the early 1980's as a result of commission reports and nationwide studies has led to increased spending for major reforms. The pattern of support for reforms in other areas suggests that the public must be convinced that reforms are having an impact if their support is to continue. This need to convince the public can be translated into a need for effective means of measuring the results of the educational reform efforts. Among the methods that can be used for evaluating the success of reforms are (1) monitoring statewide and local performance indicators, (2) studying the overall financial impact of the  reforms, (3) comparing the cost effectiveness of various programs with similar goals, (4) conducting evaluations of discrete programs, (5) assessing the degree of local implementation of state-mandated reforms, (6) examining the cumulative impact of broad reform packages, and (7) conducting research isolating cause and effect relationships. Such evaluations are extremely complex, but are critical to maintaining reform momentum. (PGD)",

The study data came from questionnaires completed by students, teachers, and administrators at six high schools in two urban districts in the western United States; interviews with teachers and administrators; and district records. After describing the sample, the paper reviews problems of underreporting absences, difficulties in assessing the significance of absence figures, and problems in defining \"absence.\" A measure of absence based on class periods rather than on full or half days is proposed. The paper next discloses the magnitude of the absence problem. Students' reasons for attending or not attending classes  are examined, and the effects of class subject, size, difficulty, teacher, and grading system on absence rates are reviewed. Differences between frequently and infrequently absent students are noted. The differences between teachers with high student absence rates and those with low rates are explored in terms of classroom practices, attendance monitoring procedures, and beliefs concerning absence control. The paper concludes with eight specific recommendations to schools for increasing control over absences. An appendix lists the individual reports based on the study. (PGD)",

        "description":"Australia's Hawke Labor Government, elected in 1983, reflects the politics of electoral pragmatism and consensus rather than those of idealism and reform. This paper explores the often conservative and pragmatic policies adopted in the schools area by the Hawke Government and seeks to explain the economic, social, and political factors underlying them. Major value orientations evident in Hawke's education policy are (1) a commitment to maintaining a strong federal role in education reflected in a willingness to improve or maintain levels of federal funding in education; (2) a centralist approach to coordination, policymaking, and accountability in relation to federal funding; (3) an attempt to give equity issues greater attention than excellence; and (4) attention to the  vocational/competitive/technological role of education. This paper focuses on the following key related schools policy developments that have occurred under Hawke: the historic schools funding settlement of 1984, the Participation and Equity Program, the Quality of Education Review Committee Report, and the downgrading of the role of the Commonwealth Schools Commission.

        "description":"The Hawke Labor government in Australia, elected in 1983, conforms to a well-defined international trend away from stong public support for education and welfare spending. This paper focuses on the education policies of the Hawke government and compares them with those of the previous Fraser government and with those of the Reagan administration in the United States. Two charts detail philosophical and financial differences and similarities among the three governments. The Hawke socialist government's similarities to conservative administrations are partly attributable to common constraints imposed by large federal deficits and the decade's conservative social climate. The Hawke government has pursued consensual and pragmatic strategies and has ignored party policy. Hawke has  failed to halt the downward spiral in budget education allocation so that the position of public schools has deteriorated. Program initiatives have promoted educational access for some disadvantaged groups such as Aborigines. The government's legacy may be educational policies destined to increase inequalities in Australian society. The Hawke and Reagan governments contrast ideologically concerning the federal role. The Reagan administration's conservative philosophy emphasizes excellence and choice, whereas the Hawke socialist perspective focuses on equity issues. (CJH)",

This paper analyzes (1) assumptions held about leadership and instruction, (2) these notions in other contexts and practices, and (3) effects of such practices on the lives of teachers. The notion of leadership is devoid of educational purpose because moral discourse has been abandoned for the technical discourse of managerialism, so that education is regarded as a production process. In the development of industrial capitalism, the most successful alternatives to owner control of the production process have been based upon bureaucratic systems of rule specification, incentives, and task evaluation. That schools were  not matching production of knowledge with the wider society was presented as a managerial problem, to be solved by translating technical knowledge rapidly into the schools. The accompanying ideology has led to a deskilling of teachers' traditional craft and a reskilling in terms of managerial work, but with restrictions on responsible autonomy. A theory of education as a form of cultural politics will recover its essential social and moral basis. (CJH)",

The corporate culture model has diverged from the \"New Sociology of Education\" approach, which interprets administrative processes as cultural politics (Bates 1983). That \"corporate culture\" is a commonly held system of beliefs and behaviors in organizations was documented 30 years ago by Whyte (1956). Whyte's concern about the effects of organizational life on individual self-concept is not expressed by contemporary advocates of corporate culture, who treat organizational culture as managerial culture (Deal and Kennedy 1982). Technological transformations are provoking alterations in the social organization of work, from  traditional worker controls to bureaucratic manipulation of company culture. This new rhetoric has been swiftly transferred to the schooling processes; for example, Dunigan (1985) favors manipulation of school culture in the pursuit of excellence--a parallel to the managerial notion of \"success.\" Analyses of school and community cultures suggest that good administrators develop a collaborative basis in the articulation of cultural politics. Commitment to education and democratic values means advocacy involvement by teachers, pupils, and parents and implementation of such values. Seventy-seven references are included. (CJH)",

Results are examined in terms of three issues: (1) the characteristics and work preferences of preservice special education students (the typical preservice special education student is female, Caucasian, and a public high school graduate); (2) preparation of quality personnel (nearly half of the faculty members reported a decline in student quality over the previous 5 years); and (3) the  external influences on teacher preparation in special education (there was a reported lack of communication between faculty and state education agency personnel). Implications noted include the importance of advising students of career options, examining the content of course offerings as well as the sequence of courses for students returning for graduate school, and promoting cooperation between college and university faculty and the state education agency.

All were referred for evaluation as a result of serious academic or academic/behavioral problems. Of the 67 students referred, 32 were identified as severely learning disabled (LD) and were accepted for placement in the school and 35 were not accepted but were diagnosed as emotionally disturbed, behaviorally disordered, educably mentally retarded, or were nonhandicapped. As a part of the diagnostic process all 67 were administered both the K-ABC and  WISC-R in counterbalanced order. The correlational results of the study documented strong relationships among all of the global standard scores on both instruments. Individual performance patterns for the LD students showed a tendency for scores on the Simultaneous subtest to be greater than scores on the Sequential Processing and Performance IQ subtests which themselves tended to be higher than the Verbal IQ subtest scores.

Myths concerning overrepresentation are exposed, including that the most important issue in placement bias litigation is IQ test bias; that overrepresentation is objectionable to minority plaintiffs and social scientists; and that minority mildly retarded students as adults disappear  into the normal population and are no longer identifiable as retarded. Changes in the category of mild mental retardation over the past 15 years are analyzed, and the need for genuine reforms to produce more effective programs is emphasized.

        "description":"In a follow-up of 407 mentally retarded children first studied in 1959, the study examined contributing influences of parental attitude and child-rearing practices as well as the larger society's socializing practices. Original demographic and attitudinal data were used to predict the functional adjustment of 70 members of the original cohort. Those adults found (on parents' ratings) to be doing much better or much worse than predicted were examined ethnographically. An attempt was made to detect factors that might account for successful or unsuccessful life adjustment. Among observations made of this group were (1) that the mothers were more accurate in assessing and predicting their children's life adjustment than were social agency or institutional personnel; (2) that problems  associated with sexuality and physical and mental abuse were quite prominent; and (3) that cultural expectations relating to growth and development as envisioned in mainstream society were in conflict with these persons' individual patterns. The study points out the roles that mothers play in the lives of their retarded children and stresses their need for specific directions for helping those children at each stage in their lives. A six-page list of references is included. Nearly half the document is comparised of 13 appendices that include: Leichman's 1959 Interview Scales, including those pertaining to home environment; sample questions from the Progress Assessment Chart of Social and Personal Development; sample items from the Parental Attitude Research Instrument (PARI) and the PARI  scoring sheet; the 1959 and 1983 standard scores on the 23 scales of the PARI; and seven life histories.

The experimental design used was a multiple baseline across subjects. A training tape and a written hand-out were made to instruct parents in training procedures. Data were collected by observers during the infants' weekly visits to a university-affiliated, center-based parent-infant program. Data analysis methods included visual inspection of the graphed data. These two studies  demonstrated the utility of a parent-implemented interactional approach, and the results showed changes in the behavior of eight of nine parents with corresponding changes in the behavior of seven of the nine infants.

        "description":"This doctoral dissertation examines the extent to which general case simulation instruction on a janitorial task sequence and a housekeeping task sequence conducted with four secondary and postsecondary age persons with moderate mental retardation resulted in generalized performance. A multiple baseline design across subjects and behaviors was used to assess subject performance in simulation instruction, on concurrent and subsequent actual job probes, and in actual job instruction. Data indicated that simulation instruction on two representative teaching examples for each of two job task sequences resulted in concurrent generalized performance on six response examples for each task sequence, and in subsequent improvements in job entry skills which were maintained and extended  during actual job instruction and instructor withdrawal phases. Results are discussed in terms of potential uses and misuses of general case simulations of community job skills. An extensive literature review of 57 items is included on: (1) high school programs for the severely handicapped students; (2) adult vocational and nonvocational day placements; (3) alternatives to the continuum of services; and (4) generalization. A short version of this document (26 pages) prepared for journal publication, and authored by William Woodrow Woolcock, Steven R. Lyon, and Karin P. Woolcock, is appended.

Sixty-nine second-, third-, and fourth-grade regular education and LD students were observed for two consecutive days using a comprehensive 10-second interval time sampling technique to describe the instructional context and student responding for a target student. The nature of instruction and student responding for students in different instructional arrangements was more similar than different. The studies documented the small amount of time spent by all  students in active academic responses and the considerable variability that existed between individual students regardless of the instructional placement. Despite differences in the nature of instruction there were no differences in total academic responding time of LD students in the resource room and non-LD students in mainstream classes, for students in high, middle, or low reading groups, or for students in different service delivery levels. Instruction received by LD students in resource rooms and in mainstream classrooms differed in several ways, including the student's active academic response. (Author/CL)",

The paper organizes reports from \"state of the art\" research and practice according to underlying methods and practices which strengthen the mainstream: adaptations of curricula and classroom management systems; teacher development (e.g., inservice training) and administrative management strategies; and early interventions. Recommendations for policy, training and research are proposed, including models to integrate training of regular and special educators.

Assessment of learners' reading skills, by a variety of techniques, in the context of their language backgrounds can then lead to development of materials and methods for effective reading instruction. English as a second language (ESL) programs have adopted a number of approaches to these issues; both theories and procedures are in the process of being refined.

Vocabulary is receiving new attention in the literature, but the strategies for introducing new lexical items have changed due to new teaching methods. The key to teaching vocabulary lies in putting the items in meaningful context and in developing the relationships between words. These techniques will lead to retention of vocabulary and will increase student ability to communicate effectively and function outside the classroom. The instructional unit that is included uses this approach and focuses on leisure and recreational vocabulary in English as a second language. Designed for high school students at level B, it consists  of three weeks of daily instructional and evaluative activities leading to a series of specific cognitive, affective, cultural, and psychomotor objectives.

        "description":"Cultural and acculturation patterns should be taken into consideration in the assessment of and development of education programs for culturally and linguistically diverse exceptional (CLDE) children. In order to promote a clearer understanding of the complex process of acculturation, a section is devoted to defining and expanding upon terms related to acculturation and culture, such as: acculturation, culture, adaptation, integration, assimilation, and deculturation. Patterns of acculturation among two groups in the United States--Hispanic and Navajo--are then discussed. The special problems in the area of language ability and development among CLDE children and related research are presented. Educators must avoid underidentifying exceptional needs by attributing learning  problems to different and unfamiliar cultural and linguistic background, or overidentifying exceptional needs and ignoring cultural and linguistic characteristics. The cultural characteristics of three ethnic groups (Asian, Hispanic, and Native American) are considered in relation to implications for the special instruction of CLDE children. More research is needed in this area, especially in acculturative and sociolinguistic patterns as they relate to exceptionality, and in the interactive effects of these three factors. In addition, research is needed on cultural and parental attitudes toward exceptional children and how they may affect CLDE children's growth and development, including the use of special services.

        "author":["Collier, Catherine"],
        "description":"A study of the characteristics of Hispanic elementary school children in bilingual education programs attempted to identify those education and acculturation characteristics which distinguished children who had been referred to special education from nonreferred children. The sample consisted of 95 Hispanic children, of whom 51 had never been referred and 44 had been referred to special education. Of those referred, only 17 had been placed in special education programs. Contrary to expectations, the results indicated no significant differences between groups for any educational characteristic except degree of teacher concern, but achievement was found to be related to years of bilingual instruction, language proficiency, minority enrollment, and overall acculturation level. In  addition, there was a meaningful effect size between the achievement of non-referred and that of placed children. Placed children tended to be the most acculturated and more often came from schools with low minority enrollment. Those referred but not placed were the least acculturated and had the lowest achievement in all content areas. The findings imply that culturally and linguistically different children are disproportionately referred for special education, possibly as a function of minority enrollment and availability of alternative programs, and that the psychodynamics of acculturation must be considered in the identification and instruction of culturally and linguistically different children with special needs.

The system, constructed for investigating the acquisition of language for social-communicative purposes, codes talk on two levels: the single utterance, and the interchange. Both kinds of units are defined functionally as well as grammatically, and in both cases the analysis is communicative rather than strictly functional. In the utterance, the analysis codes for the intended illocutionary act; in the interchange, it codes for the speaker's overt framing (i.e., defining) of the immediate social situation. The manual is divided into 11 sections as follows: (1) an introduction explaining the notion of framing and the interactive functions  of talk interchanges; (2) types of verbal interchange; (3) speech act codes, categories, and definitions; (4) coding rules for classifying types of verbal interchange; (5) coding rules for classifying verbal moves and acts within types of verbal interchange; (6) coding guidelines for book-reading; (7) transcription rules; (8) a method of dividing the corpus into codable units; (9) general coding and indexing rules relating to the format of the computer file; (10) a glossary and index of interchange codes; and (11) a glossary and index of verbal act codes.

The conferences are followed by student revision and resubmission of the composition as many times as necessary. During the conference, the teacher and student decide together what improvements should be made in the essay, based on the teacher's notes about the draft. Meaning in the composition is addressed first, and form second. Each essay accompanies or follows an in-class lesson on concepts used in writing. The contents of the lessons are determined by the needs of the class. The method has been found to be more efficient for the teacher and more effective  for students, who get better feedback through conferences, learn more from participating in decisions about the composition, and become more comfortable with the writing and revision processes. An appendix provides examples of students' compositions at different times in the academic year, and the teacher's notes on the progress evident in some of the essays, which is attributed to conferencing.

The procedures used were those used by Sondra Perl in a study of the composing processes of unskilled college writers (1979). Subjects were four students in a remedial ESL program and four non-natives who were taking or had completed a freshman composition course. The students had varied linguistic backgrounds. The data were drawn from taped interviews about the students' educational and writing backgrounds; proficiency tests in grammar, vocabulary, and reading; think-aloud composing on two topics; interviews after each composing session; and assessment of writing  samples by trained evaluators. Some common patterns emerged from the analysis: the ESL students wrote more than Perl's theorized basicwriter and edited less, with the lowest-proficiency students editing very little. The proficient group's editing focused on punctuation and verb forms. The non-remedial students wrote more fluently and revised more than the others, but one low-proficiency non-remedial student was found to write very well. The overall conclusions were that no neat definition of the ESL writer emerged, the profile of the unskilled ESL writer is extremely complex, and opportunity for oral rehearsal may be valuable in skill development.

There is research to dispute each of these assumptions. One instructional approach that incorporates recent research and rejects the assumptions is the whole language approach, which integrates all four skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing), exposes children to language in real, functional  contexts, encourages language exploration, and builds on the students' existing linguistic strengths.

        "description":"The development of a successful short-range forecasting model for predicting enrollment in a university intensive English course began with examination of the characteristics (nationality, enrollment patterns, persistence) of both course participants and no-shows; the resulting figures revealed consistent patterns for country of origin and for former versus new students. Show-up rates were derived from these patterns, and several prediction models were applied to registration data for several semesters. This analysis revealed further patterns in walk-in registrations and in the differential timing of registration according to the student's country of origin. A database was developed to record, at the time of application, the information found to be relevant in these analyses,  including name, country of origin, geographic area, semester applied for, date of application, new- or former-student status, and current location (in the United States or abroad). The results for each semester are incorporated into the next semester's prediction formula. Other impact factors, such as a country's changing educational or political policy and economic situation, changes in U.S. immigration regulations, and changes in university policy are also considered. These considerations are quantified when possible and integrated into the forecasting model. An initial forecast is made ten weeks before the semester begins and is revised weekly until classes begin. An appended handout section presents supporting data including graphs, forecasting formulas, and an enrollment forecast  table for the past five semesters. (MSE)",

Recent years have produced increased media attention, growing public support, and professional unity and organization. These factors have translated into improved and new policies, increased legislation, and major policy changes in the states. The 98th Congress has produced increased funding for Soviet and East European research and training, grants for library foreign language acquisitions, funds for international diplomacy and conflict resolution research, and teacher training support. While foreign languages are a stepchild in the legislation,  previously they were simply absent. Several initiatives either were introduced too late or they languished in the legislature, but they will be reintroduced. In the most recent budget, although foreign languages were again zero-funded, support for strengthening their status exists. The challenge is for the profession to sustain its efforts to protect existing programs and funding and to keep the current favorable public attitude toward language study alive. (MSE)",

The joining of language and applied business is needed in international trade, given the relative decline of the U. S. position in an increasingly integrated global economy. The program combines language and cultural expertise with the necessary business background for handling the challenges of international trade.

Foreign language educators and students must learn to relate to other fields, communicate beyond the limits of their own disciplines, and deal with the realities of other cultures. Curricular and pedagogical innovations in this area frequently fail because of lack of sustained institutional support, lack of faculty preparation time, faculty fears of new programs or procedures, and regression toward established programs. The possibilities for interdisciplinary course combinations or coordination for specific professions are  substantial and varied.

Examples of teaching units for each model are given, as well as the major theoretical influences for each model. The concept of genre for operating in both the classroom and the larger society is examined. It is proposed that the analysis of discourse and other features of any given genre within a field can provide the course designer with a manageable and meaningful framework within which to construct courses and that it can offer the learner tools  with which to engage in any of the structurable events of business and professional life.

Very little information about the trainees' experience or education was available, and only required vocabulary lists and training manuals were made available for developing the curriculum. An integrative skills approach was adopted, and the curriculum was planned to include structure, reading, listening/speaking, writing,  technical vocabulary, general vocabulary, and English handwriting. Other program elements provided at the request of the contractor were cultural activities and a program design that prepared the trainees to assume professional roles on their return to Saudi Arabia.

        "description":"The Federal Republic of Germany has begun an experiment in industrial democracy giving workers federally guaranteed rights and authority in industrial decision making. All workers in companies with five or more employees are entitled to elect a works council with which management must consult concerning all employment policies and conditions. All companies with over 100 employees must establish a workers finance committee, which will be given specific information on the company's economic and financial situation. The structure has functioned with little friction. Management generally speaks positively about the council system. The more controversial aspect of codetermination is the federal law requiring large stock companies to allow employees to elect 50 percent of the board of  directors with rights and authority equal to owners' representatives on the board. Full parity is still elusive, because the power scales remain tipped in favor of management, a situation that is criticized by labor activists. Some owners fear excessive labor influence, and others use and benefit from the system. Works council representatives from both labor and management support the arrangement and its lack of confrontation. Unions remain strong, and strikes occur, but the cooperative potential of codetermination continues to work to resolve conflicts. However, some concern about the future of unions exists. Early fears about the inadequacy of workers in decision making positions have not been borne out, and West Germany has regained substantial industrial strength. (MSE)",

The scientific view of management is hardly accepted by Latin Americans whose management philosophy is more simple and based on art. Hispanics rely on subjective perception and are more sensitive and respectful than North American workers, requiring more tact in communication from managers at all levels. Organizations need to restructure their settings for the increasing Hispanic population. The restructuring should include provisions for managers to confer with workers in private and provide more information, in Spanish when necessary, about  employee benefits and responsibilities, job requirements, safety regulations, and other important work-related matters. Additional English training for employees and Spanish training for managers is also helpful. North American organizations must address the needs of this growing work force and market. (MSE)",

The six-course programs provide curricula based on print and broadcast media, and stress listening, reading, and speech skills. The program was begun to encourage journalism students to pursue professionally useful language study and to coordinate with the incentive provided by journalism school and language department foreign internships. Enthusiastic support was found in the journalism school, and a federal grant was obtained to implement the program. Other preparations included coordinated scheduling with the journalism program, production of a recruitment brochure, preregistration advising, and participation in precollege  orientation. Retention during the program's first year has been good. Instructional techniques use video recordings from satellite transmissions, audio recordings, foreign newspapers and magazines, the computer laboratory, and a review grammar text in a variety of exercises. Guest native speakers and journalists with international experience are also invited to address and participate in classes. The program has been found to a strong student motivator, to have brought visibility to the language department, and to have produced a frutiful collaboration with the journalism school. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study of the influence of the writer's social and cultural background and training on the organization of his or her writing was studied in essays written by two groups of students: Chinese students at the Beijing Institute of International Relations and the Xian Foreign Language Institute and foreign students in the United States. The essays were descriptions of and responses to a situation in which rain began to fall heavily on a long line at a bus stop. It was found that most Chinese students gave the reason for being at the bus stop, described the beginning of the rainfall and the sky, described the crowd, and drew a moral lesson from the crowd's behavior. Metaphorical language was common. Elements in the nonnative U.S. students' writing that were not found in the Chinese  students' papers included mention of weather predictions, excuses for taking the bus rather than driving a car, greater variation in the crowd's composition, and concern about time pressures and the opinions of others. These essays suggest that topic development is largely a factor of cultural experience, as well as social and educational policy. Therefore, teachers must be careful that assigned topics do not require students to relate experiences that they do not have, and in reading the compositions, teachers need to determine which aspects of the essay are not in keeping with their own social and cultural experiences and thus contribute to a written discourse accent.

Also covered are: how to use the library and surveys as well as interviewing to gather essential data; how to organize and present quantitative information on public policy issues; how  to define a social problem, identify alternative public policies, and evaluate the impact of the policy; and how to determine the steps required to implement a public policy and assess the chances of success. Examples are offered for each skill area, and exercises help the student master the skills. A model for forecasting and developing a strategy to get political support for the proposal is also considered. Finally, students are required to analyze a single policy issue of their choice. (SW)",

Five indicators are addressed: changes in institutional distress potential for private colleges, changes in institutional financial resources, changes in academic emphasis, changes in the extent of academic opportunity, and needs for more financial resources. Primary causes of financial distress are inefficiency and a suboptimal market segment. An institution's educational market segment affects its finances because of factors such as: (1) student demand for a college with certain programs, costs, and location; (2) the supply of competing educational institutions, and (3) the economies  of operating in any particular educational market segment. The conceptual framework considers whether the institution has a favorable market segment and operating efficiency, along with inflows (e.g., tuition, appropriations, financial aid to students) and outflows (e.g., expenditures, students leaving the college). To develop indicators of financial health, the main focus is financial data from the Higher Education General Information Survey, with secondary attention to enrollments, degrees conferred, institutional characteristics, and faculty data.

Financial strength for the long-term involves calculations on endowment market value and operating expenses, while the intermediate-term calculations involve available fund balances and operating expenses, and short-term calculations concern current fund assets and liabilities.

The objective is to begin developing and issuing social indicator reports on the status of professional education that may be helpful to government agencies, accrediting bodies, and professional organizations. A conceptual framework identifies major components of professional education, issues for each component, and variables that should be included in a social indicator report. The conceptual framework covers: student characteristics, characteristics of professional curricula, factors influencing policies and practices of institutions offering professional education, availability of financial aid, and the role of continuing  professional education. A social indicator report presenting time-series data on these topics would permit answers to the following research questions: (1) the status of various professions with respect to each issue; (2) whether the status of professions has changed in recent years; (3) possible future trends; (4) implications of these trends for educational policies; and (5) implications for educational policies of differences among the professions.

A model for scanning the environment has four dimensions that concern economic, social, knowledge-technology, and public policy areas. The point of strategic planning is to monitor the educational climate continuously and comprehensively, and scanning the environment helps to identify possible opportunities, such as social problems requiring action and areas of scientific progress. Two techniques for forecasting include probability-diffusion matrices and values profiling. A seven-step group process for decision-making covers: examining institutional mission,  describing the institution, determining environmental forces, determining internal forces, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and specifying priorities. Outlines of considerations for each step are provided, and the initial activities of planning and opening a meeting of institutional representatives are covered. Three hypothetical documents that can be used to invite widespread participation and review in the strategic planning process are included. Criteria and a scale to test plans are also presented.

        "description":"Issues concerning whether to centralize or decentralize decision-making are addressed, with applications for colleges. Centralization/decentralization (C/D) must be analyzed with reference to a particular decision. Three components of C/D are locus of authority, breadth of participation, and relative contribution by the decision-maker's staff. C/D analysis can also shift depending on the identities of individuals at the core or outer circle. Strategic, tactical, and operational decisions are distinguished. Empirical findings from the literature on C/D suggest that: strategic decisions are best made by centralized authority with decentralized participation; and the authority to make operational decisions should be decentralized as much as possible. Tactical and operational  decisions that relate to established strategy are probably made at lower levels of authority and with less participation, except when they generate a fair amount of controversy. Five questions should be used to determine whether centralization or decentralization is appropriate: (1) is it a strategic decision? (2) what is the organizational context of the decision? (3) who should have the authority to make the decision? (4) should participation be broad or narrow? and (5) to what extent would the decision-maker's staff be involved? (SW)",

        "description":"Strategic decision-making literature is reviewed, and applications to colleges and universities are made. The key requirement for strategic decision-making is that decisions affect the entire organization. While strategic decision-making can occur at different levels within the organization, the specific strategic decisions available to the planner at each level will vary depending on the issue addressed. Strategic decisions at colleges include: mission, program offerings, student clientele, geographic scope of activities, faculty-resource mix, and comparative advantage sought. In order for a unified organizational strategic thrust to occur, these strategic decisions need to be integrated. The achievement of this outcome can be illustrated by summarizing William Rothschild's  categorization of types of generic strategy, with attention to strategies concerning investment, management, and implementation. It is noted that strategic decision-making assumes change is inevitable and focuses on preparing for change. An analogy is made between strategic decision-making and vector mathematics and also to sailboat racing to help illustrate the process. A three-page list of references concludes the document. (SW)",

For some types of national reporting the NCHEMS classification may be too broadly defined, and creating more specialized institutional groupings might facilitate comparisons among peer institutions. Eight data variables were used to sector the 1,316 four-year institutions, presently categorized as Major Doctoral, Comprehensive, and General Baccalaureate. It was concluded that the current NCHEMS classification system ought to be left as it is and that it is not workable to create in  advance lists of institutions that will be truly appropriate comparison groups for a significant set of potential users. A procedure to create lists of such comparison groups is currently available using the NCHEMS database and technical assistance. The forms that are used to facilitate this process are appended (i.e., criteria selection forms). Also appended are lists of alternate groupings for institutions using three NCHEMS school categories, as well as public/private control, land grant status, and the presence/absence of a medical school on campus.

Organizations are viewed as evolving through three stages: variation, selection, and retention. Earlier reports have cited six dimensions of diversity: governance, output, finance, program, clientele, and delivery system. In the context of the population ecology model, the dimensions of program, clientele, and delivery system show the most promise for compatibility. Attention is directed to the following factors that  have been addressed in consideration of diversity in higher education: internal and external diversity, programmatic diversity, procedural diversity, systemic or structural diversity, constituential diversity, reputational diversity, and value and climate diversity. The method and findings of Birnbaum's study are discussed, and attention is directed to how further study of diversity can build on Birnbaum's work.

Two dependent variables were used: an index of items measuring an individual's self-confidence in the ability to perform academic and professional work, and an index measuring an individual's sense of personal ability to act assertively in doing academic work. Three independent variables represented potentially supportive aspects of the environment: an index measuring perceptions of the quality of relations with the adviser, an index measuring perceptions of the availability of support from peers and faculty, and a global assessment of the amount of stress  experienced in graduate school. Enrollment in a master's or Ph.D. program was also considered. Separate regressions were performed for men and women. The results suggest that women are sensitive to supportive features of the academic environment but fail to generally support such a conclusion about men. The supportiveness of the academic department failed to be a significant predictor. The perceived level of stress in graduate school was the strongest predictor of both assertiveness and self-confidence for women. (SW)",

A review was undertaken of qualitative research on black women administrators from both two- and four-year colleges that are non-church related. Three major barriers to women seeking administrative positions were identified: sex-role stereotypes, organizational barriers, and women internalizing traditional female behaviors. In general, successful administrators were typically defined as those who had obtained their doctoral degree. They were described as committed, independent, dominant, active, adventurous, sensitive, secure, and self-confident. In addition to mastering the skills that are crucial to all leaders, black women  administrators may experience both sexism and racism. All the literature concurred on the importance of self-confidence, technical and interpersonal skills, awareness of organizational attitudes, conforming to the culture, and having mentors both inside and outside the university. It was recommended that black women who aspire to administrative roles in higher education should seek the doctorate. A five-page list of references concludes the document. (SW)",

In the first study phase, 238 students described general study styles/approaches, using a questionnaire developed by Entwistle, which included 30 Likert-type items from the following dimensions: achievement orientation, reproducing orientation, meaning orientation, comprehension orientation (deep versus surface), operation learning, and pathological styles (improvidence and globetrotting). Most students were from four departments: education (86), business administration (57), computer science (35), and arts (45). Fifteen students were from other fields, including the social sciences. In the second research phase, 34 students were interviewed and completed the questionnaire about their studying  habits in specific situations. The interview focused on students' activities in an independent study situation (e.g., when preparing for a test). Computer science students said they studied for exams mainly by attending classes and doing homework; they did not make conscious decisions about study procedures. However, most education students described their study strategies, which differed depending on the form of test they expected. Additional findings and conclusions concerning the questionnaire and interview methodologies are provided. A two-page list of references concludes the document. (SW)",

        "description":"The relationship between student financial aid and college attendance in Sweden during 1965-1985 was assessed. Objectives were to determine: the extent to which student aid has increased the overall rates of transition to higher education; the effect of financial aid on the recruitment of different socioeconomic groups; the effect of financial aid on recruitment of students of differing achievement levels; and any sex differences in recruitment resulting from aid. For three nationally representative samples born in 1948, 1953, and 1963, consideration was given to college attendance in the late 1960s, early 1970s, and early 1980s, respectively. During this period, the rate of transition from upper-secondary to higher education decreased from nearly 70% to less than 30%. However,  the evidence suggests that student aid did not explain the decreasing enrollments. In each cohort, the transition rate of students from higher social groups exceeded that of students from lower groups. Yet, in the late 1960s student aid had a substantial socially-equalizing effect on educational opportunities. However, this positive effect vanished and in the early 1970s student aid had practically no bearing on social differentiation, and this trend was greatly reinforced in the 1980s. Additional findings are covered. (SW)",

The operation of the restructured system was based on creating five resource groups to manage the distribution of academic resources to departments. Positive outcomes of restructuring included: time scale of decision-making, additional flexibility with funds, better information, focus for decision-making, unifying influence, and cohering new directions. Negative outcomes included: increased administrative load, confrontation between department heads, between-group competition, increasing bureaucratization, and impacts on faculties and deans. Concerns about the change  that were identified included: the rationale for tenurable positions and chairs, ad-hoc decision-making, staff personal problems, and inequality of access to information. The dynamic model represented the resource allocation and management mechanisms introduced in the structural reorganization. The dynamic model was evaluated by subjecting it to a variety of scenarios in the form of system stresses and policy alternatives. Questionnaires and interview schedules are appended, along with equations for the model. (SW)",

Brief descriptions are included of activities involving the scanning committees, including conduct of meetings, training committee members in forecasting techniques, developing the scanning newsletter, and writing issue briefs. The primary purpose of an environmental scanning and forecasting system is to identify and analyze trends in order to  uncover emerging issues that may affect the ability of colleges to perform their missions. The desired result would also be to provide the college's senior management with complete, objective, and detailed information about the external environment to help anticipate what is happening in the state, region, and nation. In support of the college's strategic planning process, the scanning committee would analyze and evaluate scanning abstracts on a monthly or bimonthly basis. (SW)",

The college historically has provided educational opportunities for black, disadvantaged students and has been successful with low-income, first-generation college students. The project would have two components: an academic year intensive weekend program and a summer residential program in two counties. The target communities have highly populated urban and semi-rural centers with low-income residents and a high unemployment rate. Experience during 1974-1983 with an Upward Bound Project indicates that students were deficient in basic skills, cognitive  knowledge, and critical analysis, and also had low self-image and counseling needs. The project would serve 11 senior high schools and 11 junior high or middle schools in two counties (i.e., students in grades 9, 10 and 11). The schools lack tutorial programs; opportunities for individual and small group educational experiences; educational, personal, financial aid, and career counseling; and summer programs for skill building and remediation.

Frameworks focusing on intellectual development cover effects of education on the acquisition of cognitive skills, knowledge, and understanding. A total of 35 of the classifications cover broad outcomes that affect  the individual. Of the four classifications concerned with impacts on society, one covers research and development outcomes of education, and another, the social purposes of public schools.

Three aspects of needs assessment most critical to a postsecondary institution are: learner assessment, community assessment, and provider assessment. After establishing objectives and defining the audience for a needs-assessment study, the question of focus arises (who decides that a need exists, who has needs, what needs will be assessed, and what information is required). In addition to considering each of these questions, a classification structure for  identifying needs is presented. The structure is a matrix that can focus on the following need areas for learners, the community, and providers: description, purposes, content, methods, financial resources, physical resources, human resources, time resources, information resources, support functions, and outcomes.

Attention is directed to: nationally-oriented blue-ribbon commissions, state-level commissions, blue ribbon commissions on campus, and factors that make commissions effective. For purposes of the study, a blue ribbon commission was defined as effective if it appeared to have produced an immediate and recognizable change in postsecondary structure, functions, or processes in a state. The two commissions studied in detail are: the Temporary State Commission on the Future of Postsecondary Education in New York State (Wessell Commission) and Maryland's Commission on the Structure and Governance of Education (Rosenberg Commission). A blue ribbon commission has the  following characteristics: a predetermined life span, the involvement of eminent individuals from a variety of backgrounds, staff and funds to assist in fulfilling its charge, and a charge to investigate and/or to recommend changes in structures, functions, origins, or processes. Gubernatorially or legislatively created commissions were established on at least 48 occasions in 25 states between 1965 and 1983. In many instances they have made recommendations that have changed the direction of higher education in the state; in other instances their impact has been minimal. (SW)",

These courses are offered as part of graduate level studies in the field of higher education administration. Review of seven syllabi and three brief course descriptions indicated that the subject of educational policy is treated differently among colleges. It appeared that educational policy courses in higher education included introductory courses utilizing the term &quot;policy&quot; to denote fundamental issues and purposes, as well as complex social, economic, and political relationships. In addition, mid-level courses focused on federal and state relations and the process for formulating policy at these levels. Finally, more specialized courses applied  concepts of politics and methods of policy analysis to the study of higher education at federal, state, and institutional levels. It is recommended that distinctions be made between the more generic, &quot;issues-based&quot; use of the term policy and the more specific practices of policy formation and policy analysis.

Most courses required students to follow a syllabus with an outline of weekly topics and to prepare a paper on a related topic. Student evaluation was usually based on test scores, papers, class reports, and class participation. The courses were generally conducted in seminars involving some limited lecturing by the instructor and, in some cases, extensive use of invited speakers. Integral to many of the courses was the preparation and  presentation of papers by students. Most of the courses employed extensive readings from journals, articles, and chapters in several books touching on higher education finance.

The syllabi had wide-ranging differences in concept and content. While some of the courses dealt exclusively with higher education public policy, others merely touched on that topic (e.g., overview courses that include a public policy segment as one of many topics). Several syllabi conceptualized the politics of higher education as encompassing the processes of policy-making (or decision-making) that take place in both internal and external settings. Reading materials on higher education policy are identified and organized into three categories: public policy matters specific to higher education, the policy-making process in more  generic terms, and some general references or guides that can be useful to the student. It is suggested that unpublished materials may serve as useful instructional/learning resources (e.g., legislative committee reports, public officials' speeches, and court decisions).

        "description":"After two field projects, interactive videotex (IV) was introduced in West Germany in 1983. Currently, the German IV system offers over 560,000 pages of information by more than 3,400 public and private information providers. Because the potential of this medium for education seems considerable, the use of IV for educational purposes is also being explored. Information and services offered through IV include: (1) information on educational institutions and programs; (2) registration and ordering of books and learning material; (3) courses, e.g., adjunct, refresher, correspondence, and programmed learning courses; (4) individual information exchange between learners and with teachers; and (5) computer services via host computers connected to the IV system, i.e., computer assisted  learning, information searching, computer-aided problem solving, computer simulation, and tests. It is assumed that IV--especially in combination with such media as private computers and videodiscs--will become a valuable medium for education. In addition, increased use of IV in the private realm of news retrieval, telebanking, and teleshopping will also have a strong impact on students' attitudes toward ordinary school instruction, which may lead to changes in the curriculum and wider adoption of IV techniques. Data tables and graphics are provided which illustrate key points in the document. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"The Computer Assisted Diagnostic Prescriptive Program (CADPP) is a customized databased curriculum management system which permits the user to load the following into a filing/retrieval software system: (1) learning characteristics of individual students (e.g., age, instructional level, learning modality); (2) skill-oriented characteristics of available instructional materials (i.e., readability level, interest level, modality required); and (3) a skills/concepts list. Once these files are loaded, the CADPP cross-references them to the match characteristics of students and materials, and produces customized prescriptions for each participating student. CADPP diagnostic components include the Criterion Referenced Test (CRT) series, developed to allow for a usable and accurate  means of diagnosing a student's needs in basic reading and mathematics skills. The CRT results inform teachers of skill areas that are deficient for each pupil, and this information is used to develop personalized educational plans for individual students. The software program can be used with an APPLE II+, IIe, and TRS 80 Models II and IV; two disk drives are required. The program disk has a capacity for 150 skills in two curriculum areas, 100 students per teacher, 150 prescriptions per skill, and 1,600 prescriptions per disk. The descriptive pamphlet includes a description of the National Diffusion Network Division, which makes validated educational programs available for adoption by schools, colleges, and other institutions; a CADPP adoption agreement; sample costs connected with the  adoption of CADPP; and a CADPP awareness session participant feedback form and material rating form. Validated by the National Institute of Education and the U.S. Office of Education in 1979, the system is currently used in over 500 schools in 35 states. Its greatest utilization has been with ECIA Chapter 1 students and special education, basic skills competency, gifted and talented, and adult basic education programs. (JB)",

The study's objectives were twofold: (1) to collect baseline information; and (2) to provide policy-makers, innovation planners, and curriculum developers with information about ICL state-of-the-art in the schools. The population consisted of a sample of 462 Dutch junior secondary schools stratified as follows: 202 general secondary education (GSE), 187 lower vocational education (LVE), 56 GSE/LVE schools, and 17 middle schools. Instruments included a general school questionnaire (38 items) and an  ICL questionnaire, which covered various aspects of introducing this new topic into the school curriculum and requested information on the degree of ICL implementation. Analysis of the responses from 382 schools (83%) indicates that: 70 schools (18.3%) were not active at all with ICL; 107 schools (28%) were teaching ICL to their pupils; 205 schools (53.7%) were in an orientation phase; teachers were the main group for originating adoption decisions; and reasons for not being active with ICL included lack of hardware (76.8%) and lack of time/resources. It is concluded that factors necessary for successful implementation include support from the government and school, positive attitudes and motivation of those involved, and positive experiences with earlier innovations. In addition, factors  important at the beginning of the implementation include knowledge about the innovation, contacts with other institutions, inservice training, and materials development. A list of references and 10 data tables are provided. (JB)",

In addition to providing custom-designed workshops in 20 states focusing upon state-level priority issues and needs for state policy makers, the project team also provided follow-up assistance and information services throughout the 2-year project. The purpose of this two-volume final report is to identify priority policy issues that have surfaced or are beginning to surface and to discuss alternative federal policy options to assist states in planning over the next few years. The first of two volumes describes the project and discusses general  state-level policy trends and the impact of SLATE upon state policy formulation related to the use of technology. The second volume addresses the major policy issues that were identified during the SLATE project, initiatives undertaken by the states, and alternative federal policy options, which if implemented, would appear to facilitate effective planning and use of technology at the state level. Appendices include lists of project advisory group membership, participating states and state coordinators, and 14 letters of appreciation. (JB)",

The project involved simultaneous development of content design, instructional strategies, software, and hardware, with a principal focus on evaluation of the instructional videodisc in the classroom. Videodisc development proceeded through three phases of increasing sophistication and evaluations were performed at each phase, including several comparisons of student learning with videodisc instruction and traditional lecture learning which were conducted at three different colleges. Results indicate that videodisc students consistently displayed greater learning and retention gains, reduced study times, and higher productivity ratios.  This paper describes the evolutionary stages of development of the intelligent videodisc, \"Development of Living Things,\" and the parallel evaluation studies.

        "description":"One of a series of developmental projects that have produced and evaluated applications of an advanced multimedia, computer-based technology for basic skills education for Army enlisted personnel, this project focused on the development of an integrated curriculum to teach learning strategies and problem-solving skills. The first task was to develop interactive videodisc instruction in problem solving and grouping as a learning strategy (i.e., classifying information into groups that emphasize similarities between items), and to produce a videodisc overview to integrate this instructional package with 12 previously produced videodiscs that teach a variety of additional study skills and learning strategies. The second task was to prepare printed, off-line materials to teach the  skills presented in the entire videodisc curriculum for use both in future media comparison evaluations planned by the Army Research Institute (ARI), and in locations that do not have the hardware necessary to present videodisc instruction. The third task was to prepare two videotapes, one a short summary and the other a 20-minute presentation, of the videodisc work sponsored by ARI. All videodisc instruction was designed for use with Apple- and Cromemco-based Spatial Data Management Systems (SDMS). This report presents a discussion of the learning strategies curricula, including its purpose, the videodisc materials that were developed, design and development issues, and the development of off-line materials, and a description of the videotape presentations on ARI videodisc instructional  projects.

(The replace of MEP in March 1986 with a small Microelectronics Support Unit, which will focus primarily on curriculum developments, is noted.) The MEP experience is described, and reasons for the success or failure of various aspects of computer-based learning during its tenure are discussed. Research and development activities that are beginning to emerge  are then reviewed, and a project at the University of Leeds for designing and building a knowledge-based advisor to encourage problem-solving skills is described. It is concluded that much greater collaboration, interchange of experience, and dissemination of software and associated curriculum materials between institutions are needed, as well as complementary research programs that look to the methodologies of cognitive science/artificial intelligence in order to prepare for the future.

After a brief introduction, Part 1 focuses on strategies for integrating various technological approaches into the curriculum, e.g., computers, electronic art, computer assisted instruction, and electronic networks. Use of technology in school management is also discussed. Part 2 discusses future uses of technology in tomorrow's schools, addressing possible changes in the structure and functions of schools, the role of the teacher, problems that may be caused by the implementation of electronic learning, the challenges of staff development, and the  question of copyright. Part 3 briefly describes three paths that educators may follow: (1) the full exploration of the creative and effective uses of electronic technologies in the instructional process and in school management activities; (2) the use of computers to assist in the instructional process, but without making changes in the curriculum to accommodate the computer; and (3) anticipation of far-reaching changes in the curriculum and public education caused by technology and rethinking the purpose of education accordingly. A list of participants and presenters at the conference is included. (JB)",

The key characteristics of telecommunications are discussed and 11 important telecommunications terms are defined. Additional topics addressed include: software typically used for telecommunications; the hardware required, i.e., a modem and interface; primary characteristics to look for in  a modem; choosing the right telecommunication system; key characteristics of networking; considerations regarding multi-users systems; and basic system costs. It is noted that a multi-user system includes these five components: the hardware; the interface; the master controller (either a chip on the expansion card, a hard disc drive, or a dedicated computer); the system server; and the wiring to connect the system parts. Evaluators are cautioned that, while multi-user and networking systems are very appealing, at the present time they are not realistic because of copy protection procedures used by most software companies and the cost of multi-user versions of software.

        "description":"The Service Delivery Assessment (SDA) model is a human services evaluation tool which offers a viable alternative to more traditional approaches and is appropriate for small local evaluations as well as large national studies. There are five phases to an SDA study: assignment, pre-assessment, design, analysis, and communication of the findings. Assignments are decided by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Inspector General, and may request answers to highly specific questions or be quite open-ended. During the pre-assessment period, information is gathered about local conditions, and possible contacts, respondents, and site study settings are determined. Because the primary means of gathering information in an SDA study is the one-to-one personal discussion, the  design phase focuses on identifying a wide array of people with whom to talk; in addition, SDA teams observe local conditions and activities during this period. The analysis phase is best described as one of consensus building by iterative steps; as information is gathered, trends and patterns emerge and new information is sought that will verify or repudiate investigators' hunches. The final report includes three different types of information--a description of local activities and conditions, a comparison of conditions with standardized or existing criteria, and the interpretations of the SDA team. Six characteristics of the SDA method are provided, as well as suggestions on when to use this approach. Finally, the evaluation of a teacher training summer institute is described to  illustrate the application of the SDA model. Two references are appended. (JB)",

        "description":"Designed for educational evaluators, this paper discusses reasons for the growing concern with linking or interfacing computers for information sharing; compares three major approaches to linking; and discusses the implications of each. An initial overview presents three linking applications in educational evaluation: (1) linking microcomputers with mainframes for data analysis; (2) data collection; and (3) distribution of instructional information systems. Scenarios are also provided which illustrate each of the three applications. The three major technical approaches to linking microcomputers with mainframes or each other are then described--exchanging electronic media (floppy disk exchange); telecommunications linkages, including asynchronous and synchronous connections; and  linking products (software packages). Examples and implications of each approach are discussed, including their advantages and disadvantages. Alternatives to shared access to a large database, such as local area networks and multi-user microcomputers, are also described, and their advantages and disadvantages outlined. Finally, the problems of coordination and system design are addressed; it is noted that finding solutions to linking problems takes time and experimentation, and that computer resources cannot be maximized without user acceptance. The latter necessitates the involvement of users in each stage of the planning, design, and testing of the application. Six examples of evaluation linking applications that are being implemented conclude the document, and a list of references is  provided. (JB)",

Composed of representatives from libraries, publishing, and the paper industry, the committee set two primary objectives: to increase knowledge about the durability of books and other materials, and to encourage improvements in their physical properties. A survey of more than 430 publishing companies sought information on the use of acid-free paper, awareness of the need for permanent papers, and willingness to cooperate by identifying acid-free publications. The reports in this document and the survey were planned to serve a dual purpose--to gather information about the use of acid-free paper and durable bindings, and also to alert publishers,  librarians, and others to the need for more careful consideration of production decisions. The &quot;Report on Book Paper&quot; discusses who has responsibility for preservation, what is currently being done, what should be done, availability of materials, recommendations, durability of books, the production situation, and paper mills. An appendix provides guidelines and a table of manufacturers producing acid-free grades of paper. &quot;On Longevity in Book Bindings&quot; includes information on pages, folded and gathered sheets, book covers, and recommendations.

The report consists of eight chapters and four appendices.  The first chapter is an executive summary, intended to serve not only as an introduction but as a free-standing document in itself, suitable for communication of the results to a large audience. The second chapter is a background paper describing the current accreditation process and the role of the ALA Committee on Accreditation. Chapters 3 and 4 are concerned with procedural issues related to organizing and financing the accreditation process in the context of the involvement of multiple professional societies. Chapters 5 through 8 are concerned with substantive issues involved in the evaluation of educational programs in the field, with emphasis on the interests of participating societies.

Two instruments were designed to answer questions about library patrons' uses of bibliographic citations retrieved in online database searches and the patron's need for rapid document delivery. Questionnaires were distributed to 196 people (145 to database search users and 51 to interlibrary load users). Questionnaires were returned by 80 (55.2%) of the search requestors and 33 (64.7%) of the users of interlibrary loan. Several fundamental issues were explored in this project, including: (1) users' perceptions of the meaning of &quot;rapid&quot; in a rapid document delivery  system; (2) the likelihood that users would utilize interlibrary loan channels if a rapid document delivery service were available; (3) users' willingness to pay for a rapid document delivery service; and (4) differences between the responses of users of different libraries on campus to issues 2 and 3. Following careful analysis of the study data by appropriate university bodies and other interest groups, a plan to develop a rapid document delivery service will be investigated.

The purpose was to recruit talented college graduates to the library profession and to retain these individuals in Illinois libraries. Of the 212 individuals who received scholarships, 198 (89.9%) were located, and 178 verified demographic information taken from their ISL files. Telephone interviews were held with 165 individuals who had finished degrees as of 1982. Of those interviewed, 122 (78.9%) were currently employed in library and library-related positions, and 94 (77%) were in Illinois. The consensus of the interviewees was that the ISL should reinstate a scholarship program of some sort, but perhaps not on the  scale of the 1961-1980 programs. Two possible scholarship programs are proposed. This report contains information on the background of the scholarship program and the procedures of the follow-up study; a detailed analysis of the survey data; and a summary and conclusions. Six appendices provide a bibliography on scholarships and fellowships in library and information science; copies of materials sent to scholarship recipients; the follow-up letter sent to recipients; the telephone interview form; copies of materials sent to members and former members of the ISL Advisory Committee; tables of supporting data; and an alphabetical listing of scholarship recipients.

At the time of the opening of the new wing, the circulation department began using a new computer system for circulation of the general collection. The survey included questions concerning the new circulation services, the new building facilities, and the collection arrangement, and was administered in the last month of the spring semester before the new wing was opened and in the last month of the following fall semester. Approximately 250 questionnaires were distributed each time. A return rate of 90% was achieved the first semester and 67% the second semester. Although changes in the  facilities and services were dramatic, general user satisfaction did not appear to be affected. However, changes in users' opinions about some specific services were noted. High user expectations, a nonspecific survey construction, and multiple-service changes are discussed as some of the possible reasons for a lack of detectable change in overall satisfaction. The library survey and a 12-item bibliography are included. (Author/THC)",

        "description":"This paper examines the changing instructional role of the high school librarian from 1951 to 1984 to determine: (1) if the purported changes in the instructional role have been fictional or factual; (2) if the changes were those of substance or of form; (3) if the changes represented a process of growth and development in direct relationship to educational and societal revolutions; and (4) if any of the changes noted experienced a period of dormancy between introduction and acceptance by practitioners. Three sources of material were selected as research parameters for the study: representative literature published during the period which described the instructional role of the librarian; standards, guidelines, and reports issued by national educational and library associations;  and research studies performed during each decade. Library literature was characterized by its precocity; it usually did not reflect the times so much as advance them. Standards, reports, and guidelines seemed to reinforce the literature, while research studies revealed that the instructional role had changed, but not to the degree indicated in the first two sources.

        "description":"In 1980, the Ohio Board of Regents (OBR) proposed several alternative funding formulas for the state's public-assisted institutions in anticipation of enrollment declines. Two alternatives, involving subsidy ceilings and free competition for students, were dismissed in favor of a third alternative involving a system of voluntary restraints in which Ohio public institutions would plan to maintain or decrease their enrollments in an orderly manner under several mandated restrictions. This alternative also included a modification of the existing enrollment-driven subsidy model that would permit money earned by growing institutions to be transferred to those in decline. As part of the review of these alternatives, enrollment and subsidy data were analyzed, revealing that: (1) there  was a strong correlation between enrollment growth and the cost of education as measured by total institutional expenditures per full-time equivalent student (FTE); (2) growing institutions were on the whole operating at a lower instructional subsidy per FTE than declining institutions; and (3) there was already diversity in educational subsidies per FTE within the system with apportionments per FTE for universities ranging from $1,710 to $4,211, for community colleges from $1,819 to $2,641, and for technical colleges from $1,772 to $3,976. While it is difficult for the OBR to allow declining institutions to experience destructive financial problems, an argument for allowing the free market approach to prevail, at least in a modified form, could be made on the basis that growing  institutions need more money while declining ones need less; and that if an institution's revenue fluctuates with enrollment, it will likely work to operate in a manner similar to profit-making corporations and be more responsive to student needs and more efficient and accountable in terms of staffing. An enrollment-driven state support system which includes a relief loan fund for institutions which face financial exigency is recommended. (RO)",

First, introductory comments argue that, just as there are stratified technological levels within the labor market, levels of knowledge can also be distinguished, pointing to access to &quot;high status knowledge&quot; as a critical problem in determining the equity of a nation's educational system. After presenting a rationale for comparing the two educational systems, the paper defines &quot;middle class&quot; for the purposes of the analysis, examines Brazil's two-tiered educational system of public and private schooling, and describes SENAI, a private educational enterprise offering industry-oriented vocational training to a select  group of working class students. Next, the U.S. community colleges are described and assessed in terms of how well they serve the educational needs of the middle and lower middle classes. Educational innovations that have been implemented in Brazil with limited success are reviewed next, including efforts to offer a 2-year postsecondary curriculum and to expand university access through night classes. The final sections discuss implications and offer conclusions, indicating that both SENAI and the community college offer unique education to the lower middle levels of their respective societies, yet neither effectively offers education for those at the very bottom of the social structure.

A group of 124 entering students agreed to participate in the pilot project and were given a battery of assessment tests and counseling based on their test scores and academic goals. This group was divided into two halves: the Program group consisted of students who took assessment tests and followed placement recommendations, while the Control group was made up of students who failed to attend testing sessions and those tested students who placed themselves contrary to the counselor's recommendations. While Program  group members had higher success rates in mathematics courses than Control group members, this was not the case for English courses. The study found no correlation between placement instrument scores and final course grades in 11 English and mathematics classes that were given placement instruments as class exercises.

In the 1960s, Nova University developed field-based doctoral programs as a strategy to prepare individuals to become agents of change in the contexts in which they work. Nova's Center for Higher Education developed field-based doctoral programs in: (1) higher education; (2) leadership in adult education; and (3) vocational, technical, and occupational (VTO) education. During the 1980s, the Center for Higher Education critically analyzed its format for the delivery of the specialization seminars for the three programs. This paper describes the redesign and implementation of the  new format for developing change agents in VTO education, detailing the content of two specialization seminars, namely, &quot;Personnel--Human Resources Development&quot; and &quot;The Emergence of Vocational, Technical, and Occupational Education in America,&quot; and analyzing outcomes of the new seminar format.

Although the teaching role is not a necessary condition for successful scholarship, some form of scholarship appears to be a necessary condition for successful teaching over an extended period of time. Therefore, the stress on teaching in community colleges may have actually led to a decline in the quality of teaching. The facts that new colleges are not being opened, that enrollments are declining, that funds for professional development are scarce, and that community college faculty are aging all reinforce the importance of scholarship as a means of enhancing faculty members' performance and image as professionals. While at  the university level scholarship is equated with research, at the community college level a more liberal definition of scholarship should be employed, including professional activity, research/publication, artistic endeavors, engagement with novel ideas, community service, and pedagogy. The systematic processes involved in each of these activities will do much to strengthen teaching and combat boredom and burnout. Though examples of scholar-teachers exist on every campus, there is a need for the formal encouragement, support, and reward that would institutionalize the role of the scholar-teacher, and, in doing so, revitalize the teaching role.

Citizenship education is congruent with the mission of the community college in that it is a practical enterprise leading to self-governance; it is integrative, using a variety of cognitive skills, attitudes and knowledge; it is community relevant; and it enhances career development. By adopting a conception of general education that inclines toward the notion of education for democratic participation, community colleges can contribute to the process of political socialization and better fulfill their obligation to the community which is their source of support. Advantages of civic education for community college students include the possibilities of reducing political power  differentials; addressing social issues of importance to a \"late bloomer\" student population; and developing a sense of community among students. Objections to mandated programs in civic education focus on the curriculum constraints imposed on the community college. Issues of freedom versus constraint, individualism versus social obligation, and vocationalism versus liberal learning need to be resolved before such a prescriptive model of general education can be adopted. Civic education programs in community colleges contribute to the quality of community life and further the commitment to democratic values and practices which is the aim of the community college.

The importance attached by the instructors to designing writing exercises tailored in form and content to the students'  skill levels is noted. The paper then offers brief descriptions of writing assignments designed to build confidence in writing ability and emphasize communication skills, including clustering, modeling, brainstorming, and controlled writing, free writing, and journal writing. Other exercises more appropriate for more advanced students are also outlined; these may include summaries, practice essay exams, and computer assisted writing.

These variables are used in three separate stages of the program evaluation: program monitoring, in-depth program evaluation, and program reduction/discontinuance. Programs demonstrate their success in terms of their responses to 13 clearly defined criterion questions that can be answered with a simple yes or no answer. In addition each criterion is evaluated on a five point Likert Scale using specific quantitative standards. The evaluation procedure focuses on: (1) enrollment rate; (2) graduation rate; (3) graduate placement in appropriate field; (4)  employer requests for graduates; (5) advisory committee recommendations; (6) cost per full-time equivalent student; (7) faculty productivity ratio; (8) relation to the college's mission; (9) needs assessment; (10) physical facilities; (11) equipment; (12) enrollment of female, minority, and handicapped students; and (13) availability of the same program from other agencies.

        "description":"Having implemented a policy that allowed schools to retain children in kindergarten an extra year, the Boulder Valley Public School District in Colorado conducted a study to determine the cognitive and emotional benefits of retention in kindergarten and the characteristics that led to decisions about retention. The study involved a research review of existing literature, an examination of first grade outcomes, and interviews with parents and teachers to determine their perceptions about young children and their readiness for first grade. The study revealed that (1) the use of Gesell tests to make individual placement decisions cannot be defended on the basis of existing research; (2) the existing research does not show either academic or social-emotional benefit from retaining  immature children; (3) the finding of no benefit on most measures and only a one-month gain in reading raises serious questions about the efficacy of an extra year in kindergarten; (4) data from parents did not indicate that there was an average benefit of retention or two-year kindergarten programs on children's academic progress; (5) diversity existed among the kindergarten teachers with respect to what they believed about child development and the best ways to educate young children; (6) beliefs about development were related to retention practices, and seemed to be shared within a school building; (7) kindergarten teachers believed retention and other two-year programs had benefits that outweighed their risks; and (8) teachers in the same school usually had very similar policies in  terms of the kinds of pupil characteristics that should lead to kindergarten retention. It was concluded that two-year kindergarten programs are an ineffective solution to the problem of escalating expectations in kindergarten. Six pages of references are included. Appendixes contain a first-grade rating form for teachers, a parent interview schedule, coding categories for teacher interview analysis, and instructions for case reviews. (HOD)",

        "author":["Cohen, Leonora Marx"],
        "description":"This report proposes a modification of Jean Piaget's concept of \"creative abstraction,\" the mechanism of creative thought, which develops both intelligence and creative ideas. By reflecting on one's actions and the coordinations of actions, the individual constructs new relationships, links, rules, or correspondences between and among them. Reflective abstraction is important both in the growth and development of young children and in the creative work of adults. The report finds fault with Piaget's description of this mechanism in that it does not conceptualize the process sufficiently for either research or educational purposes. The paper also outlines the correspondences between models for creative problem-solving drawn from other research and reflective abstraction and amends  Piaget's \"dual process of reflecting and reflection\" by hypothesizing that reflective abstraction is a six-step process. This model of the reflective process is presented from the beginning, when an individual becomes aware of a problem, through the final resolution of the problem. Finally, the report illustrates the workings of reflective abstraction with reference to the creative work of scientists and artists. (RH)",

The statement on public school preschool programs briefly describes characteristics of the 4-year-old, indicates aspects of a developmentally appropriate preschool program, provides a rationale for public preschool education, indicates preschool children's basic needs, suggests guidelines for the implementation of quality programs, and delineates the role of public schools in advancing appropriate experiences for 4-year-olds. The statement on parent support discusses what is known about quality family  life and quality parenting, ways to help parents be effective, and plans to support parents. The statement on child care explores children's needs (l) to feel that their situation is a safe and comfortable place to be, (2) to be fully employed in activities that are meaningful to them, (3) to live comfortably with other children and adults, (4) to have their physical development supported and be helped to learn health, nutritional, and safety practices, and (5) to feel that there is consistency in their lives and a shared concern for them among parents and caregivers. Discussion of developmental experiences for kindergarten recommends beginning with the needs of children, suggests ways of designing learning environments to meet children's needs, and points out ways of assessing  kindergarten children's development.

In most classes, provision was made for spontaneous play, but this was not related to academic objectives, and was seldom evaluated by the teachers. Directed reading and mathematics settings were highly teacher controlled. Both academic accountability and classroom discipline contributed to the narrow range of  formats in these areas. (RH)",

        "description":"This paper presents findings of an analysis of kindergarten report cards from Ohio public schools and discusses implications of the findings for policy makers, program planners, and curriculum supervisors. A total of 76 school districts were selected in a random sample of 331 which was stratified to represent 6 types of school districts. Data were analyzed to determine (1) how report cards were organized; (2) how information was reported; (3) what children were expected to know and to be able to do; and (4) what philosophies of early childhood education or theoretical orientations were evident. Findings in each of these areas are reported. The analysis led to three conclusions. First, there are specific skills that a kindergarten child is expected to master, with major emphasis  being in the areas of work habits, reading readiness, and math readiness. Second, the push in Ohio public schools is toward an academically oriented kindergarten most heavily influenced by the behaviorist perspective. Third, the predominant marking systems present negative evaluations for the kindergarten child, assuming that a child can fail in the skills and behaviors expected of a kindergartener. Such a system, it is argued, further reinforces a behaviorist perspective in contrast to a maturationist or interactionist orientation. (RH)",

As the participant observation field-work of the study progressed, it became clear that much of children's interaction in their kindergarten classroom was covert in nature. That is, it took place in classroom contexts defined as situations in which peer conversations were either forbidden or discouraged. The focus of the study was then directed toward the character of such situations and children's covert interactions within them. The findings describe contexts in which children's talking was officially limited and identify patterns of interaction children used in reaction to classroom limitations. Students' response patterns were classified into three domains: (1)  forgetting expectations, (2) secret communications, and (3) exploring the limits. Each category of response is discussed as an example of children making secondary adjustments to institutional role expectations of the school. (RH)",

As early observations and analyses were completed, the behavior of Lester and the behavior of other children toward Lester suggested that his relationships with his classmates were strained and difficult. During subsequent observations, attention was given to contexts in which Lester was involved and to reactions to his social behavior. Analysis of Lester's social behavior revealed three general kinds of behavior which  breached peer norms and expectations in the classroom: aggression, teasing, and contact incompetence (poorly developed strategies for making positive social contact with peers). Classmates responded to Lester with snubs and by denying him entry into already established groups. In interviews and in classroom peer interaction, children talked about Lester as if his deviant status was taken for granted by the group. While the children did not knowingly construct the stigmatization of Lester, the impact of their treatment of him was potentially more devastating because his inferiority was assumed. Insofar as Lester accepted the correctness of that assumption he was learning to be an outsider. (RH)",

The initial sample consisted of 321 low-income mothers of healthy infants, follow-ups at kindergarten entry were completed on 237 mothers and data on school retention during the first three years of school were completed on 209 children. Data were collected on mothers' characteristics and behaviors toward the infant during the third trimester of pregnancy and at four and  twelve months postnatally; data were also collected on child grade retention or promotion and teachers' ratings of child academic competence and social adjustment. Factor analyses and analyses of variance revealed that maternal interactions with the infant predicts grade retention during the early school years. Moreover, mothers of children retained during the early school years were rated as lower on interactions with their infants at twelve than at four months. It was also found that teachers' ratings of child academic competence are significantly related to grade retention or promotion. (BB)",

Children in the sample, though of normal intelligence, showed depressed early reading skills, difficulties in visual-motor integration and some evidence of attention-deficit symptomatology. Three hypotheses were tested regarding possible deficits in the production, quality and internalization of self-regulatory language in this high-risk sample. The findings suggest that although the overt self-regulatory private speech of high-risk children is apparently normal, their marked lack of whispering indicates difficulties in the subvocalization or  internalization of such speech. A strong relation was found between lack of whispering and an index of reading disability, suggesting that the capacity to internalize speech might be a necessary precursor for the capacity to read. Thirty-eight references are included. Four statistical tables and four graphs are presented to support the study. (Author/RH)",

It presents reflections on entering the field site, keeping field notes, and analyzing data. An exploratory study of a group of preschool children led to the selection of qualitative methods and clarified the theoretical basis for research. In completing the formal study, triangulated methods of participant observation, interviewing, and record and contextual analysis were used. The use of ethnomethodology to explore events themselves led to a dual analysis of theoretical propositions and empirical data in which theory provided a frame of reference for conducting field study and observation-based findings led to theoretical reorganization. These methods proved to be appropriate for  the setting and for the sociological data collected. The role of participant-as-observer was manageable by adopting a passive attitude as adult-without-authority. The children responded to the presence of a researcher with mild curiosity. Their level of interest was evaluated reactively at the conclusion of observation. The analysis of data proceeded steadily through three phases and culminated in the full description of typologies and strategies used by the preschool children. The interpretive process of ethnographic methodology was valuable in constructing detailed, contextual information about children's everyday social behavior. (Author/RH)",

Two types of repetition were studied: repeated recall of the same event, and repeated experiences with the general activity of remembering. From the total corpus of conversational data, 75 memories were selected for analysis. Results demonstrate the importance of learning to talk about the past in the development of memory and indicate that individual, autobiographic memories--independently of effects of repetition and rehearsal--are well established at an early age. In repeated conversations about the  past, the child was learning how to remember, not what to remember; the structure of remembering was acquired, rather than specific content. (RH)",

High, average, and low achievers of first- through third-grade levels (n = 38) were selected from classrooms of eight teachers who had been observed frequently suggesting cognitive processes and strategies to children. For comparison, 26 children were chosen from five classrooms in which teachers rarely made such suggestions. In individual sessions, children were given a free recall task, trained in an organizational strategy for free recall, and assessed for strategy maintenance. Although all children showed improved recall performance and increased  strategy use immediately after training, groups varied in performance on a later test trial. Average and low achievers whose teaachers were high in strategy suggestions showed maintenance superior to that shown by similar children whose teachers rarely made strategy suggestions. This difference appeared for recall performance, recall organization, and among younger children, for category sorting during study. Children whose teachers often suggested strategies were better able to verbalize an accurate recollection of training instruction. Children who were high in achievement generally showed excellent maintenance of the trained strategy, independent of teacher characteristics. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This study examined (1) the psychometric qualities of a modified version of the Parent Behavior Form (PBF) designed to obtain ratings of parental behavior toward a child from four different family members, and (2) the effects of aggregating across raters on the reliability and generalizability of ratings of parental behavior. Subjects were 744 individuals from 186 families. The four participants from each family were a freshman college student, the mother, the father, and one sibling within 3 years of the student's age. Results showed the PBF to have overall good reliability and a consistent pattern of three factors--labeled warm involvement, harsh control, and lax control--for ratings of both mother and father by all four family members. These results suggest that the PBF can be  a reliable and useful research instrument. It is probably unnecessary to reject data of subjects scoring high on either of the instrument's two validity indices. Results parallel those of Schwarz and others' study (1985) which found that aggregating ratings of multiple family members generally increased the reliability of ratings. Findings of the Schwarz study and the present study supply strong support for the continued use of children's reports as a means of measuring childrearing behavior. (RH)",

        "description":"Indicating that the essence of social psychology is social influence, this inaugural lecture discusses social psychological dimensions of education. Particular attention is given to the topics of teaching styles and the impact of the student's personality and social learning outcomes on school achievement. It is pointed out that recent research on classroom interaction shows some agreement on certain aspects of teaching style which help low socioeconomic status children learn. Subsequent discussion focuses on recent studies conducted in England, including Bennett's (1976) controversial study of primary classrooms, Galton and others' (1980) Leicestershire study of primary classrooms and of transition from primary to secondary schools, and Hargreaves' (1967, 1975, and 1978) studies  of social relations in a secondary school, interpersonal relations and education, and the effects of the classroom on teachers' behavior. Concerning self-esteem, the consistent finding of a high correlation between low self-esteem and low school performance is supplemented with summaries of additional research findings. Concluding remarks briefly explore ways in which school ethos, classroom climate and teaching style influence student achievement and suggest that the real challenge of education is located in the interactive, social psychological processes of adaptation and engagement.

The programs include educational development, health services, social services, nutrition services, parent education and participation, evaluation, and staff development. The state requires that all subsidized programs evaluate themselves using an instrument called the Program Quality Review. Recognizing that schools are already involved in providing day care programs, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Bush Program has been primarily concerned about issues of child care as opposed to issues of schooling. The Child Care Task Force has several suggestions as to the role schools should play in providing services to  four-year-olds and their families: (1) school involvement should be in full day programs as opposed to part day programs, (2) programs should be year round instead of being offered on the traditional school year schedule, (3) children should be presented with educational models that are developmentally appropriate, and (4) programs should offer cultural diversity. A study of 100 randomly selected child care programs in the county of Los Angeles, however, revealed that teachers and directors are running structured programs. This suggests that while the appropriate role for schools should be to extol the positive effects of high quality preschool programs, there is also a need to get the developmental principles that underlie the different curriculum models across to the public.

        "description":"In this paper conceptual and methodological issues in the analysis of developmental sequences are discussed. Conceptually, the reconstruction of the logic of acquisition calls for the use of task or structure analysis. Methodologically, it calls for an individual-oriented approach, the use of statement calculus for formulation of the postulated developmental relationships, and confirmatory fitting of the developmental model. This approach is illustrated by longitudinal data of operatory intelligence collected in an Icelandic sample of 121 children 7, 9, and 12 years of age. Structural relationships between different concrete- and formal-operational abilities are specified with respect to the synchronous and diachronous development. The postulated relations are validated by  structure analysis and integrated into a consistent model of operatory development. This model represents intraindividual courses or profiles of cognitive development, and on an aggregate level the formation processes of emerging operativity. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"A quasi-experimental non-equivalent control group design was used to investigate the effects of full-spectrum light, prescribed color and light/color combinations, ultra-violet light, and electromagnetic radiation in an elementary school environment. Four schools in the Wetaskiwin School District, Alberta, were involved in the study; three served as experimental groups and one as a control group. Independent variables were exposure to full-spectrum light or prescribed cool colors for teachers and prescribed warm colors for students or a combination of light and color treatments, ultraviolet light for a sample of grade five students, and elimination of electromagnetic radiation for a sample of grade three students. Dependent variables were primarily student academic,  physiological, and affective outcomes and also included blood pressure as a teacher physiological measure. A pre-experimental static-group comparison design was used in the investigation of mood and noise. Overall results support a call for additional field-based and laboratory research into the effects of color, light, and color/light combinations. Findings regarding the beneficial effects of ultraviolet light and reduction of electromagnetic radiation in the school environment support strong recommendations for further study of these effects. An extensive literature review of research findings on light and color is included in the report, which also contains 58 tables, 12 figures, and a bibliography. Appendixes include an analysis of pre-adolescent mood variation, a report of an  investigation of electromagnetic radiation and student off-task behavior, and an illuminance survey of schools of the Wetaskiwin School District.

The description of Coding Scheme 1 focuses on the initiation and termination of a shared focus between mother and child. Coding Scheme 2 recorded every request by child to mother for help or information, mother's response, appropriateness of mother's response, and presence or absence of cognitive content in mother's  response. Coding Scheme 3 centered on the contents of mothers' speech and behavior. The coding of cognitive contents aimed at capturing all instances in which mothers imparted facts about the physical, social, and emotional world, and methods for acquiring knowledge, for knowledge representation, and for knowledge use. Coding Scheme 4 characterized the content of mothers' communication in terms of its specificity and availability to the senses. Coding sheets are attached. (RH)",

Strategies and problems concern health, language, motor difficulties, immaturity, active negative behavior toward adults, distrust or passivity toward adults, disruptive behavior, aggressive behavior, bossy or meddlesome behavior, leading and following peers inappropriately, shyness and withdrawn behavior, unhappiness, lack of self-confidence, self-concept, lack of initiative, academic difficulty,  miscellaneous problems such as stealing, dependence on peers, oddities or mannerisms of personal behavior, and need for attention, as well as behavioral, academic, and management concerns. Chapter 3 describes whole-class strategies which are considered suitable for any style of primary classroom. These concern the establishment of a positive and responsive learning environment, managing social problems, ways of dealing with problms caused outside the classroom, classroom discipline, academic routines, self-chosen learning activities in the classroom, developing academic concepts and skills, and meeting the needs of the teacher.

Additionally, 20 types of classroom problems were identified and categorized as involving constitution, non-social skills and behavior, self-direction and self-confidence, emotional functioning, and miscellaneous. Ratings did not predict specific problems, but only the incidence of problems in general. A total of 22 types of strategies were used by teachers to deal with problems they identified.

Steps recommended for the exploratory phase of research are identifying stakeholders, gaining the confidence of stakeholders by personally asking for their advice; and collaborating with practitioners or establishing a steering committee which includes them. Strategies suggested for the research design phase include framing research questions in  non-threatening ways; keeping scientific validity as well as human credibility in mind; and creating a dissemination plan. Practices to aid in research dissemination include communicating preliminary results personally to stakeholders, using a mix of media (news articles, radio, television documentaries, slide shows, linking agents) to publicize findings, communicating findings in easily digested/discussed small pieces, tailoring reports to the audience, and repeating the message many times to create an impact. The paper cautions that, despite efforts to gain support for the research and to communicate the findings, it may well have little direct, observable impact on practical decisions. This does not, however, mean that the research has not been useful. (NEC)",

Findings indicated that children of migrant workers are erroneously classified as lower class because of the jobs their parents usually have in West Germany, a fact which has resulted in many negative consequences for the children in the schools.  However, data indicated that Greek migrant children are beginning to function on an achievement level which could have been expected from them (as extrapolated from their parents' attributes) had they attended the schools in their country of origin.

        "description":"The Alaska Native population experienced substantial advances in physical health, education, income, and housing between 1970 and 1980. Despite these gains and the 1971 passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), the Alaska Native population remains at a disadvantage in all areas relative to the Alaskan non-Native population and the United States population as a whole. Despite an annual 2.4% population increase, Natives constitute a smaller minority group in 1980 than in 1970. The Native birth rate is likely to remain high, with approximately 39,000 Natives ineligible to enroll for ANCSA benefits by 1991. Declines in infant mortality and deaths due to preventable diseases were offset by increases in the rate of deaths due to accidents and suicide. While the  educational attainment of Natives 18-24 years old has improved significantly, one out of four dropped out of high school in 1980. The Native male unemployment rate (13% in 1980) showed negligible change during the decade. From 1970 to 1980, state/local government employment among rural Alaska Natives increased from 22% to 39% of all Native employment. The average number of persons per Native household dropped from 5.2 in 1970 to 3.8 in 1980. (NEC)",

Part One presents facts and issues related to types of crime, crime statistics, the extent of crime, trends in crime rates, victimization rates, rural and urban differences, fear of victimization, and police protection and crime. Part Two reports a study based on personal interviews with a random sample of 403 heads of households in 4 Oregon counties. Discussion of results covers various factors, including crime rates, which caused some people to be more satisfied with police protection than others. Adaptations made because of dissatisfaction  with police protection are also discussed, e.g., purchase of safety devices, political action, and inferaction with neighbors. Policy implications are considered for three findings: (1) city, town, and rural residents respond differently to dissatisfaction with police protection; (2) people in the three locations differ in degree of unmet need for greater public safety; and (3) people most dissatisfied with police protection were generally those most willing to pay for increased safety.

        "description":"Community decision makers selecting an economic development strategy most appropriate for their local community must begin with an understanding of how their local economy functions, what its economic base is, and how changes in that base may affect local economic structure and performance. The economic base approach emphasizes the roles of exports and imports in generating local income and employment. Export promotion is a traditional strategy to stimulate more economic activity by enlarging the flow of income into the community. Import substitution is a strategy to decrease the leakage of income out of the community. Both the export promotion and import substitution objectives can be accomplished by attracting new firms as well as by retaining or expanding existing firms.  Furthermore, the increasing importance of investment income and transfer payments as a major external source of earnings flowing into the community should not be overlooked in local economic development planning. This paper explains the process of local employment and income generation, illustrates several simple techniques for estimating the local economic base, and suggests how information on economic structure can be used to help select more promising economic development strategies. One Pacific Northwest regional economy--Baker County, Oregon--is used as an example. (JHZ)",

In 1985 and 1986 three vendors in the continental United States pioneered the offering of interactive satellite instruction for high school credit courses. The programs were: (1) German by Satellite offered by the College of Arts and Sciences at Oklahoma State University; (2) the Accelerated Learning of Spanish Project via Satellite Television sponsored by the Utah State Board of Education, the Bonneville International Corporation, and the IBM Corporation; and (3) the TI-IN Network broadcasting 14 different high school courses originating from San Antonio, Texas. These rapidly growing systems currently beam 16 different high school credit courses to over 2,300  students in approximately 200 schools scattered across 13 states. The systems employ a variety of teaching strategies in their televised satellite broadcasts, which are supplemented by features such as computer assisted instruction, live audio interaction between students and video teacher, and electronic mailbox systems. Although no data are yet published assessing the quality of the instruction, survey information shows students and administrators have positive attitudes towards the satellite courses. (JHZ)",

Only three towns with populations over 1,000 bear names that clearly come from Indian languages: Sioux Falls, Sisseton, and Yankton. The hostile relationship existing between white settlers and Indians in South Dakota from 1859-1890 when most of the names which have gained official status were assigned by whites may account, in part, for the lack of Indian names. However, a closer examination of the names of smaller towns reveals a fascinating variety of documentation and folklore tracing back to a rich heritage of Sioux Indian influence. Interesting details surround the towns of Huron,  Iroquois, Seneca, Onida, Pukwana, Kodoka, Oacoma, Oglala, Wasta, and Wakonda. Place names that are translations of Indian words form a longer list, but it is difficult to ascertain which are actually translations and which are descriptive labels that would be natural in any language. Place names falling into this group include Black Hills, Badlands, Vermillion River, and Wounded Knee. (NEC)",

More than half the grants were primarily for economic development; approximately one-third were for improving tribal governments, and about one-tenth were for social development. The remaining grants focused on a combination of activities. The economic development efforts were aimed at establishing or expanding business enterprises, creating employment, and increasing income from natural resources. Numerous tribal governments were strengthened; for example, 44 tribes enacted tribal codes, 13 tribes initiated new tax collection and management systems, and 47 tribes  adopted merit employment systems. Grants for social development often contributed to a tribe's economic development as well. Grants establishing day care centers and service networks to help the elderly and alcohol and drug abusers provided needed social services as well as jobs for tribal members. This report summarizes numerous projects implemented by American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaska Native communities. Appendices include a summary of expenditures for FY 1984, a list of grant recipients, and graphs showing the impact of SEDS grants on Native American employment and economic growth. (JHZ)",

Chapters outline Federal-Indian relationships; provide demographic and economic information on the Indian population; trace current health status, changing health problems, and regional health differences; describe Indian Health Service (IHS) care and facilities construction programs; and discuss major issues such as eligibility, effects of self-determination on tribal health services management, equity of fund allocation among IHS service areas, and problems of purchasing high-cost care which IHS cannot provide. Among findings are that changing Federal policy has introduced great complexity into the  Federal-Indian relationship, that there is controversy over IHS eligibility, and that Indian health continues to lag far behind that of the population of the United States as a whole. The report recommends that IHS programs be coordinated with needs-based planning, including cooperation with private providers, improvement of existing facilities, and continuation of sanitation projects. Numerous tables and graphs supplement the text; appendices include Indian population estimates by IHS service units and tribe, age-specific and age-adjusted death rates by leading causes, IHS allocations for 1972-85 by area and budget categories, and a glossary.

The program was open to school groups during weekdays and to the general public on weekends and evenings. Visitor behavior at the exhibits was monitored, and the 17 displays were evaluated on their attention-holding ability, knowledge impact, instructional component, accommodation potential, and self-directiveness. The highest rated exhibits tended to be self-directive and highly interactive. To assess knowledge and attitude changes related to the program, a pretest-postest  questionnaire was completed by visiting adults and students. Students and adults responded differently to the program. Adults showed significant knowledge gain while students did not. On attitudes, students and adults were positive on the pretest, but only students showed a positive shift on the posttest. Positive feedback was obtained from teachers who participated in the program with their classes. A diagram of the display area and exhibit design, as well as observation form, are included. (ML)",

        "description":"This paper describes the background and development, provides an overview, and discusses the evaluation of the Carroll County, Maryland, elementary school science program emphasizing a hands-on approach to science. It uses locally developed materials designed at each grade level and focuses on process skills instead of concepts. The program development was guided by a statement of principles: (1) a hands-on approach and direct involvement of students; (2) concepts appropriate for the developmental level of students; and (3) extensive use of science processes. Instructional emphases are: (1) Grade 1--observation; (2) Grade 2--classification; (3) Grade 3--experimentation; (4) Grade 4--analysis; and (5) Grade 5--application. Materials needed for the program are supplied to teachers  in custom-made kits developed for each grade level, designed and manufactured by Delta Education. Teachers receive trade books selected to match curriculum topics to supplement the curriculum. Summer enrichment materials have been prepared for each level. The lab-based approach was compared to two textbook based programs and found superior in amount of hands-on activity, inclusion of scientific processes, student motivation, and teacher motivation, but inferior for implementation. Subsequent reports include documentation of material development and curriculum guides for each grade level. (JM)",

Based on a 1983 pilot study and implementation of this program, funding was secured from the National Science Foundation for evaluation of the program. The principal investigating agency was the Carroll County Board of Education, working in conjunction with the Maryland State Department of Education, Hood College and the University of Maryland. The program provided preservice training for all teachers, follow-up workshops, program evaluation and identification, training and support of science coordinators in each school. The evaluation found the locally develped program to be significantly (p less than .001) better than two textbook approaches to  which it was compared in amount of hands-on activity, inclusion of scientific processes, student motivation and teacher motivation. It was significantly more difficult (p less than .001) to implement then the textbook approaches. The bulk of the document consists of appendices which include statements of principles, pilot designs, duties of coach, operational definitions of processes, congruence with state framework, kit contents, supplemental text lists, live material center description, summer program information, and evaluations of Parent-Teacher presentations, the pilot study, and workshops.

Three general issues were addressed: knowledge required for understanding problems, knowledge of the conditions for applying problem-solving operators, and strategic knowledge for problem solving. Computational systems were developed in which graphical displays present explicit information to students that allows them to reflect on processes that are usually implicit, construct representations of problem information, specify assignments of variables, and learn from strategic errors. Research is described that provided analyses of cognitive processes  on which instructional designs were based, and preliminary empirical results from use of the systems are presented. (Author/JM)",

Recently computer-based problems have been available to complement these standard sources. This report focusses on the use of computer-based problems in the study of genetics. Discriptions and comparisons of textbook, laboratory, and computer-based problems are stated and an explanation is given of how college students (N=68) performed in completing and understanding computer-based problem-solving tasks. Examples of problems involving dominance and linkage concepts are presented. The study results suggest that computer-based problems can encourage productive rather than reproductive thinking and thus facilitate meaningful  rather than rote learning of genetic concepts. It is believed that this type of learning experience confronts student misconceptions, identifies inadequacies in student problem-solving skills, and provides a productive context in which students can develop and refine their skills.

The first essay, &quot;Extremist Conceptions of Man and Nature&quot; by Eric Katz critiques three popular philosophies regarding nature and the environment that are believed to be misguided and ineffective. A paradigm of harmony or &quot;ecopiety&quot; in which humankind is attuned to both itself and to nature is offered in Hwa Yol Jung's essay. &quot;The Arrogance and Banality of Technology: A Critique from the Perspective of Deep Ecology.&quot; Ecopiety is meant to subvert and transgress anthropocentrism and thereby harmonize humans with nature in a spirit of reverence for all earthly beings and things. In the third essay, &quot;Technology and the  Healing of the Earth,&quot; Thomas Berry reviews the question of human/earth relationships through a cultural/historical approach on a species level. He proposes the need for a mutually enhancing human/earth relationship that focuses on bioregionalism, appropriate technology, and a less wasteful and unjust distribution of human goods.

It is one in a series developed by the project &quot;Overcoming Critical Barriers to Learning in Nonmajors' Science Courses.&quot; The materials offer guidance to teachers in diagnosing student deficiencies, in creating dissatisfaction with misconceptions, and in providing opportunities for application and practice. This module contains: (1) an introduction (specifying the critical barriers to understanding light and vision, appearances of surfaces, and color and explaining how to use the module to overcome these barriers); (2) diagnostic test and  commentary (designed to be used as a pretest and/or posttest); (3) materials for lecture or discussion with commentary (consisting of a series of copy-ready masters for use as overhead transparencies and student handouts on light and color); (4) laboratory activities and commentary (including exercises on shadows, diffraction grating, and color shadows); and (5) problem sets (containing a problem set on light and vision and one on color). All instructional materials for the students are juxtaposed with instructor commentaries. (ML)",

A special focus is given to an analysis of the process of assimilation as it is proposed in Hugh Petrie's book, &quot;The Dilemma of Enquiry and Learning.&quot; Initially, Piaget's biological metaphor of assimilation-accommodation is reviewed and then is followed by a discussion of a new metaphor drawn from the field of cybernetics. A control systems metaphor is described and compared to the process of assimilation as a special case of rule following. It is suggested that teachers and scholars use Petrie's model of accommodation to explain both of the learning processes, for in this model the learner continually tries to fit sensory inputs into an existing set of conceptual schemes.

The prevailing notion that only pluralistic and relativist, or positivist epistemological concepts of truth adequately capture social education inquiry and products, and that claims to human action based on \"soft\" or \"fuzzy\" qualitatively-driven bases are illicit, is clearly wrong headed. What is required is a new view of conceptual schemes and frameworks that does not run the risk of either positivistic metaphysics or vicious relativism. It is argued that a meta-theory of social education inquiry that is neither absolutist nor foundational in the traditional meanings of these terms, together with an attendant conception of what is socially  useful knowledge, is capable of being constructed and followed in practice. However, this new view must grow from more sophisticated assumptions regarding what counts as wisdom rather than knowledge, who ought to inquire, and which tools of the inquiry processes are most instrumental to the generation of such wisdom, as well as what ends are appropriate for social education.

        "description":"The organization and argument of this paper on the status of economic education in American schools today are essentially summarized in four observations. They are that: (1) the current emphasis of economic education is overwhelmingly cognitive and focuses on increasing student knowledge and understanding of our economic system; (2) available evidence on the impact of cognitively oriented approaches to economic education suggests that they have no educationally significant influence on students' economic related attitudes, values, norms, dispositions, etc.; (3) it is increasingly apparent that attitudes and dispositions related to economic life are of importance to personal economic success, system maintenance, and vitality; and (4) if the above observations are correct, then one  may conclude that there is a gaping hole at the heart of economic education that needs concerned attention. The body of the paper develops these points, suggests four interpretations regarding the significance of attitude changes resulting from economics curricula, and proposes two goals of economic education, one personal and one social. The paper concludes by presenting perspectives for understanding the dynamics of normative economic socialization in schools and discusses their implications in regard to the importance of an attitudinal dimension in the planning of curricula.

        "description":"Attribution theory suggests four major explanations for behavioral outcomes: ability, effort, luck, and task-ease. The theory suggests that explanations given for an applicant's success-potential may influence evaluations of that applicant. The research indicates male and female applicants may be affected differently by gender-stereotyped descriptions, job level, and ambiguous fit between qualifications and job demands. In the study, 86 personnel and management association members rated hypothetical applicants for director and counselor in an Employee Assistance Program. All were qualified for the counselor position but none had managerial experience. A significant 3-way interaction of sex, gender of attributes, and job-level/ambiguity was found for the dependent variable luck,  but not for the other three. Raters valued nonstereotypical attributes more highly for the director when the &quot;fit&quot; between qualifications and job demands was ambiguous than for the counselor. The study does not support previous findings showing external qualities to be a female characteristic of success; rather, sex appears to interact with ambiguity of fit and gender-related attributes.

Using a constructivist-critical method of analysis, the Snygg-Combs theory of perception is shown to be lacking as foundation because of its inadequate social dimension. Next, the wide-lens view of inviting success is contrasted with the context specific model for inviting educative events. It is suggested that they are complementary. Finally, the dimensions of skills, crafts, and art are analyzed and shown to be key concepts for developing an integrated invitational theory of educational practice.

        "description":"The study tested the hypothesis that teaching high school economics concepts first in a familiar mode or symbol system and then elaborating on the concepts in a second or less familiar mode facilitates classroom learning. Using an experimental design, 83 high school seniors were randomly and individually assigned to three separate classes, which in turn were randomly assigned three different classroom instructional treatments, each having a duration of 10 hours and taught by the students' regular economics teachers. It was predicted and found that comprehension of economics is facilitated by a teaching strategy that initially presents the concepts in a familiar verbal mode and then presents them in a more abstract way using graphs or other instructional imagery. The results imply  that the type and order of presentation of symbol systems influence the learning of concepts in high school economics classes by facilitating or interfering with the generation of relationships between prior knowledge and new information. The findings also imply that presenting economics concepts in two symbol systems rather than one facilitates learning, provided, contrary to customary teaching methods, the teacher uses the familiar verbal presentation first and follows it with an integrative but less familiar graphic presentation. A 9-item list of references, the instructional treatments, and data tables are appended. (Author/TRS)",

The works of Robert Ennis, John McPeck, Harvey Siegel, and Matthew Lipman are considered to support the conclusion that though critical thinking is a ncessary condition of philosophical thinking, it is not a sufficient condition. Philosophical thinking as taught in the pre-college curriculum is characterized as the interplay of dialogue and reflection that has grown out of an initial sense of wonder. (Author/BZ)",

Teachers need to know what critical thinking is before they can successfully incorporate the skill into their teaching strategies. Understanding why critical thinking is a major goal of education in a free society helps teachers prepare students to be informed and rational participants in civic affairs and to gather enduring intellectual abilities to make themselves more effective as students. To develop skills for critical thinking requires that teachers ask challenging questions and require students to provide evidence for their answers or opinions. Encouraging students to examine different positions on controversial topics in an open supportive classroom environment prepares them for the responsibilities of  participating in a free society.

The actual procedure for applying the methodology is given in a step-by-step manner, including guidelines for teachers and implications for classroom teaching. A number of sample lessons are included. Part 1, the discovery/inquiry-oriented approach deals with determinants of family size; consequences of rapid population growth for community  health; effects on socio-economic development; effects of family size, parity, and spacing on the health of the mother and the family; and effects of population growth on food production. Part 2, values clarification, consists of 10 sample lessons and uses a variety of strategies concerning family size, and values regarding pros and cons of population control. Learning strategies described in the program expect students to approach problems with an open mind, to study evidence clearly, and to make judgements based on their own activities. (AG)",

The first section describes briefly the efforts undertaken to develop this proposal. The Center proposal is organized around four points of collaboration among scholars and practitioners. The Center would: (1) create a diverse and extensive field laboratory for research; (2) involve teacher education practitioners as collaborators in all of the research projects; (3) create research opportunities for practitioners and solicit questions of concern to them; and (4) provide research expertise to support  the research activities generated by the practitioners. A framework for knowledge-based reform is constructed around the three stages of teacher education practice: recruitment, professional development, and induction. Section two of the report details plans for executing research projects. A set of planning premises are presented. These take into consideration the following factors: (1) social change; (2) core values; (3) the nature of schooling; (4) the changing role of teachers; (5) the interagency dependence of schools and institutions of higher education; and (6) the impact of technology on all of these factors.

An assessment is given of the strengths and weaknesses of the MAT model. The MAT model appeared to be effective in attracting academically superior students. In regard to the retention in teaching and the factors that differentiated among career choices of MAT participants, the following topics are discussed: (1) who became a teacher; (2) background and training; (3) teaching experiences; (4) satisfaction with teaching?; (5) reasons for teaching; (6) reasons for leaving teaching; (7) reasons for not entering  teaching; (8) other education careers. Findings indicated that the MAT model was successful in getting its graduates into teaching. A substantial number of MATs not currently teaching in the schools continue to play a role in education through such professions as adult education, administration, research, and private consulting. Some strengths and weaknesses of the MAT model are illustrated by examining information about the model's implementation and operation. Fifty endnotes provide documentation. Appendices which make up about half the document, consist of profiles of current MAT programs and 51 supporting data tables. (JD)",

This report documents the validation of two tests of psychomotor ability against U.S. Air Force Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) performance, and development of strategies to incorporate this information into the U.S. Air Force selection system. The two tests, Two-Hand Coordination and Complex Coordination, differentiated between UPT graduates and eliminees as between fighter- and non-fighter-recommended students. This differentiation can be used through the psychomotor screening  system as an additional selection gate for UPT candidates. Three Integrated Pilot Candidate Selection Models use all available information, including psychomotor measures, to improve attrition and quality in UPT candidates and also reduce the rejection of potential graduates. These models can also be used to screen minorities and women without bias. (JD)",

The critiques present discussions on the following elements of the studies: (1) data from the literature; (2) data from the descriptive-empirical research; (3) research methodology used in the study; and (4) results. Included in the discussion are analyses of the cognitive processes of teachers in the pre-active (planning) phase, the interactive phase; and the post-interactive phase of teaching a unit of study.  A discussion is presented of results of the four studies grouped into categories: (1) substantial results; (2) methodological questions; and (3) theoretical value of the studies.

This approach is seen as being able to provide a fundamental understanding of the teacher's perspective. Understanding how teachers individually and collectively think, act, develop professionally, and change during their careers might provide new insights as to how one might approach necessary reform, change, and improvements in education. The main part of the paper attempts to illuminate the potential of this approach through descriptions of two teachers' autobiographies. An effort at collaborative interpretation of these biographies is provided to identify the nature, sources, and manner of evolution of the  special kind of thinking, action, and knowledge that pertains to their teaching. A brief comparative analysis is included to reveal similarities and differences and illustrate themes that might characterize the personal practical knowledge of other teachers. (JD)",

This change is analyzed by looking in both the earlier and later periods at three different elements that defined the position of these teachers--the status of high school teachers in relation to the rest of the teaching force, the method used in recruiting these teachers, and the degree of autonomy that they exercised in governing the high school. The discussion is based on a case study of a prominent early high school for boys, the Central High School of Philadelphia (1841-1907), and draws on a variety of archival  sources--including faculty meeting minutes, faculty biographies (compiled by an early historian of the school), and annual reports.

        "description":"It is proposed in this paper that the goals of teacher education programs should include not only the acquistion of knowledge and skills, but also a class of outcomes called \"dispositions.\" A disposition is defined as an attribution which summarizes the trend of a teacher's actions across similar contexts. The construct is descriptive and classificatory rather than explanatory. For example, a teacher who uses praise in specific contexts and on many occasions might be attributed a \"supportive disposition.\" Because of what is known about the relative stability of human behavior, the summary of the trends of a teacher's behavior, fundamentally descriptive, can also serve as a basis for predicting future trends of behavior. The proposal to include dispositions among the goals of  teacher education is intended to focus upon behaviors of teachers related to teaching in the classroom. Arguments for this proposal include discussions on: (1) disposition versus habit and attitudes; (2) the potential benefits of dispositional goals; and (3) the potential risks of over-emphasizing skills. The discussions include noting the problems and difficulties of identification and assessment of dispositions and suggestions on overcoming these problems. (JD)",

The following unsubstantiated assumptions (or \"myths\") are discussed: (1) pay teachers and they will teach better; (2) competition among teachers for career advancement and higher pay is a sound way to improve the quality of their service; (3) promotions and  incentive pay will keep good teachers in teaching; (4) career ladders will encourage teachers to improve; (5) career ladders and incentive pay will attract more academically talented people into teaching; (6) teachers who are promoted up career ladders can evaluate other teachers for promotion; (7) since almost everyone can recall at least one great teacher, the characteristics of great teachers are easy to identify; (8) the scores students make on tests are a good measure of teacher effectiveness; (9) an effective teacher is equally effective in all settings; and (10) good teachers are born not made.

It is suggested that, rather than telling novices not to &quot;teach by the book,&quot; teacher educators need to consider contextual constraints and the limits of beginners' knowledge and skills and teach beginning elementary teachers how to learn from using published curricular materials. These issues are explored by addressing four questions: (1) What did the teacher education programs convey about textbooks, planning, and curricular decision  making? (2) What did the prospective teachers come to believe about the use of textbooks, about planning, and curricular decision making? (3) What did the student teachers do with textbooks and teachers' guides during student teaching? and (4) What should preservice elementary teacher education programs teach beginning teachers about textbooks and their role in planning and teaching?

Section one provides an introduction to the reform movement and to performance-based pay initiatives; a definition of terms; a brief discussion of funding sources; a discussion of compensation strategies; a description of the theoretical basis for conceptions of the work of teaching; and a discussion of the organizational context in which all incentive plans must function. The second section offers a brief historical perspective on the current situation and a discussion of teachers' salaries and the &quot;benefits package&quot; associated with teaching; it also offers a review of the conditions that make a teaching career less attractive to those who have the  option to choose another profession. In section three, a discussion is presented on the theoretical and practical issues concerning performance evaluation. The section deals with: product- and prcess-oriented evaluation and the issues of reliability and validity of both; rater bias and the selection and training of evaluators; the use of student-achievement measures; and the effects of performance evaluations on minority teachers. Section four presents problems experienced in previous programs; four major incentive strategies and assumptions on which each is based; a set of steps for planning and implementing a performance-based incentive plan; and a brief review of some of the legal issues involved in such plans. The final section presents a summary of experiences, and the lessons  learned from those experiences in a number of districts and states that are involved in the implementation of some form of incentive plan. Eight pages of references are appended. (JD)",

Physical education programs became strongly entrenched within the higher education curriculum with the sanction of college administrators who recognized a responsibility to college students for their physical health as well as their mental growth. The changing emphasis in the physical education curriculum from formal health-oriented calisthenics to programs offering development of lifetime sport skills is discussed, as well as the societal pressures that brought about these changes. In chapter 2, the current status of the basic instruction program in physical education in institutions of higher education in  the United States is described. A discussion is presented on the problem of whether the physical education program in a college or university should consist of required or elective courses. Questions on tenure for physical education faculty, financing the athletic program, credits given toward graduation, and the general design of the physical education program are also considered. The final chapter offers reflections on the future of physical education on college campuses. It is pointed out that at present there is no consensus on the goal-orientation of physical education programs. The future direction of physical education may either be toward developing skills for the enjoyment of individual lifetime sports, or toward an emphasis upon health education and physical fitness.

The test items may be computer-generated from strategies programmed by test constructors, or pre-constructed by item writers and stored in computer memory. The tests formulated may be administered interactively by the computer or as paper and pencil tests. Studies dealing with computer applications in item construction, item banking, test design, and test administration (both adaptive and nonadaptive) are grouped for review in four sections: (1) theoretical and philosophical propositions; (2) applications and implementations; (3) evaluation and research; and (4) prospects for the future and implications  for educational testing. It is concluded that while there have been many attempts to utilize computers for test construction, actual successful, large scale applications are relatively few. Most of these simply use computers to replace pencil and paper tests or human labor. With the exception of adaptive testing, there is little documentation to show that the quality of assessment processes is improved by computer utilization. However, with continuing rapid technological developments to overcome current computer limitations, and with attention to measurement quality, the future of computer-assisted test construction should be very bright.

The service analyzes test score and criterion data supplied by the college and produces a report based on the data. The college can use the information to establish decision rules for placing students into courses or to counsel individual students in their selection of courses. The MAP Placement Research Service report consists entirely of tables, is organized by groups of  students, and includes the score distributions of all predictors and criteria and the intercorrelations of all predictors and criteria in each group of students. The user can request a series of detailed analyses of the relationship between particular predictors and criteria. For each analysis, the user specifies the group of students, the predictor or predictors, and the criterion measure. Tables, smoothing procedures, and sample sizes are discussed.

Goals were to develop a reliable survey that: (1) could be administered for fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-graders in a group setting; (2) would provide a profile of children's declarative knowledge of strategies for classroom learning; and (3) would show good external and discriminant validity. Two pilot samples, one of 21 fifth-graders and one of 45 sixth-graders, participated in the initial skill construction. Based on results from the pilot administration, the questionnaire was revised to a survey of 48 items across instructional situations. A validation sample consisted of 194 subjects drawn from three grade levels in four schools in Indiana and Michigan. The  revised LSQ was administered along with a battery of other scales to 194 elementary students, 51 high school students, and 122 classroom teachers enrolled in a summer graduate course in education at Purdue University. The LSQ showed good reliability and validity with elementary and high school students, and with classroom teachers. Subscale scores were found to be related to age, achievement level, and motivational orientation. Results are discussed in terms of both the development of strategy knowledge and the role of personal goals and values. Directions for future use of the LSQ as a research tool are suggested. A four-page list of references and data tables are appended. (LMO)",

        "description":"The study investigates differences in learning styles as measured by the Learning Style Inventory (LSI), an instrument designed to identify sociological, emotional, environmental, and physiological factors that form an individual's learning style. The subjects for the study were a sample of fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-graders in a midwestern elementary school. The students were divided into three groups according to their achievement scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. A series of one-way analyses of variance was conducted with scores on the LSI as the dependent variables and achievement category as the independent variables. Post hoc comparisons were completed as needed using the protected t-test. The findings support the previous findings that students do manifest  significant variations in how they prefer to learn in a classroom setting. The average achievers did not display a significant preference for a particular learning style, while the high and low achievers did. The high achievers were more independent and motivated than other students, and they indicated significantly fewer physical needs than the others. No significant differences were indicated for global factors of sociological needs, emotionality and immediate environment. Based on the results of this study, teaching strategies could be developed to potentially enhance learning of the different achievement groups. (JAZ)",

        "description":"According to the classical working memory perspective, tasks such as command and control decision-making should be performed less effectively if extraneous material must be retained in short-term memory. Only marginal support for this prediction was obtained for a simulation involving scheduling trucking and transportation missions, although robust memory loading did occur in the case of more abstract tasks. This pattern of results is not consistent with the classical single system view of working memory, and suggests that working memory may have multiple subsystems. Apparently, some memory demands can be isolated from the memory system used to accomplish the trucking and transportation task. Increased understanding of the nature of working memory subsystems and of isolation of  task components into separate subsystems should aid in design of command and control task environments.

        "description":"High rates of attrition among students in Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT) is a major concern for Air Training Command. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the Basic Navigator Battery (BNB), a multi-test experimental selection instrument, for its potential to increase the validity of the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) in predicting attrition among students in UNT. Three selection models were evaluated against four UNT performance standards. The three models consisted of AFOQT Nav-Tech composite score only (Model I), AFOQT Nav-Tech composite score plus other AFOQT composite scores (Model II), and AFOQT Nav-Test composite score, other AFOQT composite scores and BNB subtest scores (Model III). The four measures of UNT performance were training  outcome, average classroom lesson score, average simulator lesson score, and average flying lesson score. Model III was found to have the highest predictive accuracy for all four performance standards; it also identified more unqualified candidates. It was concluded that BNB is useful in reducing UNT attrition through improved selection. Further research is suggested for better estimates of the stability and the validity of the test. The specific findings are illustrated in eight tables. (JAZ)",

Questionnaires were completed by 1,037 sixth-graders, 2,265 secondary school students (mostly 11th-graders), and 109 school staff members. Forty-five elementary schools and 105 high schools were sampled, representing the lowest, middle, and highest scores on the California Assessment Program's mathematics tests. The three questionnaires are presented, with a summary of responses to each item. The results indicated that the reported incidence of cheating was much higher among high school students than sixth-graders. Sixth-graders most often reported copying on tests and  plagiarizing. High school students reported use of crib notes and copying during tests. About 93 percent of high school students reported seeing other students cheating on tests more than once. More cheating was reported by students from high-scoring schools, and students with lower grades cheated more. School staff reporting that cheating was a significant problem included 41 percent of secondary school staff and 3 percent in elementary schools. Appendices include the questionnaires and percentile responses. (GDC)",

Early in 1985, NCES began a thorough review of its data collection program. The purpose of the review was to address questions of the suitability, scope, reliability, and timeliness of statistical data in terms of the purposes those data serve, relative to instructional and administrative needs and relative to education policy issues. To initiate the dialogue, a number of individuals and organizations were invited to prepare a paper following guidelines provided by NCES. Individuals invited were likely to (1) use quantitative approaches in their analyses, and thus be data users, and (2) have the interest and time to produce a&quot;thought paper,&quot; not a research paper. There was no intent to represent known positions or to provide balanced representations across sectors of the education community. Organizations were selected because of an identification with education issues and concerns. The results of these efforts may well be the design of a new plan for national data collections from institutions and individuals to be implemented over several years. A total of 38 individual papers, 16 organization papers, and 3 agency papers are included in this volume. (LMO)",

Current NCES practices and their limitations are discussed, additional data needs for research and policymaking are identified, and modifications for data collection are suggested. Teachers are viewed as one aspect of educational resources for which finances are allocated. Current NCES financial data collection, which includes the Common Core of Data (CCD) State Fiscal Report and Public School District Finance Report, distinguish the sources of revenue and the types of services supported. State data are reported in the Condition of Education and Digest of Education Statistics. Problems with these reports include the time  lag before publication, the lack of published data on school district-level expenses and revenue, and the changes in data categories used, with decreasing detail. This makes it difficult to relate expenditure data to information about resources. NCES has collected very little data on teachers, even though concerns about teacher quality, compensation, and supply and demand are high. Inter-school district comparative data are badly needed. Suggestions for improvement include compilation of state-by-state data on teacher characteristics, construction of a general database, study of teacher pay systems, and longitudinal studies. (GDC)",

Data and analyses are needed in such areas as the supply of scientific and computer personnel to determine oversupplies or shortages, and the relationship of corporate training to other sources of education. It would also be advisable to examine the assumptions underlying federal job training and retraining programs; perhaps retraining is not necessary if the problem is really lack of jobs or low wages. It is not necessarily true that an occupation requires a particular set of job skills and training; skills may be interchangeable, and training may come from a variety of sources. Although this type of research should be conducted in  laboratory experiments or observational studies, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and other agencies can provide longitudinal data on sources, amount, and subjects of training, and characteristics of work experience. The second part of the paper discusses the need for data to study teachers and teacher quality. NCES should play a central role in data collection.

Schools will have to provide certain functions which were traditionally provided by the home and the community. Based on this premise, there are implications for the functioning of schools and for the kinds of data needed to evaluate school effectiveness and to guide school policy. When a society changes outside the school, it is necessary for the schools to change, also. School success has traditionally been associated with strong families and strong communities. Changing social situations have lessened the community's ability to provide support for the schools; therefore, schools must modify their activities. Schools can either strengthen and rebuild  the supporting social structures, by increasing parental involvement and strengthening community structure, or they can provide school activities which build compensatory social structures. Implications for data collection by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) involve measuring social structure and its relation to school; measuring school policies relevant to social structure; and using NCES data to augment parental resources.

Major test scores, such as those obtained from the American College Testing Program and the Scholastic Aptitude Test should not be used to compare and contrast state achievement, since these tests were not designed for that purpose. The limits of the test instruments should appear in publications dealing with results of such tests. The following principles are suggested to guide NCES in data collection activity: (1) the data should be useful to federal, state  and local policymakers or decision-makers; (2) the amount of data and number indicators should be limited to that which can be stored and analyzed within three months and reported to policymakers within the year; and (3) data should be drawn from sample rather than total populations. The National Assessment of Educational Progress is federally funded, and one option for including state assessments is to add funds to the contract. Two of the major concerns would be: (1) the cost of the expanded survey; and (2) timeliness of the reports. (JAZ)",

Spotty evidence about two recent trends have produced a waft of legislation concerning teacher education, certification, and compensation across the United States. The first consists of data suggesting that the academic ability of those choosing to teach may be declining; the second suggests that the number of prospective teachers will soon be insufficient to meet the demand for new teachers. The data available are inadequate to firmly establish the existence or magnitude of these trends. Projecting teacher supply requires knowledge of at least three sources of potential supply: (1) the number of current teachers expected to remain in teaching; (2) the  number of college graduates expected to choose teaching as their initial occupation; and (3) the number of individuals qualified to teach who are currently not teaching but might return to teaching. Data on teaching variables if gathered from teachers sampled in clusters by school and district and, if combined with administrative data on policies and school/student characteristics, would allow analysis of how policy and environmental factors influence teaching practice; how teacher characteristics--including qualifications and experience in the teaching area--influence practice; and how practices change over time.

        "description":"Three goals must be met in order for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to improve the quality and utility of its data collection: (1) the choice of what to collect must be driven by the questions of interest to decisionmakers and the public; (2) procedures must insure validity and reliability of the data; and (3) the data must be reported in ways that facilitate use by the intended audience. The reliability of the data reported is the biggest challenge facing NCES. Careful choices about what to collect and clear reporting cannot compensate for inaccuracy. Reporting data should include the following points: (1) description of similarities and discrepancies from different sources; (2) indication of how various sources were used, when applicable; (3) precise  descriptions of what the numbers represent and interpretations of how their known weakness influence the results; (4) knowledgeable interpretation of data; (5) methods of reporting which minimize inappropriate comparisons; (6) full and accurate citation of data sources; and (7) inclusion of a glossary to help readers. NCES should investigate the use of minicomputers for different kinds of assessment instruments and should begin to design a computerized data collection system utilizing telecommunications capability. Comments on &quot;Indicators of Education Status and Trends&quot; are listed with page references. (JAZ)",

The concerns involve the roles performed by school personnel and the effect of student characteristics on achievement. Obtaining accurate measures of school district personnel--how many, what type, and what they do--is difficult. However, measures of this type of process, particularly administrative efforts, are important. In general, educational institutions tend to respond in symbolic ways to community needs--by hiring a director of evaluation, for example--but in ways that have very little effect on the actual productivity of a system. It is important to observe administrative effort during times of reform or declining enrollments. Improvements are also needed in the  categories used to collect data on school personnel and in the ways in which school staff really spend their time. As for the comparison of private and public schools, data collection has previously focused on students' output, or achievement. Research efforts should examine whether public and private school families are different before entering private schools, or whether the choice of private schooling fosters certain attitudes, values, and behavior.

Ways to develop self-esteem and creativity in the classroom should be studied, including the effects of teachers' affective attributes and teaching behaviors.

A model for conceptualizing the sources and processes of school productivity is presented. The Learning Productivity Model suggests that school outcomes are the consequence of the interaction of five factors: (1) clarity of educational objectives; (2) student characteristics; (3) curriculum technology and instructional strategies; (4) teacher quality; and (5) school environment--opportunity and resources. The importance of educational research is stressed for its ability to identify what types of data are relevant in studying effective schools. The model considers a variety of educational outcomes, both academic achievement and lifetime  outcomes or post-school experiences such as occupational success. Two suggestions for data collection are discussed. New data should be used to relate educational processes to educational outcomes, as in the High School and Beyond study. Better coordination of data collection activities is recommended. (GDC)",

The social organization of an effective school promotes school-wide conditions for teaching and learning: clear academic and behavioral goals, discipline, high expectations, teacher efficacy, caring, rewards, leadership, and community support. Instruction and curricular conditions involve time on task, homework, student evaluation, variety of teaching strategies, and student responsibility. The cumulative, or synergistic, effects of these  characteristics may be very significant; a critical mass of these conditions is labelled organizational efficacy. Further research is needed in order to identify the contributions of each of these factors or combinations of them in successful schools. (GDC)",

State and local education agencies often report that data requests from federal agencies represent an administrative burden, especially when they are not an expected part of the personnel workload. Educators may not know why the data are relevant or needed, and may fear that releasing complete data might result in a compliance review, a lawsuit, or embarrassment to the school district or state when it is compared to other school districts or states. There are a number of ways to manage or reduce resistance to providing data, which would be appropriate for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES): (1) reduce the data reporting burden by sampling  only a portion of local education agencies; (2) employ contractors rather than agencies to conduct the surveys; (3) distribute useful reports from the surveys to the participants; (4) enlist Congressional support; (5) reduce the number of surveys conducted by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR); and (6) approach and negotiate with chief state school officers individually, not as a group.

Teachers play the central role in the education enterprise, and it follows that data about teachers rank among the most important sets of information needed for making decisions about reforms in policy and practice. Federal government is the single largest source of support available for research and development, and policy setters need a simplified and readily available summary of the areas of education receiving federal investments, along with  comparative data on how those investments have changed over time. The five aspects of schooling process mentioned are: textbooks, allocation of instructional time, utilization of resources from business and industry, the use of computers, and out-of-school opportunities for learning.

Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and American College Test (ACT) scores should be published by state alongside an adjusted set of scores that takes into account the influences of participation rates, family income and private school attendance. International Association for Evaluation of Education Achievement cross-national test comparisons should receive continued financial support. A uniform  method for calculating dropout rates should be implemented. Datasets are needed that provide detailed information on children's schooling as well as information on post-schooling careers and income paths. Data on teaching should be collected, including: (1) an annual comparison of salaries in teaching with those of other occupations; (2) information on SAT scores of college graduates entering teaching; and (3) teacher mobility patterns. Data on capital account expenditures should be examined in regard to use and cost. Data should be collected on private and for-profit schools. (LMO)",

Section I recommends that NCES should: (1) explicitly consider moving beyond the collection of data on schooling to the collection of data on education; (2) conduct a longitudinal study of students in the elementary, middle-school, and junior high school grades; (3) pay greater attention to the collection of data on school processes; (4) organize the systematic collection of data on student performance on employer sponsored tests; (5) devote greater attention to those educational  organizations that serve preschool youngsters; (6) put in place a process for ensuring that its large-scale data collection efforts can be linked with more micro-level studies; (7) work with a few states to develop pilot state level data bases related to significant issues; and (8) maintain an awareness of emerging technologies for the transmission and communication of data to relevant groups of users. Section II comments on the six current NCES surveys: Private School Survey, Public School Survey, Recent Survey of College Graduates, Survey of Teacher Demand and Shortage, High School and Beyond, and Library and Media Center Survey.

Federal data collection concerned with resources should identify the state as the unit of analysis, should broaden the definition of resources beyond revenues and expenditures to include people, time and curriculum, and should provide data on resource allocation and use within districts as well as resource distribution across districts. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) should continue to collect state aggregate revenue and expenditure data, and revenue and expenditure data for a representative sample of districts, where the sample is representative of each of the 50 states  as well as the United States as a whole. More detailed data on human resources in the education system are needed not only because policy interest is forging a tighter connection between dollars and what they purchase, but also because interest in the human resource component of education is high. Time and curriculum are the other two categories of resources into which revenues are converted, and some aggregate data on these two variables are needed. (LMO)",

The relevance, technical quality and utility of the data could be improved by collaborating with other large organizations, such as several of the Educational Research and Development Centers that will soon be funded by the National  Institute of Education (NIE). NCES might collaborate with the following Centers: (1) NIE Center on Teacher Quality and Effectiveness to gather data from the teachers' perspective on working conditions and factors that affect teachers' decisions; (2) NIE Center on Student Testing, Evaluation, and Standards to develop and refine tests that measure higher level cognitive skills; and (3) NIE Centers on Effective Elementary Schools and Effective Secondary Schools to collect time and observational data on what students are actually doing and learning in classrooms.

The main questions raised at the preprimary level pertain to availability of programs, standards, and family-school interaction. At the elementary/secondary level, the policy debate revolves around questions relating to educational improvement, resources effectiveness, and equity. National data bases provide little help in answering these questions, and the quality of data varies. At the higher education level, data sources are considered as they pertain to student aid, efficiency, educational value, and role of higher education. The following recommendations are made for improving the  national data: (1) eliminate low priority data items; (2) identify and fill information gaps on a priority basis in areas of major policy interest; (3) establish an office of quality control; (4) give highest priority to improving quality of elementary/secondary education data; (5) modernize procedures for data collection; (6) investigate the feasibility of linking the most costly data collection systems in the Department of Education; (7) initiate discussions with representatives of other agencies to coordinate data collection; (8) in developing questionnaires, consider those variables that have been shown to be most important to outcomes; (9) establish an education data bank to improve survey consistency across data bases and over time; and (10) keep expectations high.

        "description":"The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), in its expansion of data reporting, should consider approaches for studying the curricular content of elementary and secondary instruction and student achievement of curricular goals. More specific information is needed about the curricular content of U.S. education. For example, data collected on the average years of high school mathematics studied do not indicate what proportion of graduates have studied algebra, trigonometry, or calculus, or which skills have been mastered. This information would be useful for college and vocational planners, for program evaluation and planning, and for fiscal accountability. Better data on curriculum and achievement would also allow comparisons across educational agencies and their programs  and comparisons across time to assess trends. Data on instructional content and methods could include courses of study, enrollment, major skills taught, local and state guidelines, teaching methods, teacher qualifications, and supervisor role. Testing of students' mastery of instructional content should involve different difficulty levels, the full breadth of content, and different types of achievement sought by different teaching methods. Problems which are likely to be encountered in designing these new data collection activities involve: agreement among the interested parties; public perception of burden and expense; inappropriate comparisons; and diverse educational goals.

Working conditions enhancing teacher commitment, retention, and teaching effectiveness are examined across a wide range of studies. Teacher rewards, teacher certainty and skill development are considered as variables affecting teacher commitment. Teacher evaluation, buffering, managing student behavior, teacher isolation, faculty collaboration, participation in decision-making, and organizational rigidity and flexibility are discussed as organizational determinants of teacher commitment. Other major points discussed are standards  for student learning and career ladders. Some states have begun to set skill-specific standards and learning sequences that all teachers must cover in the curriculum. Periodic testing of students is used to monitor the conformity to new standards. However, use of minimum competency tests can result in unintended negative consequences and lowered teacher commitment. Career ladder plans offer teachers increased salaries and status in return for additional responsibilities. A five-page bibliography is appended. (JAZ)",

The critical issues include the equal importance of equity and excellence as goals of American education. Several phenomena related to the goals of equity and excellence are discussed, including bilingual education, private schools, use of computers in schools, drop-outs, and the transition from school to work. A second major issue is the development of students  from childhood through adolescence. Developmental issues include longitudinal studies, especially of elementary school children, preprimary school programs, and adolescent development.

In the input stage of the educational system the indicators would be: amount of time allocated to education, content, standards and expectations, teaching as a practice and as a profession, and leadership and support. Factors identified in the output stage are achievement and retention. There are certain kinds of information which are essential for defining variables but not available, such as: number of  students who know basic academic concepts, achievement of students compared to students in other countries, ability of students to solve complex problems, trends in measuring educational achievements, and trends in achievement facing different challenges.

        "description":"The value of statistical research depends on valid comparisons which can usefully influence educational policy. Educational research needs to extend the measures of learning (such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress) through nationally-calibrated absolute measures and through computer-assisted and adaptive testing. Direct sampling by computer would make educational polls and national assessment faster and less expensive. A national bureau of educational standards might be founded to collect, coordinate, calibrate, archive, analyze, synthesize, and make available the data that is needed to improve educational productivity. Nine factors promoting efficiency and productivity of learning are classified in three broad categories: (1) student aptitude, including ability,  development, and motivation; (2) instruction, including amount of time students engage in learning and quality of instructional experience; and (3) environmental factors, such as home climate, classroom social group, peer group, and television viewing. The tables in the appendix illustrate the effect of productivity factors on achievement revealed by quantitative syntheses carried out by a number of investigators in Australia, Canada and the United States during the past decade.

Research and educational practice support the contention that information on learning environments or conditions can enhance innovative program development, school implementation, and strategic planning. Research on the learning environment has studied productivity factors involving the interaction between students, instruction, and environment and the characteristics of instruction which are adaptive to student differences. In addition, it is important to gather information on learning processes as outcomes of  effective schooling. Schools need to be more effective in creating environments that foster basic skills development as well as preparing every individual to make the educational, occupational, and professional choices that each person deserves. The National Center for Education Statistics data base could include these indicators of learning outcomes: students' use of resources, study strategies, use of specific lesson materials, learning behaviors, motivation, and self-concept.

Social and communicative competence are important achievements of the school-age years and are heavily influenced by classroom experiences. Academic, social, and communicative achievements are interrelated. To expand descriptions of students' achievement and competence in the classrooms, a model is presented. The effective speaker, who is successful in communicating with others, receives appropriate responses to requests. Appropriate speakers have been found to produce effective responses and to have the highest achievement test scores in reading and mathematics. The  communicative climate of the classroom may help to encourage individual differences in achievement. To measure social and communicative competence, direct classroom observation is suggested. One could assess social problem solving, effective communication, moral reasoning, understanding of social relationships, and self-concept. It is also important to observe communication in the small instructional classroom group: (1) conditions under which the student successfully requests and obtains information; (2) variety of attempts to obtain information; and (3) response when information is not obtained. Assessment of young children is encouraged. (GDC)",

This report was contracted by the U.S. Department of Education's Center for Statistics as a &quot;10-year plan&quot; of data collection to satisfy the statements made by writers submitting papers to the Center's Redesign Project and appearing in the &quot;Synthesis of Invited Papers,&quot; and is intended as a companion to that volume. The current data system is flawed in fundamental ways; it does not provide the kinds of information needed to understand the context, processes, and outcomes of schooling in the United States. These kinds of  information are now being demanded by policy-makers as well as by the general citizenry. The proposed national data system is designed to provide essential information for policy-makers in all branches and at various levels of government as well as new constituencies. The structure of the proposed national data system, as well as specific categories and subcategories of data have been identified in the report, and the types of costs and distribution of costs likely to be incurred in developing and maintaining the proposed national data system are enumerated.

        "description":"The Mantel-Haenszel procedure (MH) is a practical, inexpensive, and powerful way to detect test items that function differently in two groups of examinees. MH is a natural outgrowth of previously suggested chi square methods, and it is also related to methods based on item response theory. The study of items that function differently for two groups of examinees, originally called item bias research, focuses on the fact that different groups of examinees may react differently to the same test question. The preferred, more neutral, term is differential item functioning (DIF). In studying DIF, members of the focal group and the reference group should be comparable. The item data may be arranged into 2 x 2 tables. Chi square procedures test a hypothesis, but do not produce a  parametric measure of the amount of DIF exhibited by the studied item. The MH chi square test provides a measure of the size of the departure of the data from the null hypothesis. The data are presented in 2 x 2 tables, and the measure of DIF is in the scale of differences in item difficulty as measured in Educational Testing Services delta scale. MH is significantly less expensive to use than item response analyses. (GDC)",

With the increase use of computerized adaptive test (CAT), the ability to determine the accuracy of calibrated item parameter estimates is paramount. The first method applies a normalizing transformation to the logistic residuals to make them more interpretable. The second method translates residuals directly into a loss of information statistic. Both methods require a CAT simulation to accurately assess the ability range over which an item would most likely be chosen. Results suggest that the lack of fit in the logistic regression should not be a major concern in developing a CAT item pool. Suggestions for further research are made. (Author)",

A second major question facing those interested in teaching and testing thinking skills involves whether such skills should be taught and tested as a separate subject area or embedded and infused in existing subject matter. The paper by Michael H. Kean offers a concise treatment of the major questions facing those who would embark on the teaching and testing of higher order thinking skills. Edward D. Roeber and Betty L. Stevens describe the activities in Michigan  during the planning and development stage for testing higher order skills, and outline the alternative approaches being considered by state level decision makers. Joan Boykoff Baron's paper provides an analysis of Connecticut's experiences in implementing a higher order thinking skills component in an ongoing assessment program.

The specific ideas and examples in the handbook are derived from the experiences of Follow Through Program sites in New York City, which included health services, social services, guidance and psychological services, and nutrition services. The main body of the handbook consists of five sections which outline program development: (1) Needs Assessment (identifying the problems and needs to be addressed by the program); (2) Program Design (planning  service delivery and management strategies for addressing these needs); (3) Program Implementation (operating the program based on clearly specified program objectives); (4) Program Monitoring (determining whether the program is being implemented efficiently and effectively and is meeting its service delivery and management objectives); and (5) Interagency Cooperation (forming linkages with other agencies and programs for the sharing and exchanging of ideas and resources). The handbook also presents a case study of non-instructional services in the Follow Through Project, a workbook containing worksheets and a checklist for each stage of program development, and an extensive annotated bibliography. Charts, tables, and other illustrative material are included to provide a capsule view of  the program development process and to present examples of the concepts and activities being discussed.

        "description":"Since 1978, Federal policy has sought to encourage the development of local comprehensive service programs for pregnant and parenting adolescents through demonstration grants, research, and dissemination of information about exemplary program models. The prevailing interventive model used is based on the development of local and comprehensive medical, social, and educational services. Material prerequisites for implementing the comprehensive services model include a pre-existing social welfare infrastructure, flexible funding sources, and support from State policies and funds. Managerial resources required include leadership, coordination, community acceptance, and political support. The consequences of this approach were assessed in a study of how local comprehensive programs  were developed in ten communities in four States. The assessment found many of the prerequisites for program development to be lacking in many localities. Funding mechanisms exacerbate resource disparities among communities. A more effective Federal policy would seek to compensate for differences in local capacity, eliminate service gaps, support local planning and coordination, and give emphasis to prevention. (KH)",

        "description":"The implications of a mandatory pupil assignment desegregation plan for the racial composition of the School District of Philadelphia are assessed in this report. The first section of the report reviews desegregation literature relating to mandatory pupil assignment. Virtually all of the research indicates that mandatory white reassignments significantly accelerate white flight, but the magnitude of white flight is dependent upon demography, geography, program choices, and attitudes. The second section of the report presents new findings on the desegregation attitudes and program choices of parents in six selected elementary schools in the Philadelphia School District. Among the factors considered in the analysis were: parents' race, level of education, and desegregation  condition of their child's school. The three school desegregation conditions present in the district at the time of the survey were: (1) schools with voluntary desegregation programs; (2) schools identified for pairing to achieve desegregation; and (3) schools neither experiencing nor being considered for desegregation. Among the major findings reported are the following: parents are generally in favor of school desegregation and district programs and services; voluntary desegregation strategies are favored by the majority of parents; the quality of education in the school was characterized as being more important than desegregation; and parents were overwhelmingly pleased with the schools their children attend. The report concludes that the basic result of a mandatory plan would be  increased white flight. Survey results are presented in tabular form in an appendix. (KH)",

        "description":"The Philadelphia School District's desegregation expansion strategy seeks to achieve and maintain a diverse student population in 117 desegregated schools through providing incentives for voluntary student transfers. One type of transfer is the EH36, which occurs when a student wishes to transfer between a neighborhood school and another open enrollment school. During the 1984-1985 school year, parents who requested EH36 return to neighborhood school transfers were interviewed by telephone. Reasons for returning to neighborhood schools varied. Some parents cited more than one reason, and decisions to return were also dependent on the grade organization of a child's school and the time of year a request was made. Parents' reasons for requesting EH36 fell into six general  categories: (1) curriculum or coursework; (2) student dislike of the school; (3) administrative; (4) transportation; (5) family; and (6) physical or emotional health of students. The other type of transfer is the EH38, a process utilized for transfers into those schools having special admissions requirements. The greatest reason for a transfer request cited by parents of children in special admission high schools concerned the difficulty or unsuitability of coursework. Transportation problems were the most cited in comprehensive high schools and junior/middle and elementary schools. The implications of these findings are clear: fewer parents and students will opt out of the voluntary transfer program if: (1) the transportation system operates more smoothly; (2) supportive services for  students who dislike the new school are in place; and (3) students are given a realistic perception of the programs and schools they are considering. The district's ability to limit resegregation is related directly to the support it is willing to give to this effort. (KH)",

        "description":"In October 1983, the School District of Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission signed a memorandum of understanding that resulted in a Modified Desegregation Plan. The plan itself consisted of three complementary initiatives: (1) an educational improvement component promising systemwide educational reforms, specialized programs, and a comprehensive school improvement project for the district's 75 lowest achieving schools; (2) a desegregation expansion strategy promising racially balanced faculties, programs within desegregated schools to foster integration, and the targeting of 50 additional schools for desegregation; and (3) an effort to reduce racial isolation promising augmented curricular units focusing on multicultural and interpersonal understandings  for students remaining in racially isolated schools, an increase in shared time/shared facility programs, and a citywide mobilization of public and private agencies to support the schools. Philadelphia has made a genuine effort to have concurrent desegregation and school improvement, although in some areas these efforts conflict. The successful desegregated school is a coordination of many different elements involving nearly every important feature of organizational behavior: motivation, decision making, intergroup and interpersonal conflict, cooperation and communication. The district's plan is being carefully monitored by the Pennsylvania State Human Relations Commission. (MCK)",

Currently four major socioeconomic trends point not only to widened knowledge gaps in the future but also to greater divisions between higher and lower socioeconomic status (SES) groups. First, a long-term trend toward a more educated population appears to be reversing, as evidence suggests a decline in the availability and quality of education opportunities. Second, changes in occupational structure, urban ecology, and the structure of the national economy have made it more difficult for lower SES groups to qualify for many information and industrial jobs. Third, families in higher SES groups are much more likely to increase their socioeconomic resources than are  families in lower SES groups as women continue to enter the labor force. And fourth, the acquisition and use of the new computer-based mass media are most likely to occur among higher SES groups, creating an unequal distribution of information-seeking resources. These socioeconomic trends raise many questions in the areas of equity; meeting the needs of a large, relatively immobile, poorly educated and low-skilled population; increasing socioeconomic disparities; and mismatches between distributions of blue-collar jobs and residences of blue-collar workers.

The quantitative phase of the project had two parts. First, telephone interviews, lasting 20 minutes on the average, were completed with adults. Then, during the second part, respondents were asked to complete a questionnaire mailed to them at home. Findings identified two groups of people as being especially critical of newspapers. One was a segment of the population with  relatively higher education and income than other people surveyed, greater knowledge of news coverage, and greater propensity to act when angered by media content. They were disportionately Republican and conservative. The second group was a segment of the population with relatively low education and income, less knowledge of media, and less likelihood of taking action when provoked by media content. This group was particularly likely to be confused by newspaper policies on separation of fact and opinion and to have serious problems with media credibility.

The first technique is addition, characterized by using the connecting word \"and\" to join two or more base sentences together. The second technique is called \"embedding,\" and is characterized by putting parts of two or more base sentences together without the use of \"and.\" The third technique is \"coordination,\" which joins two equally important base sentences together using one of four grammatical elements: coordinating conjunctions, a semicolon, a semicolon with a conjunctive adverb, or a correlative conjunction. The final technique, \"subordination,\" involves combining two or more base sentences to emphasize a dependence of one upon the other, by using a subordinating  conjunction, relative connectors, or prepositions. There are five signaling devices that can be used to direct students' attention to key points in the text where sentence combining can occur: arrows, umbrella signals, margin signals, footnote signals, and boxes.

This is followed by a brief description of the pioneering work begun by L. M. Terman in 1921 on the characteristics of gifted children and the long-term consequences of giftedness. The criteria used to identify the two kinds of gifted students are then discussed as well as the need to concentrate on specific  curricular measures. The paper concludes with eight strategies of action--four for identifying the gifted and talented student and four addressing curricular concerns. (HOD)",

Next, the digest discusses how speaking skills are assessed, explaining observational and structured approaches and their respective rating systems, and touching on the effects of rater reliability. The digest also discusses how listening skills are assessed, expanding on  the three important elements in all listening tests: the listening stimuli, the questions used, and the test environment. Finally, the digest explores how assessment instruments should be selected or designed, noting that selection depends upon the purpose for the assessment, and providing guidelines for various purposes.

        "description":"A study applied an associative coding model to discern how emotions experienced during television commercials affect the strength and content of viewer memory for the commercials. Subjects, 25 males and 49 females enrolled at a large midwestern university, tested the model. Emotion was indexed by having viewers continuously turn a dial as they watched four categories of emotional messages: neutral, positive, negative, and poignant. Memory was indexed by the probability of recall and the content of the recall protocols. Following recall, subjects indicated how much they liked the commercials. Results showed that emotional commercials were more likely to be recalled and generated more retrieval of executional information, descriptive words, and inferences than neutral commercials.  Emotional commercials were also liked better. Only in repetitions of product category and in generating product characteristics did neutral commercials out-perform emotional ones. Results suggest that a model of episodic memory detailed enough to include emotional events will yield a better picture of how people process television messages. Advertising messages can thus be more accurately designed to meet goals formulated in a marketing plan. (DF)",

Telephone surveys were completed by 333 single-family homeowners in a northern state, many of whom were retired and living on fixed incomes. One year later, 227 of the original sample were reinterviewed. Public affairs energy knowledge, total energy conservation behaviors, media exposure and use, energy information seeking, conservation attitudes, and educational level were all measured. The results indicated that the more highly educated residents in the community appeared to have gained information about the energy situation and its tradeoffs at a faster rate  than the less educated. Neither public affairs energy knowledge nor practical energy knowledge directly affected energy conservation behavior, although it appears that at least practical energy knowledge indirectly facilitated actions to save energy in the home, such as lowering thermostats. None of the media usually relied upon by government agencies, utilities, interest groups, and others to convey energy information to the public appeared to be related to the holding of this practical knowledge.

The children were removed from classrooms in groups of three or four and shown one of the four programs. After viewing the program, the children were taken to another room and interviewed. Almost none of the kindergartners and first graders was able to see a lesson that unified the content of the program, but almost 40% of the sixth graders could correctly identify a lesson. These results suggest that children's ability to identify a moral or  lesson may depend on their comprehension of plot and require a higher level of cognitive development. (DF)",

Such an advanced course should first be genre-centered instead of interaction centered. Instead of emphasizing the audience-speaker interaction, the course should center on the creation, analysis, and evaluation of rhetorical genres, such as the epideictic oration, the \"apologia,\" the forensic disputation, the television spot, or the heckling debate. Second, the advanced course should include a critical as opposed to a behavioral focus, emphasizing the development of sensitivities to critical dimensions of discourse: the possibilities of rhetorical invention, enthymematic arguments, ethical and pathetic proofs, the use of the topoi,  rhetorical disposition, fantasy themes, and rhetorical myths imbedded in public address. Third, an advanced course should be research oriented. Research projects should include systematically observing communication in natural environments, with students reporting on the structural context they observed, the communicative participants, the research question being tested by the observation, the method used to collect the data, the observation itself, and the conclusions.

Because of current discussion and disagreement about what the basic general education requirements of a university should include, a survey was administered in 1981-82 to full-time faculty members at Butler University in Indiana to determine whether a basic speech class should be included in the general education requirements. The survey instrument consisted of 32 objectives for general education that faculty members were asked to rate on a scale from 5 (most important) to 1 (least important). From a full-time faculty of approximately 150, 107 responses were received. Although writing was ranked as first in importance by  faculties in the colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Business Administration, and Fine Arts and second in importance by those in the colleges of Education and Pharmacy, the latter two colleges ranked speaking ahead of writing. The faculty then took action to require public speaking, as well as composition, of all first-year undergraduates. The ability to express one's self verbally may become increasingly important in order to succeed in a competitive society. (DF)",

The major portion of the paper discusses individually the five instruments: (1) the Learning Skills Inventory, (2) the Communication Competency Assessment Instrument, (3) the Brown-Carlsen Listening Comprehension Test, (4) the Watson-Barker Listening Test, and (5) the Kentucky Comprehensive Listening Test. The remainder of the paper presents conclusions drawn from the previous discussions, specifically that one  instrument cannot win acceptance without its underlying conceptual definition being agreed to by the majority of users, and that perhaps no one instrument will be found to be acceptable for all situations.

A randomly selected panel of 611 students, grades three through ten, was drawn from the nine schools (six elementary, two junior high, and one senior high) that make up an entire public school system in Tennessee. Students completed a self-administered questionnaire and then chose between two electronic media activities (watching television or using a computer) and two print-oriented activities (writing or reading). Data were then examined in group level analyses, individual analyses, and demographic analyses. Among the findings were the following: (1) males preferred electronic media activities and considered them to  be more educational than did females; (2) females selected writing and reading more often then did males; (3) students in lower grades preferred using a computer, considering it less difficult than did older students; and (4) watching television and reading were considered to be significantly more difficult by younger students than by older students. Perhaps most important, students appear to perceive their preferred activities as being easiest, and the easier the activities are perceived to be, the more students believe they learn from them. Further research is needed to support these findings. (Diagrams and tables of findings are included.) (DF)",

Most of the 102 respondents indicated that they use undergraduates when running a speech tournament but that concerns about utilizing undergraduates do exist. Major areas of concern are scheduling, tabulation, ballot distribution/checking, and judging--because students may lack the experience and the maturity to exercise ethical judgment. However, since it is almost impossible to run a tournament using only faculty members, steps must be taken to improve the quality of undergraduates involved. A curriculum should be established to educate undergraduates regarding tournament management. Also,  opportunities should be provided at the high school and college level to give students practical experience in tournament management. If these steps are taken, the overall quality of future forensics coaches will be improved. Furthermore, more tournaments may exist if the coach does not have to run the tournament alone.

Analysis of the most popular plays reveals that they portray a world populated primarily by white, middle-aged, middle class Americans. American drama is the only drama represented. Only plays from the past are popular, and only successful Broadway plays or adaptations of popular novels or films are represented. Therefore, students, the audiences for these plays, might well conclude that the part of the world that truly matters is a Christian, white, middle-class, small-town world where free  enterprise, self-fulfillment, and patriarchy are the accepted principles. Worst of all, students might feel that drama is trivial, with no connection to their own lives.

        "description":"The speech communication department chair's most important function involves creating a healthy departmental climate for professional growth and development. While the department chair must be able to recognize and accept the fact that some faculty members cannot or will not improve their performance, there are still four principles he or she can observe in an effort to renew faculty commitment to scholarship. First, set realistic expectations of scholarship, or rather, define scholarship broadly enough so that all contributions to knowledge--including those that describe educational strategies and techniques--are encouraged. Second, make the initiative a departmental one. The goals of an effort to renew commitment to scholarship must be seen as set by the faculty members since  their participation and acceptance are a necessary foundation for effective implementation. To this end, a departmental committee on research, appointed by the chair, can not only aid in setting and clarifying departmental goals, but also provide faculty leadership in locating and organizing resources for the achievement of those goals. Third, think big, but start where the chances for success are high. Initial efforts might focus on a small group of motivated volunteers, with changes kept to a minimum to avoid resistance. Fourth, provide options and be flexible. No single approach is suitable for all faculty members and the identification of a variety of approaches enables faculty members to choose the ones best suited to their style and needs. Approaches might include participation on a  research team, exchanges and sabbaticals, and participation in local, regional, or national conferences. (HTH)",

        "description":"Research indicates that the characteristics of schools can affect student performance. School improvement reforms depend on the involvement of individual teachers and administrators, but research also suggests that individuals are more likely to commit themselves to change when a positive, supportive change environment pervades the entire organization. The good school can be characterized as one that follows processes identified as conducive to school improvement. In addition to exhibiting the high standardized test scores typical of effective schools, good schools exhibit high student performance in behavioral, vocational, and cognitive areas, and serve all students equitably. Quickly implemented characteristics typical of good schools include school site management, strong  leadership, staff stability, curricular articulation and organization, schoolwide staff development, parental and community involvement, schoolwide recognition of academic success, maximization of learning time, and district support of change. More slowly implemented characteristics include collaborative planning and collegial relationships, a sense of community, the sharing of goals and high expectations, and order and discipline. First steps in a change program should involve communicating fully with the staff, placing staff representatives in leadership roles, reviewing the school climate, and developing a workable change program based on clear goals.

        "description":"Seven school superintendents in the state of Washington with varying levels of exposure to Iannacone and Lutz's dissatisfaction theory of democracy as well as varying degrees of experience with electoral conflict in their careers were interviewed to determine the level of their understanding of the theory, their acceptance of it, their ability to apply it, and their desire for more information on conflict levels in their districts. The executive directors of the state school boards association and the school administration association were also interviewed. The researchers concluded that practitioners in the field of school administration have not received much information concerning dissatisfaction theory, though they are receptive to the theory when it is described in the  context of electoral data with which they are familiar. Graduate studies offer the best format for educating superintendents concerning the theory, and the most effective method for presentation is to provide multiple sessions during which superintendents can obtain guidance in applying the theory to their own situations. This paper discusses the various responses of the superintendents and state educational leaders interviewed, suggests conclusions that can be drawn, and recommends policies for encouraging wider awareness of the theory.

        "description":"Effective teacher supervision for successful schools seeks to remove obstacles in the work environment that hinder teachers from seeing each other at work, receiving feedback from others, engaging in professional dialog, and participating in decisions about collective instructional actions. Just as teachers try to encourage the cognitive development of students, so supervisors should try to develop the thinking abilities of teachers. Supervisory tasks that can be planned to provide teachers with these developmental opportunities include direct one-on-one assistance to teachers, inservice education for groups of teachers, curriculum development activities, and action research. Adopting uniform supervisory and teaching practices fails to allow for or to encourage the mediating  effects of thought. This paper reviews the role of the supervisor (that is, of the many people involved in supervision), the importance of the supervisor's activities as models for the teacher's, the characteristics of different types of conceptual thinking, and the difficulties (often growing out of the historical development of American education) that beset educational improvement efforts. The central focus of the paper is on the nature of teacher development strategies that supervisors can employ. A list of 38 relevant resources is attached to the document. (PGD)",

        "description":"According to dictionary definitions, the concept of \"technology\" does not have to involve hardware, but refers instead to the application of scientific methods or scientifically derived knowledge to a practical task. Despite the availability of complex new instructional hardware to teachers, very little in the way of pedagogical technology has been effectively provided them. They rely instead on tradition, common sense, and charisma, and often adopt the attitude of \"know-nothingism\" that goes along with these imprecise guides to teaching practice. Such attitudes prevent the development of commonly understood information about teaching. The most powerful technology available to teachers today is based on the psychological and biological principles underlying human growth and  development, yet too few teachers know, understand, or can apply the concepts drawn from these fields to their work with students. Until a technology of teaching is developed that will help teachers understand the impact and effective utilization of the tools at their disposal, training teahcers to use advanced hardware may only lead to their having greater impact in their incompetence.

From this form the facilitator trainers obtained data concerning factors affecting the effectiveness of facilitator training programs. Ratings were computed for each of the elements of the training program as a whole, and the trainees' comments were examined individually in the context of the characteristics of the specific training sessions in which they participated. Differences between responses to the highest and lowest rated sessions indicated the value of establishing a climate of mutual trust and support, clarifying the overall nature of the program, and challenging participants to grow. The findings in general supported several conclusions about trainees' needs for preparation for training, understanding of program concepts, and clarification of the nature of the facilitator role. Trainers should be aware of trainees' adult learner characteristics, the style and climate of training sessions, the linkage between training events and objectives, the value of program evaluation, and the importance of adequate time and pacing.

The interviewees came from small, medium, and large schools in rural and urban settings. Nearly 71 percent of the principals were able to list all the rights granted in short suspension cases, whereas fewer than 30 percent of the counselors and teachers could do so. Most principals also exhibited good understanding of the complex requirements in expulsion cases, whereas counselors and teachers showed much more limited knowledge even of preliminary procedures. Principals were more knowledgeable concerning whether procedures were based on United  States Supreme Court decisions or on state law than were counselors or teachers, and all groups were more fully aware of state requirements than of the Supreme Court's mandates. The research upheld the hypotheses that more highly placed school personnel exhibit greater knowledge of sanctions and that the closer the sanctioning authority is to the school the more aware personnel are of the mandates established. This report includes a discussion of the legal considerations and court decisions behind Indiana's disciplinary process regulations. (PGD)",

        "description":"Through observation, interviews, and a review of school documents in a small suburban elementary school, researchers sought information concerning how faculties make sense of a changeover in the principalship. The research was conducted from a cognitive perspective. The study found that teachers' views of administrative succession and the norms of the school affected the ways in which they made sense of events, while the circumstances surrounding the changeover and the succession process itself had little impact on their thinking. The teachers assumed changing the principal would bring significant changes to the school. Prior to the changeover, teachers expressed fear that they would lose autonomy and hope that the incoming principal would be personable and supportive. During the  first few months of the new principal's tenure faculty reactions were positive, but transfer of the school's secretary led to a period of mistrust and criticism. Toward the end of the year teachers settled into an acceptance phase, but still anticipated significant changes that had not yet surfaced. A brief review of the literature on leader succession is incorporated into the report. (PGD)",

Questionnaires and interviews were used to gather information from superintendents, school board chairmen, and state legislators concerning the frequency, extent, and kinds of political activity in which superintendents were involved. Four kinds of activity were assessed: involvement in issue definition and proposal formulation, the mobilization of support for or opposition to policy proposals, attempts to influence policy as an individual rather than as a member of an association, and activity affecting specific fiscal issues. Superintendents were classified on a continuum from highly active to relatively inactive. The degree to which a superintendent was active was taken to  reflect the superintendent's own beliefs concerning appropriate levels of political activity as well as those of his community and school board. Superintendents at both ends of the continuum saw themselves as less active than they were perceived to be by either legislators or board chairmen. The training and experience levels of superintendents appeared to affect the extent of their activity. Those closer to the state capitol proved more active than those located farther away, perhaps reflecting greater community support for political activity. Five pages of references are appended.

Twenty-seven Kansas elementary principals of schools with student populations between 215 and 315 were asked to complete Fiedler's Least Perferred Co-worker scale to determine their leadership styles. Three principals were selected from each of the style groups identified: those who were relationship-oriented, those who were task-oriented, and those dominated by neither orientation. These principals then completed the Norton Communicator Style Measure. The teachers serving under the principals completed the Communication Satisfaction  Survey. Tape recordings were made of the principals' oral communications with teachers. The relationship-oriented principals saw themselves as relaxed, open, and easy-going, but their teachers were dissatisfied and they communicated least of the three groups. The principals without dominant orientation communicated most frequently, particularly concerning issues of control, but teachers were not very satisfied. Task/oriented principals focused on instructions and on personal talk and left teachers more satisfied. The results suggested that leadership style is manifested in observable behavior, but were not intended to be conclusive. (PGD)",

        "description":"Middle level schools have special needs because of the characteristics of the age group served. Staff development is crucial for middle schools. Its purposes and major planning components are presented in this paper. Most mid-level educators were prepared for elementary or high school teaching and have a limited knowledge of early adolescent needs. A good staff development program can develop the skills necessary to build a staff dedicated and committed to meeting pre-adolescent students' needs. The primary emphasis of successful programs should be to change teacher's attitudes and behavior. The hierarchy of staff development purposes has four levels; awareness, skill development (existing programs), new program development, and skill development (new programs). Using this  hierarchy of purposes can help programs in developing planning and implementation. Once a purpose is established the plan is developed by: determining needs, planning, implementation, and evaluation. Needs are determined by assessing faculty, student profiles, and parent/community data. Planning determines who is to be involved and used as consultants and resources, and establishes goals and objectives. When implementing the plan it is important to personalize the program to the needs of teachers. The final step, evaluation, uses a variety of techniques to gather data. These include questionnaires, observation, interviews, and student achievement data. The principal's leadership is key to the success of staff development programing. (MD)",

The paper includes a description of the Minnesota study, a characterization of the legislative process, and a discussion of the implications of that characterization for educational policy making. The conceptual framework of the Minnesota study combined categories of political influence with a systems orientation. Implications of the analysis of the legislative process include the following: (1) that political  expediency was a more important determinant of the legislative process than policy information and policy analysis; (2) that single-issue interest groups are adversely affecting the legislative process by diminishing the prospects for compromise or rational deliberation; (3) that a debilitating lack of cohesion exists in the public school lobby; and (4) that the study provides a point of departure for research on tuition tax concession decisionmaking and a point of comparison for research on educaiton policymaking.

It is suggested that most educators prefer theoretical discussion of management to practical help, and that teachers often are difficult to teach on account of intellectual egotism--a resistance to experiential learning. Yet management development is essentially an affective process in which a manager reflects on his own experience in order to develop appropriate theories, and authority derives from his own understanding. Accordingly, there are certain principles that apply to the introduction of management thinking across the board. The first is that trainees need both a cognitive and experiential understanding of how organizations work; the more  financial awareness can be brought to rank and file members, the more managers will feel the need to think and act with true managerial responsibility. The use of consultants is recommended as a way to bring about satisfactory management development. It is probable that many new sectors will open to good management quickly, now that a national awareness of economic restraints and opportunities has been encouraged and sustained. (TE)",

        "description":"This paper describes Hilltop Junior High School's initial experience with interdisciplinary teaming, an arrangement whereby teachers from different disciplines systematically plan curricular experiences for a common group of students. The innovation began with the appointment of a new principal who advocated teaming as the basic unit of middle school organization. Thus the site provided an opportunity to observe the processes and effects of organizational and curricular change as they occurred. In order to understand the emergent expectations, behaviors, interactions, and their meanings for participants as the innovation took shape, the researchers observed weekly planning meetings of the three teams, interviewed teachers and administrators, and reviewed relevant documents  throughout one school year. Following an introduction and rationale for the study and a description of the research methods, the paper describes the development of teaming, the functioning of the three teams, and the foci of teachers' discussions during planning meetings. These events are then discussed with respect to the redistribution of authority, loose coupling, staff recruitment, rewards, structural lag, and work load. Several implications for curricular decision making and staff development are then explored. The paper concludes with five working hypotheses which provide direction for additional investigations.

Instruments were distributed to 701 school administrators from two central city and eight suburban school districts in Oregon and Washington, with a response rate of 55 percent. Coefficients alpha, means and standard deviations were calculated for all OWVI scales, and multivariate analyses were performed on the sex of the respondent and on the level of administration, along with factor analyses on  responses to the 77 items of the OWVI. The research indicates that school administrators value jobs that are enjoyable, involve working with ideas, allow for self-realization and for helping others, and provide for independence and the opportunity to work with others. On 9 of the 11 work values, male and female public school administrators responded similarly, suggesting that both sexes find similar qualities of work personally rewarding and fulfilling. Finally, the scale mean for the work value of money was found to be less than those for the higher order needs of self-realization and altruism. Results are tabulated in seven statistical tables, and references are included. (TE)",

The general explanation explored in this paper is that the school environment exerts important and systematic influences over the development of the organizational characteristics necessary for success. The paper begins  with a general perspective that emphasizes the school as an organization, followed by a general comparison of public and private school structure and purpose. The following sections compare (1) the relation of public and private schools to their immediate outside authorities, (2) the parental environment, (3) the role of public and private principals, (3) the structure of the school, (4) school personnel, and (5) staff relations. The conclusion suggests that the difference in performance between public and private schools ultimately derives from the greater political constraints of the public school environment, as this is reflected in the role of the principal and in staff relations.

The agenda first calls for policy-oriented research that examines the implications of state-mandated educational changes on supervisory practices and commensurate teaching and learning. Legislated learning and the career ladder are discussed as examples of trends toward centralization, respectively, of curriculum and personnel policies. In both instances, research is needed to inform the decision-making process at the macro level. The second major focus of the agenda is a call for research that seeks to scientifically match existing and evolving supervisory techniques and practice models to unique professional  practice situations. Examined as examples are (1) bureaucratic versus professional evaluation of teaching and (2) contingency versus \"one best way\" approaches to supervision and teaching. Intended here is micro level research designed to advance further the science and art of supervision, by providing cognitive \"maps\" that will help supervisors deal with the full range and variety of practice situations.

Highlights of the first-year findings summarized in this journal are based on the responses of nearly 8,000 students and 350 teachers. Attendance records are neither accurate nor consistent from school to school. Almost a third of the students missed an average of at least one class per day; nearly all students missed some of their classes two to three times more often than other classes. Students named social sciences, English, and math as subjects they cut the most. Penalties seemed to be a poor deterrent; having to make up classwork was the most powerful deterrent. Compared to  low-absence students, high-absence students accounted for 84 percent of all grade point averages below 1.5; and 85 percent said they would be satisfied with a C or D grade, compared to 50 percent of the students with fewer absences who said the same. Absences by students in classes they failed were double the overall school rate; they were triple the school rate for those students who failed more than one class. To control chronic absenteeism and prevent more students from dropping out, administrators should improve school curriculum, instructional techniques, and attendance policies. (MLF)",

Underlying this framework is a belief that, in order to manage time, one must manage oneself within the bounds of the institution. Accordingly, three interdependent sets of practical suggestions are provided, in keeping with the threefold \"SOS\" sequence. The first component, self-awareness and self-discipline, entails documenting the activities of a normal work week and critically assessing this logbook for the appropriateness of the time devoted to each kind of activity. The second, organizational awareness, involves an assessment of individual time management in the context of ongoing organizational concerns and  requirements--a synchronization of the organization and the individual. The third component, scheduling, involves planning, timetabling, implementing, and monitoring tasks for the organization as a whole. References are included. (TE)",

The main purpose of this study was to test the dissatisfaction theory of school governance to see if the events it predicts do occur. Three districts with recent labor disputes were selected for a 4-year longitudinal study of community dissatisfaction and its effects. Data were collected from minutes of school board meetings, newspapers, and interviews with school officials. Standards were developed for  judging whether observed events matched predicted events, and the theory was modified based on analysis and interpretation of data. Elaborations of the theory were made in the areas of (1) level of community dissatisfaction needed to affect change in school governance, (2) split voting patterns by school boards, and (3) interaction between school board member turnover and split voting by school boards. In cases where predicted events did not occur, a search was made for intervening variables that might explain the theory's failure of prediction. Appended are (1) an index of magnitude-of-demand inputs and (2) the standards used for judging whether or not observed events match predicted events. (TE)",

The suit forced the school system and community in Louisville (Kentucky) to negotiate substantially revised discipline policies. The historical context of the case is first reviewed, followed by an indepth discussion of the litigation and its effects on the community. The second and third sections focus on policy revisions arising from the settlement, and on procedures for monitoring compliance with the settlement agreement. The new policies enhanced student rights and emphasized parental involvement and alternatives to suspension and corporal punishment.  Statistical analysis of three years of suspension data indicates that implementation of the new policies has been irregular and inadequate, though some progress is reported. Black student suspensions remain disproportionately high, but the problem is evident in fewer schools. Statistical tables are included. (Author/TE)",

Findings reveal that the percentage of women being certified each year is increasing in much greater proportion than the percentage of women who actually hold positions at each administrative level. Data on the number of withdrawals from each position indicate numerous opportunities for the hiring of women. If, during the past 15 years, a certified woman had been hired whenever a position became available, 73 percent of the administrative jobs would now be held by women. Yet the latest data available show that only 3.3 percent of  superintendents, 7.6 percent of assistant superintendents, 3.5 percent of secondary principals, and 16.9 percent of elementary principals are women. Possible reasons for this disparity include differences in aspiration levels of men and women and internal or external barriers to achieving administrative positions. Strategies for overcoming these barriers are discussed. References are included, along with statistical tables and charts. (Author/TE)",

After a background discussion of five basic ideas that guided the work and of the contributions and limitations of past research, the study addresses the role of the principal in fostering norms of collegiality and experimentation. The observation and evaluation of teaching, provisions for curriculum development, involvement in shared planning or  preparation of methods and materials, and the design and conduct of inservice education are all examined for the conditions and consequences of the leadership they convey. Data on classroom observation and feedback practices between teachers and administrators serve to illustrate the range of leadership strategies and to make a case for the probable connections between those strategies and school improvement outcomes.

This paper approaches the subject using as its theoretical basis a document even more basic to the founding of the republic than the Constitution--the Bible. Using the King James Version of the Bible as a data source, a conceptual analysis of both the Old and New Testaments is undertaken to indicate strong support for the concept of fiscal equity in the financial support of education in America. This Biblical support is not only for the general concept of equalization, but also for some of the current measures that have been suggested, and are in some cases being employed, to equalize wealth disparities  within states. The two most common proposals for equalization in education, full state funding and district power equalizing, have conceptual support in the Bible. There is also a Biblical basis for recapture provisions that are currently not very popular on the political scene. (Author/TE)",

On the basis of interview and observational data, four prevailing norms were identified: a strong sense of order, the instructional isolation of teachers, the lack of personal contact and support for teachers, and the importance of expectations. Findings confirmed Gephart's thesis that the faculty degraded the status of its departing principal, but this status degradation was based on an interaction of professional and organizational norms rather than solely  on organizational norms. The conclusion suggests that Gephart's theory of succession would have to be adjusted to accommodate the influence of sources of norms external to the organization. References are included.

The aim was to gain access to a set of schools that provided both variety in instructional leadership and diversity in school size, organization, grade level, faculty and student characteristics, and circumstances. Case studies were conducted in five schools during the first year, and a survey of expectations and practices--developed from findings of the case studies--was distributed to administrators, department heads, and teachers in these five and three other schools during the second year. This report begins with an extensive summary of the methodology, findings, and implications of the study as a whole. This is  followed by chapters in which the following topics are discussed in depth: (1) theory and action (leadership and the character of schools); (2) views of instructional leadership (a review of the literature); (3) control, freedom, and opportunity (the school as an informal organization); (4) findings on instructional leadership from the five case studies; (5) observing and being observed at work (findings from the survey); and (6) leadership by teachers. Results of the survey are tabulated, and six pages of references are included. (TE)",

Short term treatment consisted of four tutorials over a 2-week period. Long term treatment 1 consisted of eight tutorials over 4 weeks (an extension of the short term treatment). Long term treatment 2, also eight tutorials over a 4-week period, included material from content areas studied in the regular classroom. A control group was not exposed to the strategy training curriculum or any other type of group experience. Measures of clustering and recall were used to assess the impact of the strategy training curriculum. There were no  differences in the degree of categorization evident in the recall protocols of trained and control Ss with respect to picture stimuli. There were also no significant differences between Ss in long term and short term training conditions regarding adjusted ratio of categorization (ARC) scores. Comparisons between treatment and controls showed no signficant effects of training, and extent of training had no significant effect on recall of items from either blocked or unblocked prose stimuli. Practical and design-related concerns were noted to affect data collection and research results. It is noted that \"uninsightful\" poor readers (i.e., those requiring additional steps in the training process) did improve as a result of their exposure to strategy training. (CL)",

Ss assigned the simulated cases in one of eight placement choices. Committee members also convened to place one randomly selected case. The instruments consisted of questionnaires requesting demographic information, 279 computer generated case studies of hearing impaired children, and a teacher report regarding one randomly selected case study. Data collection resulted in 2120 individual placements and 26 simulated debates regarding the randomly selected case. Analysis of  the data showed that the Ss placed relatively different importance on the variables although several emerged as important to all groups. Analysis of committee placements indicated a tendency toward more restrictive placements than those made in the individual task. Anecdotal information indciated that the committees used the teacher report and/or parent preference as basis for the debates. Appendices include the study questionnaires, a group of 10 case studies, and the computer program used for the study. (CL)",

The importance of families as resources for handicapped children is stressed, although the lack of attention to family and cultural affiliation is seen to reduce the effectiveness of early intervention. Among characteristics noted of black rural families are readily identifiable family structure, a well established relationship between siblings, and a general sense of optimism about the child's future. The paper stresses the need for educators to familiarize themselves with their students' cultural orientation. Strategies for encouraging parent participation in school are suggested, including  flexibility in scheduling, alternative meeting formats, and use of black parents in leadership roles within the school.

A Title IV-C Developmental Grant was written to develop a curriculum to meet the needs of moderately and severely handicapped students. The curriculum was subsequently evaluated by a state panel and selected as a model program for adoption in the state of Washington. The curriculum consists of 11 units: (1) identifying relationships; (2) precautions to take with strangers; (3) private body parts; (4) saying \"no\"; (5) protecting information; (6) travel safety; (7) social situations; (8) home safety; (9) authority figures; (10) exploitation in exchange for favors, gifts, and kindness; (11) reporting exploitation.  The first five units are intended to help students acquire general information and skills needed for self protection, including discriminating strangers and learning the appropriateness of certain activities with strangers. Appropriate and inappropriate touching is discussed, as are examples of \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" information to give strangers. Units 6-11 feature self protection in specific situations. Units include information on materials, activities, and alterations. (Author/CL)",

A 3-year-old deaf child from the authors' previous study was selected and all of his characterizing signs produced during a 2-hour naturalistic play session in his home were videotaped. Each sign was coded in terms of its handshape, motion, and place of articulation. Analysis revealed that his signs could be described in terms of handshape form/measuring categories and motion form/meaning categories. His signs were composed of a limited and discrete set of 10 hand and 9 motion forms each of which was consistently associated with a distinct meaning and recurred across lexical items. Further analysis suggested that he used discrete forms to represent objects, actions, and  traits in his world despite the fact that one can manually represent movements and shapes in a continuous fashion. His signs also appeared to be organized in relation to one another, as opposed to being organized only in relation to the objects they represent. (CL)",

Documentation appended to Part 1 includes a report of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, and the responses of W. Bradford Reynolds to questions submitted by Senator Weicker on the report: &quot;Staff Report on the Institutionalized Mentally Disabled.&quot; The staff report (printed separately as Part 2) presents findings from a study of environmental conditions and physical health and safety in state mental hospitals. Staff visited 31 facilities and  conducted an estimated 600 interviews with staff, patients, residents, facility administrators, state and federal officials and others in the field. It was concluded that on many wards, parents/residents are vulnerable to abuse and serious physical injury; that hospital staff are also at risk of serious physical injury; and that living conditions in many institutions are unacceptable. Interviews also suggested that there is little treatment other than medication provided in many institutions. Monitoring information is reported in terms of accreditation and certification of state hospitals for the mentally ill, certification of institutions for the mentally retarded, and the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act. Further considerations for institutionalization of both the mentally  ill and the mentally retarded are noted. The federal government's role with mental health systems is examined, including agency programs and federal initiatives. The final chapter reviews judicial decisions on constitutional rights of the mentally disabled, the right to treatment, and the right to refuse treatment. (CL)",

Students received individualized, diagnostic prescriptive instruction from a program remediation team consisting of a reading teacher and paraprofessional assistant, as well as from their classroom teacher. During the 1982-83 school year, the program served a total of 16,265 students, of whom 226 were in nonpublic schools. Nearly three-fifths were served in classes for learning disabled students and one-fifth in classes for emotionally handicapped pupils. Analyses of qualitative data (from program observations and staff interviews) and quantitative data (from criterion- and norm-referenced tests) indicated that the program was  fully implemented and effectively promoted reading skill mastery and general improvement in reading comprehension. Among additional findings were that mastery rates were highest for elementary students in the regions and for high school students in citywide services, and that mean gain in normal curve equivalents for program students was higher than that for a non-program comparison group.

Rorschachs were administered to the same group of students. Data from each test were reduced via factor analyses, and factor structures were chosen which demonstrated both statistical consistency and psychological integrity. Standardized factor scores were subjected to a series of canonical correlations to determine degree of common variance. Zero-order correlations were computed among relevant BSAG, Rorschach, and background variables. Finally, a series of multiple-discriminant analyses were conducted comparing hit-rates  for correctly classifying students by special education category and psychiatric diagnosis. No significant canonical correlations were found between Rorschach and BSAG factors. However, both sets of factors extracted appeared unique for this sample. Inclusion and exclusion of certain Rorschach variables were consistent with current research. Discriminant analyses revealed that the BSAG and Rorschach had comparable hit rates (53%) in correctly classifying students by special education category. While Rorschach contents and determinants were most accurate when categorizing students in terms of psychiatric diagnosis, potential use of Rorschach and observation data in the derivation of all of these categories could have confounded findings.

Findings include an increase of 4,913 handicapped children served from the previous year and a preponderance of speech impaired children (60.9% of the total handicapped population). Chapter 3 focuses on the following types of services: outreach and recruitment, diagnosis and assessment, mainstreaming and special services, and coordination with other agencies. Appended information includes  diagnostic criteria for reporting handicapped children in Head Start and state-by-state survey results. (CL)",

After collecting the information, the computer program combines facts and rule-based logic to produce a solution. The system has components for learning disabilities, speech and language, mental retardation, behavior disorders, physical impairment, and sensory impairment. Examples are cited of the learning disabilities component, which contains a knowledge base of over 170 rules. Examples illustrate procedures to test rules and to end the  consultation. Additional features of the system include abilities to track and monitor computer logic as the program attempts to determine advice and to query the program at any point in the consultation regarding its intermediate conclusion.

There is a strong emphasis on human rights, independence, and personal choice. Although the process is slow, there is progress toward clients making the very difficult decision to attend continuing education in community settings.

The guidelines are consistent with  recommendations made by the Federal Center for Disease Control. Specifically, the guidelines do not advocate the categorical admission or exclusion of AIDS infected students, but provide rather for this determination to be made on a case-by-case basis by a team consisting of public health personnel, the student's physician and parents, and appropriate school personnel. A similar case-by-case determination is recommended with regard to the continued employment of school employees who have or could transmit AIDS.

Variety, careful preparation, assuring that the students understand the activity, feeling free to discontinue an activity that is not working, and extending the activity over several days or into another activity when it is working, are suggested as classroom techniques. Fifteen warm-ups are described for activities including a detective game, mime, information-seeking, giving instructions, a dating game, description, map-making, question-answering and reporting, explanation, and guessing and observation.

The camp was originally housed in college classrooms, but now occupies a church and uses college dormitories for resident students. Three levels of each language are offered, and students have been known to begin another foreign language after completing the third level of the original one. The costs are kept as low as possible, with tuition covering instruction, books, materials, and an ethnic luncheon in the cafeteria, as well as teacher salaries, facilities, and  advertising. Teachers are recruited from the area, and some have used the experience for reentry into teaching after extended time off. Texts have been developed for each level of each language, and many brief, lively group activities are interspersed with instructional periods. A parent program at the end of the camp is used to demonstrate what has been learned. A week-long teacher workshop has recently been integrated into the camp program. Parent and teacher reception of the program has been very good, and some expansion is planned. (MSE)",

Russian and minority languages in the Soviet Union are examined, including the early development of Soviet language policy, language policy under Stalin, and language policy from Krushchev to the present. An exploration of Chinese language policy looks at the situation of Chinese national minorities, language policy in Communist China, and education in the context of the Four Modernizations. Discussion of Canadian language policy focuses on the history of language in that country, the &quot;quiet revolution&quot; in Quebec, and the pedagogical dimensions of bilingual  education. Against this background, the following conclusions are stated: (1) the United States attempts at bilingual education have been motivated more by political imperatives than educational reasons; (2) bilingual education is not a new concept, but one that has a long history; and (3) we can learn a great deal about what succeeds and what does not by looking at these and other countries' experiences.

However, the process-centered approach has a number of drawbacks, and prose models can solve some of these inherent problems. Properly designed models can be an essential part of a writing class if their purpose is to show how writers with limited English proficiency can solve a communication problem in an acceptable, idiomatic, and concise way. Students can learn a little about rhetorical patterns by studying a dozen or so models, but to increase the range of content areas in which students can operate and to build up an inventory of adaptable cliches, they should be exposed to many more models. By studying a large number  of models and solutions, students realize that writing is more than the application of a few simple formulas. They see the communicative value of the structures they learn and appreciate the kinds of communication problems writing can solve. (MSE)",

The three top needs of the California group were ESL instruction in the content areas, program design for preliterate students, and materials development. The needs expressed by the Venezuelans included strategies to teach reading in English, teacher knowledge of language learning, and methods to use in very large classes. The common elements in the two lists of teacher concerns show the teachers' awareness of some of the themes current in second language learning theory and research. Both groups are interested in using content other than language for teaching English; the Venezuelan group, to  provide interest in large classes, and the California group, to improve the fit between English and other secondary school subjects. Both mention mastery of a variety of teaching techniques as important. The differences in the lists demonstrate the profound influence of student population and institutional setting on second language instruction. The results can help those developing materials to serve the needs of teachers in different settings with different objectives. (Author/MSE)",

Wholistic evaluation amplifies the concept to include both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Student-centered evaluation acknowledges that differentiated inputs may attribute to differentiated outputs. Select sociolinguistic, psycholinguistic, and educational variables unique to limited-English-proficient (LEP) students contribute to language acquisition and learning. Their recognition and integration into an evaluation plan facilitates appropriate and meaningful educational opportunities for LEP students. Teachers are both a valuable source of data and a resource to be used in student evaluation. Teacher expertise or connoisseurship is the backbone of  instruction and needs to be built into the assessment model. If English as a second language and bilingual education teachers are considered key components in student evaluation, and reliable and valid information is obtainable through informal and formal means, educational decisions that affect LEP students will be more sound, realistic, and useful.

The subjects were 144 introductory Spanish students divided into eight recitation groups. Half of these groups (control groups) were assigned to 40 minutes a week of audiotape laboratory; two were assigned to 40 minutes a week of tele-lessons, and two were assigned to 40 minutes a week of computer drills. Other features of the course  were the same as the standard introductory curriculum. Results indicate that the computer-assisted instruction method was clearly the most successful of the three tested, but only in enhancing writing skills and not, by extension, other language skills. Use of the computer for a variety of skill development exercise, alone or in combination with another instructional method, is recommended. (MSE)",

Interest in it has increased substantially in recent years, and further research and development of the measure for use in a variety of situations have been undertaken. It was found that, as a result of a training course given to test administrators, some teachers altered the curriculum, classroom activities, materials, and pace of instruction to help students cross the major thresholds between one proficiency level and the next. Several curriculum development projects have grown out of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages/Educational  Testing Service (ACTFL/ETS) oral proficiency projects, including one aimed at restructuring a secondary-level French program based on the ACTFL proficiency guidelines and one creating a fourth-year college conversation course designed to move students from the intermediate to the advanced level. The ACTFL/ETS guidelines and tests based on them can serve as an organizing principle for curriculum development and provide a basis for the elaboration of end-of-course goals. They have been found to be more effective than other instructional strategies in helping students emerge from language study with a usable level of language skill. (MSE)",

Surveys were conducted with students, faculty, and department heads. The department questionnaire covered different types of graphics capabilities and types of computer resources, including: microcomputers, minicomputers, mainframe interactive mode, and mainframe batch mode. Data collection focused on how much access  is needed to complete course requirements, excluding student needs for word processing, library searches, and electronic mail. The type and location of student stations that were needed were determined, along with estimated numbers of hours of access required per course. A service unit was generated to represent the theoretical maximum number of hours that a work station can be used. The departments that need their own terminals were identified, and estimates were made of the personnel needed to supervise all work stations. (SW)",

Twelve of the institutions used a systematic approach to improving endowment management, while 11 used a more traditional and less intensive approach. It was found that institutions employing independent consultants, multiple investment managers, and a systematic approach to policies and endowment management practices performed significantly better than institutions that took other approaches to endowment management. Study findings suggest that important factors in improving performance are appropriate trustee  interest and involvement, institutions' retaining external professional managers of endowment investments, and using independent consultants to evaluate managers and performance.

        "description":"The knowledge and skills needed by managers are considered, as well as the relationship between undergraduate study and continuing management education. Because of industry's dissatisfaction with the general preparation provided by colleges, business and industry managers were surveyed about the learning goals of the management-training programs they provide for employees. A total of 116 training directors, personnel managers, and executives at 98 firms rated the importance of learning goals for in-house management education programs. The human resource managers in industry valued interpersonal and affective abilities far above the acquisition of cognitive skills and broad knowledge in subject areas considered fundamental to a liberal education. They suggest that many of higher  education's objectives are of little use in preparing graduates to be effective managers. (A second study of 51 executives had similar findings.) Personal choices of managers when they participate in education and training programs were also determined. Based on a federal 1981 Survey of Participation in Adult Education, a subset of managers who were part-time students was also analyzed to determine the types of courses they pursued. Recommendations for colleges include providing students more active learning and opportunities for oral communication. (SW)",

Reliable national estimates were sought on: the number and type of courses offered; the percent of students taking remedial courses and recent enrollment changes; and rough measures of remedial program outcomes (e.g., course completion and student retention). Remedial or developmental studies were defined as programs, courses, or other activities for students lacking skills needed to perform college-level work at the specific institution. The national sample of 511 colleges and universities was drawn from the Higher Education General Information System enrollment report of 1982. Eighty-two percent  of the schools had at least one remedial/developmental course, and more colleges offered courses in remedial writing (73 percent) and math (71 percent) than in reading (66 percent). In addition to course enrollments, information was obtained on: the level and control of schools offering such studies, types of remedial support services and summer programs, type of credit and requirements, and student retention and program evaluation.

The university was established in September 1973 to serve students who would complete 2 years at community/junior colleges in the Permian Basin area. The school's mission and the two towns near the college are described (Odessa and Midland). Faculty were sought who had subject knowledge and enthusiasm for the discipline, enthusiasm for teaching, empathy for students, commitment to high academic standards, and the ability to get along with colleagues and administrators. Most of the faculty recruiting was done at leading research universities out of state. Personnel practices at the new university included: term tenure, student ratings of teachers  each semester, linking salary increases and teaching performance, and an annual faculty award of $1,000 for outstanding teaching. Faculty evaluation committees and administrators terminated nontenured faculty as soon as it became apparent that they were not effective teachers or did not fit the institution, usually within 2 or 3 years instead of the maximum of 6 years. The institution's policy on research and publication is discussed, along with the relationship between the school and the community. (SW)",

Subjects were 455 introductory psychology students. Changes in performance on the first exam and three subsequent exams were examined, plus extra credit for participation in psychology experiments. The butterfly difference equation was tested using hierarchical stepwise regression. The model, which assumes nonlinear change, predicted performance more accurately than two linear alternatives. Where the goal was to predict performance at the end of the program, the butterfly model offered a 37.7 increase in utility. Larger positive changes in performance were observed for successive administrations of the course, indicating that the course was  steadily improving. The degree to which the course was perceived as important for career goals (extrinsic instrumentality), was found to be a significant bifurcation variable. Women showed more favorable performance changes compared to men. The butterfly model described the motivational dynamics taking place in the classroom. The collective learning curves varied along four parameters: extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation, programmatic differences, and ability. Equations and explanations of the model, including applications for training evaluation, are included. (SW)",

The availability of grants to independent students may have two consequences: college students under age 22 with access to parental resources might take steps to gain independent status; and individuals over 25 who have not attended college might enter higher education. In classifying independent students, California examines the students' situation in the current and 3 preceding years, in contrast to information on only the current and prior year that is used by the federal government to determine eligibility for Pell grants. The extent that enrolled students shift from dependent to  independent status is assessed, based on data from the California Survey of Student Expenditures and Resources for 1979-1983, and longitudinal data for freshmen entering the University of Wisconsin System in fall 1979. Based on the limited available evidence, it is concluded that the incentives for students under age 25 to change their status are not that substantial.

        "description":"Definitions of manageable college student debts are discussed and one definition is applied to California data, using the Student Expenses and Resources Survey. Definitions proposed by Daniere, Hartman, and Horch define manageable debt levels in terms of future income. A comparison of the three proposals shows the number of years of repayment required for accumulated debts of different amounts. For the analysis of California data, a manageable debt limit is defined as the maximum debt that can be repaid within the standard 10-year repayment period. Any debt in excess of $14,000 is designated as excessive, although the present maximum borrowing allowed under the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program is $12,500. The analysis, which is restricted to seniors at four-year public and  private colleges, considers average debt size, the distribution of debt size, borrowing patterns, and graduate and professional education debt. The data indicate that at most 3% of seniors with debt might on average experience repayment problems. The situation is most serious for independent students attending private colleges; perhaps as many as 9% of this group have unmanageable debts. However, slightly over half of students borrow and the average accumulated debt is well under half the GSL maximum. (SW)",

        "description":"Ways to improve college student loans, work-study, and grants programs are suggested, based on the experience of the financial aid director at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is recommended that emphasis be shifted from the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) Program to the National Direct Student Loan (NDSL) Program, which is more cost-effective to taxpayers. In addition to increasing the appropriation for NDSL, nine other recommendations are offered, including: keeping the present needs test under the Uniform Methodology, and increasing the institutional match from 10 to 20 percent. Eight changes for GSL are also suggested, such as: applying the present needs test system to all applicants, including those earning below $30,000; and raising to 10 percent the interest rate  borrowers pay after leaving school. Two ways to improve the College Work-Study program are to keep the Uniform Methodology to channel money to the neediest students, and to require schools to contribute 25 instead of the present 20 percent. Decentralizing the Pell Grant program and a change in the distribution of Pell funds are advocated. Other considerations are addressed: appropriations for research on student financial aid, self-support rules, and financial aid for part-time students. (SW)",

The effects of carrying out the Department's policy or methodology, called &quot;validation,&quot; on financial aid applicants and colleges were assessed. Costs of 1982-1983 validation on schools were evaluated through in-depth case studies of a representative sample of 12 schools. Additional analyses involved: a national mail survey of financial aid officers at a stratified random sample of 400 colleges; a mail survey of students at 3 types of schools selected from the 12 in the case studies; review of the Department's recent studies of Pell error; and interviews with federal officials and representatives of private groups. In  1982-1983 the Department increased to 1.66 million the number of applicants who must validate their eligibility. The estimated cost to colleges was less than 1 percent of the total Pell program, which provided $2.4 billion in grants during the year. The Department's studies identify continuing problems with award accuracy and the error is sizable. Recommendations to improve the Department's policies and procedures are offered.

In addition to a search of various kinds of records, interviews were conducted with faculty, staff workers, and administrators. The Delphi technique was used to isolate problems of an administrative nature, specifically those dealing with finance, curriculum, and faculty. The college's history was written from a conservative, traditional viewpoint. Little or no attention was given at the college to social issues, labor-management relations, the effect of war on national policies, the study of peace, women's rights, or integration. Peabody was primarily a place where the status quo was observed. Major financial problems during the era were:  decreasing funds, faculty salaries, inadequate business procedures, and insufficient buildings and equipment. Two problems concerning faculty were identified: the quality of the faculty, and the faculty members' inadequate promotion of the purpose and objectives of the college. Major problems relating to the educational program concerned enrollment, departmental reorganization, and the quality of students' work. Two innovations were a conference on professional negotiations and the establishment of the Joint University Libraries system. (SW)",

Project purposes are given, as well as reasons for the study, which was designed to address these specific problems: purchase of computer hardware without adequate instructional systems design; introduction of microcomputers and plans for computer literacy instruction with minimal attention paid to present subject matter curriculum; little staff instruction on how to integrate the microcomputer into the existing  curriculum or how the technology might alter the curriculum, and lack of systematic methods for courseware evaluation. The project background and setting are described, as well as a list of findings from the first year. Components of the project design are given, including a rationale for the project, project needs, the program development model, the assumptions for the conceptual approach, and the flexibility of the instructional program.

The issues addressed in the first year of the project are presented in this report, which describes: how the project was planned and implemented by the Merrimack Education Center with the staff from three school sites in Burlington, Lunenburg, and Tewksbury, Massachuetts; how a program development model was chosen; the major  elements of the project design; year one activities; and resulting curriculum changes in each of the three school sites. Ten major findings from year one are listed, and it is concluded that the existing basic skills curriculum often is not configured to make maximum utilization of technology, and that staff uncertainty about the new technologies leads to initial confusion about staffmember roles, lack of focus in the curriculum target area, and negative perceptions about lack of incentives and burdens of time. It is suggested that teachers need to broaden their view and perspecitve of technology in the curriculum and create new contexts for the skills development that is necessary to make appropriate and meaningful uses of technology in the schools.

Results indicate all districts but one utilized computers during 1982-83; the number of computers available ranged from one in a small district to 232 in a large district. When analyzed on a  computer/student ratio, there was a range of 1/28 to 1/412, and a mean ratio of 1/156; Apple is the overwhelming choice of schools; and most computers were located either in classrooms (83%), the library (51%), or a computer laboratory (54%): virtually all districts reported multiple placement. Only 10 of 35 school boards had taken any official action concerning computers in their system; however, 80% of the districts had provided inservice training activities during 1982-83.

Concepts and principles from organizational sociology are applied in order to investigate the relationship between teacher's mastery of this body of knowledge and the process of implementation of the innovation on the one hand, and the relationship between mastery and implementation outcomes on the other. Theoretical propositions of the study are illustrated by a secondary analysis of data gathered by the Program of Complex Instruction at Stanford University's School of Education. A connection is made between the improvement of thinking skills and problem-solving ability utilizing a theoretical model of a program, Finding  Out. Implementation of this activity-based bilingual math and science program features a complex instructional approach based on theories and research in the disciplines of cognitive psychology, sociology, and social-psychology. During the academic year 1982/83, Finding Out was implemented in 15 classrooms from 10 schools within three school districts in the San Jose, California, area. Approximately 390 second, third, fourth, and fifth graders participated in the program, which was presented by teachers who had attended a 2-week workshop. The workshop introduced them to the theoretical framework and rationale of Finding Out and gave them the opportunity to practice teaching the program. Data are presented on teachers' scores on Index of Mastery, Index of Non-Routine Behaviors in Finding  Out, and Index of Effectiveness, and four case studies are presented to illustrate some of the variables involved.

Several conclusions can be drawn from these meta-analyses. First, although CBA has not been uniformly successful in all its guises and at all instructional levels, most CBE programs have had the following positive effects on students: students have learned more and retained more in courses providing assistance from computers; students learned their lessons in less instructional time and liked their classes more when they received computer help; and students developed positive attitudes towards computers when they received help from them in school. Second, results of CBE vary as a  function of the evaluation design used to measure CBE effectiveness; and third, study outcomes also vary as a function of the type of publication in which the results are found. Since CBE generally has positive effects on student learning, future programs of implementation and development should be encouraged. Research is needed, however, to determine the factors that produce differences in the results of studies reported in journals and in dissertations, and differences in the results of studies using different research designs.

The drill and practice approach is shown to embody a deterministic, behavioral technology that turns learning into a systematically-designed and quality-controlled form of work. Computerized tutorial programs are shown to extend the behavioral and technological approach to learning even further by shaping interactions via an external agent's intentions in order to maximize the learner's performance gains. Most seriously, computerized tutorial interactions pre-empt the personal intellectual agency and ultimately inner-directed learning. Finally, the use of computers is shown to limit the  learner's mental landscape to objective, quantitative, and procedural tools. A list of references completes the document. (JB)",

        "description":"Subjects for an investigation of the effects of training with a computer and past computer experience on the computerized aptitude test performance of college students were 92 undergraduates at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, who participated in a test study utilizing six Apple II+ microcomputers. The study was conducted to determine whether: (1) computerized test performance would be significantly enhanced and the concomitant anxiety level would be significantly lowered by increasing the amount of training with the computer prior to testing; and (2) increasing the amount of training with the computer would significantly reduce the difference between the mean anxiety level occurring with a computerized test and the mean anxiety level occurring with a  paper-and-pencil test. Test performance was measured by the number-correct score on an arithmetic reasoning test. Results indicate that neither training immediately before testing nor past computer experience appear to significantly affect computerized test performance or the concomitant anxiety level. The mean paper-and-pencil test score was higher than the mean computerized score, however, and it is suggested that differences between pencil-and-paper and computerized test performance may be the result of human error and deficiencies of the computer software.

        "description":"The 101 computer-based education (CBE) studies considered for use in this meta-analysis came from three major sources: references in an earlier meta-analytic review of CBE at the college level (J. Kulik, et al., 1980); a computer search of the Comprehensive Dissertation Abstracts and ERIC databases; and utilization of the bibliographies contained within the documents located through reviews and computer searches. The instructional outcome measured most often in the 101 studies was student learning as indicated on achievement examinations given at the end of a program of instruction. Some additional outcome variables measured included: performance on a follow-up or retention examination at a later date; attitudes toward computers; course completion; and amount of time needed for  instruction. Findings indicate that computer-based education usually has positive effects on college students (CBE raised student examination scores by 0.26 standard deviations in the average study); CBE effects were somewhat lower in unpublished studies than they were in published reports; CBE effects were also somewhat lower in the hard, nonlife sciences than in the social and life sciences and education; CBE produced small but positive changes in student attitudes toward instruction and computers; and CBE also reduced substantially the amount of time needed for instruction.

Such systems have several advantages over existing training options in business and industry--e.g., reduced time needed for training--and more effective, individualized instruction results from utilizing computer based training. In addition, the computer can track, analyze, and present results quickly and meaningfully. Computer simulations provide the opportunity to present trainees with experiences that go beyond those available through textbook materials and classroom settings.  However, three major issues should be considered when introducing new technologies into industrial training programs: the needs of those who will be using the system, the attitudes and reactions of trainees, and the attitudes and reactions of the trainer.

As an experiment in teaching library research skills, 27 eighth graders were assigned to search an online encyclopedia in preparation for writing a science theme. The students' operational practices and associated conceptual understandings were interpreted as a multimodal case study of videotex use. Analysis of data from hard copies of the students' disk records (an unobtrusive measure), participant observation during naturalistic computer use, and a direct, hands-on test of computer competence at the project's end supported five tentative conclusions; the students typically: (1) mastered only the simplest videotex commands without  improving their rate of error over time; (2) had difficulty understanding the concepts and vocabulary, but not the structure of electronic menus; (3) accessed only a small quantity of electronic text compared to available printed materials; (4) exhibited the ability to search by keyword but found the videotex service inadequately cross-referenced; and (5) required constant adult assistance to log on to the videotex service, to learn command operations, and to store text on disk files. The study indicated that, as of 1984, commercial electronic text services lacked internal motivations to achieve operational efficiency and were unsuited to the educational objective of learning the cognitive skills of information processing.

Computer equity consists of three dimensions: access, participation, and benefits. Access is the number of microcomputers available for student use, or the ratio of students to computers; equity issues arise when access to computers is restricted to certain schools, grade or ability levels, or to certain classes, such as advanced math. Participation is the average amount of computer time allotted to student use; inequities can result if free time usage is dominated by boys or high achieving students. Benefits are the kinds of activities students engage in when using the computer; the assumption that learning to program is preferable to drill and practice or word processing leads to  inequities in educational benefits. A list of 12 barriers to equitable computer access and use is included, as well as suggestions for evaluating equity problems.

First, the criteria of efficiency and equity are explained in terms of their use by economists in judging the appropriateness of public policy. Next, two analytical constructs used by economists in recommending educational policy are discussed: (1) the principle of externalities, which helps determine the benefits absorbed by other members of a society as a result of educating a single individual; and (2) the theory of human capital, which refers to the value of the income/earning potential embodied in individuals. Next, economic justifications are provided for the  public funding of community colleges, including efficiency factors; economic development considerations; educational equity and its impact on social mobility and income levels; and educational outcomes as returns on students' economic investment in their schooling. Finally, the paper concludes that economics will influence many of the policies affecting community colleges in the future. (EJV)",

        "description":"It is generally acknowledged that all parties benefit from efforts to facilitate the process of student transfer from two- to four-year colleges, yet there are very few institutions with formalized transfer articulation agreements. The greatest deterrent to the development of such agreements is the considerable commitment of time and effort that is required to conduct the course-by-course analyses that serve as the foundation for the whole transfer articulation process. While determination of course content and overlap can be done individually on each participating campus, it is vital that personal face-to-face contact be made between representatives of each program. This contact facilitates the exchange of precise information, the adjudication of problems, and the development of  a professional network among the participating faculty members. An example of the effectiveness of this process is provided by the State University College at Plattsburgh (SUCP), which decided to formalize its articulation agreements with all of the community colleges in New York State in the mid-1970's. An important aspect of these articulation efforts was the decision to place the articulation agreements in a format that could be easily understood, readily available, and quickly updated. The time and effort involved in initiating this system was great, but once completed very little effort has been required to maintain and update it. Appendices include samples of transfer articulation agreements between SUCP and a community college for particular programs. (EJV)",

        "description":"Art exhibits on college campuses not only foster aesthetic appreciation and knowledge, but they also stimulate and encourage community involvement. In New Mexico, public and institutional policies permit the purchase of art to enhance public buildings, including institutions of higher education. At Eastern New Mexico University's Clovis Campus (ENMU-Clovis), a branch campus serving a community college mission, funds were set aside from the capital outlay appropriations for the purchase of art. A committee of local community citizens and faculty members was appointed to recommend purchases, commissions, collections, and displays of art works in buildings. In addition, the committee established criteria for the selection of art works, and provided incentives for gifts and loans  that added to the college's collection. The visual arts program at ENMU-Clovis has had numerous tangible and intangible benefits, including: (1) donors to the arts program have received tax savings, while the institution has realized an appreciation in the value of certain collectibles; (2) the art faculty has been prompted to conduct student art shows each semester; and (3) art exhibits are at least contiguous to various areas of work and study and therefore more readily accessible to students, faculty, guests, and all other employees. In the years to come, leadership from within the college and community, supported by national, state, and regional humanities organizations, will have important goals to attain and decisions to render so that the users of its facilities will continue to  have the opportunity to view, touch, and experience quality works of art through its visual arts program.

        "description":"The purpose of a peer tutoring program is to assist those students who require ongoing and formal instruction in a subject area. If effectively run, it can have an impact on retention. There are five areas that need to be addressed when initiating a peer tutor program: (1) organization and funding; (2) supervision; (3) tutor training; (4) tutor program evaluation; and (5) public relations. The Community College of the Finger Lakes' (CCFL's) peer tutor program serves to illustrate effective techniques in these five areas. Since its initiation in 1981, CCFL's program has grown from employing 6 tutors and providing 68 hours of tutoring in 1981-82 to 34 tutors and 755 hours of tutoring in 1984-85. The college's experience with the program has underscored the importance of putting the  rules and policies of the program in writing; training tutors in areas such as program rules, problem solving, questioning skills, and studying for particular subject areas; providing supervision, even if it is informal; collecting tutor and client evaluations; and mounting a good advertising campaign to attract tutors and clients. Appendices include a summary of the accomplishments of CCFL's tutor program, a Student/Client Diagnosis Checklist, tutor training materials, a bibliography of resources, questionnaires for both student and tutor, and public relations advertisements.

The study sought to determine the relative priorities of manufacturing establishments for training certain workers in certain skills; the status of education and training among manufacturing plants with CAD/CAM; training most likely to occur with different types of CAD/CAM equipment; and factors explaining variations among plants with respect to education and training. Two data sources were used for the study: a national probability survey of 393 firms conducted in August 1982, and Census Bureau data on industry-level characteristics from 1960 to 1980. Study results included the following:  (1) 45% of the plants with CAD/CAM sponsored an educational and training program; (2) on the average, 25% of the workforce at a plant received training, with the least attention given to design engineers and programs, and shopfloor staff displaced by the new equipment; (3) skills and knowledge areas covered by the training ranged from basic engineering to safety; however, many aspects of CAD/CAM were ignored; (4) most plants used vendors to provide training, and most offered either partial or full reimbursement for instruction outside the plant; (5) as CAD/CAM equipment was integrated, training needs dramatically increased; and (6) factors related to the provision of training programs included the integration and prevalence of automated equipment, and organizational factors such as size,  workforce composition and firm age. Recommendations and a discussion of implications are included. (LAL)",

        "description":"American higher education has isolated the enterprise of basic research and relegated it to the university, while simultaneously insulating the craft of teaching from the scholarship that nourishes it by identifying certain colleges, community colleges in particular, as \"teaching\" institutions. From the start, community colleges have not required that their faculty conduct research or publish in subject-matter areas. In fact, the heavy teaching loads required in community colleges leave teachers without the time or perhaps even the incentive to conduct scholarly research. Few community college faculty members have been able to keep abreast of their disciplines, and they enjoy fewer opportunities than their four-year college counterparts to participate in professional activities.  Consequently, faculty burnout is becoming the new academic disease, as faculty members teach from year to year without significant professional development. While there are currently many faculty development programs, most place emphasis on how to teach rather than on what to teach, affording little support for scholarly activities. Community colleges need to define a middle ground, blending subject-matter research with pedagogical scholarship, in order to promote intellectual revitalization, to engage the community as a resource, and to provide field experience for students. Such a program has been developed at Montgomery College (MC) in Maryland, where faculty receive support for activities such as writing for publication, participating in performing arts, creating an artistic work, or  holding a major office in a professional organization. In this way, MC is assured of having expert teachers, who are also experts in their fields. (EJV)",

The model was developed using adaptations of microcomputer software and tested using data from the Chancellor's Office of the California Community Colleges and from the Marin Community College District (MCCD). Conclusions drawn regarding MCCD included the following: (1) compared with similar districts in 1982-83, MCCD exhibited wider differences in its ratios to total operating costs for costs of instruction and instructional services, and maintainance and operations, than it exhibited in its ratios to total operating costs for costs of student services, and general services; (2) MCCD experienced a .71% change in average daily attendance from  1977-78 to 1982-83, while similar districts experienced a 9% to 10% change; and (3) compared with other districts, MCCD exhibited a 2% to 28% larger ratio of assignable square feet to average daily attendance, which may have influenced MCCD's cost of maintenance and operations. The study results showed the model to be a cost effective way for community college districts to compare their costs with similar districts on an average basis.

The sample consisted of approximately 4,000 administrators from a total population of 20,000 administrators in 1,600 institutions. Study findings were used to investigate the question of institutional crossover, i.e., the specific situation in which current four-year college and university administrators were previously employed at a two-year college. Of the 2,896 respondents to the survey, 170 (5.8%) had at one time held at least one position at a two-year institution. Responses from this group  indicated: (1) the largest percentage of two-year college crossovers (52.9%) were currently employed in liberal arts colleges, compared to 39.8% of the general sample; (2) barely 10% of the institutional crossovers were employed in doctoral-granting institutions; (3) the administrative positions most frequently held by two-year college personnel were student affairs officer (8.8%), registrar (7%), dean of continuing education (6%), chief academic officer (5%), and head librarian (5%); (4) like the general sample, the crossover group was comprised mostly of males, between 35 and 50 years of age, who held associate or full professor ranks; (5) the crossover group was better educated than their administrative peers; and (6) in comparison to crossover men, crossover women were more likely to  hold two--as opposed to three--degrees, were employed in a smaller number of positions, were more likely to have a mentor, and were younger.

The project served as an umbrella for several related activities, including a program for assessing the potential college skills of high school juniors. CTC's role in the state-supported testing program was to encourage all area schools to participate, to promote high levels of participation among the students, to work with Ohio State University to develop a more discriminating diagnostic test for math skills, and to identify an appropriate test for cost effectively assessing students' English skills. The results of the early assessment program have included: (1)  a 73% increase in senior math enrollments; (2) a decrease in the number of students needing remedial math courses from 34% in fall 1983 to 25% in fall 1984; (3) participation by 26 of 29 high schools in CTC's service area; (4) encouragement of students to take college-preparatory English courses rather than general ones; and (5) continuing interest in program participation by all of the schools involved in 1984-85. This description of CTC's involvement in the early assessment program presents information on the use of the Written English Expression Placement Test, including an outline of testing and feedback procedures for students and schools.

The specific high school subjects required for admission effective fall 1990 are 4 years of English, 3 years of social studies, 3 years of mathematics, 3 years of sciences, and 2 years of electives in foreign language, music, or art. This report discusses procedures for implementing these requirements in community colleges. After exploring the advantages of the admissions requirements, the problems yet to be addressed and resolved are identified. Next, the report examines issues related to the  establishment of a formal program admissions process involving application for admission; assessment and review of records; counseling, advising, and orientation; and acceptance/non-acceptance. Then, the report points to the need for each college to identify competency-levels in English, math, science, and social science. The next sections look at decisions to be made regarding acceptable alternatives for admission, the establishment of a &quot;conditional&quot; or &quot;provisional&quot; admissions category, and the possible need to redefine remedial education and to re-evaluate the college's AA and AS degree general education requirements. Finally, the report identifies a number of unresolved issues that need to be addressed system- and state-wide. (LAL)",

        "description":"Designed to generate discussion among community college faculty and administrators in Illinois, this report provides an examination of the associate degree as it has evolved in Illinois public community colleges, along with recommended guidelines and alternatives for further development. First, the report reviews the current context of educational reform at national and state levels, suggesting that greater consistency and salience of the associate degree would be achieved nationwide if all two-year colleges adopted the definition and parameters set forth in the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges (AACJC's) October 1984 policy statement. Next, information is presented on the associate degree in Illinois. Trends in degree titles and types of awards are examined,  indicating that currently nine different degree titles are used in the state. Problems and issues involved in reducing the number of awards in keeping with AACJC suggestions are identified. The next section focuses on graduation requirements for the associate degrees awarded, presenting tables of general education requirements by college. Three trends in general education requirements are identified in the report: (1) a reduction in the number of courses students may select to meet the distribution requirement at both community colleges and public universities; (2) a renewed emphasis on basic skills; and (3) the appearance of requirements designed to provide graduates with an appreciation of other cultures.

        "description":"Broome Community College (BCC) is developing a series of questionnaires to assess the impact of college on its students, and to measure the college's role, if any, in promoting social mobility. The first study in this series focused on the backgrounds, needs, and goals of students who entered BCC during June, July, and August of 1983. Students who had been admitted to the college for the fall term were asked to come to campus in groups of 30 or less for an all day program of orientation and counseling and to register for classes. All students who participated in the summer program (N=1698) completed a 34-item survey. Survey findings, based on 1686 usable responses, included the following: (1) 86.8% indicated they were first-time, full-time students; (2) 50.1% of the respondents  were male, 96.1% were white, 77.0% were under 18 years of age, and 94.0% were single; (3) 54.3% indicated their intention to work either full- or part-time while enrolled; (4) 33.9% indicated that their parents would be their main source of financial support; (5) 7.2% indicated that they had previously attended college; and (6) 85.5% had been admitted to their first-choice program. The study report includes data tables detailing survey responses and the questionnaire. (EJV)",

        "description":"A total of 128 middle- and upper-working class children in four age groups, ranging in 2-year intervals from 4 to 10 years of age and equally divided by sex, viewed 28 photographs of adults and children expressing seven emotions in order to explore developmental changes in children's ability to differentiate emotions. Emotions modeled were happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, surprise, and shame. Four tasks were posed; results of matching, labelling and comprehension tasks are reported. Whereas children in this sample showed a much greater deceleration of the curve of success than did Izard's (1971) sample, results from these London children are in some ways very similar to those obtained in his study of American and French children. The steep rise in successful recognition  and labelling he obtained in those children between 2 and 5 years is also shown in the steep rise found between the 4- and 6-year-olds of this sample. These subjects also displayed the marked difference between labelling and comprehension which may be indicative of their relative unfamiliarity with emotional terms and emotion as a field of discourse. Subjects frequently confused shame and sadness, fear and surprise, and anger and disgust. Happy, sad, frightened, and surprised expressions were those most easily discriminated, with happiness by far the best distinguished. (RH)",

It provides children with flexible supervision by caring, trained adults and gives them opportunities to grow into responsible, independent teens by planning and participating in activities on their own. The Check-In Program is designed to be sponsored and administered by an existing community group, such as a child care center, children's club, or service organization. The sponsoring agency recruits, hires, and trains the program's family day care providers. The providers care for and supervise children, plan projects, and offer friendship, support, and counsel. The two booklets which make up this document introduce the program,  explain how to implement and administer it, and suggest a training course for providers. The first booklet, an overview, describes the two Fairfax County, Virginia community service organizations which piloted the program and highlights the program's positive features. The second booklet describes how the program works and includes guidelines for staffing the program and for resolving licensing, zoning, and liability issues as well as for publicity, training, and evaluation.

Two groups of children from a university-operated laboratory school participated in this study: one group consisted of 8-, 9-, and 10-year-old students in the age-heterogeneous Intermediate Unit, and the second consisted of 11-, 12-, and 13-year-old students in the age-homogeneous Advanced Unit. Both groups of children responded to two rating scales measuring the children's interpersonal ratings of social distance and humorousness. Responses were analyzed using repeated measures and two-way between subjects ANOVAs. The results support the notion that gender  and age influence friendship preferences and humor perceptions. Within the age levels encountered in this study, cross-sex humorous perceptions are considerably lower than same-sex perceptions, and cross-sex social distance preferences are considerably higher than same-sex preferences. Twenty-two tables and 14 charts are appended. (BB)",

The following two research questions were addressed: (1) does participating in Head Start have any long term effects, and (2) how does the long term performance of the Head Start graduates compare to that of other students in the school system. The study examined the impact of Head Start participation (question 1) by comparing the performance of students who attended Head Start with that of a group of students who applied to Head Start but were not  admitted. Overall performance (question 2) was assessed by comparing the performance of Head Start graduates to that of all other students in the school system born in the same year. Specifically examined were the following: grade retentions, special education placements, standardized test performance, grades, type of courses selected (honors, remedial), and attendance. Findings generally indicated positive effects for all three groups, although weak design prevented the effects from being seen in the fourth and eighth grade groups. (DST)",

A total of 240 mothers of only child infants (l-l8 months) or of children 2-3 years old responded to an Infant or Child Series of drawings with an attached list of sentences. Subjects described situations in drawings, associated drawings with &quot;most natural&quot; sentence, and indicated age of baby in drawing. Results indicated that 1) some general characteristics of baby talk are modified according to the addressee's developmental level; 2) mothers with differing experiential levels choose different topics for talk; 3) the rule &quot;closeness to context&quot; works independently of addressee's developmental level and mother's experiential level; and 4) attribution  of meaning to specific situations is based on different elements grasped and given different valencies on the basis of addressee's developmental level and mother's experiential level. Preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that different representations of children, social partner's role, and the situation as a whole are responsible for different &quot;context readings&quot; is shown by the presence of partially different intentions and types of speech acts in experimental groups. Appendices include the Infant and Child Series of drawings, the basic list of sentences, and several figures. (BB)",

Twenty-four children at each of five age groups (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12), equally divided by sex, served as subjects. Three groups of tasks were administered: (1) the recognition of facial expressions from photographs, (2) the identification of target emotions contextualized in stories, and (3) the elicitation during conversation of children's accounts of situations which provoked emotions in themselves and in adults. Particularly emphasized were the differences in responses between the various age groups. The results maintained the grounding of emotion in the appraisal of situations and indicated that the understanding of situation increased with the growth  of experience in children. The study suggests that, if the development in children's understanding of emotion as an organized construct is to be investigated seriously, both their knowledge of situational factors and of internal psychological factors should be considered jointly to ascertain if and how these factors change with age and how they interact.

The report concludes that children enrolled in Head Start enjoy significant immediate gains in cognitive test scores, socioemotional test scores, and health status. In the long run, cognitive and socioemotional test scores of former Head Start students do not remain superior to those of disadvantaged children who did not attend  Head Start. However, a small subset of studies find that former Head Starters are more likely to be promoted to the next grade and are less likely to be assigned to special education classes. Head Start also has aided families by providing health and social and educational services and by linking families with services available in the community. Finally, educational, economic, health care, social service, and other institutions have been influenced by Head Start staff and parents to provide benefits to both Head Start and non-Head Start families in their respective communities.

Chapters eleven and twelve suggest methods for documenting and evaluating parent involvement. Chapter thirteen closes the handbook with some thoughts about how Head Start can affect families. Appended are suggestions for further reading and for finding resources in the community as well as lists of organizations providing information and materials for parent and child educators and those serving parents and children with special needs.

Contents are organized into three categories: safety procedures, planning a transportation system, and training strategies and activities. The section on safety includes guidelines for operational safety and emergency procedures. Topics covered range from vehicle maintenance and the rules of safe driving to procedures for accidents, breakdowns, and adverse road conditons. The section on planning addresses the roles and responsibilities of the key members of the transportation team: the transportation manager, bus driver, monitor, other  staff, and parents. Special attention is given to the selection and hiring process for bus drivers. In addition, worksheets organized according to questions likely to be asked by drivers, staff, and parents that will assist each Head Start agency in developing its own transportation policies are included. The training section contains sample activities for transportation inservice, addressing such topics as child development and discipline, bus safety, classroom and home safety games, and effective communication.

Consideration of the genesis of play in the child leads to doubt concerning the assumption that the identification of play is unproblematic because everyone knows play as framed. Freud's interpretation of the fantasy play of 18-month-old Ernst Halberstadt is a case in point, since it required familiarity with other features of the child's circumstances which could not be known by observation only. Quite likely it is necessary to take account of the individual child's reactional biography to  provide an adequate description of apparently spontaneous play. \"Framing,\" too, may have its genesis in reactional biography and may not withstand close study. Matthews and Matthews are correct to say that no scientific definiton of play exists. That does not mean it is not worth attempting to produce one. Deciding whether to abandon \"play\" as a candidate scientific term will ultimately require considerably more facts about playing and the identification of play than those presently known. (RH)",

Like parents in a number of countries, Glasgow parents used the idea of a &quot;Jenny with the Iron Teeth&quot; to threaten children who misbehaved at bed time. Research reveals that the Vampire Hunt of 1954 was one of a series of similar incidents taking place in Western Scotland over half a century before and since that date. If  such hunts are indeed relatively common, explanations may not be hard to find. The vampire hunt and another incident involving an attack by schoolchildren on gypsies appeared inexplicable to contemporary observers because certain features of childhood were overlooked. The best hope of understanding such incidents is to relate the children's behavior to their past histories and immediate circumstances. Such an inquiry seems possible without recourse to concepts such as &quot;play&quot; and &quot;delinquency.&quot; (RH)",

Data were collected from fall, 1979, through spring, 1982, in four Wisconsin schools. Primarily, subjects were approximately 240 students in grade 3 during the 1979-80 school year; these students were followed during their fourth- and fifth-grade years. Data were also collected from other students, parents, all teachers and other professional staff members who instructed any student in the study, and school and district administrative personnel. Reported are community, school  district, school, student, and teacher characteristics; the research methodology, including selection of variables; and results of regression analyses. Results revealed that no single set of teacher-related variables showed consistently stable relationships with student achievement across grade levels and subjects. Certain variables did appear in the final step-wise regression equations quite consistently, including years of teaching experience and number of professional magazines and journals read regularly. Several variables, such as satisfaction with teaching and some of the attitude and belief questions, seldom entered the final equations, or entered late and contributed little to the coefficient.

In the first study, observations of 69 teachers of kindergarten through sixth grade classes showed a peak in strategy suggestions at the second and third grades. Factor analysis showed that use of cognitive strategy suggestions by teachers is a unique aspect of instruction. Teachers showed awareness of developmental change and differences related to achievement level in their expectations for children's memory strategy use, memory knowledge, and use of memory monitoring abilities. The second study compared children whose teachers were either high or low in frequency of cognitive strategy  suggestions. Strategy use and metacognitive concepts of first through third grade children were assessed in a memory training task and in arithmetic and spelling tasks. Average and low achievers whose teachers were high in strategy suggestions showed strong maintenance of a trained memory strategy. Few differences related to teacher characteristics appeared on other tasks. The third aspect of the project was a workshop for elementary school teachers, in which information on memory and metacognitive development and memory training was presented, along with many examples of ways in which teachers can facilitate children's memory.

Thus, prevalence of several maternal emotions were predicted to be related to other measures of mother's psychosocial functioning, prevalence of children's emotions, and indices of children's social-emotional competence. Emotional displays of 29 mothers and their toddlers were coded on videotape. Children's social-emotional competence was rated globally during situations where mother was absent. Self-report and rating measures of each mother's  psychosocial functioning were also obtained. All predictions were upheld in the results. The relations of the affective environment to children's emotions and behavior were delineated by this methodology; maternal affective environment is related to concurrent indices of the child's social-emotional well-being.

By conducting a literature review, studying the role of the CPS case manager, and developing a case management model, the Case Management Project attempted to eliminate misunderstanding of CPS caseworkers' role. The review of the social work literature substantiated the fact that confusion exists about CPS caseworker roles. The survey asked physicians, attorneys, foster parents, teachers, and caseworkers to identify which of eight roles CPS workers performed and skills needed by protective service workers. Responses varied markedly among groups of respondents.  The model presumes that there are three main roles in CPS work: case manager, caseworker, and case specialist. Each role should be assumed by a different member of a &quot;case team.&quot; The three team members are ultimately responsible to a supervisor of case services. These four people make up the case team and handle cases as they are assigned to a CPS unit. Each of the three specialists takes the same role with each case assigned to the team. A paper summarizing the findings of the literature review, a paper summarizing the survey's results, and the proposed case management model are appended. (RH)",

Eight of the states had specified definitions for primary and secondary prevention; three states responded to the survey with policy documents focusing specifically on primary and/or secondary prevention; and 13 states indicated that they had a specific program that emphasizes primary and/or secondary prevention services. Analysis of the survey  information identified factors appearing to be significant in establishing a quality prevention program.

The project demonstrated a model of intensive intervention with families who had been referred to DHS's child protective services (CPS). Cases were assigned randomly to either DHS or DePelchin staff. The impact evaluation compared intensive services provided by DHS, standard DHS protective services, and intensive services provided by DePelchin staff. Main points of comparison were the effects of services on families and the cost of services. Due to the small number of clients served in the year, results were limited to  descriptive data. These data suggested that children from families receiving intensive services from either DHS or DePelchin staff were removed from their homes less frequently than those from families receiving standard DHS protective services. Cost comparisons indicated that while the per-family cost of DHS intensive intervention was higher than that of standard services, the low frequency of removals in intensive services cases resulted in lower costs for foster care. Costs for intensive intervention provided by DePelchin staff were slightly lower than those for DHS intensive services. The cost analysis is included in this report. (RH)",

Discussion of the concept and associated trends in care initially focuses on factors accounting for the recent interest in involving older adults in programs for young children. Types of intergenerational programs such as exchange, volunteer/aide, and employee programs are described. Objectives of intergenerational programs and benefits of intergenerational experiences for children and older adults are listed. Subsequent discussion focuses on administrative considerations for intergenerational exchange programs, volunteer programs, and employee programs. Included in the latter  section are discussions of trends regarding older volunteers and employees, age stereotyping, the inaccuracy of job-related age stereotypes, facts countering age bias, and common misconceptions about the economic condition of older adults, their involvement in society, and their attitudes about work and retirement. Concluding sections of the document concern training and staff development needs of older adults, related issues, and steps that will provide needed information about such programs and their effects.

It also explores the concept of adolescent/infant development as a means of providing comprehensive services to pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents, and their infants. The underlying premise for the concept of adolescent/infant development is that the development of both adolescents and infants must be facilitated. Important features of the model demonstration program developed at Howard University Hospital, designed to implement this premise, are that intervention with adolescent parents begins during pregnancy whenever possible and that follow-up services are  provided for 3 years after the birth of the baby. Major emphases of the program includes assisting the adolescent in continuing her education, encouraging her self-sufficiency and independence, and discouraging additional pregnancies during the adolescent period. These goals are achieved by using a holistic, family-centered approach to working with the adolescent parent/infant dyad. Four tables are appended. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Claims about the relative holding-power and play-versatility of toys either low or high in amount of realistic detail, such as miniature metal cars, were tested in a solitary play environment with and without the use of props. Subjects were 36 middle-class preschool children. Results suggest that, when structure is varied within the toy prototype, high-detailed cars had a greater holding power than low-detailed cars on children's pretend play, a finding contrary to prevalent claims. Significantly less distracted behavior occurred with high-detailed cars. Contrary to claims about the versatility of play, no significant differences were found between children exposed to high- and low-detailed cars in the number of play categories they engaged in. While props, such as roads, had  little impact upon the length of time children spent in pretend play, they did focus the children's play upon prototypic-theme behaviors. It is concluded that a prototypic toy seems to elicit a somewhat fixed repertoire of play behaviors in preschool children playing alone. Increasing the amount of realistic detail on the prototypic toy does not appear to enhance the versatility of toy-manipulation behaviors, but it does appear to influence the duration of play.

Using naturalistic methodology, social behavior was studied by observing interactions among children in classroom settings without direct adult supervision. In peer interactions, children were seen accomplishing social goals in three domains: affiliation goals, competence goals, and status goals. Examples of peer interactions in these three areas are described and serve as a basis for teachers in understanding social interaction in their classrooms, new ways of thinking about children's motives and values, and alternative frameworks for planning and implementing classroom activities. Four sets of teacher  roles which may help teachers organize their decisionmaking about social development in their classrooms are given: (1) establishing classroom social context, (2) modeling appropriate social behavior, (3) coaching appropriate social strategies, and (4) teaching social awareness.

        "description":"The primary aim of this discussion is to demonstrate that social pretend play is a process of negotiation involving children's attempts to reach minimal agreements in order to maintain the play activity. The second purpose is to show that the quality of negotiation changes in content and form as social pretense evolves and that this process is reflected in different phases of play. To these ends, the paper provides a theoretical framework for the discussion of shared and personal foundations of negotiations. Additionally, current research findings are reviewed in terms of developmental patterns in the negotiations that transpire during four phases of social play: (1) becoming a member of a play group; (2) making a transition into the pretend mode; (3) planning and maintaining  social pretend play; and (4) terminating pretend play. Concluding remarks point out that, while a complete cycle of social pretend play includes these four phases, not every instance of social pretense involves all four, the phases may not occur sequentially, and play can be terminated before the cycle is completed. Depending upon the degree of shared representation of events and forms of communication, children's play may take different forms. It is likely that play becomes more scripted with age, although it retains its personal qualities. Future research needs to identify developmental changes in the evoluation of play interaction.

Sections of the discussion focus on phases in the restructuring process: fantasy; pretending; panic; and the emergence of a new family reality involving conflict, re-working, and moving on. Characteristic of the fantasy phase are the 'good' and 'bad' fantasies about the new partnership and the new family. In the pretending phase, stepfamily members pretend to be the collection of fantasies they bring to the new family. Essentially, the panic phase arrives when one or more people in the family begin to recognize their unique, individual view of the family and of other  family members and, consequently, start to feel like an outsider. The conflict phase is that time in which the couple and/or family as a whole confront highly charged differences in values, traditions, histories, standards, styles, perceptions, and skills. During the re-working phase conflicts are perceived in new and different ways and members begin to create relationships. Now, moving on, stepfamily members are better able to appeciate and explore the differences within their new family, differences which often become assets. Experience suggests that movement through the process takes at least 4 years. (RH)",

Categories of children's verbal behavior included designating through pointing, pointing and speaking unintelligibly, verbal labeling with or without  pointing, and pointing with a question; questioning about television content by using &quot;wh&quot; and form questions, questions relating to self, and operative questions; repetition; and description. Categories of caretaker verbal behavior included designating through attention calling, labeling, correcting, and requesting a label; questioning; and parent responses to the child involving repetition, acknowledgement, directing behavior, and answering questions. The categories are compared to those reported for parent-child interactions outside the viewing experience, in particular, joint book reading. A model of television as a talking picture book is proposed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Dialogue from 30-minute samples from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood&quot; was coded for grammar, content, and discourse. Grammatical analysis used the LINGQUEST computer-assisted language assessment program (Mordecai, Palen, and Palmer 1982). Content coding was based on categories developed by Rice (1984) and consisted of counts of immediacy, emphasis, nonliteral meanings, novel words, and explicit instructions regarding the interpretation of content. Discourse categories were four types of narratives proposed by Health and Branscombe: recounts, accounts, event casts, and stories. Findings indicated that the programs' dialogue was appropriate to young viewers, showing adjustments like those made by adults speaking to young children. Mean length of utterance was  comparable to that of adults in interactions with children, the ratio of different words to total words equaled that of young children's language, sentence structure was simplified, and there was a pronounced emphasis on the here and now, as evidenced by a majority of present tense verbs, a high proportion of utterances about immediately visible topics or referents, and a preponderance of event casts as narrative structure. Repeated instances of linguistic emphasis were found, with frequent repetition of key terms. Both programs avoided complex word forms. Overall, the dialogue of educational children's programs follows the constraints and adjustments found in adults' child-directed language. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Children may be able to gain partial information about the meaning of a word from clues, such as how it is used in a sentence and what words it is contrasted with. This strategy, known as &quot;fast mapping,&quot; may provide a very useful first step in language learning. One question which arises from studies of fast mapping is whether fast mapping is available to children across various semantic domains, such as shape, texture, and color. A total of 50 children (with a mean age of 3 years, 8 months) participated in the first study, and 33 children (with a mean age of 2 years, 9 months) participated in the second. Children were introduced to a novel color, shape, or texture term by contrasting the new term with a well-known word from that domain. They were then tested for both their  ability to produce and comprehend the new term and whether they knew the semantic domain the word referred to. The data show that children can gain some information about the meaning of a word from a brief encounter. In contrast to rather slow and difficult hypothesis-testing mechanisms, fast mapping may allow the child to rapidly obtain information from the situation. By considering only a few hypotheses, the child can then quickly focus in on the correct meaning. (Author/RH)",

In order to create a pool of excellent teachers with the ability and skills to help other rural science teachers, the project provided training in science content, methodology, leadership, and staff development. Participants were selected from 141 districts in rural Kansas. Instructional activities were conducted during a 2-week summer period. One week--spent at the Cosmosphere--focused on space science and technology, and 1 week--spent at Kansas State  University--focused on science education and staff development. This paper includes discussion of project evaluation and follow-up activities planned or underway. A summary of project needs, objectives, and activities is provided along with criteria for participant selection. Appendices contain a needs assessment survey conducted with participants, participant application form, and guidelines for an action plan that each participant developed to implement changes in science instruction at the local level. The 4-step plan covers evaluating science teaching situations, school and district organization, evaluating proposed changes, and factors in implementing change. (JHZ)",

The conference was the result of a concern that a major problem in Alaskan education was the number of Alaskan Native students dropping out. The report contains twelve presentations by individuals actively involved in educating Alaskan Native students. The presentations focus on problems of Native students in public schools, accomplishments and criticisms of Native Alaskan education, development of cultural identity among the Tlingit people, Native American curriculum development, role of private  institutions, personal accounts of cultural background and cross-cultural schooling, overview of current research on Native education, and accomplishments of the Commissioner's Study Group on Native Achievement. Four conference themes emerged: the importance of the family in the educational process, the need for more early childhood education, the importance of schools which reflect the cultures of their students, and the importance of cultural integrity, character, and morality. Thirty-seven recommendations drawn up by discussion groups are grouped under topics of culture and identity, family responsibility, educational curriculum, cross-cultural settings, role of private colleges, and educational problems and strategies for change. A concluding statement summarizes events in Alaskan  education relevant to Native Alaskans during the year and a half following the conference. (LFL)",

During 1981 approximately 250,000 crew workers comprised 10% of hired farmworkers. Crew workers were 53% White, 28% Hispanic, and 19% Black or other racial/ethnic groups. Most lived in the Southeast, North Central Lake States, Southwest, and Lower Pacific Coast regions of the United States. Their earnings averaged $2,772 annually. Long-term crew workers (working more than 75 days in a crew) comprised 21% of all crew workers, were 59% Hispanic and 19% Black, were 25-54 years old, and were not high school graduates (87%). Short-term crew workers comprised about  79% of crew workers, were mostly young and White, and most were students doing farmwork during school breaks. Noncrew farmworkers averaged more days of farmwork in 1981 and had higher earnings than did crew workers, averaging $4,470 annually. Of the 9,774 people who registered for certification to hire farmworkers for crew work in 1981, 2,557 applied for Department of Labor authorization to transport workers to and from work, and 827 applied for authorization to provide housing for their employees.

        "description":"Outdoor education provides a setting in which students learn to discover things for themselves and should be an integral part of school curriculum. Beginning as soon as students and teachers step beyond the classroom, outdoor education employs methods of observation/discovery, research, and reflection. Small group instruction allowing full use of the five senses is necessary to a successful program as are references and resource materials at the program site. Teachers are not required to be subject specialists, but should have basic preparation in the techniques of outdoor education. An outdoor education committee is desirable to establish needs, articulate philosophies, plan the curriculum, collect resources and prepare materials, arrange inservice training, and evaluate the  program. Types of outdoor education programs include resident, day-long, recreational, or cultural/aesthetic and each of these can be academic-centered or camp-centered. Methods of correlating outdoor education with school curriculum include vertical articulation, horizonal articulation, and modular approaches. Program evaluation is essential and should focus on specific objectives, particularly the personal meaning of the outdoor experience for each individual. A list of 8 objectives for experiences gained in an outdoor education program are provided and 12-20 outdoor activities are suggested for each of 7 curriculum areas. (LFL) activities are suggested for each of 7 curriculum areas. A list of resources on outdoor education concludes the document. (LFL)",

Prior to the course, participants ranked the 17 course components in order of perceived importance, and following the course they indicated how effectively each component was delivered. Importance and performance ratings were plotted on a matrix divided into four quadrants: (1) highest importance and highest performance; (2) lower importance and high performance; (3) lower importance and low performance; and (4) high importance and low performance. Results indicated the VOBS successfully met the expectations of students in the areas of overall course rating, expedition/wilderness  travel, solo, skills training, first aid/emergency care training, and rock climbing. Components rated very important but judged low in performance were whitewater activities, food quality, basecamp activities, group dynamics, ropes course, and transportation arrangements. These items should receive priority attention in program improvement efforts while items rated low in importance and performance warrant less attention, and items rated low in importance and high in performance can be left alone. The importance-performance matrix can help managers evaluate programs and compete more successfully in the outdoor/experiential education market. (JHZ)",

Responses indicated that a \"typical\" HEP student is 17-21 years old; speaks English or Spanish; has 2-7 siblings; is the child of parents who have not graduated from high school; left school at age 16 or 17; left school in the 10th or 11th grade; was not enrolled in a migrant program in school; attended school regularly; decided to return to school with the advice and encouragement of family members or  friends. The three most frequently given reasons for leaving school were failing in classes, not liking school, and having very few credits for graduation. HEP students' responses confirmed findings that being average for grade placement puts students at risk for dropping out--less that 6% of HEP students surveyed were at or above grade level when they left school.

The study found that Indian student enrollment had increased 2.3% from 1983 to 1984; average daily attendance was 4% less than for non-Indian students; dropout rates for Indian students in grades 9-12 was 33.2% in Bureau of Indian Affairs schools and 24.4% in public schools receiving Johnson-O'Malley funds; and an estimated 4.5% of Indian children were not enrolled in an educational program. Data for the study were gathered primarily from questionnaires returned by 41 Bureau of Indian Affairs or contract schools and 13 offices of education in states with schools receiving Johnson-O'Malley funds. Other data  sources included onsite visits and telephone interviews with officials in agencies concerned with Indian education. The difficulties encountered in obtaining exact data about the Indian student population were described, including no universally accepted definition of Federally recognized Indians, no uniform data gathering or recordkeeping system for Indian students, no central data depository, fequent student transfers between schools, and variations in computation of average daily attendance.

Most testimony concerned S. 1298, which addresses the problem of alcohol and drug abuse among Indian youth by requiring: more coordination of information and services between the BIA and the Indian Health Service (IHS); training of all personnel working directly with Indian youth; a more comprehensive education program in BIA schools; alternative placements for children arrested for drug and alcohol related offenses; and more comprehensive alcohol and  drug abuse treatment centers that include detoxification facilities, counseling services, and follow-up care. This report includes the texts of the bills, transcription of the hearing proceedings, and numerous prepared statements from government agencies and tribal organizations. Statements from the BIA and IHS support the goals of S. 1298 but do not support the bill as a means to achieve those goals.

        "description":"Computers are integrated into science education when they are used as the most appropriate tool or delivery system to support the goals of science education. The goals of science education can be condensed into two general areas. One area concerns the preparation of a science-literate citizenry; the second area concerns understanding the interrelationships of science, technology, and society. Current uses of computers that support these goals include: (1) direct instruction software, which use drill and practice, tutorials, or a combination of both; (2) exploratory software, which allow students to explore a system, manipulate variables, and observe outcomes (including simulation, problem-solving, and inventory programs); and (3) software used in laboratories, business, and  industry (laboratory interfacing systems, word processors, database management systems, spreadsheets, and graphing/numerical analysis). To achieve integration of computers into science education requires planning, preparation, and well-organized classroom management strategies. For decision-makers (the change agents), this requires involving science teachers in an active integration process, providing inservice training, organizing a curriculum development effort, and providing such incentives as release time for curriculum development, stipends for additional work, and recognition for the results.

However, when they are introduced to formal mathematical symbols, they fail to see the connection between the manipulations they learn for these symbols and the informal strategies they use to solve the problem. MATHBOXES is designed to help children make this  connection.

The instrument, developed in accordance with the Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) theory of attitude assessment, can be used by junior secondary science teachers or administrators to assess student attitudes toward the subject science or to provide feedback on how positively or negatively students view various science-related activities. The report contains: (1) an introduction; (2) a literature review in four parts: rationale for the promotion of positive attitudes toward science; research which considered student attitudes in science education; attitudes toward science compared to scientific attitudes; and methodological issues related to suggested improvements in  attitude toward the subject science research; (3) an overview of the Ajzen and Fishbein theory of reasoned action; and (4) the development and testing of the ATSSS' validity and realiability, in terms of assessing students attitudes toward the subject grade 10 science. A copy of the ATSSS and scoring instructions are provided in an appendix. (Author/JN)",

Microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) and model-solving tools illustrate the educational potential of the technology. These tools include modeling software and three MBL packages (which are described in this paper): (1) The Bank Street Laboratory, a large hardware, print, and software package which enables students to perform a wide variety of experiments involving light, temperature, and sound; (2) Exploring Heat, an MBL unit developed with special attention to the needs of mildly learning disabled late elementary school students; and (3) Experiments in Chemistry, a secondary/college-level package for recording, graphing,  and analyzing pH, electromotive force, and temperature data. MBL and dynamic modeling software are important to science education because they complement each other. In addition, students do science, activities become more student-centered, and software has applicability to many grade levels. Extensive in-class testing shows that the desirable characteristics for the successful educational use of both MBL and dynamic modeling software include ease of use, fast feedback, the computer's computational ability, and use of graphical output.

Notes taken during and tape-recordings of the interviews were used to identify the following types of misconceptions, namely, graph as picture, slope/height confusion, centering on one variable only, linearity of scale, initial positioning at the zero point on the axis, and a static (rather than dynamic) conception of graphs. Two major  misconceptions, both of which have been observed with college populations, were documented in the preliminary analysis of three items. The first misconception (graph as picture) was strongly exhibited in a bicycle problem (dealing with elevations and speed). For example, subjects drew a picture when asked to make a graph, and when presented a graph, they read it as a picture. The second misconception (slope/height confusion) was found in a problem dealing with graphs of temperature versus time of day. (JN)",

This descriptive study determined the impact of MBLs on middle school students' understanding of graphs of distance and velocity. The study was based on the premise that understanding the use and interpretation of symbol systems such as graphs is a central developmental task for all children. Sixth-grade students received five MBL lessons on distance and velocity, where they were challenged to construct different kinds of graphs via their own movements and the movements of a toy cart. Results (based on classroom observations and a post-intervention quiz which required students to match  graphs with written descriptions of these graphs) indicated that after experience with MBL, students could accurately match complex graphs of physical phenomena with written descriptions of these graphs. Children attained a mean accuracy level of 85 percent on the matching task which involved graphs of position and velocity (including negative velocity). Observations corroborated these findings, and showed that students' understanding of graphs was resistant to countersuggestion. By linking the concrete and the abstract, MBL may be providing a bridge that facilitates the development of formal operational thinking. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"Graphing is a common and powerful symbol system for representing concrete data. Yet research has shown that students often have graphical misconceptions about how graphs are related to the concrete event. Currently, the Technical Education Research Center (TERC) is developing microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL) science units that use probes to gather data on such physical phenomena as motion, heat and temperature, and response time. With these probes attached to a microcomputer, real time graphs can be displayed of data as they are being collected. The research component of the project is looking at graphing misconceptions (such as confusing the graph of an event with a picture of the event) and how MBL can help students to learn graphing skills. Preliminary results suggest  that MBLs do help in improving graphing skills. Attributes of the MBL science laboratories that seem important in this include: (1) the grounding of the graphical representation in the concrete action of the students; (2) the inclusion of different ways of experiencing the material (visual, kinesthetic, and analytic); and (3) the fast feedback that allows students to immediately relate the graph to the event.

        "description":"A promising new development in science education is the use of microcomputer-based laboratory tools that allow for student-directed data acquisition, display, and analysis. Microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL) make use of inexpensive microcomputer-connected probes to measure such physical quantities as temperature, position, and various physiological indicators. This paper discusses the use of a MBL motion probe in a sixth-grade classroom and in two college physics courses at Tufts Univerity which are primarily designed for humanists. The probe (developed from a sonic transducer used in Polaroid cameras) was used in both settings to teach relationships among position, velocity, and acceleration of objects as a function of time by use of immediate (real-time) graphical  representations shown on a computer screen. In both cases the motion of the students' own bodies was initially used to teach the concepts involved. Results of observations, written work, and examinations show substantial student understanding of motion and graphing. Preliminary observations indicate that the linking of concrete measurement of an actual physical system with the simultaneous production of the symbolic representation may be an effective way for students to learn to correctly interpret and produce graphs.

A 1978 survey of faculty suggested the need for a single volume that united introductory material on the various social science disciplines and the classroom experience of faculty already teaching in the field. This volume is the response to that need. It focuses primarily on the space shuttle era (1980s and 1990s) and is divided into four parts. Chapter one outlines characteristics and attributes of the shuttle and the technologies scheduled for transport to orbit. Chapter two is organized into sections representing seven disciplines (economics, history, international law and relations, philosophy, political science, psychology, and sociology) which  allow faculty to relate a specific discipline to space technology and to adapt space-related issues to the teaching of that discipline. Chapter three presents materials for teaching interdisciplinary courses and topics, including observations from instructors who have offered such courses, and insights from faculty who have analyzed space technologies in debate format. The last section contains appendices with representative bibliographies, syllabi, and other materials (organized by discipline or interdisciplinary approach) which are most useful in curriculum development rather than for identifying teaching objectives.

Individual clinical interviews were used to identify the strategies used by 48 Nigerian schooled children from grades 1 through 4 and 47 Nigerian unschooled children from ages 7- to 14-years-old to solve a broad range of addition and subtraction  word problems. Results revealed that the performance of schooled and unschooled children was similar, although unschooled children used the more advanced strategies at older ages than schooled children. As grade or age level increased, solution strategies of both groups of children moved from direct modeling strategies to number of facts learned, both at the recall level and derived from other number facts. Children performed significantly better when problems were presented in their native language than when they were presented in English. (Author/JN)",

Following an introductory section describing the incomplete or biased portrait of Latin America frequently presented in social studies textbooks and the media, four considerations for including more about Latin America in the curriculum are listed: (1) foreign policy--international controversies over the influence of other governments in the politics of Latin America need analysis and examination; (2) physical proximity--Latin American countries are virtually  next-door neighbors, with close political, commercial, and cultural interactions with the United States extending over many years, (3) the American heritage--Latin American culture and the Spanish language are part of the American heritage, exerting early and continuing influence on the southwestern region of the United States, and (4) negative stereotyping--it is well documented that Hispanic-Americans in general suffer from explicit negative stereotyping. The world history course is recommended as an especially fertile ground for introducing a Latin American perspective into a study of world events.

Research findings on cooperative techniques in the classroom are summarized as follows: compared with other methods, cooperative learning produces greater academic learning, better intergroup relations among black, white, and Hispanic students, enhanced self-esteem, and improved relationships between mainstreamed academically handicapped students and other students. Brief sections describing the positive effects of cooperative learning are followed by descriptions of three widely used approaches to cooperative learning: (1) Student  Teams-Achievement Divisions (STAD)--a method in which students with widely varying academic abilities are assigned to four- or five-member teams; (2) the &quot;Jigsaw&quot; method--in which students become &quot;experts&quot; on a topic, then meet with other experts to study their assigned topic; and (3) the Group Investigation Model, which attempts to eliminate competition entirely by involving cooperative group inquiry emphasizing data gathering by pupils, interpretation of information through group discussion, and synthesis of individual contributions into a group project.

A distinction between peace education and nuclear war education is followed by a description of four basic themes offered as a rationale for peace and nuclear war education: peace and nuclear war education are appropriate content for developing capable, thinking, competent young adults; peace and nuclear war-related content are highly relevant in today's world; openly addressing and confronting psychological concerns of young people regarding nuclear war with information and appropriate pedagogy can help young people cope with these concerns; and by addressing peace and nuclear issues,  teachers can prepare young adults for participation in the nation's democratic institutions by helping them make decisions regarding leaders and policy. Challenges for dealing with the controversial nature of peace and nuclear war education include (1) those teaching peace and nuclear war education must familiarize themselves with both the content and processes necessary for credibly teaching this information and must take great care in selecting only age-appropriate lessons; (2) the controversial nature of peace and nuclear war education must be recognized, confronted, and honestly addressed; and (3) advocates of peace and nuclear war education need to work diligently, patiently, and cooperatively in bringing about the changes they seek.

A section synthesizing the findings of six recent studies characterizing elementary and secondary students as illiterate in geography is followed by an examination of possible reasons for the problem. Positive steps to improve geography education include the development of guidelines focusing on what should be taught in geography by the National Council for Geographic Education and the Association of American Geographers. Short- and long-term tasks to  promote geography education include the development of grade-by-grade curriculum guidelines with activities; a network of people to serve as consultants in geography education; model workshops and materials for improving geography education; an information network in geography to share news about such things as new materials, notes on important reports, workshops, conferences, and professional training; the addition of a geographic component to admissions requirements at some colleges; and the addition of geography as a required course in the high school curriculum.

Separate sections describe the rise of censorship, recent court cases and incidents related to library censorship, who the censors are, what is being censored, a framework for academic freedom in schools, and a distinction between selection and censorship. Following a discussion of the recent rise of censorship in the nation's classrooms and school libraries, a comparison of the views of proponents of academic freedom and the views of proponents of censorship is offered. Recent court cases and incidents related to library censorship are offered as examples of the recent challenges coming from the conservative side of the political  spectrum by leaders such as Phyllis Schlafly, Jerry Falwell, and Mel and Norma Gabler. Examples of the most frequent targets of protests are followed by a framework which librarians and other decision makers may use to maintain the right of academic freedom. This framework holds that educators may use methods, symbols, or materials (1) relevant to the subject matter being taught, (2) not in violation of valid laws, (3) compatible with current standards of decency, (4) reasonable for students' level of maturity, (5) intended for a legitimate educational purpose, and (6) unlikely to result in substantial disruption of school activities. A distinction between selection and censorship is made and the importance of sustaining a commitment to the concept of academic freedom is emphasized.  (LH)",

The digest considers key challenges that the course poses for educators, the goals of the conference, long-term efforts that have been initiated, activities recommended by conference participants that would provide practical help to local schools, and current efforts to implement conference recommendations. Challenges facing educational leaders as they attempt to strengthen their world studies courses include the fact that there is no universal approach for teaching &quot;world studies,&quot; that there is no mechanism for educational leaders to identify and assess successful practices, and that there is a critical need to help teachers and administrators enhance  their capacity to teach world studies. Conference goals are then outlined, followed by four activities recommended as a way of providing practical help to local schools: (1) the development of a handbook outlining and analyzing alternative conceptual approaches to high school world studies courses, (2) the collection and dissemination of syllabi and other appropriate descriptions of world studies courses being taught in high schools across the nation, (3) the development of model resources for developing a global relations course, and (4) the strengthening of preservice and inservice programs by focusing on leadership and teacher preparation.

Uses of database software are discussed and examples of commercially available database software programs are also provided. That database development and maintenance are fast becoming essential skills for effective citizenship participation is offered as a compelling rationale for incorporating this tool into social studies instruction.

A review of literature on the best methods of effecting change in teaching behaviors so as to bring about effective instruction is presented, focusing upon the role of the cooperating teachers. The problem under investigation consisted of the following questions: given the association of a cooperating teacher strong in the use of ATB with a student teacher untrained in ATB, will the student internalize and manifest those behaviors without the intervention of an ATB observational instrument with stresses on the Active Teaching  Behaviors? Similarly, will the use of an observation instrument yield a higher level of the use of ATB in the student teacher associated with the cooperating teacher who is high in ATB? Conversely, given the association of a cooperating teacher low in the use of ATB behaviors with a student teacher untrained in ATB, will the use of the ATB observational instrument cause the student teacher to display higher levels of ATB than a student teacher in a similar pairing, but not using the ATB observational instrument? The research procedures are described and a discussion of the results is presented. Follow-up interviews with student teachers and cooperating teachers provide a basis for considering the effectiveness of the observational instrument as a means of improving active teaching  behaviors.

The purposes of the agenda building effort are discussed and descriptions are offered of activities that took place and some of the results of the project. In discussing the overall conceptual framework which was developed to guide the 18 month agenda building process, it is pointed out that emphasis was placed upon viewing teacher education as occurring across a professional continuum as it is experienced by teachers, rather than disjointedly as it is organized institutionally. This continuum consists of preservice training and preparation, induction, and inservice education. Examples are given of teacher education topic areas in which research  has been conducted, or further research is needed: (1) content of preservice education, induction, and inservice teacher education; (2) design and delivery of preservice, induction, and inservice teacher education; (3) collaboration of delivery systems; (4) social, political, economic, and cultural contexts of teacher education; (5) strategies and limitations of research for contributing to the development, design, and evaluation of the teacher education continuum; (6) present research perceptions of teachers and teacher educators as learners; and (7) how research findings can be shared and disseminated.

The first issue discussed is ability grouping; it is pointed out that this practice does not necessarily increase academic achievement, particularly in the lower level achievement groups. Another issue discussed is the potential threat to human development and dignity by too much emphasis on training in basics and insistance on academic excellence to the detriment of a sense of self-worth and interest in the broader societal values on the part of the student. The problem of the impact of students holding jobs outside of school on their classroom performance is considered, and several research findings  on the topic are cited. A brief article warns researchers that reform proposals need healthy skepticism and awareness of the realities of the classroom.

        "description":"At the conclusion of each student teaching semester, 50 student teachers enrolled at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale were asked to list positive and negative influences of their cooperating teachers. The study was conducted over a period of three years with three different sets of student teachers. Listings of the participants fell into three categories: interpersonal relationships, personality, and professional ability or expertise of the cooperating teachers. Results indicated that student teachers want and need constant and on-going feedback given in a tactful and polite way. Negative criticisms as well as positive were acceptable. Student teachers felt they did their best work when the teacher was friendly, accepting, understanding of the trauma of student teaching,  and exhibited confidence in the ability of the student teacher in various areas. It is suggested that pitfalls to be avoided by cooperating teachers with student teachers are failure to offer critiques or feedback, and failure to develop better relationships with their student teachers.

The Intern Teaching Program for College Graduates (ITPCG) is designed for liberal arts and science graduates who wish to become teachers. ITPCG started in 1954 with two major purposes: to draw capable arts and science graduates into teaching and to meet the then shortage of teachers. The second program, Temple University's add-on certification program in mathematics and general science, was developed at the request of the School District of Philadelphia. The add-on program seeks certified teachers who wish to add mathematics or general science to their teaching credentials and has as its purpose to move teachers from overstaffed to underserved teaching areas. Though each  has a different target population and a separate mission, the older program has influenced a number of programmatic decisions of the newer one. Major similarities and some differences between the programs are described, and a brief outline is offered of meaningful lessons learned from developing the programs. These may be applicable to fifth year and internship teacher training programs. (JD)",

The goal of the Rockhurst College Teacher Education Program (Kansas City, Missouri) is to prepare teachers who will be able to engage in critical inquiry through reflective action. It is hoped that Rockhurst graduates will teach with an awareness of alternatives for teaching practices and an awareness of the origins and consequences of these alternatives. Moreover, they are being prepared with the skills necessary to select, organize and implement curriculum based on a  considered and communicated rationale. This view of teaching involves making problematic students' taken-for-granted assumptions about schools, teaching, and learning as they develop the ability to analyze the schooling process. At the core of the program is the notion that teaching is dialogical and that language facility provides the means to achieve reflective action. (Author)",

        "description":"The proposed study will examine whether effective clinical supervision requires supervisors who practice certain strategies and procedures as they dialogue with supervisees in the conference, or whether the mere acquisition by supervisors and/or supervisees of research-verified knowledge about teaching and learning, e.g., the role of academic feedback in pupil learning, is sufficient to improve the classroom teaching of the supervisee. This \"process\" vis-a-vis \"content\" investigation will be examined in the light of the supervisor conceptual level. \"Process\" strategies and procedures have been identified only in high conceptual level supervisors. This study may demonstrate that these strategies are associated with a positive effect on supervisee teaching. Where practicing  supervisors are not using these strategies, they could be taught as a compensatory model for improving effects of supervisory intervention. It is suggested that \"content\" about teaching and learning in itself is associated with positive effects on supervisee classroom teaching. It is tentatively concluded that supervisors and/or supervisees merely need to be exposed to such knowledge. Where only supervisees are exposed to the \"content\" amd the effects on their classroom teaching are found to be positive, the viability of supervisory intervention is questionable, and different organizational means to bring about improved classroom teaching should be sought.

Ratings were provided by the teachers, students, local supervisors and building directors. The population included 164 vocational high school teachers from two schools in western Ohio. The Teacher Reaction Profile was administered to teachers and their spouses or close friends. The Classroom Observation Checklist was used to measure frequency, bothersomeness and teacher tolerance of a specific list of classroom behaviors. A select group of teachers were observed in their classrooms in order to authenticate the tolerance measures from the instruments. An analysis of findings  presents the degree of relationship between: (1) teacher tolerance to life events and measures of disciplinary effectiveness; (2) teacher tolerance of misbehavior scores as perceived by teachers, and disciplinary effectiveness ratings of supervisors; (3) teacher tolerance of misbehavior scores as perceived by students, and disciplinary effectiveness ratings; (4) teacher demographic variables and teacher tolerance scores; and (5) teacher demographic variables and disciplinary effectiveness ratings.

        "description":"This monograph grew out of an effort to develop a new and comprehensive system for evaluation of teacher education programs at Ohio State University (OSU). The need for a more sophisticated evaluation system became apparent as it was noted that follow-up studies revealed that many graduates of the College of Education took their first jobs unequipped with many skills the curriculum was supposedly providing. Also, the system had no feedback loop which would enable the College to identify and correct student and program deficiencies. The monograph provides an overview of the literature on teacher education evaluation systems, and describes issues at OSU that can be generalized to other institutions. Descriptions are provided of the student and program evaluation system that has  emerged at OSU, including its conceptual base, the components of the system, and its implementation process. The instrumentation used in the program is presented, as well as analyses of data produced from the system. Discussions are included on the implications drawn from the findings of the system, the proposed next steps in the system's development, and the significance of such a system to the improved effectiveness of the teacher education enterprise. It is believed that this system is replicable in whole or in part in many other settings, and special care is taken to explain the rationale, to provide many examples of forms and materials used, and to document the implementation process at each step of the way. Appendixes present: a hypothetical individual profile; the Freshman Early  Experiencing Program (FEEP) exploration profile, 1982-83; an analysis of teacher candidate profile ratings, 1982-83; a summary of findings from a follow-up questionnaire, 1982-83; and elements, activities, and strategies for implementing an evaluation system.

The study examined patterns of microcomputer adoption and implementation in both rural and urban school districts. Specific research objectives were to describe: (1) actual computer adoption processes; (2) actual computer implementation processes; and (3) the relationship of these two processes to theoretical models of educational innovation. Three theoretical models of the innovation process were examined: (1) research, development, and dissemination model; (2) social interaction model; and (3) problem solving model. Two important findings were that educators were more concerned with the feasibility of the innovation than  with its potential for improvement of instruction and that the implementation process itself tended to change the innovation. While the theoretical models were useful in understanding the change process, the models were more normative than descriptive.

        "description":"This paper defines a strategic site for research in classroom management, namely, the tension between management and curriculum. Programs of action in classrooms are defined both by the rules for social participation and the demands of academic work. Academic work is directly involved in the process of achieving classroom order, and can be shaped in basic ways by a teacher's management decisions. The research reviewed in this paper suggests that academic work can be swamped by the management function in teaching, and teachers can become preoccupied with getting work accomplished rather than promoting student learning. When this happens, management limits students' opportunities to learn, even though engagement may be high. In such circumstances, a well-managed class would not be  a high achieving class. At the same time, some challenging academic tasks are difficult to manage in classrooms. When such tasks are being used, the class may not score high on such management indicators as attention and engagement. Nevertheless, students are being afforded the chance to learn important aspects of the curriculum. Two implications of these considerations are discussed: (1) content needs to be included in studies of classroom management, and (2) resolving the tension between management and curriculum in classrooms may actually require a greater emphasis on management.

        "description":"The lack of clear consensus among cooperating teachers and university advisors about expectations for the student teacher role ties in closely with the confusion that currently exists about the respective supervisory roles. Student teaching continues in many programs to be structured around the traditional triad which has been characterized as lacking clear agreement about the roles played by each member. This paper reports a Canadian replication of American (1964-1971) research seeking to clarify role expectations for the student teaching triad. Subjects were classroom teachers, students enrolled in a teacher training program at the University of British Columbia, and the university faculty who act as field advisors. Results of the study revealed that while the advisors in the  American study felt that cooperating teachers should not inform student teachers of the aims and objectives of teaching in the district, the Canadian advisors strongly endorsed the expectation that cooperating teachers initiate student teachers into the ethos and context of the district in which the practice teaching takes place. These different responses appear to reflect the general intellectual, moral, and cultural climate of the times rather than differences between American and Canadian cultures. The implications for teaching and teacher education of those tendencies to move from a more liberal and critial-reflective university-based program to a field-based, practitioner supervised, on-the-job training as the preferred form of teacher socialization are pointed out.

The majority of student teachers were found to prefer styles of Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random. Constructs were elicited from students as they compared and contrasted different teacher role types (e.g., Best Teacher, Most Understanding). The \"Planet\" computer program (Shaw, 1982) was utilized to determine similar patterns and relationships that existed in the subjects' construct systems. As predicted, students whose style preference was Concrete Sequential had a tendency to rate all the teachers with negative or positive characteristics the same on the repertory grid. An analysis of the  constructs revealed categories of: personal traits, teaching qualities, and techniques. Shifts in styles were found to have corresponding changes in underlying cognitive structures. Awareness of style types and cognitive structures appears to need further research and consideration for inclusion in teacher education practices. (Author)",

Chapter three repeats the same structure with the general issue, &quot;What guidelines should govern the evaluation of students?&quot; The fourth chapter elaborates  on how the teachers with an interactive orientation have some similarities with the teachers with a responsive orientation on what they do and do not emphasize, but differ on the meaning of what is central and matters most to them in student evaluation.

Ninety-five percent of the respondents supported high school graduation exams and junior high promotion tests. Participants also wanted tangible evidence of teacher competence and initiative. More than 80 percent favored national teacher exams and teachers working during the summer to improve their teaching. About two-thirds were ready to support measures designed to attract and retain good teachers, including increasing teachers' salaries and/or offering merit pay to outstanding  teachers. Respondents were opposed to school closings and cutbacks in extracurricular activities as ways to pay for these reforms; most preferred paying higher taxes instead. About one-third of the survey's participants said they would abandon support for more rigorous course work if their children had to give up athletics or other extracurricular activities to have time enough for schoolwork.

Computer equipment and  software was not adequate for use in the guidance program. Job analysis showed that most activities of counselors facilitate the accomplishment of guidance goals and objectives. Surveys showed that an assessment of student needs was not implemented. Several need areas which had not been addressed were identified. There was a discrepancy between junior and senior high schools with regard to adequacy of services, but impact of counselors on guidance consumers was positive. Survey instruments for guidance counselors, administrators, students, teachers, and parents with response results are included in the 12 appendices. (LMO)",

        "description":"The College Assistance Program (CAP) in the Dade County (Florida) Public Schools was established in 1977 to encourage and assist the efforts of high school seniors to pursue post-secondary education. This evaluation of CAP was designed to examine the extent to which the program was meeting its goals and providing a worthwhile service. The evaluation was conducted by means of: (1) survey instruments distributed to administrators and guidance personnel, (2) interviews with administrators, guidance personnel, and students, (3) data collected by the Office of Student Support Programs, and (4) data supplied by the College Admissions Services Office. The overall perceptions of administrators and guidance personnel about CAP were positive. Data from students who graduated from 1976  through 1980 showed a slight increase in percentage stating they received adequate information regarding college admissions, with a larger increase occuring after CAP's inception. There was a widely perceived need by administrators and guidance personnel to have CAP advisors available in most schools on a full-time, five days a week basis, and to have advisors spend more time with students in lower grades. CAP, Inc., has increased the amount of funds it had available for scholarships since the early days of the program. Appendices contain the College Assistance Program Survey and the Student Interview questionnaire. (LMO)",

This article introduces a steering mechanism as the prerequisite for a study of knowledge work and maintenance on empirical grounds. Knowledge is treated synthetically, that is, as something that exists only through the individual's cooperation with its environment, which implies that criteria can be formulated for the isolation of knowledge processes. Specific processes may then be studied and interpreted with reference to manipulable factors and to the influence of these factors on measuring processes and theory construction. (Author)",

In this paper, no distinction is made between state anxiety and trait anxiety. It is suggested that state and trait anxiety may be considered apart from behavioral consistency. The issue of dramaturgical quality is discussed: if a person performs a persuasive task well, he or she is thought of as persuasive, whether or not the person's behavior is consistently persuasive. It is suggested that special instructions be given to the examinee in order to measure anxiety. Instead of the usual instructions to &quot;record five adjectives to describe yourself,&quot; one might say, &quot;record five adjectives to indicate how you feel.&quot; This paper consists primarily of the  following sections: (1) the author's work involving the concept of anxiety; (2) methods of scoring anxiety with the AGT, and their reliability and validity; (3) strengths and weaknesses of AGT; and (4) research and application using AGT measures of anxiety. This research includes the effect of listening to music, sex differences, relaxation training, and individuals' therapy. A five-page list of references concludes the paper. (GDC)",

The system was created to support the course evaluation system at Athabasca University, a distance education university in Canada. The courses evaluated were all home study courses, and they varied significantly in design and with respect to the kinds of instructional materials they incorporated. Consequently, the evaluation questionnaires were custom tailored to each course, and little standardization was possible among courses. The sheer volume and variety of questionnaires required that some form of computer support be used. Within two years, the system supported the evaluation of 42 different courses requiring  125 distinct questionnaires. Software was written in the C programming language to run on a VAX 11/780 under the UNIX operating system. This configuration allowed for text editing features, specific and global scanning, and global alteration of sets of codes. Technical aspects of the system, as well as its limitations, were discussed in detail. (LMO)",

The method--Program Development Evaluation (PDE)--calls for researcher-practitioner collaboration in the design, implementation, and evaluation of programs to increase school effectiveness. Two Baltimore City junior high schools are working with Johns Hopkins researchers to reduce school disorder, increase attendance, and improve educational attainment. Both schools used the PDE method to design programs during 1982-83 and implemented them during 1983-84. The present evaluation shows that the schools are improving as a result of the project. Large and consistent increases were observed in staff morale, effective administration, and in teachers' reports of their schools as  places where innovative planning and action occur. Findings also imply decreased school disruption and increased achievement. This report describes the projects, summarizes data on implementation, and recommends ways to facilitate the application of the PDE method in future projects. Appendices include profiles of school climate, non-Effective School Battery scales, teacher characteristics measures, and results for all program outcomes. (Author/LMO)",

Arizona moved from Legislative directive in April 1980, to the implementation of the Arizona Teacher Proficiency Examination in June 1981. The Basic Skills component of the ATPE was a four hour, 150 question test made up of three parts: reading, grammar, and mathematics. A passing grade was 80 percent on each subtest. In April 1984, legislation was signed requiring students entering teacher education programs to pass the Basic Skills exam. Failure rates were particularly high among minorities, with the overall minority failure rate averaging 69 percent. Reasons for  testing at the entry level were discussed, and exam scores were compared with other measures of student ability. Alternatives were offered to basic skills testing. (LMO)",

The present research is designed to study the generation effect for cues, following a depth-of-processing interpretation. The task described is to produce a word, opposite in meaning to the cue, given the cue and target with two interior adjacent letters missing. Thirty-two undergraduate students viewed a cue-target pair for five seconds, wrote the target word, and viewed the completed target for three seconds. Control subjects received the cue and the entire target, wrote the target, and reviewed the target for three seconds. All  subjects received twelve items and provided data on free recall, cued recall, and recognition. Half were tested for recognition of targets, and half for recognition of cues. Results showed that the generation effect does apply to cues as well as responses, although the effect for cues is weaker, suggesting that depth of processing cannot be the only process contributing to the generation effect.

People solve problems in new domains by applying weak problem-solving procedures to declarative knowledge they have about this domain. From these initial problem solutions, production rules are compiled which are specific to that domain and that use of the knowledge. Numerous experimental results follow from this conception of skill organization and skill acquisition. These experiments include predictions about transfer among skills, differential improvement on problem types, effects of working memory limitations, and applications to instruction. The learning experiments involve the writing of LISP computer  programs, an area where the ACT theory has had extensive application. (Author/GDC)",

The cognitive science approach to cognition in general can be used as a base theory. This theory generates requirements for individual intelligence measurements which differ from tests used to predict performance in some (perhaps ill-defined) criterion situation. The use of theory-defined measures of individual mental competence is different from the use of measures that are justified in  terms of their predictive validity. (Author/GDC)",

Two scores were derived: performance scores or number right, and thinking scores indicating the quality of thinking displayed. Analyses were concerned with three  questions: (1) whether the verbal reports accurately portray the thinking that takes place; (2) whether thinking concurrent with reporting differs from thinking in testing situations in which reports are not elicited; and (3) whether thinking subsequent to reporting is different from thinking subsequent to non-reporting testing situations.

The purposes of this paper were threefold. First, the fundamental concepts required when considering multidimensional models for the interaction of a person and a test item were defined. These concepts included the multidimensional latent space, the item difficulty function, and the item discrimination function. These definitions were conceived as multidimensional generalizations of similar concepts in unidimensional IRT models. Second, six existing multidimensional models were reviewed and, on the basis of their similarities, were classified into three general categories.  The characteristics of these categories were described, and the general Rasch model was selected for further study on the basis of ease of parameter estimation. Third, estimation procedures for the parameters of the general Rasch model were described and applied to a set of simulation data that had been generated according to a two-dimensional special case of the model. The results indicated that a very close correspondence had been obtained between the estimated item parameters and those used to generate the simulation data. (PN)",

The dichotomous response was then treated for CAT item selection and ability estimation purposes as if it had been generated by the unidimensional model. To the extent that the observed item response was affected by dimensions other than  the first (which corresponded to the single dimension assumed to underlie the item selection and ability estimation process) errors should be introduced into the adaptive testing process. These errors should affect the ability estimates and the efficiency of CAT. The study focused on the nature and degree of these errors under a variety of multidimensional structures, to determine how robust CAT is to the effects of multidimensionality in examinees' responses to test items.

        "description":"Latent trait models are presented that can be used for test design in the context of a theory about the variables that underlie task performance. Examples of methods for decomposing and testing hypotheses about the theoretical variables in task performance are given. The methods can be used to determine the processing components that are involved in item performance. Three component latent trait models for underlying theoretical variables are described along with their maximum likelihood estimators. The item parameters can be used for item banking according to the influence of the underlying processing variables on item difficulty. Such estimators permit the test developer to choose items that represent specified information processing demands for the examinee. In this manner,  what is measured by an aptitude test can be explicitly designed by specifying difficulty levels in the underlying processing components. The need for meta component latent trait models was also considered. It was shown that both items and persons vary on metacomponent parameters and that these parameters are important for the predictive validity of an aptitude test. The main conclusion to be drawn from these studies is that metacomponent latent trait models are needed to estimate more fully the processing abilities that underlie aptitude. (PN)",

Seven stepwise multiple discriminant analyses and associated statistics were computed to determine which linear combinations of G sub f and G sub c measures would optimally separate the two groups. Corresponding classification functions derived for the discriminant analyses were applied to the data to evaluate the effectiveness of differentiating failures and graduates. The results did not substantiate the hypothesis that G sub f measures would be associated more strongly with student success in a  new instructional situation than would G sub c measures. Contrary to theory, the findings suggest that some unconventional educational environments are not necessarily dysfunctional for more able students. In these situations, they can just as easily exercise and exploit those skills developed and applied in more traditional instructional settings. (Author)",

        "description":"Six new forms of Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) were developed. These new forms were equated to a standard reference test, ASVAB 8a, using normative data based on a 1980 weighted probability sample of American youth, ages 18-23. Equating allows the services to report the distributions of examinee ability on a common metric or standard regardless of which form of the test the examinees take. It also provides consistent meanings for cutting scores used in selection and classification. The new ASVAB forms were analyzed using data collected in Recruit Training Centers (RTCs) and Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS). The subtests and items were analyzed using both conventional and item response theory procedures. For each form, linear and smoothed  equipercentile equating tables were then developed for the 10 raw subtest scores, two raw-score composites, and 14 standard-score composites. The Joint Services Selection and Classification Working Group met in April of 1983 and selected two sets of linear equating tables for future use. For ASVAB 12a, the tables developed in the RTCs for that form were selected. For the other new forms, the tables developed in the MEPS using ASVAB 11a were selected.

The test is composed of three subject tests: Reading, Mathematics, and Language. The study was intended to validate the test development procedure by comparing difficulty levels of common test items measuring competencies on the initial item pilot and on the live administrations. Data were collected during two phases of pilot testing and four live administrations. Public schools in Alabama with at least 50 students were randomly sampled to participate in the pilot procedure. Data were analyzed, and difficulty levels and discrimination indexes for all pilot items were calculated, based on the proportion of  students completing the item correctly. A second pilot test involved testing of forms. Following live administrations, common items were compared with the initial item pilot. The comparison demonstrated the stability of the difficulty level and supported the validity of the test development procedure. Although a higher percentage of students passed items on the live administration, the slight increase in percentage seemed to be consistent from one form to another. (LMO)",

It is intended to indicate the degree of disadvantage which a child from a deprived background has, at the time of entering school, so that deficits can be remediated. The CPI-R has 64 items in four factor-analytically derived subtests: personal-social responsiveness; associative vocabulary; numerical concept activation; and sensory concept activation. Items are scored correct or incorrect, and responses are recorded in the four-page booklet. Examinees may draw in  the booklet, and periodic reinforcement for correct answers may be given by the examiner. Studies of the CPI's validity are minimal. When it was administered to 317 North Carolina kindergarteners, there was found to be a socioeconomic component involved in test scores. There was also a correlation between CPI scores and intelligence quotient. Test norms are based on scores of 1531 children in over 150 Head Start classes, aged 3 to 6. Test reliability is reported as ranging from .86 to .92. (GDC)",

The former approach views learning as the formation of associations, while the latter views memory as the process of reconstruction of fragments based on prior knowledge. These positions are often considered antithetical: Ebbinghaus was concerned with &quot;laws&quot; of memory and tried to control for prior knowledge; Bartlett was concerned with how our world knowledge interacts with learning and memory. This paper argues that one can collect data that supports either position because people can adopt one of several memory strategies. Data are reviewed that illustrate that the same knowledge structure can produce dramatically different results,  depending on the strategies that operate on that structure.

The primary objective was to determine if the short and long forms of the student JAS represent similar measurement instruments. A secondary objective was to determine if the short and/or the long JAS results in comparable factor patterns and covariance structures for As and Bs. The short Student JAS gives factors that are more independent than those of the long JAS, and provides a more comparable structure for Type As and Bs. The present results suggest that researchers should still use the short form since its structure most closely resembles that hypothesized by the underlying  theory. An important finding is that neither the Glass orthogonal nor the oblique two-factor model fit the data well in an absolute sense: less than half of the common variance was explained by any model, on either form. Examination of the residual correlation matrices indicated that two classes of large residuals (self versus perceived others' ratings and actions versus feelings), which were largely responsible for the significantly poor fits, were observed on every LISREL computer run.

It was predicted that higher IQ scoring subjects would not outperform lower IQ scoring subjects under nonmediated learning conditions but would significantly outperform lower IQ scoring subjects under mediated learning conditions. Sixty subjects learned one of two paired-associate lists and a concept list. Mediation and nonmediation scores were derived for each subject based on performances of previously learned paired-associate word lists. At the conclusion of the concept list, the Vocabulary test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test was administered, followed by a Family Background Questionnaire to ascertain the socioeconomic status of  the participants. Separate Scheffe Multiple Comparisons were performed on the two concepts employed (white and soft). The findings indicate that when &quot;soft&quot; was the concept investigated, both the highest and lowest scoring groups profited from the mediation condition; but only the highest scoring group utilized the mediation condition to sufficiently and significantly improve performance over nonmediation. Analyses derived from &quot;white&quot; did not indicate a significant main effect of either IQ score or condition. In fact, there was reversal of the phenomena found for &quot;soft.&quot; (PN)",

The attrition rate has traditionally been higher for the two-year college. Financial factors are generally conceived to be important in persistence. The majority of both dropouts and persisters are from the middle socio-economic  level, while increased persistence has been associated with higher socio-economic status. High school grade point and rank still appear to be the best predictor of college grades, but the relationship to persistence is unclear.

Particularly evident is the finding that expertise is acquired when people continually try to confront new situations in terms of what they know. Increasing ability to solve problems and generate new information is fostered by available knowledge that can be modified and restructured. Initial knowledge structures, when they are interrogated, instantiated, or falsified by novices in the course of learning and experience lead to organizations of knowledge that are the basis for  the more complete schemata of experts. Acquiring expertise is seen as the successive development of procedurally oriented knowledge structures that facilitate the processes of expertise.

        "description":"The hypothesis that variation in accessibility of categorical knowledge affects its use as an organizational device was tested in this experiment using 36 second graders and 36 fifth graders from a middle-class community within San Diego, California. The students memorized each of two lists of words that differed in category representativeness. They received one of three memory instructions: standard free recall, repetition, or categorical processing. Recall performance was about equal for standard vs. repetition, and both were lower than category processing, especially with the highly representative items. Age did not enter this interaction, so it is concluded that at both age levels, accessibility of categorical information influences children's use of it. This suggests  multiple types of possible production deficiencies. It appears possible to distinguish between a production deficiency that can be attributed to an initial disposition of the subject and one that can be attributed to the relative accessibility of relevant information.

The Bureau designed a study calling for the involvement of four distinct groups: (1) the general public; (2) parents of children affected by the State testing program; (3) local education agency (LEA) teaching and central office staff; and (4) Staff Program administrators or policymakers. Participants were selected by local superintendents for skills as opinion-leaders, and by State Department of Education administrators at the state level. Group interviews and individual interviews provided data. Groups were  almost unanimous in identifying major purposes for a state testing program: (1) parents wanted information about how their children were doing on skills beyond the minimums; (2) LEA staff felt this should not be a requirement for a promotion; and (3) both groups were happy in suggesting a strategy that would give normative data on higher level skills, but that would not count them as a promotion requirement. Pre-interview training proved to be successful. This study procedure was extremely labor-intensive, and suggestions from interviews had to be carefully weighed by technical staff. (LMO)",

        "description":"The Attribution Style Questionnaire (ASQ) is a short (36-item) objective inventory which assesses cognitions regarding responsibility for bad and good outcomes relevant to cognitive models of depression. Three alternative scoring systems have been proposed; no scoring system has been empirically verified. Convergent and discriminant validity have been demonstrated. In the present study, data from a mixed-sex sample group of 328 volunteer subjects were employed to assess the internal validity of the ASQ and to determine which of the proposed scoring systems, if any, is empirically supported. A principal components analysis resulted in two clearly interpretable components. The first component was comprised of internality, stability, and globality ratings for good outcomes (Good  Composite); the second component was comprised of internality, stability, and globality ratings for bad outcomes (Bad Composite). Results generally corroborate the proposed two-dimensional structure and scoring system. However, internal consistency is only moderate and response biases appear to be inadequately controlled. Contrary to the pivotal role theoretically attributed to perceived internality for negative outcomes, internality attributions do not substantially contribute to the empirically derived Bad Composite scale.

Students' expectancies for academic performance and the relationship of the expectancies to actual grades were examined. Subjects were 331 students (168 women and 163 men) enrolled in a variety of courses at a small Midwestern university, and courses were chosen to represent a wide range of sex-role stereotypes as well as sex-role neutral disciplines. On the first day of examination, the experimenter distributed questionnaires asking students to indicate the grade they expected. Actual grades were obtained from professors following the examination. The conclusion was made that, relative to men, women's lower  academic achievement cannot be attributed to their lower expectancies for success, and that women's expectancies do not seem to have the same effect upon, or relationship to, their academic performance. The conclusion also was made that in order to avoid incorrect cross-sex comparisons, an analysis must be made of the equivalence of the within-sex regression equations. Suggestions were also made for studies comparing other types of groups. (LMO)",

In Experiment 1, six word lists were constructed with varying frequency of alphabet letters. A variety of instructions were presented (whether to study word frequency or letter frequency). Some subjects were administered the expected task, and others were surprised with a different test. Results confirmed that subjects were more accurate when they were told to attend to letter frequency (the intentional condition) than word frequency (the incidental condition). In the word frequency task, subjects who were instructed to remember word frequency performed better than those  instructed to remember letter frequency, the distractor. Experiment 2 varied the meaningfulness of letter strings (some were words and some were not) and high versus low probability of occurrence. In general, judgment of frequency increased as did actual frequency. As frequency increased, so did the differences in judgments between meaningful versus nonsense words, and between high versus low probability words. It was concluded that frequency information was processed automatically, but varied according to the type of material presented. (GDC)",

The taxonomy was then revised to include five functions: orientation; resource distribution (load balancing); timing (activity pacing); response coordination; and motivational functions. The first four of these functions were observed in a small-scale laboratory setting in which briefly trained subjects rated 15 videotaped segments  of team activity. The ratings were generally reliable, although there was some acquiescence bias leading raters to rate functions as present when they were not.

Participants discussed what a state testing program should accomplish and suggested alternative testing strategies. The current testing program used the Basic Skills Tests (BST). Respondents wanted to retain its diagnostic capabilities and its use for student promotion and accountability. Additional concerns included comparison with national norms, remedial opportunities, policy making information, longitudinal research data, testing of higher-level skills, and not interfering with  regular instruction. Four testing models were developed: state criterion referenced test (CRT) including norm referenced items; (2) adaptive state CRT; (3) state CRT based on a published norm referenced test; and (4) state CRT and published norm referenced test. The alternative to discontinue testing was removed from consideration. Some groups were interviewed repeatedly; participants were informed of findings of other groups; and some groups received training.

When these youth reach adulthood, their poor educational foundations will have deleterious economic and social consequences, including high rates of unemployment, low incomes, dependence on public assistance and higher rates of criminal involvement. The paper begins by describing the population of educationally disadvantaged students in terms of its composition, growth, and educational performance. Second, the consequences of ignoring the needs of these students are considered. Third, the failure of current national educational reforms to consider the needs of the  educationally disadvantaged population is discussed. And, fourth, an agenda for addressing these needs is outlined. This agenda describes goal setting; accountability; resource allocation; and the responsibilities of government, parents and students, communities, schools and agencies, colleges and universities, and business and industry.

Previous research has suggested that bilingualism might have positive effects on cognitive ability. This study focuses on effects for \"non-balanced bilinguals,\" those who do not have equal levels of proficiency in both languages. Following an extensive review of research on bilingualism, the study is described. Subjects were elementary students in a Spanish-English bilingual program. Cognitive abilities measured included English and Spanish verbal ability, metalinguistic ability, nonlinguistic ability, and social perspective taking. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses showed statistically reliable effects of bilingualism on cognitive abilities,  although magnitude and reliability varied over time and grade level. The results in general support the position of a positive relationship between bilingualism and cognitive ability, even in non-balanced bilinguals. The appendix in volume 1 is an annotated bibliography of research on bilingualism and intelligence, while volume 2 consists of 3 appendices: a questionnaire sent to parents of study subjects, a preliminary report of a demographic study of all Hispanic students in New Haven giving statistical data in tables and figures, and measures used in the study including extensive picture tests.

        "description":"Ethnographic interviews and observations were conducted with a group of teenage males from one inner-city neighborhood who were biological and/or social fathers, i.e., males who were fulfilling fathering roles toward the children of their girlfriends. Some of the respondents were not supporting their children, but most were contributing partial support, usually without the knowledge of institutional service providers. They were interviewed concerning the social development of their attitudes and behavior with regard to sexuality and parenting and how their development was influenced by their parents, peers, and neighbors as well as by schools, employers, social service agencies, and the criminal justice system. The interviewers paid particular attention to the role played by high  rates of unemployment and underemployment within local communities and how these economic hardships shaped the households and families of these individuals. The findings of the study challenge pre-existing stereotypes of universally heedless, exploitative, and irresponsible behavior. While some of the respondents' behavior may be seen as exploitative and thrill-seeking, this did not preclude strong feelings of paternity. The young fathers, their peers who were non-supporting fathers, and other residents of their community all condemned the abandonment by fathers of their children. At the same time, all members of the community recognized the difficulty of obtaining jobs, particularly for those still in their teens. A remarkable diversity of arrangements for child care and financial  support found within the sample suggests that economic and educational opportunities are as influential as moral character or ability in determining who in this community works, receives welfare, or takes care of children. Finally, these data suggest several ways in which current social policies affect patterns of fathering, ranging from sex education and school programs for parenting teens to child support requirements, welfare services, and employment training programs.

        "description":"In order to assess differences in social behavior patterns among ethnic groups, videotapes were produced of eight brief social episodes that occur commonly in elementary schools, each taped once with Black actors and once with Mexican-American actors. These were shown to 127 Black and Mexican-American boys and girls from third and sixth grade classes in integrated urban classrooms. The children were shown the films with actors from their own ethnic group and were asked to write what they would do in each situation. Responses were coded into categories, and chi square analysis was used to examine ethnic group differences overall and by age and sex. There were significant ethnic group differences on five of the eight scenes. The differences were stronger at the sixth grade level  than at the third grade level, and more evident among boys than girls. The results provide evidence that cultural differences which have been identified among adults can be found in elementary school children as well. For example, it has been shown that Mexican-American culture emphasizes orientation to the group, respect for authority, and a passive coping style. The behaviors of the children in this study reflect these values. In contrast, Black culture has been portrayed as encouraging expressiveness and active engagement with others. In this study, the Black children were more likely to express feelings of anger, explain their behaviors to teachers, and take action in dealing with social situations. (CG)",

        "description":"The objective of improving mental health care for Hispanics has been reviewed, most often, as dependent upon the provision of culturally sensitive mental health services. &quot;Cultural sensitivity,&quot; however, is an imprecise term, especially when efforts are made to put it into operation when providing mental health services to Hispanic clients. Nonetheless, there are values and choices implicit in all treatment innovations, and this paper attempts to order and define these embedded assumptions. The concept of cultural sensitivity as used by researchers and mental health practitioners working with Hispanics is examined, with a focus on three levels: 1) the process of making existing traditional treatment available to Hispanic clients; 2) the selection of therapies that fit the  Hispanic culture, or the modification of the treatment modality selected by incorporating into it Hispanic cultural elements; and 3) the development of new modalities based upon an aspect of the client's own cultural context. An example of this third approach is Cuento Therapy, a treatment that takes as its medium the folktales of Puerto Rican culture. Through the relating of these folktales to Puerto Rican children experiencing psychological distress, cultural values are transmitted, the mother's role as socializing agent is reinforced, and pride in the cultural heritage is inculcated. It is believed that ego strengths weakened through the acculturative process can thus be reinstated and reinforced. (GC)",

The pilot year of the project was conducted in the Caddo Parish School System and accomplished two tasks: (1) identification of important socioeconomic and school variables; and (2) construction and pilot testing of a questionnaire designed to measure school climate variables. It was found that schools scoring above average on the parish's State Assessment Test scores shared several characteristics: highly educated parents; students with fewest siblings; greatest percentage of fathers in professional jobs and smallest numbers of mothers in  nonprofessional jobs; majority white student bodies; faculties with highest educational attainment and teaching experience; and the largest percentage of white teachers. Schools scoring below the parish's average had the reverse ratings on these characteristics. However, a predictive mathematical model found striking contrasts between predicted and actual school performance. Further analysis determined that the numerous socioeconomic variables explored were so highly correlated as to be considered one separate dimension in school effectiveness, while two separate important dimensions (teacher preparation and teacher experience) emerged among the school variables. Teacher, parent and peer expectations also were found to vary among schools of higher and lower effectiveness. Much of this  report consists of tables demonstrating the study's statistical analysis of variables. Student, teacher, and principal questionnaires are appended. (GC)",

The study was conducted to determine how the JTPA limit on money for program administration affected the type of individual served and the training provided in the transition year 1984. It was found that the current training act served a better-educated clientele--more high school graduates and students and fewer dropouts--than CETA participants. Participants in JTPA generally received less financial support and were more likely to be enrolled in on-the-job training. The number of participants enrolled in work experience programs decreased. While the factors that caused these changes are unclear, the  limitation on participant support costs under JTPA does not appear to be a factor. Service delivery areas generally received the waivers on cost limitations that they requested, but few requested such waivers. Thus, any changes that occurred may have been due more to program implementation activities than to the legislatively imposed limitation. (GC)",

        "description":"This paper provides a broad overview of the demographic, social, and economic characteristics of Samoans in the United States, focusing particularly on the Samoan populations of Hawaii, California, and Washington, where 85% of Samoans reside. The data is derived from the &quot;race&quot; question on the 1980 Census and other local statistical materials. Demographically, the population is found to be highly urbanized, young (average age 19.5 years) and with a high fertility rate (averaging 4.3 children per adult woman). The total U.S. Samoan population projected for the year 2000 is most realistically estimated at 131,000. Among the three States, Hawaii's Samoans are youngest, with a higher dependency ratio and lower sex ratio than elsewhere in the United States. Economic and social  characteristics outlined in the paper include geographic distribution and urbanization; household structure (averaging 5.2 persons); family characteristics (49% having children under six, 18% female headed); marital status (smaller proportion married than average for the United States); income levels (82% of U.S. median income per household); poverty rates (27.5% of families below the poverty level); housing; education; language; and labor force participation. Generally, Samoans are found to be worse off than other selected groups, even recent refugees. Strong differences appear between Samoans in California, who are much closer to national averages, and Samoans in Hawaii. (An appendix discusses language use among Samoans). (Author/CG)",

        "description":"This paper examines various estimates of the Samoan population in the United States and assesses their relation to 1980 census data. Because Samoans were enumerated for the first time as a separate group, because there are no national records of Samoan births and deaths, and because there are no data on migration to the United States or movement back and forth between the United States and Samoa, estimates vary considerably. The 1980 census counts are compared with other estimates using demographic methods which can provide an estimate of the coverage error. A base population for the United States is established and census data from American Samoa, Western Samoa and New Zealand are combined with vital and migration statistics to provide a means of estimating the &quot;expected&quot; Samoan  population in the United States in 1980. The discrepancy between the population enumerated in the 1980 census and that estimated by these methods ranges from 4,600 to 8,900, representing percentage differences of from 10 to 17 percent. The 1980 census counted 42,000 Samoans in the United States; the estimated population from this analysis is between 46,600 and 51,000. (Author/CG)",

American Samoans have developed adaptive strategies for the urban environment, transforming four traditional social structures for use in the new environment: Samoan culture, extended family, chief and title system, and visiting patterns. Despite these adaptive changes and increased roles for churches and community organizations, barriers to positive adaptation continue. Significant barriers are: educational and English language proficiency, limited appropriate pre-migration employment, and discrimination. The adaptation process can be enhanced through job training programs.  They will contribute to communications skills, job skills, and job performance. Broader long-range issues of housing, health, employment, and education can best be met by statewide organizations unifying the Samoan communities and providing programmatic solutions to adaptation problems.

        "description":"This paper considers the communicative competence of Samoan migrants and how it affects their effectiveness in working situations. English language skills, written and oral, are assessed, using fieldwork reports and 1980 census data. Traditional Samoan communication is described in order to examine Samoans' second language competence comparatively. Social dimensions of communication in Samoa; Samoan speech registers; personal naming practices and social implications; the status of English in contemporary Samoa; and non-verbal communication are outlined. An ethnography of traditional Samoan conceptions of work and divisions of labor is sketched, highlighting aspects pertinent to the American workplace. The authors find that Samoans are themselves deeply concerned about English  proficiency and that limited English reading and writing proficiency of migrant Samoans combines with unfamiliarity with Western expectations and values associated with work to hamper the abililty of Samoans to write resumes, complete job applications, and succeed in interviews. Limited English competence, limited proficiency in reading and writing, conflicting values between the home and school/workplace, and unfamiliarity with Anglo ways of speaking contribute to a high rate of unemployment and underrepresentation of Samoans in white collar and supervisory positions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the consequences of limited communicative competence in the American workplace for Samoan workers. (Author/CG)",

It finds that: (1) between 10% and 17% of Samoans may not have been counted in the 1980 census; (2) Samoans have higher rates of poverty and lower per capita incomes than average for the United States; (3) existing services do not and will not meet Samoan needs; and (4) Samoan youth's difficulties in school and the labor market have severe economic implications. The study  recommends policy and programmatic solutions. Policy recommendations are for statutory recognition at the Federal level, and set-asides under the Job Training Partnership Act. The programmatic recommendations are: (1) census undercounting should be avoided in the future by Samoan participation in census planning; (2) Samoan cultural information and bilingual staff should be used more widely in providing training and services, and the specific needs of Samoans should be considered in planning services and modelling delivery; (3) linkages between schools and community should be strengthened and in-service training on Samoan culture and parent training should be provided; and (4) closer ties should be developed between schools and work settings; career awareness should be stressed in schools  and training programs; and schools and training programs should take into account the needs of employers in the local labor markets that Samoan youth will enter. Appendixes provide: (1) a profile of fieldwork contacts and community conference participants, and (2) four tables showing range of population projections for Samoans living in the United States and the underlying assumptions.

        "description":"This review examines whether immigrant Australians are disadvantaged educationally or vocationally by the education they receive, and whether their educational experiences are of a high quality and relevant to their needs. First, data is provided on the patterns of post-war immigration, along with information about the changing attitudes of Australian society toward immigrants. Then, a concept of educational disadvantage is presented, which incorporates elements regarding equality, equity, and cultural diversity. The aspirations and attitudes of immigrant Australians toward their schooling experiences are described; in general, immigrants' aspirations are high and their attitudes positive toward the schools in relation to native Australians. Examined next are teacher expectations  and perceptions, the classroom interaction process, schools' ethnic policies, and schools' roles within the social structure might affect immigrants and contribute to social class inequalities. Two aspects of educational outcomes, retention rates and educational achievement, are considered. Retention and aspirations were found to be high, particularly among non-English speaking immigrants. Achievement was found to suffer at both the primary and secondary level, probably largely due to language related problems. Immigrant experiences with tertiary education are discussed. Immigrants appear to have high aspirations in this area as well, preferring universities and colleges over other institutions. Next is a discussion of how immigrant Australians approach the transition from school to work,  and how well their educational achievements translate into vocational outcomes. Finally, a concluding section discusses problems with research on immigrant Australians. (CG)",

The following three trends are cited as important in the States' increased role: (1) increased State spending on education relative to Federal and local spending; (2) court ordered school finance reform which has led to equalization of spending between districts; and (3) State legislative interest due to the increased spending and a realization of the importance of education to economic growth and social progress. Following an introduction, section two of the book reviews the context for State reforms and discusses the improved professionalism of State governments, the States' interest in educational quality, and the growing perception  that high quality education is necessary to ensure economic competitiveness. The third section briefly reviews the States' recent efforts to improve the quality of education, describing the range of new initiatives and summarizing several leading examples of major reforms. The topics covered include teachers, the academic experience, financial support, education organization and structure, and Federal initiatives. The fourth section examines a series of long- and short-range concerns that will have a major impact on the ultimate success or failure of the State efforts to improve the schools, and a final section provides some concluding observations.

The purpose of the study was to identify the entry skills and characteristics of assistance personnel, how and what they learn during their involvement in school improvement, the specific skills and strategies they use in their work, and what outcomes they help to achieve. The three improvement programs studied were a constituency-based renewal program, an effective schools program, and a teacher growth program. From each program five to six assisters were chosen who had been identified as highly successful. The research consisted of a series of interview guides, which were given to the assisters, the  program managers, and teachers, principals, and parents. The paper describes assisters' educational and job experience backgrounds upon entry into the various programs and describes their teaching, curriculum/content knowledge, academic, administrative/organizational, and interpersonal skills. It was found that while the assisters had, in general, impressive entry characteristics, much learning was acquired on the job from their new roles in implementing improvement programs. The assisters felt that they received extensive support from peers, program managers, key school personnel, program trainers, and their own families and friends. The study indicates that while many of the skills necessary for successful assistance work can be generalized, many others are particular to an individual  program and school and will be acquired on the job.

Concerning the agencies, it was found that most of them had a flexible service philosophy, that their future orientations were characterized by stress and scarce resources, and that the adequacy of the agencies was affected by lack of funding and the need for management and  staff development. The directors were found to value the need for sensitivity to socio-cultural and political awareness among their treatment personnel. The centers were found to need special personnel, political support, adequate public transportation, and bilingual programs. The major community priority seen was a need for services for children and adolescents and community outreach programs. The resources needed by the agencies included staff development and technical assistance in the areas of finance, research, and grantsmanship.

        "description":"This study was undertaken to develop a comprehensive data base regarding the use of informal social support networks as avenues of help-seeking among Blacks for the solving of mental health related problems. The study population consisted of 451 noninstitutionalized Black adults from Richmond, Virginia, nearly two-thirds of whom were women. The respondents were interviewed with a structured interview schedule which is included at the end of the report. The incidence of mental health related problems, the number of stressful life circumstances, the number of recent problems, and the number of depressive symptoms experienced are detailed in the report. The most frequently experienced problems related to finances and family. The most recent problems related to life transitions.  Female, divorced/separated, young, and less religious respondents experienced more stressful life circumstances. Other factors found to correspond with more problems were not being active community participants and having low incomes. Female friends, male friends, and sisters were named as those most often turned to for support, with a same sex preference indicated. For the most part, respondents turned to informal sources of support during financial crises and to formal services during health related crises. Overall, respondents were not knowledgeable about various mental health facilities in their community and only 4.6% indicated that they had used such a facility at least once in the past year. The study results have direct implications for enhancing the helping capacity of informal  social support networks. (CG)",

Provinces and Territories indicated a common concern about, and awareness of, the professional/technical updating problem. Mail questionnaires were designed to identify interested firms, secure information about the firms, and identify accessible areas, types  of activities, and the most suitable periods for updating activities. The survey resulted in the preliminary identification of 50 Manitoba business and industrial establishments willing to collaborate. The two cooperative updating activities--one in the university setting and another in industry--proved to be very successful for student teachers, industry, and the Faculty of Education at the University of Manitoba. Recommendations involved the mandating of a provincial agency for updating activities and a listing of interested firms to be updated annually. Appendixes include a comprehensive list of Manitoba business and industrial firms with addresses and names of presidents, a list of firms willing to participate, with names and titles of contact persons, and information on the two  updating ventures.

One hundred sixty-three (out of 244) teachers sent usable returns to a survey to determine the extent to which they have obtained updating experiences, teachers' obligations to update, preferences for time and frequency of updating, incentives, and the importance of selected institutions/methods. Findings showed 70 percent of business teachers and 92 percent of vocational/industrial teachers had completed work experience before commencing teacher education programs. Fifty-nine percent of the teachers indicated no business and industrial work experience since beginning teaching.  Almost two-thirds said work experience was valuable since it helped them become more effective teachers. Eighty-eight percent felt a professional obligation to update skills and knowledge continually; one-third of that group maintained that updating should occur at least yearly. Educational leave with guaranteed position/salary and school inservice days were recommended as times for updating. A majority supported voluntary updating for retention of teaching certificates, with educational leave and credit towards a degree/certificate as major incentives. Industry- and business-sponsored programs for updating were strongly supported. (Appendixes include instruments and teacher comments.) (YLB)",

A project advisory committee was established, a review of literature was undertaken, and assessment instruments were prepared. Questionnaires were sent to a sample of 191 schools with 310 Project instructional programs. The survey found that schools who were conducting CVAE for the purpose of preparing students to enroll in other vocational programs were very successful in achieving this purpose, but that the majority of the CVAE programs are not preparing students for employment in occupations for  which employment opportunities exist. The study also found that support services are usually not provided for CVAE programs and that almost half of the schools are not in adherence with the purpose of CVAE as stated by the State Board of Education. It was recommended that the State Board of Education define vocational education for the disadvantaged and develop rules for its implementation.

        "description":"An assessment model was developed to produce change in adult basic education (ABE) programs and thereby improve learning for adult students. During the development of the model, 89 ABE programs were analyzed. To determine the effect that ABE has on the quality of life of its students, researchers observed 77 of the 89 programs included in the study and administered questionnaires to 1,625 students who could be described as being predominately white, female, less than 30 years old, and earning less than $10,000 per year. In essence, the assessment model developed calls for: (1) observation of program planning and objectives, program organization, classroom interaction among students and teachers, and student perceptions; (2) analysis of these four factors to determine appropriate  elements for change; and (3) development of strategies for improved teaching and learning. Data collected indicated that goals and objectives were not consistent across programs that are within a given geographic area and that are funded by the same source; however, the ABE programs are having a positive impact on students' quality of life, with males, older adults, and those who have been in ABE longer having the most positive attitudes toward the program.

In light of these focal points, preservice training programs for ABE instructors should cover (1) the nature of ABE, (2) general characteristics of ABE students, (3) ABE program objectives, and (4) appropriate pedagogical techniques for ABE (programmed instruction, individualized instruction, lecture, language experience, contract learning, group discussions, group tutoring, and the Laubach method). When designing  inservice training for ABE instructors, planners should remember that effective ABE programs must respond to current and changing needs, establish ties with other educational institutions, monitor teacher effectiveness, and develop credibility within the community.

        "description":"Teaching adults in the higher education context can be frustrating because higher education is often not flexible enough to provide an environment conducive to self-directed learning. Also, both faculty and students must adjust their learning and teaching preferences to an experiential, problem-exploring style that has often been contradicted by years of conditioning about instruction through passive learning and note taking. Reevaluation counseling (RC) can be used effectively in higher adult education to examine and work through internalized norms to improve learning. In RC, people take turns acting as counselors to one another, providing loving attention, listening well, and using various methods to contradict the past distress so that the participants can discharge feelings  from the past, reevaluate the situation, and think and act clearly at the present time. In higher education, RC can be used to overcome the following internalized norms that interfere with adult learning: isolation, hierarchical rankism, and overemphasis on technical rather than holistic learning. Techniques that are particularly effective in the higher education setting are the following: emphasizing peer counseling and collaboration; balancing negative critique with validation and position thinking; dealing with distress of denying it; and developing a safe atmosphere for fostering clear thinking.

        "description":"A study examined the experiences of local governments throughout the United States in implementing the public service employment (PSE) component of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA). The study involved four rounds of observations (in July and December 1977, December 1979, and December 1980) of programs in 40 State and local jurisdictions. These observations indicated that in the period from 1976 through 1978 the PSE component of CETA not only worked, but worked well. Displacement, that is, the use of CETA job funds to pay for jobs that would have existed anyway, was found to be relatively low in this period. The researchers analyzing the data collected during the longitudinal study concluded that a public service jobs program narrowly targeted on the most  disadvantaged workers, which is what the program was modified to do in 1978, is not an effective strategy. In their estimation, that modification reduced the incentive to make good use of the PSE funds for &quot;real&quot; jobs. It was recommended that policymakers dealing with the current workfare approach to welfare reform examine the strengths and weakness of the PSE component of CETA when developing future policy pertaining to welfare.

        "description":"A study was conducted to describe the family patterns and attitudes toward dentistry of women dentists. The data for this study were collected through a questionnaire distributed to 226 women dentists selected from the 1979 membership list of the American Association of Women Dentists, with a return of 65 percent. Almost half of those surveyed had been out of dental school only 1-10 years, while approximately one-fifth had been out 30 or more years. Frequency and percentage tallies were compiled and chi-square correlations were used to compare subgroups of the sample. Analysis of the data showed that 86 percent of the women have been or are now married, while 14 percent never married. Of those who did marry, 45 percent married for the first time during the first 10 years after  dental school graduation, while 49 percent married for the first time either before or during dental school. One in six has been divorced or separated. Approximately half of those who married have either one or two children, while 34 percent have no children. Sixty-nine percent of those who had children had their first child during the first 10 years after dental school graduation. Although dental school produced a strain on marriages, most marriages were happier after graduation. Conflicts between home and work were acknowledged by one-fifth of the women. Most of the women were involved in private, rather than group, practice of general dentistry. The study concluded that career satisfaction among the women dentists was very high. Approximately 90 percent of the respondents indicated  they find dentistry financially rewarding; they enjoy the opportunity to be independent and to interact with their patients; and they do not find dentistry repetitious or boring. Three-fourths of the group would choose dentistry again and would encourage a daughter to do likewise. (KC)",

        "description":"A study examined the validity of using questions concerning retirement expectations in large-scale micro surveys. A simple static labor supply model that considered wages, hours worked, and health data was developed for this purpose. Next, the model was implemented using data from the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) on the Labor Market Experience of Older Men. Data from the NLS concerning a sample of white males who were, among other things, (1) between the ages of 45 and 49 in 1966, (2) not self-employed in any survey year, and (3) not subject to mandatory retirement, were compared with actual labor supply data. The reported expected retirement ages were actually more accurate than expected retirement ages predicted by the labor supply model, although the correlation between  them is significant. This was found to be consistent with the idea that expectations data provide valuable information about labor supply behavior, which can be exploited to improve estimates of labor supply models.

        "description":"The interrelationship between the health status and work activity of older men plays a central role in at least three current controversies about the direction of public policy: whether the average health levels of older men have deteriorated, remained the same, or improved over the past 25 years; whether retirement status influences health status; and whether recent improvements in mortality have selectively favored individuals at higher risk of disablement, thereby contributing to pre- and post-retirement health trends. Data from the National Longitudinal Survey Panel of Older Men covering the period from 1966 to 1981 were subjected to a Markovian analysis to cast further light on these policy issues. The results suggest that health levels of older men have deteriorated over  the past two decades, partly as a consequence of improvements in life expectancy. These health trends have contributed to the observed decline in labor force participation of this population subgroup. Little evidence was found, however, to support the claim that retirement harms health status. (MN)",

        "description":"Two data waves from the Youth Cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience compared Black, Hispanic, and White servicemen with their civilian counterparts to determine what types of persons are more likely to enlist in the military. Comparisons of minority servicemen with their civilian peers who are employed full time showed that those who chose the service had better-educated parents, were better educated themselves, and had higher educational expectations and better scores on the Knowledge of the World of Work Test. The following characteristics tended to increase enlistment intentions among Whites: lower parental education, longer employment, residing in a state with high unemployment, the desire for occupational training, and approval of one's  enlistment by a significant other person. Among Hispanics, the only correlation found to be statistically significant was that of approval by a significant other; among Blacks, having been in the labor force and having lived in a single-parent household by the age of 14 increased the likelihood of enlistment. Although males and females aged 17 to 21 in 1980 agreed that serving in the military was a good thing to do, only 22 percent of the males and 11 percent of the females said they would try to enlist.

        "description":"The Displaced Homemakers Network surveyed its 425 programs in the winter of 1985 to determine the extent and nature of services to displaced homemakers under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). Also sought was information about the barriers to JTPA that kept program operators from bidding successfully for contracts. Finally, the survey collected information to find out if programs' level of involvement in their local JTPA scenes could be related to having a JTPA contract. Some of the key findings were the following: (1) 61 programs (about one-third of the approximately 40 percent that replied to the survey) had 80 JTPA contacts; (2) typical JTPA projects enroll 1 to 20 displaced homemakers; (3) a wide range of services were being provided by projects serving displaced  homemakers, with the greatest concentration in pre-employment activities and vocational training; (4) more than half of the 80 contracts made provisions for supportive services, mainly child care and transportation costs; (5) much of the vocational training offered by JTPA projects was in one of three areas: clerical/office skills/work processing, health care, and nontraditional occupations; (6) programs most often used Title IIA funds; (7) the 10 percent window for serving persons who face barriers to employment was being used to enroll displaced homemakers; (8) the two reasons most frequently cited for not having a JTPA contract were that information was lacking and that homemakers were not a targeted population; and (9) knowledge of and involvement in the local JTPA scene was  positively related to having a JTPA contact.

In the fifth section, various methods of data collection that can be used in adult basic  education are discussed, while the sixth section describes statistical procedures for analyzing evaluation data. Section 7 illustrates the preparation of the program evaluation outline, which is a device to help program staff sketch out the essential elements of the evaluation plan. Section 8 outlines the different factors that determine the effectiveness of a program. The final two sections describe various reporting and dissemination techniques applicable to adult education programs and provide a summary of the program evaluation process.
