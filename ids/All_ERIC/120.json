        "description":"A model that allows for the assessment of alternative funding formulas for postsecondary educational systems is described. The need for a practical planning model to fit the changing context of higher education funding is emphasized. The importance of a relatively simple funding model that will allow consideration of the aggregate impact of changing basic variables is also discussed. Various components of the proposed model are described. The model is designed to consider alternative funding formulas such as marginal funding, where ratios and compensation rates vary by the magnitude of the projected enrollment changes. The application of the model to a study of Minnesota higher education is described. From results of the study based on the practical planning model, it is  concluded that some form of marginal resource allocation may serve to benefit both the state and higher education in a period of declining enrollments. While the model operates at a statewide level of aggregation, it is suggested that it would also be beneficial to those interested in system and institutional resource allocation patterns.

        "description":"A study was conducted to help discern the relationship between various student recruitment activities and enrollment. A set of 10 recruitment activities utilized by the office of admissions at a private selective undergraduate institution of about 2300 students was selected for analysis. The activities were classified as on-campus contacts and off-campus contacts. The subjects were the 1311 accepted applicants for admission to the class of 1981. Questionnaires were sent to the 561 enrollees (those who paid the admissions deposit) and the 750 non-enrollees. The findings indicate that there is almost no relationship between the off-campus contacts and enrollment yield, while moderate correlations between on-campus contacts and enrollment yield were observed. The study results  identify the need for colleges to evaluate on a continuous basis the effectiveness of recruitment activities they employ. (SW)",

        "description":"The reading level difficulty of college recruitment literature and the ability of college-bound high school students to understand the terminology frequently used in college admissions were studied. The reading difficulty of passages from catalogs collected from 42 colleges and universities was computed using the Flesch Reading Ease Formula. A College Terminology Quiz and a demographic questionnaire were administered to 206 high school seniors from three schools to evaluate their ability to understand admissions terminology. The reading difficulty of the catalogs was rated at difficult to very difficult, indicating an average reading level appropriate to the advanced college student or college graduate. The average score on the College Terminology Quiz suggested that students had  considerable difficulty identifying the correct use of terms commonly found in sections of college catalogs, although students who planned to attend college scored significantly higher than those who did not. The study results indicate that college catalogs are written at a reading difficulty level well above that of the major intended audience and that the students are often unfamiliar with the meaning of the special vocabulary used by those who write admissions materials, suggesting that colleges need to examine their recruitment literature for its level of presentation as well as its content.

        "description":"Two studies, conducted at the University of Washington and 30 large research-oriented institutions, examined the issue of performance of college and university administrators. In the first study, operational dissonance among the three levels of academic administrators were examined. Based on the role prescriptions and job functions of administrators delineated in previous reported studies, three questionnaires were developed. Respondents were asked to characterize their role functions and the degree of interaction with the other administrators, and to describe the observed performance of the role functions of other administrators. Provosts, deans, and department chairpersons were surveyed and 114 operational variables were studied. Usable responses were received from 417 of the  627 administrator sample. The second study examined task-specific tension and/or stress levels and their effects on the quality of administrator decisionmaking. Graduate students role playing as administrators completed tasks in which they experienced varying increases in tension and anxiety. Findings of both studies indicated the existence of inappropriate administrator behaviors leading to dysfunctional operations. Suggestions to alleviate identified problems include individual and group administrator training programs. (SW)",

The model was designed to be adequately flexible and comprehensive to incorporate the array of faculty appointment and tenure types found in medical schools throughout the United States. It has been implemented and tested on historical faculty data from the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. The Monte Carlo method of simulation was chosen as the most effective technology. The present model is called the &quot;Tenure and Promotion Policy Simulator&quot; and is programmed in the BASIC language. The entry, promotion, tenure  status, and departure of full-time faculty members of the School of Medicine was traced from 1944-45 through 1977-78, totaling over 1,850 individuals. A computer data file was then constructed containing encoded biographical and appointment history information. Six data aggregation and synthesis computer programs were written to display the data in forms appropriate for analysis of the interrelationships of each variable on others. Statistical tests were run to determine the independent variables that have a significant relationship with the probability of a faculty member receiving a promotion, tenure, and other actions. Validation of the model was also undertaken. (SW)",

Data were analyzed from a national sample of 1,347 four-year universities, with an enrollment between 200 and 40,000 students, that provided adequate information on the 1975 Higher Education General Information Survey. The path analysis of the study model revealed that size does have a direct effect on cost per student; however, the amount is small and is eclipsed by the far greater effect of changes in the staffing ratio and by changes in curricular complexity. The staffing ratio has the greatest direct effect on costs. These  staffing ratios, however, appear to be independent of other factors in the model, essentially resulting from external influences.

In these fields, a situation occurs in which many bachelor's degree graduates and community college vocational degree holders perform exactly the same work and receive different salaries. The monetary benefit returns to individuals are calculated by using the cost-benefit analysis method. The method is based on the assumption that the income that an average individual with a sepcific level of education in a given field will be earning years later can be estimated based on the average income currently being earned by people having the same characteristics. Returns to investment in a bachelor's degree  versus a community college vocational degree range from 5.4 percent for nurses to 18 to 20 percent for computer science and social work graduates.

Few such institutions integrate outcomes information into the institutional marketing program. In most cases this type of information is used to document actual outcomes, but rarely is it used as an indicator of needed change or success of the institution's marketing program. A tailored approach to outcomes research has been instituted at Metropolitan State College in Colorado as part of their marketing program. Basically, the approach has utilized a longitudinal cohort study of students to provide outcomes information. The research program also includes studies of various segments of the prospective student market and student information needs and a study of the college's  impact on the community. A committee was formed to link outcome information to marketing and to stimulate the development of a comprehensive marketing program. The committee has continued to plan and conduct studies and to interpret and disseminate information related to outcomes information. The program has endeavored to make outcomes information more accessible to those involved in the various phases of institutional marketing, partly through improved dissemination of information and partly through the development of an outcomes data base that is linked to the college's data base system.

Two concepts are examined: nonfaculty salary expenses within the instruction program (direct instructional support costs) and both direct support costs as well as indirect costs (total instructional support costs). Figures from financial reports for 1968 through 1978 of MSU for both direct and indirect costs are provided as well as figures from four other comparison universities. Direct instructional support costs at MSU vary between 40 and 55 percent of faculty salaries. The total institutional support costs averaged about 125 percent of faculty salaries. It is suggested that there  is a need to provide more faculty salaries to meet increased enrollment. It is emphasized that support costs that are not at least equal to the added faculty salaries cannot sustain MSU instruction at its current level of operation.

Changes that have occurred in the number and type of institutions conferring the doctorate degree and in the number of degrees conferred in each field of study are documented. The number of doctorate degrees, percentage increase over the previous period, and percentage for the west are tabulated for doctoral production from three western geographical areas and the entire United States for the years 1920 to 1977. Doctorate output in the west, by census region, for various time periods, and by field and sex of recipients are also provided. An increase in doctorate production in the western region of the U.S. is noted. The number of western universities conferring the doctorate degree increased from four  in 1920 to approximately 60 by 1975. It is suggested that this type of information will provide a context for understanding and evaluating both the widely-reported oversupply of doctorates and the relative decline in governmental support for graduate study and research.

The findings reported here are based on responses from 803 faculty members, or 56.2 of those sampled. Among the findings: the median age of faculty is 43 years; 60.7 percent of faculty have doctorates; 37.5 percent have elementary or secondary teaching experience; the median work time is 50 hours per week in a 39-week work year; the median teaching load is 12 class hours per week with 80 students, and includes counseling responsibilities for 20 undergraduates and 5 graduate students; 27.6 percent report fairly low or very low morale; 50.9 percent believe morale to be declining;  26.1 percent see important constraints in effect on personal academic freedom; over two-thirds see a need for improvement of due process procedures at their institutions; and 80.2 percent are concerned about the number of part-time faculty members currently in higher education. Areas in which faculty voice a need for improvement include: communication of faculty concerns to legislatures, boards of directors, and institutional administrators; information about salaries paid to other faculty in the same institution; assistance in handling complaints with local administration; faculty representation in policymaking; institutional policies for faculty employment practices; salary levels and equity; and institutional financial support for faculty development.

It is noted that total enrollment is slowing and may be expected to begin a decline through the mid-80s, and the decline will deepen as full-time students tend to be replaced by students who study part-time. Students older than 24 years of age and women will continue to increase as a share of enrollment, and the growth of part-time study will continue largely because older students, and especially older women students, are less likely to attend full-time. Public two-year colleges and urban universities will be the main growing institutions, due to their attraction for older part-time students. The demand for new faculty will decline  sharply, as large surpluses of new doctorates continue. There will be greater emphasis on clarity of institutional missions in both the public and private sectors, and statewide agencies will have increased authority to review institutional programs and budgets, as resources have to be redistributed within systems.

Such information, in conjunction with data on newly entering black faculty (i.e., annual graduate degrees earned by blacks), constitutes the current supply of black faculty in the various disciplines. The distribution of faculty by race and discipline in the Southern region is illustrative of the national picture and, therefore,  should be helpful for program planning and affirmative action implementation. The information in this report was obtained primarily by surveying individual public four-year and two-year institutions in the region. The survey methods are detailed in an appendix. The institutions for which faculty data are included account for 94 percent of total four-year enrollments and 79 percent of total two-year enrollments in 1976-77. Data were obtained on race and discipline of 97,053 four-year and 34,725 two-year full-time faculty members. The report covers only faculty with teaching responsibilities and excludes those in full-time administrative positions. &quot;Discipline&quot; in this report refers to the subject area in which faculty teach, not to their field of preparation. The Higher Education General  Information Survey (HEGIS) classification of disciplines was used, with certain adjustments which are described in an appendix. The two primary variables covered are race and discipline of faculty. Additionally, tenure, rank, and degree level data on faculty were obtained from some institutions. (Author/MSE)",

Another purpose was to translate these issues and priorities into operational terms for use in NCES data collection activities. Four parts make up the report. The first summarizes the main issues, concepts, and recommendations. The second defines the meanings of financial viability, identifies several key issues, and describes some of the implications for data production. The third part concentrates on some of the major recommendations for ongoing statistical work,  and the fourth (the appendix) contains sample data collection aids and a brief annotated bibliography. The issues and data collection needs in this area are complex, and the data requirements question is found to have at least two dimensions. The first is how to modify existing statistical surveys without sacrificing the consistency of established and useful time series. The second is how to speed up professional dialogue for consensus on methodology as well as on concepts and financial viability models. (MSE)",

        "description":"The reasons for the persistence of the academic department in research universities and its efficacy in achieving the typical goals of the institution are examined. Six reasons that the academic department in its present form persists as an organizational entity are: inertia, the high status of research, funding sources and access to them, insulation from observation and accountability, alleged interdependence among missions, and the pedagogical necessity for knowledge-based departments. Various theories of departmentalization, including current notions of the determinants of alternative organizational structures as posed by &quot;contingency theorists,&quot; are examined. The nature of the environments external to the institution and the varying demands of clients in those environments  for different structures are explored. The impact of the &quot;technology&quot; of the many university tasks on the structure of the institution is discussed. A matrix form of organization in which sets of tasks or roles which are related to one another by necessary timing and sequencing are grouped in self-contained units is proposed. In such units, all the major resources needed to provide the service or produce the output are contained within the unit. It is suggested that the amount of inter-unit dependency should be as low as possible in order to minimize the costs of administrative coordination, and the amount of intra-unit loyalty and identification with unit goals and norms should be increased.

The first study examined operational dissonance among the three levels of academic administrators (chairpersons, deans, and provosts) in complex research-oriented universities, and the second examined task-specific tension and stress levels and their effects on the quality of administrator decision-making. The results disclosed incongruent role perceptions and expectations leading to dysfunctional performance, and particularized the tasks promoting low quality decision-making due to stress. Remediation methodologies to increase role consonance and reduce stress are postulated toward elevating  the quality of administrative performance. (Author)",

The criteria used by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to assess the status of faculty as supervisors, managers, or professional employees are applied to the activities of faculty members in the academic decision-making process. The refusal of the NLRB to promulgate rules that would clarify faculty employee status is criticized, and suggestions for resolving the uncertainty created by the Board's adjudication process are offered.

        "description":"This study is based on the assertion that it is not enough for student aid programs to facilitate attendance at, and even graduation from, a postsecondary institution because the very means used may have a negative impact on students who benefitted from such aid. While student aid may equalize college attendance across students, it may not promote equality of opportunity among college graduates. The National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 data base was used. Four areas in the college graduates' lives are examined in terms of their relationship to student aid received during college: (1) attending graduate or professional school; (2) choosing a job; (3) forming a family; and (4) forming personal values. Three basic types of aid (loans, grants, and work) are  the student aid variables, categorized by the amount of aid received. The major conclusion reached is that the hypothesized negative impact of aid, and particularly loans, on college graduates does not exist. It is much less clear, however, whether or not aid has any impact at all on college graduates. Short-term effects only were considered. It was also found that of the three types of aid, grants appear to be most promising in encouraging graduates to further their education, and that self-help aid (borrowing and working) is not detrimental to the graduates' behaviors as studied here.

        "description":"The potential for schools of education as major resources for research and development and other knowledge-generation and knowledge-use activities is discussed, along with the negative view of federal policymakers in this regard. The study reported here was designed specifically to employ contemporary organizational theory and case study aggregation methods on the problems of &quot;sheltered units&quot; or bureaus within educational institutions. A set of propositions and counterpropositions were derived and tested about the nature of the organizational climate and its function. A list of structured questions and answers about the outcomes of interest that could be used with each of eight case studies was then generated to form an analytic checklist. Three readers reviewed and completed  checklists for the case studies, making possible aggregate descriptions of university-based bureaus, their organizational contexts, and their potential. It is noted that most of these bureaus currently have two to four staff members, engage in multiple processes (such as research, development, evaluation, dissemination, adoption and field service, or research and field service), were created to respond to immediate perceived needs, reside in doctorate-granting institutions, and are undergoing mission redefinition or role extension, but are hindered by fiscal exigencies. It is concluded that the study provided a test of the range of applicability of theory relating to organizational contexts for &quot;sheltered units,&quot; and of the usefulness of the Lucas methodology in coping with data formerly  not amenable to aggregation. A bibliography is included. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"This report addressed to policy making officials in local government deals with the role of federal assistance in future developments of information systems by local governments through an assessment of the Urban Information Systems Inter-Agency Committee (USAC) Program, which, beginning in 1970, provided grants to five municipalities--Charlotte, North Carolina; Dayton, Ohio; Long Beach, California; Wichita Falls, Texas; and Reading, Pennsylvania--to develop integrated, computer-based information systems. Recognizing the different management needs of government, these systems automate selected municipal functions, mostly in the area of delivery of services, and provide data for management decision making. An assessment of the program in 1974 indicated that, in general, the USAC  Program, although it had significant impact on the development of information systems, had not met some stated objectives, due to underestimated cost and complexity of systems development within a limited time frame. This led to an examination of cost and benefit relationships of information systems and the transferability of systems or components. The program contributed a body of knowledge about how to approach the development of information systems, stressing the importance of involving elected and appointed officials in that process, and pioneered the application of computer technology in municipal functions. Since few governments have resolved the privacy issue, this and some related issues are also discussed. (CWM)",

Inquiries about cooperative activities focused on (1) multi-type library cooperative activities most and least frequently engaged in; (2) advantages and disadvantages of multi-type  library cooperation; (3) agencies, institutions, or other entities most often called upon to provide cooperative services or resources; (4) terms of formal multi-type library cooperative agreements; (5) major barriers to cooperation and methods of overcoming them; and (6) additional cooperative library activities desired by library directors and school media supervisors.

Using the notion of social indicators to measure educational knowledge production and utilization, a model of a functional system of indicators consisting of four major components was developed: (1) production output indicators reflect the extent and ways in which the educational knowledge production community organizes and transforms knowledge in all its forms; (2) dissemination structure indicators display how resources are allocated across educational sectors and geographic  areas; (3) utilization indicators provide information regarding request and usage rates by geographic or educational sectors for types of institutional and individual consumers of educational knowledge, products, and services; and (4) contextual indicators may be used to predict or explain the patterning of other types of indicators using demographic and geographic data. These indicators are examined in terms of major dimensions that may prove useful in a conceptual mapping of the indicator domain, and then in terms of implications of this dimensional mapping for the selection or development of indicators.

Three factors underlie 12 statistical indicators: a document production and access factor, a human-based linkage and exemplary practices factor, and a state planning and capacity building factor. A score of selected demographic, economic, and educational measures are used as potential predictors of the knowledge production and dissemination indicators. Factor analysis of these measures produces seven &quot;predictor&quot; factors: (1) staff size and number of educational agencies; (2) educational expenditures; (3) relative expenditure effort; (4) population and institutional density; (5) population  change; (6) Intermediate Service Agency (ISA) service level, and (7) Teacher Center (TC) service level. Multiple and canonical correlation analyses demonstrate that the size factor alone is a powerful predictor of all indicators that are based on counts. Hierarchical grouping analyses of the 50 states and the District of Columbia are made separately, and the state-level data are aggregated by the ten United States Office of Education (USOE) Regions, based first on production and dissemination indicators, and then on contextual predictors.

        "description":"\"Math anxiety\" can be a lifelong stumbling block affecting the student's level of performance and willingness to go beyond the minimum courses required, and hindering career change or advancement. The cumulative nature of math learning, early insistence on the right answer with reasonable speed, paranoia that not understanding will result in ridicule, the mystique of the genetically-predisposed mathematical mind, and inability to handle frustration when dealing with math are a few sources of math anxiety. Women are further handicapped by the stereotype that they are unable to excell at math because of their sex. A math anxiety clinic at Wesleyan University helps students reduce anxiety and increase self-confidence. A non-threatening environment is set by an initial interview  which examines the student's degree of fear and his or her goals for the future. In class, individual strengths are stressed, and the fact that there is no best way to work a problem is repeatedly demonstrated. Problem-solving in small groups is extensively utilized to make math a social experience. The students evaluate their progress at mid-semester. The final exam is a standardized multiple-choice form to give the students practice for various standardized placement tests. A similar program has been implemented in developmental mathematics classes at Middlesex Community College. (DD)",

Data in the first report were obtained for a sample of 558 LACC students from file records and telephone interviews with 61% of the sample. Findings revealed that: (1) of nearly 11,000 new applicants to LACC in Fall 1978, fewer than 7,000 were enrolled in classes at first census week; (2) about 40% of LACC entrants (30% statewide) had previous college experience, with about 15% (10% statewide) holding an associate degree or higher; (3) students  indicated a variety of objectives in attending college; 38% had job-related objectives, 35% desired self-enrichment or had no objective, and about 28% planned to transfer to a four-year institution; (4) ethnic minority students accounted for 78% of LACC enrollment and only 34% statewide; and (5) about 60% of LACC students were working, and of these, 80% indicated their job was unskilled or semi-skilled. The image of the community college student as an 18-year-old just out of high school with plans to transfer after four semesters to a university appears to be correct for only a small percentage of students, at LACC and across the state.

The Valencia student is seeking a degree and hopes for either advancement in a currently held job or movement to a new job as a result of the academic program. When these data were compared to local census data, it appeared that Valencia students were representative of the county population as a whole.  Valencia students differed from a national sample of entering college freshmen, however, who were likely to be younger, unmarried, nonveterans with larger family incomes. Valencia students did appear similar to national samples of other evening students, although they were more likely to indicate preparation for a new job as their main reason for college attendance.

        "description":"This study examined the ways in which the spontaneous imaginative play and other social behaviors of 3- and 4-year-old children are affected by the frequency and patterns of their television viewing. The subjects were 141 children from predominantly white middle class homes. Pretesting was done to get an estimate of IQ (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test), an estimate of imaginative predisposition (Barron Movement Threshold Inkblot Series), information regarding imaginative play tendencies (Interview on Imaginative Play), and information regarding favorite television shows, favorite television characters, and viewing patterns (Television Viewing Patterns). Data on the children's naturally occurring play were obtained through unobtrusive observations in their nursery schools and day  care centers eight times over a 1-year period. The children's language was recorded verbatim and was coded by trained raters. Logs of the children's television viewing were maintained by parents and returned weekly during each of four 2-week probe periods. Results indicated that children who watch a good deal of television, especially action shows, seem more likely to show aggressive behavior during play. Indications of private fantasy play such as imaginative companions or inner imagery appear to be linked to more socially mature behavior, to less aggression or anger, and to lower levels of viewing television, especially more violent programming.

        "description":"This study explored the relationships between parents' reports of their children's play with imaginary playmates at home and (1) observational ratings of children's imagination, positive emotionality, concentration, social behavior and use of language during free play at nursery school, and (2) parents' records of their children's television viewing patterns at home. The activities of 141 three- and four-year-olds were observed and rated eight times over one year by trained observers during 10-minute periods of free play in nursery school. Imaginary playmate questionnaires were completed by 111 of the children's parents. Questions concerned indications of the presence and number of imaginary playmates, the frequency of play with such playmates, and the characteristics of the  playmates, including the extent to which they reflected the influence of television characters. According to parents' reports, 55% of the children had imaginary playmates at home. Multiple regression analyses indicated that scores reflecting relative occurrence of imaginary playmates predicted the imaginative play of children in school, their positive affect and concentration during play, and their social interaction and cooperativeness. Reports of imaginary playmates tended to be negatively linked to occurrences of overt aggressive behavior (in boys), negatively linked to television-viewing frequency, and positively linked to more extended language use. Additional findings are reported on children's self reports, IQ, socioeconomic status, ethnic background and family structure.  (Author/SS)",

        "description":"Parent involvement is an important goal in the Behavior Analysis Follow Through Program. A major form of parent participation in the Behavior Analysis model is the employment of parents as teacher aides in the classrooms. Another way the link between parents and the school is maintained is to insure that parents are informed of their children's progress. Parents of each child receive monthly progress reports as part of a standard and regular reporting system used to keep everyone informed of the children's progress. Parents have an opportunity to voice their opinions on the program in the Annual Consumer Evaluation. This is a questionnaire administered to parents, teachers, administrators, and students every spring to gather information about the local acceptance of the program's  performance and to indicate areas in which the Behavior Analysis program needs further modification and refinement. The most direct mechanism that Follow Through parents have to influence school policy is the Policy Advisory Committee (PAC). The Parent Involvement Progress Record has been developed to help PAC Chairmen and Parent Coordinators to set goals, summarize parent involvement activities at the local site, and assess progress toward those goals. A new monitoring system will be initiated during the 1979-80 school year to document the training and employment opportunities generated for parents by the Behavior Analysis programs. (JMB)",

        "description":"The Yale Child Welfare Research Program was a comprehensive, service centered, longitudinal, intervention project for low-income families and their children. Eighteen children from inner city, low-income, predominantly black families participated in the intervention program from before birth to 30 months of age. Each family was assigned a team of project staff members who provided services and recorded their work with and observations of the families. Data were collected on four major components of the program: (1) home visitor program, (2) Pediatric care, (3) developmental evaluation, and (4) day care and toddler school. One year after the project ended, a matched comparison sample of 18 children 30 months of age was selected. Each comparison mother was seen for a single  in-depth interview and each comparison child was seen once for a developmental evaluation. Five years after the project ended, follow-up interviews were conducted with 15 of the original research group mothers and each of the research group children was seen in a follow-up testing session. Findings are presented in detail. Results were interpreted as suggesting that the intervention had served to offset the detrimental effects of socio-cultural deprivation on the research group children's verbal abilities and had helped the project families improve their quality of life.

        "description":"This study examined sex differences in the use of interruptions and simultaneous speech during conversations between parents and preschool children. In our society, children are usually taught not to interrupt a person who is talking, yet many adults themselves interrupt others. In fact, it seems that interruptions can be used acceptably under certain circumstances. To reduce the likelihood of speakers talking at the same time, people in a conversation typically obey turn-taking rules. Even though simultaneous speech seems more accidental than interruptions, one speaker can take advantage of the situation to maintain or gain control. Subjects were 16 children ages 2 to 5, and both their parents. Each parent-child pair engaged in semi-structured play for 30 minutes. Instances of  interruptions by parents and children were recorded, as well as occurrences of simultaneous speech. Results reported are mean differences. There were no significant differences between boys and girls in the use of these two conversational techniques. However, fathers interrupted more and spoke simultaneously more often than mothers did. Further, both parents were more likely to interrupt their daughters and to speak simultaneously with their daughters. Results were discussed in relation to the power differences between men and women, and in reference to the socialization of children into male and female sex roles. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Extra post-partum mother-infant contact in the first hour of life does not appear to enhance maternal perceptions of infant temperament at 8 months. Subjects of a study of the effects of mother-infant contact on infant temperament were healthy, white, first-born infants and their mothers. Mothers were randomly assigned to an experimental group in which they received an additional hour of contact with their child or to a control group in which they received regularly scheduled contact. When infants were 8 months old mothers were requested to complete the Carey Temperament Questionnaire. This measure consists of 70 items descriptive of infant behavior in a variety of situations including feeding, response to caretaking, and interest in the environment. Behaviors are rated on  3-point scales to reflect nine temperamental characteristics such as rhythmicity, intensity, threshold, and persistence. At the time of the study, 56 mothers had completed the questionnaire. Infants were 15 extra contact males, 14 extra contact females, 15 regular contact males, and 12 regular contact females. Analysis of the data (2 by 2 ANOVA) showed no main effects for the extra contact group. There were no significant sex by treatment interactions. Female infants were rated higher than males in threshold and intensity. In general, findings indicate that extra contact may have no systematic influence on maternal perceptions of the infant or that self-report instruments may be insensitive to the presumably subtle effects of early contact.

Slides had been previously rated for the physical attractiveness of the photographed child, the presence of clinical manifestation of dysfunction, and the quality of the photographic reproduction. Subjects were randomly presented with slides classified  as attractive/normal, unattractive/normal, attractive/abnormal, unattractive/abnormal, and pre- and post-operative slides of children with craniofacial anomalies. Information relating to the experience of self-reported personal characteristics of the subjects also was obtained. Analysis of the data revealed that the attractiveness of the child plays a significant role in the judgment of functional capabilities, made from photos, for all subject groups. Children with unattractive faces were consistently scored lower in functional capability than children with attractive faces. Judgments of subject groups were equivalent.

Focusing children's attention by having them name the letter or number out loud before and during printing reduced reversals and other  errors even though the name itself was not important in producing this effect. Together these findings challenge the prevailing accounts given to explain reversals in printing and suggest an alternative proposal. (Author/RH)",

Analyses of the individual and group data indicate that subjects trained with the rote memorization procedures made fewer errors during training, demonstrated more accurate acquisition of the digit-chains, and demonstrated retention after a longer period of time than the subjects who were trained with the game procedures.

        "description":"This paper focuses on the scholastic achievement of five cohorts of white, middle-class children as they progressed through their first grade year of an elementary school. Multiwave data on several hundred children were gathered, from just before they entered first grade to the end of that grade in an attempt to clarify the process of early schooling. Specifically, researchers wanted to investigate how expectations of significant others and feedback provided to children may affect children's achievement and academic self-image in the first grade. It was found that parents' expectations for their children's performance responded to IQ of the child, to the child's sex, and to the kindergarten teacher's forecast. Parental expectations influenced only conduct marks (not reading or  arithmetic marks) and had little impact on children's expectations except for year-end reading expectations. Other parental estimates did not influence children's marks or expectations directly. Over the first grade year children's expectations were largely indeterminate although expectations did respond to arithmetic mark feedback and to parental reading expectations by the end of the year. This finding is contradictory to assumptions that children's expectations for themselves crystallize soon after they start school. Children's performance levels from the first report card to the end of the first grade were highly continuous. This suggests that even the earliest marks children receive are major determinants of future evaluations and that teachers' earliest formal evaluations may play a  leading role in determining achievement levels in young children.

        "description":"The primary purpose of this study was to examine whether a general perceptual model developed by Vitz and Todd (1971), capable of dealing with multiple determinants of attending, is useful for understanding infant attending. The model, previously used in research with adults, assumes that perception can be represented as a stochastic sampling process, and proposes that the total number of trials necessary to sample a figure is a measure of that figure's complexity. The relationships of age and sex to complexity preference were also explored. Three stimuli differing in complexity were presented to forty-one 8-, 10-, and 12-week-old infants, and total fixation times recorded. Overall, the infants fixated longer on the more complex stimuli; however, while preference for the most  complex stimulus was clear for females at all ages, there were suggestions that males' preference for complexity increased gradually with age. In addition, overall fixation times declined with age for males but not for females. These results are interpreted as providing support for the utility of the Vitz and Todd model. Although the effects of complexity differed for males and females, as defined by the model, complexity did appear to play a role in mediating infant attention. Sex differences in development are discussed in terms of hypothesized differences in attending styles. (Author/SS)",

The project gives students opportunities to learn through direct experience and provides seminars in which they may reflect upon these experiences. Some 36 institutions and community service agencies expose the student to real-life issues and give them a basis for considering future careers. One project offers the chance to work with special recreation programs for handicapped children, teens or adults. In another, students act as friends/tutors to delinquent boys between the ages of 13 and 17. At a retirement home students may act as companions to lonely old people and design group activities in addition to the individual visiting.  Other projects include working in child care centers, helping in hospital emergency rooms, tutoring foreign students, and assisting a neighborhood tenants union. A variety of services in programs relating to the mentally ill are provided. This manual for student use lists information on enrolling in Project Outreach and gives detailed information on each of the projects available, including transportation needs, target population, student's role, group meetings, and prerequisites. Appended to the document is a discussion of the concept of Experiential Education. (Author/DS)",

OBIS provides community-sponsored youth organizations and schools with 100 learning activities for use at outdoor sites, such as lawns, playgrounds, city lots, and parks, common in a man-managed environment. The OBIS Trial Edition, developed and tested over 6 years, consists of 4 Sets of 24 varied activities and a Trail Module of 4 related activities, all emphasizing biological interactions and environmental interrelationships. Their short duration and easy-to-follow format, including notes on  preparation, all necessary biological information, inexpensive or homemade equipment, and follow-up, make OBIS activities suitable for both experienced and inexperienced outdoor education leaders. Because each activity is based on a single principle, leaders need not follow a rigid sequence of activities to ensure concept comprehension, although several activities may be sequenced in a program to suit the leader's needs or for integrated study of a specific subject. All trial activities are listed and briefly explained. The OBIS system also includes a training Primer, a Newsletter, and Resource Centers throughout the country. (SB)",

Ten to twelve participants is the optimal workshop size if only one OBIS-knowledgeable leader is available. It is advisable to have one knowledgeable assistant for every 8 to 15 participants. Any central outdoor site can be used for the workshop. Leaders should obtain permission to use the site and should research restroom facilities in advance. Workshops should vary in length from 1/2 to 2 days, depending on the  needs of the participants, and should include samples of all varieties of OBIS activities: crafts, games, simulations, and plant and animal investigations. Workshop leaders should adhere to a schedule, prepare all materials in advance, be relaxed and flexible, and encourage participants to join in every activity. Sample schedules for full and half-day workshops are included. A list is included of national community groups that might be interested in an OBIS workshop. (SB)",

The booklet discusses ways of obtaining program support from school administrators, parents, and the local community; outlines the wide variety of experiences possible in community based studies; and gives guidelines for planning successful field trips. The section titled &quot;Community Studies Activities&quot; describes 50 projects undertaken in Vermont schools that succeeded in the eyes of the teachers and children involved. Activity categories are local history,  media, natural resources, mapping, technology, government and social services, student businesses, community service projects, physical education and health, and agriculture and forestry. Additional activities illustrate the techniques of shadowing, interviewing, and observing and describe ways in which teachers have used community studies to augment the regular curriculum. Final chapters cover student writing (often the most striking success of community oriented work), record keeping, and local and regional resources. (JH)",

        "description":"The Hartsville, Tennessee nuclear reactor site, the coal plant at Wheatland, Wyoming, and the nuclear plant at Skagit, Washington have mitigation plans developed in response to a federal, state, and local regulatory agency, respectively; the three mitigation plans aim at internalizing community-level social costs and benefits during the construction phase of large new energy supply facilities. Among the social costs included in the mitigation plans are public and private sector services such as schools, utilities, planning, public safety, transportation, housing, and community services at power generation construction sites. Viewed as new institutional responses to social impact mitigation planning, the plans have both variances and similarities in terms of origins, goals, scope,  local participation, financing and costs, adequacy and significance. The plans are highly significant because of their pioneer status, their similarity of scope despite highly diverse regulatory environments, and their custom tailoring to local circumstances. Policies providing impetus for comprehensive assessment of the effects of public development projects, including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, court rulings, and various state laws, are presented.

        "description":"Decisions concerning large-scale energy development projects near small communities or in predominantly rural areas are usually complex, requiring cooperation of all levels of government, as well as the general public and the private sector. It is unrealistic to expect the typical small community to develop capabilities to independently evaluate a highly technical development which to them is a one-time occurrence. Thus, local officials must be aware of resources which they may tap for information and assistance at other levels of government. This handbook advises local officials on how they should organize to most effectively participate with developers, government officials, and consultants in assessing, planning, and managing energy development and how to insure that  information is collected and analyzed to reflect local priorities and future planning needs. Discussed are the key areas of impact requiring study--employment, personal income, housing, education, transportation, water supply, solid waste collection and disposal, waste water treatment, health care, recreation, and safety. The handbook provides guidance on organizing a capital improvements program to generate revenues to cover the expanded public facilities usually resulting from energy development. Also discussed is the development of the necessary administrative structure to regulate, monitor, and permit public and private development. (NEC)",

        "description":"Nonmetropolitan and totally rural areas have greater unmet health needs and fewer health resources than urban areas. Blacks, American Indians, migrants, and Appalachians have specialized rural health care needs as a result of cultural isolation, poverty, and discrimination. The reversal of the rural to urban population migration has increased the strain on the health care system in all nonmetropolitan areas where the per capita distribution of physicians, medical specialists, services, and quality of facilities is significantly lower than in metropolitan areas. Communities need to develop specialized emergency medical transportation and communication, establish satellite clinics, and increase part-time physicians and midlevel health practitioners. A positive development has been  the federal government's recognition of rural needs and design of eight programs to ameliorate rural health care problems: Community Health Centers, Migrant Health Centers, National Health Service Corps, Health Underserved Rural Areas, Rural Health Initiative, Rural Health Clinic Services Act, Loan Repayment, and Community Facilities Loan Programs. Under any national health insurance it will be important to recognize rural residents' health needs. The report compares four factors indicative of the condition of the health care system in both areas and shows that rural areas' lower incomes, larger aged populations, hazardous occupations, and lower educational levels contribute to poorer health care conditions.

Among sixth grade students, 64% feel their parents can best advise them regarding a career, while 49% of twelfth grade students feel teachers and counselors can be most helpful. Junior college and college sophomores feel teachers and parents are equally influential. Physically disadvantaged students depend to a much greater degree on their teachers and counselors for career information and are more oriented to jobs than to careers. They need more career awareness. Students at all levels need to assess their interests, values, and goals in preparation for  career choices. They also need to understand the relationship of the curriculum to the world of work, but only 18% of ninth graders have teachers who often relate school to work. Most public school teachers and fewer teachers of the disadvantaged want to teach career education although they feel unprepared to do so and need inservice training. The Mississippi State Career Education Advisory Board is using the findings in planning comprehensive career education throughout the state. (SB)",

        "description":"Fire protection in rural Alaskan communities depends on individual home fire prevention and protection rather than on the services offered by a centralized fire department. Even when help is summoned to extinguish a blaze, aid does not come in the form of a cadre of highly trained firefighters; it comes instead from whomever happens to be in the area. In order to control and extinguish a fire in its early stages, citizens must have adequate warning that a fire has begun in a home and proper equipment readily at hand. This means smoke detection devices installed in all living units, as well as fire extinguishers placed in each home in the community. In the summertime, communities near a river or sea may utilize these water sources with portable fire pumps, hose and nozzles, but in  the freezing temperatures of winter only fire extinguishers can be used. This manual on fire protection is divided into three sections. Dealing with firefighting equipment and methods, the first section discusses fire prevention, types of firefighting equipment, firefighting techniques, and care and maintenance of firefighting equipment. Section II explores four state assistance programs, i.e., State Fire Service Training Program and Division of Fire Prevention. The final section includes lists of fire equipment supply distributors, sample forms and applications, and audio-visual materials. The list of audio-visual materials includes synopses of 47 training films available from the Alaskan Department of Public Safety. (Author)",

        "description":"The current reversal of the rural to urban migration trend among Blacks, American Indians, and Hispanics will create a myriad of coping and adaptation problems for the urban to rural migrant and the rural nonmigrant as well. It is possible to gain a partial understanding of the likely problems by reviewing studies of the ethnic minorities' rural to urban migration and the coping patterns of rural and migrant communities. New migration patterns will undoubtedly affect mental health and substance abuse, two areas closely tied to coping and adaptation strategies. Studies of the incidence of mental illness among rural and migrant minorities have shown no consistent pattern of failure to adjust. Criticism of these studies focuses on their use of hospital statistics to determine  incidences of mental illness and their failure to consider migrant characteristics and circumstances under which a move occurred. The type and extent of substance abuse varies among ethnic groups but is increasing for the rural and migrant ethnic minorities as it is for their urban counterparts. Although studies have identified stresses which affect substance abuse, they have not determined the impact of social mobility and environmental change on substance abuse. Among the many research needs is the need to identify the indigenous mechanisms used to control and prevent emotional problems and abuses of narcotics and alcohol. (JH)",

The objective was to identify those observable classroom behaviors whose presence or absence is likely to affect student performance. Two types of competency indicators are identified: (1) cognitive-based; and (2) performance-based. Specific instructional competencies are identified and stated in each of the basic skills areas. Five general behaviors were used to group these specific competencies. They are: (1) diagnosis and prescription; (2) organization and management; (3)  instruction; (4) growth patterns; and (5) evaluation. (MP)",

It was designed to investigate levels of student achievement in science in Alberta at grades three, six, nine and twelve and to provide a data base for future assessment. Between 2,000 and 3,000 students were tested at each grade level. The findings show that the student performances were generally satisfactory. Some areas of weakness were identified: (1) knowledge of scientific methods in grade three; (2) knowledge of physical science in grades three, six and twelve; and (3) earth-space science and general knowledge of science and scientists in grades nine and twleve. A list of recommendations is presented at the end of the report.  (HM)",

The newsletters offer classroom exercises, participant suggestions, and supportive essays designed for teachers working with the MSHP. The premise of the project is that \"American history can be better taught and more actively learned by using the experiences of the people of a local community as a reflection of the national experience.\" Using the manuscript census as a basic document, teacher participants and their students collect original local historical data, interpret the data in light of traditional local sources, and compare local history with that of other areas. Section I describes the Individual Biography Card  (IBC) and its uses in tabulating information, and presents an exercise using census figures relating to birthplace and immigration. The exercise in Section II involves students in the use of IBCs, attempting to develop a chronological life history for two families. Section III provides exercises based on methodological techniques used in the study of a city, emphasizing historical and geographical comparisons. Section IV studies the composition of the work force, while Section V provides an essay on working women. Section VI stresses the need for a systematic typology of rural communities based on multivariate analysis of characteristics. Three reports from teachers comprise Section VII. Section VIII presents an overview of the MSHP and suggestions for initiating and using one similar to  it. (CK)",

The committee recommends that the government needs to anticipate these changes in order to develop a policy in response to the problems caused by these changes. The document is presented in four sections. Section I discusses the changing size of the U.S. population, including the impact of the 1945-1960 baby boom and more recent birth slowdown, the falling mortality rate, and immigration changes. Future size projections are discussed, as are the need to set population goals, and economic consequences of population growth. Section II explores the changing age composition  of the nation, considering consequences and policy alternatives related to the growth of women in the labor force, effects of boom and bust birth cycles on education, influx of new workers in the labor force, and investigates geographic redistribution, noting a nonmetropolitan revival, shifts from the Northeast and North Central to the West and South, and future movement possibilities. The causes of population distribution are pointed out, as well as consequences and possible responses for areas losing or gaining population. Section IV focuses on the need to plan for population changes and their consequences, emphasizing current policies and other possibilities, and the need for coordinated data collection and analysis at federal, state, and local levels.

        "description":"The article describes how folk educational programs in the United States and in the Scandinavian countries work toward behavioral and social change efforts. The conditions under which collective change efforts create their own educational programs, the most effective pedagogical processes, and the variables associated with successful attempts to join folk colleges to social and ethnic movements are examined. Conditions for change are described as occurring when discontented people seek to solve problems through mobilization and the creation of movement organizations. Although size is not a key consideration, the way that restraints (e.g. economic-political, ethno-cultural, or religious) are identified and the articulation of realistic goals are crucial elements. Pedagogical  processes at folk colleges are assessed according to three orientations: the poetic-historic (idealistic and spiritual), the rational-pragmatic (literacy, numerical, and organizational skills), and the ideological-confrontational (militancy and struggle). Conclusions are that the most effective movement-education programs are found either in mass reformist movements seeking to extend democratic participation and secure folk political dominance or in elite movements seeking to defend traditional rights. A paradigm of social groups illustrates how key characteristics of size and power can be used to classify social and ethnic movements and thus indicate their potential for mounting educational programs with some promise of accomplishing movement objectives. Movements and folk high schools  of the Swedish-Lapps, the Swede-Finns, U.S. Danes, the Norwegians, and the pre-World War II American labor colleges are cited. (KC)",

        "description":"The paper describes a research project to determine fertility-related family decision making processes. Fertility-related decisions are interpreted as all ultimate choices made by spouses concerning the number and spacing of children they will have. Specifically, the research investigated how factors such as the desire for more or less egalitarian role status between husband and wife, socio-economic influences, and individual needs and desires led spouses to arrive at a decision as to family size. The hypothesis is that choice of family size is influenced directly by social psychological processes within the household and indirectly by social and economic variables. Social psychological processes are based on attitudes, personalities, and interpersonal orientations of the husband  and wife. A sample of 229 married couples was interviewed concerning desired and intended family size. Findings generally supported the hypothesis. The conclusion is that social exchange processes within the family are major determinants of family size and that these processes are influenced by social and economic variables. (DB)",

        "description":"The paper discusses the use of music-based experiments to illuminate teachers' understanding of their own and pupils' informal ways of learning. The major objective of the paper is to help teachers understand students' learning processes. Because one central problem in academic research is that of finding the right questions, researchers should begin with the various ways children learn. In experiments, the teacher bases hypotheses on subjective awareness and interventions and then tests her hunches concerning the student's intuitive strategies. This process adds to a teacher's self-knowledge and increases understanding of the child's current knowledge and ways of learning. With this increased understanding, a teacher can help the child integrate his basic cognitive skills with  the more formal basic skills used in schools. The success of these experiments is dependent upon the teacher's willingness to take risks and a realization that her own and the student's errors show cognitive work in progress. It is concluded that because music and the arts are non-threatening, they are rich in opportunities for illuminating cognitive research and research in adult learning or teacher development, by being used as a source of mediation between intuitive knowledge and the more formal skills taught in the schools.

        "description":"Based upon the theory of moral stages devised by educational psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg, this report examines the influence of the social situation on principled moral reasoning and on cheating. Research assessed the level of moral reasoning for 152 college juniors and seniors using Rest's Defining Issues Test (1976) in which levels of low, medium and high corresponded to Kohlberg's preconventional, conventional, and principled stages. Half the subjects took the Hartshorne and May Circles Test (in which they are given five tries to memorize the location of ten circles on a sheet of paper and then to write the numbers in the corresponding circles with their eyes closed) in a high-threat, high supervision situation. The other half took the test in a low-threat, low-supervision  situation. Controls were established by administering the test to 67 blindfolded undergraduates, computing a mean score, and establishing a score categorized as cheating. Results indicate that lows cheated significantly more than either Mediums or Highs; however, a relationship was found between principled moral reasoning only in the high threat, high-supervision situation in which none of the ten Highs cheated. The conclusion is that variations in a moral conduct situation may influence the behavior of principled subjects, depending upon how the two different situations are preceived by the subjects. (KC)",

Among the questions examined were (1) what distinguishes poor learners from good learners, and (2) how do the learning strategies of map-using experts differ from those of nonexpert learners? Eight subjects participated in the study. Five were undergraduate students at the University of California at Los Angeles and three were experts with military or scientific expertise in map reading. All subjects were given two maps of an imaginary town and country. They were allowed six trials of two minutes each in which to learn the information in the maps well enough to draw them from memory and answer questions about their contents. During the six trials they were required to think aloud about how they were  going about learning the maps. Analysis of the subjects' verbal reports and performance on a test of map content indicated that four types of learning processes were used: attention, encoding, evaluation, and control. The use of processes for encoding spatial information (storing it in long-term memory and relating it to other information already learned) was most predictive of learning performance. Good learners differed from poor learners in their ability to evaluate their learning progress and to focus their attention on unlearned information. (Author/AV)",

Global R&D priorities in order of importance include military technology, basic research, space, energy, health, information processing, transportation, pollution control, and agriculture. The majority of R&D efforts are made by industrialized nations and are geared to meeting the political and economic goals of industrialized nations. In leading the global R&D race the United States has recently encountered competition from Japan and Western Europe due to their recovery from economic and manpower losses incurred during World War II. One lasting effect of World War II has been the merging of science and government. Control of funds gives governments  great influence over national R&D priorities. Formerly producing the atomic bomb, mass production of penicillin, and radar, government-funded scientific R&D now emphasizes nuclear research. Funds for basic research generally are awarded to universities. Corporate R&D receives funds from industry as well as government. In the United States, most of the industrial R&D occurs in aerospace, electronics, and motor vehicles. Because developing nations are so technologically dependent upon industrialized nations, efforts have been made recently to form international R&D coalitions to study Third World problems. (AV)",

Objectives are to encourage the child to organize his inquiry using social studies skills, to provide him with a means of understanding the world around him, and to help him examine and begin to develop his own system of values. Twenty-five learning activities and eight evaluation methods are suggested. The units are outlined in seven sections, under headings of concepts, major understandings, topics, and details of content. Each section covers a year of study. Year 1 describes the family as a social unit, discussing family functions, relationships, and possible changes. Year 2 studies the  organization and internal relationships of the community, while Year 3 emphasizes interactions between the community and other communities, the community and its physical environment, and community growth. Year 4 stresses understanding basic culture concepts through study of an aboriginal culture area.

The objective is to explore the history of the court and to explain its role in the American system of government. The booklet is presented in four chapters. The first chapter, entitled &quot;A Heritage of Law,&quot; offers judicial background from the 1606 Virginia Charter to the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The second chapter, which forms the major part of the document, is entitled &quot;Decisions for Liberty.&quot; It traces the court's growth of scope through precedent-setting decisions such as Chisholm v. Georgia in 1793, Marbury v. Madison in 1803, McCulloch v. Maryland in 1819, Gibbons v. Ogden in 1824, Dred Scott v. Sandford in 1857, Munn v. Illinois in 1877, Northern  Securities v. United States in 1904, Adkins v. Children's Hospital in 1923, Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, Gideon v. Wainwright in 1963, and Roe v. Wade in 1973. Chief Justices and events are described historically in connection with the cases, from John Jay to Warren Burger, as the court's power as interpreter of the Constitution grew. The third chapter discusses court procedures, staff duties, the building, and the duties of the justices. Chapter IV offers a brief description of the powers and limitations of the federal court system, including contemporary reforms and technical innovations. An index concludes the booklet. (CK)",

        "description":"The booklet presents an historical narrative of banks and banking events leading to the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1914. The document is divided into three chapters. Chapter I discusses attempts to establish a bank before the 20th century, describing the creation of two central banks whose chapters were allowed to lapse, the First Bank of the United States in 1791, and the Second Bank of the United States in 1816. It hypothesizes that the National Banking Act of 1863 was inadequate because it failed to provide a central banking structure and, further, that the financial panics and economic depression which followed this act were triggered by inelastic currency and immobile reserves. Chapter II details financial reform in the 20th century, concentrating on the  activities of the 1908 National Monetary Commission, and the pros and cons of the Aldrich plan of 1911. It also traces how the Pujo hearings investigating the &quot;money trust,&quot; and the election of Woodrow Wilson led to the Glass-Willis proposal in 1912. Also described are the introduction of the Federal Reserve bill into Congress in 1913, and the ensuing political struggle, compromises, and final adoption. Chapter III outlines the establishment of the system, including selection criteria for each of the 12 regional centers, organization of national banks into formal membership, election of local directors, and Wilson's appointment of and Congressional ratification of the Federal Reserve Board. Concluding comments recount how, on November 16, 1914, the Federal Reserve banks opened, without  permanent headquarters and with very little business. (CK)",

The document is divided into seven sections. Each section presents concepts, offers three supporting examples, one of which is child-oriented, and concludes with a restatement of the concept. Section I discusses scarcity and introduces topics such as the need to allocate resources, supply and demand, trade, and population movements. Section II explores natural resources, including exhaustible and renewable resources, conservation, and government regulation. Human resources are studied in Section III, which covers employment-related subjects,  individual adaptation, and the need for education. Section IV surveys capital resources, defining capital and discussing topics such as representative goods, capital goods, capital formation, standard of living, and profits. Section V outlines forms of business organization, while Section VI investigates money and credit through examples elucidating the role and value of money, inflation and deflation, money supply, coin and currency, the Federal Reserve System, and banks. Section VII considers the government role in economics, including government goods and services, government regulation, lawmaking, taxation, and fiscal policy. (CK)",

        "author":["Ruhly, Sharon",
          "Sprague, Jo"],
        "description":"The paper suggests that culturally determined patterns of perception should be related to Fritz Heider's attribution theory in order to understand differences of perception in male-female interaction. The first section explains Heider's theory as a complex process in which past experiences with the person or act may influence perceptions. For instance, a stumble by a person &quot;known&quot; to be clumsy will be perceived as a clumsy act, whereas an action perceived as &quot;aggressive&quot; may lead the observer to attribute aggressiveness to the actor's personality. The second section applies the theory to the professional situation and the home setting, using one specific sex difference -- patterns of interruption--as an illustration. In order to be heard at a board meeting, for example, a woman  may have to speak more loudly than usual. This action may cause the men present to view the interruption as more important than the woman intended; the woman may become known as an aggressive, pushy person. In the home situation, interruption by the wife may be interpreted as &quot;bitchiness&quot; or the blame may be placed on the environment, i.e., pushy feminist influences. The third section discusses field sensitivity and field independence in assessing cross-cultural applicability of Heider's theory. These cultural patterns of perception refer to the tendency to synthesize or to analyze elements in the perceptual field. Heider's theory implies the superiority of the field independent or analytic approach. Thus, his theory should be reconsidered with particular attention given to whether and  how sexes and cultures differ in perceptions. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"College political science departments can derive several benefits by offering computer utilization and survey research courses to secondary social science teachers. Presently, attitudes of both teachers and students toward the relationship between the \"hard sciences\" and the social sciences account for the lack of computer utilization in that area on the secondary level. Problems are created for political scientists as a result of these attitudes since many political science courses are in part quantitative. Also, the lack of contact with political science departments make secondary teachers unaware of political science course offerings. Currently, a course for secondary social science teachers at Youngstown State University combines the development of computing and quantitative  skills concurrently with the teaching of elementary survey research skills. Teachers are taught to manipulate computer television terminals for processing data, and attempt to write their own programs. They also learn how to design a survey questionnaire, draw a sample, gather data, convert data to readable computer form, and present results. Benefits are that teachers who attend these courses are a valuable source for influencing high school students to major in political science, many students will enter political science courses with quantitative skills, and political scientists could use local schools for field research.

There was sufficient disagreement in the results to prevent a conclusion of equivalency of the two methods. Attempts to explain the disagreements did not provide sufficient evidence to disregard these differences. However, a brief comparison of one of Walbesser's ratios and White's statistics did show an interesting similarity, suggesting that a planned comparison might give statistical support to a cutoff score for the consistency ratio.

Evidence for an asymmetrically contingent pattern of interaction between the principals and teachers was provided by findings that principals made more verbalizations than teachers, as well as more influence attempts and directing attempts. They also refused to comply with others' influence attempts proportionately more than the teachers. When the number of verbalizations were held constant, however, the pattern of interaction of the two groups was similar. The results of coding the verbal interaction with this system illustrated the complimentary roles of qualitative and quantitative approaches to educational research. The  hypothesis developed from the findings of a qualitative study of the educational task group was tested by a theory-based quantitative procedure, which provided support for the validity of the qualitative study findings.

Sixty-three men and 63 women ranging from 18 to 78 years of age, with at least 12 years of schooling, were administered Kagan's MFF and the vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). While internal consistency reliability was high for the latency scores, it was only moderate for the error scores. As expected, error and latency scores were strongly related and were orthogonal to verbal ability. Results of a multivariate analysis of variance and follow up analyses indicated that older adults had significantly longer latencies than  middle-aged and younger adults. Reflectivity in older adults was suggested to be part of a general pattern of slowing down in both cognitive and pscyhomotor activities. Therefore, further research aimed at modifying the cognitive tempo of young, middle-aged, and older adults was advocated. However, such research must be preceded by revision of the adult version of the MFF so that it is more reliable. (Author/RD)",

There are problems associated with the use of each group as a baseline for identifying the &quot;true&quot; treatment effect. A general, two-step control procedure was advocated in which the researcher first identifies the most appropriate control group for a given context and then supplements this experimental control with statistical control. In reference to the latter controls, procedures were presented for developing a task-specific index as a covariable to be employed with a suitable measure of verbal aptitude in a multiple analysis of covariance.  The procedure was demonstrated on data from a quasi-experimental design in which it was shown that three different conclusions were possible, depending upon the control procedures employed. The converging operations obtained from the multivariate approach to the data analyses supported the results from the two-step control procedure. (Author/RD)",

The theories advanced by various evaluators have changed over the years, thus illustrating ten principles of evaluation. The starting point for theory development or modification is self-reflection and review of one's own writings. Public conceptions of a theory are based upon publications describing it; different conceptions are possible. Theoretical formulations are subject to continual change. Other principles suggest major factors for modifying evaluation theory. At conference sumposia, for example, an evaluation theory can be interpreted by colleagues, and compared and contrasted to other theories; here also, evaluators can learn to understand contrasting  arguments and to challenge or extend inferences. Another phase in evaluation theory development becomes possible when theory consolidation or theory categorization takes place. Other factors influencing theory development include field based experience, and interaction with colleagues who have compatible points of view. Finally, evaluation theory development is conditioned by human beings and their associations, motivations, intuitions, and imaginations. (GDC)",

In the present study, 44 undergraduate students who read a hierarchically structured text were asked to recall its contents immediately and again six weeks later. The generation of topically related knowledge prior to text processing, coupled with the availability of text topics and hierarchical structure at retrieval, produced the highest level of overall recall after a six-week interval had elapsed. The availability of text topics and hierarchical structure also enhanced the generation of productive ideas when recall was tested after six weeks. These findings suggest that students should be discouraged from  processing instructional discourse along solely reproductive lines. If new information is compartmentalized and differentiated from preexisting knowledge, then learning outcomes will be limited. Students who process instructional material productively can generate legitimate new products by combining newly acquired information with preexisting referential knowledge. (Author/RD)",

        "description":"The accuracy with which regression models estimate treatment effects is dependent upon a number of conditions. The stability of the regression line (a function of sample size and correlation between pretest and posttest) is said to be the most important of these conditions. The utility of regression models is proportional to the size of the correlation between pretest and posttest. As the size of the correlation increases, the predicted posttest scores of the treatment group decreases. This produces a corresponding increase in the difference between predicted and observed scores. It is further stated that in compensatory education projects, factors which lower the correlation between pretest and posttest for low scoring students may invalidate the results. Given these condition,  this study examined the impact of the correlation between pretest and posttest on the accuracy with which regression models estimate treatment effects in Title I evaluation. More specifically, the effect of the correlation between pretest and posttest on the estimation of treatment effects with regression models was studied, using simulated data. Conclusions regarding the importance of the pretest-posttest correlation varied, depending on whether more emphasis is placed upon unbiased estimates or efficiency. (Author/JKS)",

Score increases at two Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) coaching schools and Law School Admission Test (LSAT) schools were compared. Over 1,400 SAT examinees and 31,000 LSAT examinees, administered these tests between 1974 and 1977, were involved. Comparisons were reported by study subgroup: uncoached first-time examinees; coached first-time examinees; uncoached second-time examinees; second-time examinees coached before the first test; and second-time examinees coached between test administrations. Results indicated that coaching was significantly effective in raising SAT scores. LSAT coaching was  marginally effective, possibly because of the abnormally large control group increases and the relatively low correlation between grade point average and LSAT scores. However, the Federal Trade Commission acknowledges that there are &quot;several major flaws in the data analysis, making the results unreliable.&quot; (The history of both tests, an analysis of coaching research; a description of the sales, tuition costs, and claims of major coaching schools; extensive graphs of test score data; and case histories of 17 coached LSAT examinees are included).

(The Stanley H. Kaplan Educational Center, Inc., and the Test Preparation Center, Inc.). Multiple regression analysis was used to control for student demographic variables. Separate analyses were conducted for the two schools, for students who were coached before their first SAT, or between their first and second SAT administrations. Coaching was effective at the Kaplan School, where students tended to be underachievers--i.e. they scored lower on standardized examinations than would have been predicted by personal and demographic variables. Kaplan students who were not underachievers also  benefited from coaching; however, this finding was based on a limited sample, covering only a single administration of the verbal section of the SAT. Coaching at the Test Preparation Center was not found to be effective. However, these students were not underachievers. Results of this study were inconclusive, partly because of the non-experimental design. It was impossible to consider all possible effects of self-selection--for example, the possibility that students who chose to enroll in coaching schools were especially motivated to achieve higher scores.

Based on test results, the following conclusions were reached: (1) a substantial proportion of entering freshmen were not adequately prepared in the basic subjects to succeed in college-level work; (2) the problem of basic skills deficiencies was present at all two-year and four-year colleges; and (3) of the students tested, the majority had studied high school English and mathematics for at least three years. Although some colleges did not test all  entering freshmen, especially part-time students, the authors believe that if more students had been tested, the proportion showing a need for remediation would have been even higher.

Groups of subjects rated groups of their peers on 20 factors, on a subset of 10 factors, and on a subset of five factors. Rating statements included: learning ability; leadership; quality of work; motivation; ability to follow instructions; bearing and behavior; accuracy; oral communication; problem analysis; initiative; quality of work; written communication; punctuality; adaptability; dependability; emotional stability; human relations; judgment; knowledge of duties; and honesty. Profiles, based on group ratings, were developed for each  subject and given to the group members to identify. Profiles made from 20 rating statements were identified no better than profiles developed from 5 rating statements. Also, the use of two rating statements, learning ability and knowledge of duties, were found to produce information about a rate which could not be improved by the addition of many more rating factors. When the external criterion was used, results indicated that sets of statements larger than five did not provide better recognition of peers. (MH)",

Separate analyses were conducted for each year (1975-6 and 1976-7) and for each grade (4 and 8). A single indicator of school achievement was used--mean standardized scores on the subtests of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills. In response to the problem of different collection times for different data sets, the primary analyses were  conducted on the 1976-77 set. A series of strategies were employed to overcome the statistical problems associated with a large number of variables and limited degrees of freedom. Despite these conceptual, methodological, and statistical problems, research with existing data bases was worth the effort; however, the appropriateness of an existing data base for answering new questions depends on the similarity between the original and the new questions.

A third concept is the componential theory of intelligence, based on information processing models, and consisting of two basic units of analysis, the component and the metacomponent. The component is described as an elementary psychological process which operates on internal representations of objects on symbols; these components are encoding, inference, mapping, application, justification, and response. A metacomponent is described as a higher order psychological process which controls processes related to  executing components; metacomponents consist of component selection, representation selection, strategy selection or planning, strategy monitoring, speed-accuracy tradeoff decisions, and solution monitoring. Conclusions were made, based on research using parochial school children in grades 2, 4, and 6 and college level adults: (1) that children show increased use of exhaustive information processing as they grow older; (2) older children are generally less willing to surrender accuracy for speed; and (3) older individuals are more consistent in applying a strategy to problem solving, although there is no evidence of a general strategy shift in time for any age group.

The investigation sought to: (1) provide new developmental tests of a componential theory of analogical reasoning; (2) identify strategy changes during the transition from midchildhood (grade 3) to adulthood (college); (3) compare the development of reasoning across five different verbal relations; and (4) to validate a new method (stem-splitting) of isolating component cognitive processes. Twenty subjects in each of grades three, six, nine, and in college were tested on their abilities to solve verbal analogies based on synonymy, antonymy, category membership, linear ordering, and function in three different formats. It was found that the  componential theory was successful in accounting for response-time data at all grade levels and error data at all but the college level; third- and sixth-graders used a different strategy from the strategy used by ninth-graders and college students; antonymous and functional relations were the easiest to process at all levels; and the new method of isolating component cognitive processes provided new insights into age-related strategy changes in the solution of verbal analogies.

Ratings of training adequacy and frequency of task performance obtained from school graduates were equivalent to those obtained from graduates' supervisors. In the short run, questionnaires were least expensive for data collection, and job knowledge tests were the most expensive. Over the long term, with larger  populations of graduates, job knowledge tests became less expensive while structured interview costs remained high. Selection of methods for data collection must also consider the specific information needs to be met, plus the relative power of each method for producing the needed information. (Author/MH)",

Four alternative information-processing models were fit to the group latency data at each grade level. These models were: (1) spatial, whereby the terms of a linear syllogism are represented in the form of a linear spatial array; (2) linguistic, whereby linear syllogisms are solved via inferences on functional relations represented by linguistic deep structures; (3) algorithmic, whereby people solve linear syllogisms by applying a  series of simple, essentially mechanical steps; and (4) mixed, which combines selected features of the spatial and linguistic models, and adds new features of its own. The latency data supported the mixed model at each grade level, although in grade 9 the model was not the preferred one until the second session of testing. (Author/MH)",

        "description":"The conference focused upon the users of tests in counseling and guidance. The first session centered on multi-factor ability test batteries, with papers on Use of Multi-Factor Aptitude Tests in School Counseling, by Robert D. North; Use of the General Aptitude Test Battery in the Employment Service, by Pauline K. Anderson; Service Tests of Multiple Aptitudes, by Edward E. Cureton; and Logic of and Assumptions Underlying Differential Testing, by John W. French. Papers in the second session considered methods of improving communication of test information. Particular attention was given to the responsibility of the test user for initiating and maintaining communication with the test author and publisher. Papers were given by John W. Gustad on Helping Students Understand Test  Information; Alexander G. Wesman on the Obligations of the Test User; and David H. Dingilian on How Basic Organization Influences Testing. The lucheon address was a re-examination of the role of the psychologist in modern society, presented by Morris S. Viteles. The final session reviewed the relative merits of clinical and actuarial approaches to prediction. Participants in the panel were Nevitt Sanford, Charles C. McArthur, Joseph Zubin, Lloyd G. Humphreys, and Paul E. Meehl. (BH)",

        "description":"The conference theme was Testing--Then and Now, based upon the assumption that psychometrists should review their origins and look forward to their future. In the area of intelligence testing, Nancy Bayley discussed the research that re-assessed previous concepts of the nature of intellectual growth and decline. Thelma Thurstone discussed new evidence regarding the differences in the rates of achieving intellectual primes for the primary mental abilities. Gardner Murphy presented a new orientation to the field of personality appraisal, and Morris Krugman discussed the relationship between the newer concepts of personality and current methods of appraisal. The luncheon address was presented by Ben D. Wood. As for achievement testing, Ralph Taylor reviewed the approaches to  curriculum then and now; John Dobbins reported on recent measurement of achievement in today's schools; and Louis Hacker discussed the need for appraising the ability and achievement of adults who are returning to college after normal working hours.

        "description":"The RMC Model A (norm-referenced) for evaluation of Title I programs is based upon the equipercentile assumption--that students maintain their percentile rank over a one-year period, provided that no special instrucional intervention is introduced. The control group, essentially the sample used to standardize the achievement test, represents the no-treatment expectation. The treatment effect is defined as the average posttest performance minus the average pretest performance. Title I participants are usually selected based upon low pretest scores, and may bias the results of Model A evaluation because low ability students generally regress toward the mean without any intervention. Two models which could estimate the no-treatment expectation and which might solve these problems  were investigated: (1) Murray's recursive path analytic paradigm, encompassing three achievement measures, a group factor, an individual differences within group factor, and an error component; and (2) an extension of the one independent variable regression situation. Results indicated that for local districts with fewer than 500 students per grade, the no-treatment expectation would probably be overestimated. These two methods would be acceptable for use in districts with 2,000 or more students per grade. The use of local correlations, based on non-Title I participants, was also suggested. (GDC)",

        "description":"Normative data reported by publishers of the California Achievement Test, the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, and the SRA Assessment Survey were used to illustrate a procedure for specifying goals for Title I programs in terms of normal curve equivalent (NCE) gains. The procedure was based on the amount of growth reflected in student reading and mathematics norms from one grade level to another, grades two to eleven inclusive. Specifically, the spring-to-spring standardized gains used as the no-treatment expectation were calculated, by subtracting the pretest means at the lower grade level from the posttest means at that grade, and dividing by the standard deviation on the pretest. Administrators can use the procedure, presented as tables of data, to subjectively judge Title  I impact as a function of the percentage of increase which would be expected without the program. The procedure should be used with caution, however, because NCE gains across levels were not comparable, and because gains at higher grade levels were increasingly difficult to observe. (CP)",

The essay test was designed to measure creative or fluid (abstract) ability; half of the objective items required fluid ability and half required  crystallized (concrete) ability.

        "description":"A sample of mothers and daughters from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience is examined to find out whether living in a one parent family has any effect on the chances of a daughter's completing high school. The sample is limited to mothers and daughters living in the same household during the initial sample screening in 1968. Three measures of family stability are given: the percentage of families ever headed by one parent; the percentage of families headed by one parent for at least two years; and the percentage of families headed by one parent at any time during the years when the daughter was aged 14 to 18. Average family income and number of siblings are also shown. Multiple regression analysis shows that failure to complete high school varies due to  a number of factors, including length of time ever lived in a one parent family; level of family income during the high school years; educational level of mother; and knowledge of the world of work. It is found that low income is the single most significant factor in accounting for the probability of a daughter dropping out of high school, both for whites and blacks. (Author/MC)",

        "description":"An evaluation was conducted of the second year of Project REAL (Relevant Experiences for Alternative Learning), which provides high school students in Newark, Delaware, with community-based career development experiences and relates these learning activities to the curriculum of life skills, basic skills, and career development. In the area of student outcomes it was found that students did not improve in basic skills or career decision-making and employment-seeking skills after participating in the project. Nevertheless, learning managers and community instructors rated the students high in personal employment and career-related dimensions. In the category of student process goals and objectives, the project has been successful in its placement of students in diverse community  work sites, implementation of a comprehensive student assessment system, instruction in dealing with sex bias and discrimination, and award of credit for project participation. The project has also fulfilled its proposed management process tasks: developing and implementing management and staff development plans, obtaining parental permission for student participation, providing insurance for participants, and establishing a project advisory board. Recommendations were made for improvements in the three evaluated areas. (The appendixes contain the evaluation plan and a checklist of essential characteristics for implementation sites.) (ELG)",

        "author":["Ausburn, Lynna J."],
        "description":"A U.S. Air Force study was designed to investigate simultaneously four cognitive styles--field dependence-independence, reflectivity-impulsivity, leveling-sharpening, and visual-haptics. A sample of 206 undergraduate volunteers at the University of Oklahoma were tested with the Successive Perceptual Test I (SPT-I), the Hidden Figures Test (HFT), Matching Familiar Figures (MFF), and the Leveling/Sharpening House Test (LSHT) in order to assess their cognitive styles. The obtained data were analyzed in three stages: (1) chi-square tests were used to compare obtained distributions of visual and haptic perceptual types in the field independent, field dependent, reflective, impulsive, leveling and sharpening groups with Lowenfeld's theoretical distribution of 50% visuals, 25%  indefinites, and 25% haptics; (2) four variables of score on HFT, errors on MFF, mean latency on MFF, and leveling-sharpening ratio on LSHT were tested in a step-wise discriminant analysis to determine if they could predict or discriminate between visual and haptic perceptual types; and (3) finally, the relationships among the variables of the study were further explored with a factor analysis. Results indicated that although the constructs overlapped somewhat, each cognitive style has enough unique characteristics that each must be considered individually. It was suggested that when using cognitive styles as a variable in future research with Air Force Technical training, perhaps requirements of specific tasks involved in the training will dictate which of these cognitive styles holds  the most promise.

Data were collected on the fifteen comprehensive secondary school districts in the sample through two questionnaires administered to selected local education agency (LEA) personnel and the on-site evaluation. Among the findings were that (1) both LEA personnel and on-site evaluation team members agreed that there had been improvement in all occupational education program  components and that the on-site evaluation had contributed to that improvement; (2) both LEA personnel and team members reported that the on-site evaluations were a beneficial and worthwhile investment of resources, and (3) LEA personnel and on-site team members agreed as to the relative improvement in each of the program components.

Part 2 presents articles written by a labor leader who sees EBCE as a way to help young people understand the contributions of labor, a  business manager who believes EBCE will pay off in terms of contributions to industry and society through better prepared and more satisfied job-holders, and a mother who discusses the impact of EBCE on her child. The third section includes articles written by a county career education coordinator who discusses blending EBCE into the school district program; a high school principal who discusses contributions of EBCE to the students, faculty, parents, and community; an EBCE staff member who discusses converting traditional teachers to EBCE; and an EBCE learning coordinator who describes daily tasks of an EBCE coordinator.

        "description":"A series of nine conferences were held to determine how representatives of local businesses and industries across the U.S. view the kinds of skills that are occupationally transferable, and to identify the types of skills important in their firms' work settings in qualifying for job transfers and progressions. Conference participants were persons from a variety of business and industry contexts who had experience in personnel administration and a good understanding of their firms' personnel policies and policy rationale. Each conference centered around four topics: (1) personal occupational experiences and skills, (2) patterns of occupational mobility, (3) assessment of transferable skills, and (4) usefulness of the transferable skills concept. Results of the conferences  indicated that communicating, working with others, problem solving, analyzing/assessing, planning/layout, organizing, managing others, decision making, and positive work attitudes were mentioned most frequently as transferable skills. It was also found that possession of transferable skills is more essential for job openings with long term potential as opposed to immediate job openings. While opinions differed concerning vocational education's role, it was suggested that skills that assist employees to be independent should be emphasized by schools.

Data were obtained primarily through structured personal interview schedules with free options to explore responses and structured questionnaires with open-ended items. All Bureau program specialists and supervisors were invited to participate. In states chosen by stratified random sample, two survyes were conducted with state directors and supervisors of vocational education. As a result of the study, substantial problems affecting the administration and operation of the Bureau were found. Findings and conclusions were placed in nine categories:  national commitment; mission statement; structure; staffing; operational planning system; internal and external communication and cooperation; technical assistance; personnel development; and functional activities. It was concluded that the administration of programs and services to the states would be improved by (1) obtaining a national commitment to vocational education; (2) developing, through a master plan, the structure, staffing pattern, and staff development needed to support that plan; and (3) establishing and maintaining a strong federal-state-local working relationship based on technical assistance and a responsive two-way communications network.

The aim was to identify the conditions existing in vocational education which lessen receptivity on the part of teachers, counselors, and local administrators toward handicapped students entering programs. It was found that negative attitudes contain cognitive and affective dimensions which may be manifested differently. It was also found that the most effective intervention strategies which may be aimed at those attitude dimensions are information approaches and social contact approaches, respectively. Further, it is probably the affective dimensions of negative attitudes toward the handicapped that are most fundamental, and the design  of social contact interventions appears to have much potential for attitudinal change.

Nominations of community-based programs were solicited from state directors of vocational education and community colleges by mail. Two hundred and three nominations were received and were arranged by type of institution, geographical location, and eleven other key variables, e.g., per capita expenditures on education, governance structure of institutions. From the 203 nominations, a representative non-random sample of 22 locations was drawn up for two-day site visitations. Approximately 300 administrators, faculty, students, and community  leaders were interviewed. Of the 22 sites visited, nine locations involving nine community colleges and five area vocational schools were judged to be practicing successful articulation when assessed against 10 criteria. Four major barriers to articulation--competing external expectations of special interest groups, sterotyped perceptions of programs and practices of other institutions, a trend toward providing a common set of educational services, and conflicting educational values--were overcome by the exemplary articulation sites by clarifying common goals, identifying areas of potential benefit through collaboration, and by initially articulating programs and practices which lent themselves to standardization of procedures.

A research and control group each contained ten secondary students, ten high school dropouts enrolled in a Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) Industrial Training Project, and ten postsecondary students employed in industry. Two pretest and posttest instruments dealing with developing a vocational plan,  work habits, the economics of industry, and fifteen work values areas were administered. The research group participated in classroom training on vocational planning, work habits, and the economics of industry. Posttest findings indicated that the factory workers increased in the areas of maturity, security, and supervisory relations. Among the CETA students improvements were made in all fifteen areas of creativity and economic return, and intellectual stimulations.

        "description":"A number of policy questions has emerged as a result of various efforts to improve special education and vocational education services to handicapped students at the secondary level through linkages among general education, special education, and vocational education. These questions reflect recent research findings which demonstrate that the percentage of handicapped adults represented in the work force is far less than the percentage of nonhandicapped adults. Contributing factors include the following: a perceived decline in the number of handicapped students receiving special education services at the secondary level; severe shortages of personnel who are trained in both special education and vocational education; limited vocational education programs and service delivery  options; and a limited funding base. The overriding questions are whether education can become more responsible to the overall needs of handicapped youth and how to determine the most effective means of accomplishing that objective. An analysis of the needs assessment data from four states has identified six issues as most clearly reflecting the state of the art for vocational education of handicapped youth: (1) interagency cooperation, (2) personnel preparation, (3) funding, (4) service delivery/program options, (5) program evaluation, and (6) services to Native Americans and other minority handicapped youth.

        "description":"Traditionally, &quot;masculine&quot; males and &quot;feminine&quot; females are seen as being the most mentally healthy individuals. Recently this view has been challenged by Sandra Bem and other researchers in the area of sex role identity. Bem (1975) maintains that those individuals whose behavioral and emotional repertoires incorporate aspects of both masculine and feminine behaviors are more likely to display adaptive behaviors across a variety of situations. However, Block (1973) has posited that sex role development proceeds in an invariant sequence through the stages of gender identity and self-enhancement, to stages of conformity to external sex role standards and eventually internalized sex role standards, through stages of sex role differentation and, finally, androgyny. One's sex role  orientation would be one aspect of one's general personality development. If this is so, it should be possible to predict an individual's sex role orientation from his or her general personality development. To test this hypothesis, 21 subjects (15 females and six males) were administered the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) and Loevinger's sentence completion test. Subsequently, all subjects were individually administered Kohlberg interviews of moral development. Since there were not enough subjects to allow the use of sample medians in order to assign subjects to sex role orientation, scores on the masculine and feminine scales as the dependent variables were utilized. No significant results were obtained, probably due to the serious problems surrounding the androgyny instrumentation.  Preliminary evidence from a related study also brings into question the validity of self-reports obtained with this instrument. It thus appears premature to dismiss a developmental hypothesis of sex role development. With the resolution of instrumentation issues in this area it is hoped that the development of sex role orientation can be more fully studied from a developmental perspective. (Author/CKJ)",

A causal model was developed which synthesized research findings on turnover in work organizations and on student attrition. Questionnaires were distributed to university freshmen (N=1171).

Findings indicate that female dropouts are not committed to the institution or to attaining a degree, did not do well in high school, do not belong to campus organizations, do not believe that a college education will lead to employment or self-development, perceive an opportunity to transfer, do not find daily life at college repetitive, are not satisfied with being a student, know the social and academic rules of the institution, do  not participate in decision making, and do not meet with staff and faculty members informally. The findings also indicate that male dropouts are not committed to the institution, do not have a high university GPA, are satisfied with being students, do not believe that education leads to self-development, find their lives repetitive, do not know the social and academic rules of the institution well, and often live with their parents.

        "description":"Situational and personal barriers to the educational goals of nonwhite youths in Florida appear to be caused by a variety of subtle and complex factors deeply rooted in the environment of the youths: (1) cultural determinism; (2) attitudes of resistance and antagonism on the part of white teachers and counselors; (3) lack of information on the part of nonwhite teachers and counselors; (4) failure of blacks to acquire needed cognitive skills; (5) unavailability of high level curriculums in segregated or predominantly black schools; (6) inadequate guidance service; (7) delayed or deferred decision making; and (8) lack of intelligent, aggressive concern by many black families. To help young blacks, teachers and counselors must recognize diversity as a genuine characteristic of  blacks. Parents must take more responsibility for children's discipline and teacher cooperation. Black counselors must encourage black students to think more seriously about linking short-range activity and long-range goals. Faithful application of these strategies would greatly expand educational opportunities for nonwhite youth, thereby enabling them to more readily take advantage of such personally, educationally and economically rewarding time-shortened degree tools as the CLEP, early admission, advanced placement, and others.

Respondents were asked their opinions regarding crime trends, fear of crime, residential problems and life styles, and local police performance. Results indicated that Pittsburgh residents believed that others ran a greater risk than they did and that other neighborhoods were less safe than their own. They were far less likely to think that neighborhood crime had risen than they were to believe that crime had increased nationally. A majority felt very safe in their neighborhood during the day and reasonably safe at night. Crime or fear of crime was not a major factor in determining housing or life style although approximately 10% were dissatisfied with police performance. In general, crime or fear of crime had a  greater affect on the opinions of women than men, the elderly than the young, and victim than non-victims. White residents were less likely to have limited their activities, have felt unsafe at night, and more inclined to rate the police favorably than their Black counterparts, but were more likely to believe their chances of victimization had increased.

In order to deal with the child's retardation which resulted from a rare chromosomal aberration previously unexplored in the behavioral therapy literature, parents were instructed in a simple behavioral treatment package consisting of verbal punishment and reinforcement. Treatment was assessed according to a multiple baseline across behaviors design. Results showed significant improvement on all three target behaviors following the application of the treatment intervention.  Transfer of training to the natural environment was assessed and results revealed maintenance of behavioral improvement in a two-month followup. (Author)",

These four areas have been subdivided to achieve 27 basic concerns of the elderly. The 54-item OPCN Survey assesses needs for counseling and attitudes towards needs for counseling in relation to these 27 areas. The survey, administered to a representative sample of 850 older persons in North Florida, reveals that certain groups of older persons have significantly higher needs for counseling than other groups and are thus identified as being \"at risk\" in terms of the provision of immediate counseling  services. The importance of this information is related to further development and use of the OPCN Survey in the three major areas of selection, individual counseling, and program evaluation.

It presents the course goals and objectives, alternate course schedulings, a brief course overview, and a summary evaluation report of the field trials. The second chapter includes training tips that may be valuable to both experienced and inexperienced trainers--tips found in this chapter are fairly general, and may be applied to other  training activities as well as to the specific training of the AITP. The third chapter contains trainer guidelines--a session-by-session account of the mechanics, logistics and techniques to be used in this course. The appendices contain suggestions on alternative methods of evaluating course effectiveness as well as guidelines on how to administer the pretests and posttests of the course. Handouts for the trainees, which the trainer may photocopy for distribution during certain training activities, are included. This section also includes a bibliography and a reference list.

Data were obtained from students at four two-year colleges in New York City. Career innovators comprised one-fifth of the women in the sample, and aspired to a wide range of occupations in managerial and professional fields. Non-innovators almost always chose from a small range of traditional occupations such as nurse, teacher, or secretary. Women students' occupational choices resemble those of their fathers rather than their mothers. Moreover, they anticipate more continuous commitment to work over a 15-year period. Counselors need to be aware of several important differences between women with innovative and non-innovative career choices, and be sensitive  to problems innovative women face. Counselors must also come to understand why these women do not generally seek help, and are resistant to it, despite difficulties. (Author/BEF)",

College women (N=50) were blocked into two groups based on menstrual distress symptom prevalence: a high symptom report group (N=26), and a low symptom report group (N=24). Baseline and stress levels of heart rate, respiration rate, muscle tension, skin temperature, and skin resistance were taken on all subjects during the intermenstrual and critical menstrual cycle phases. A battery of stress-prone personality inventories was  also administered including trait anxiety, locus of control, and type-A behavior pattern. Comparisons by ANOVA with repeated measures indicated that there were significant differences in baseline levels of heart rate, respiration rate, and skin temperature in women reporting high menstrual distress symptoms. Utilization of ANOVA with repeated measures revealed that heart rate and respiration rate levels were higher in the critical phase of the menstrual cycle, nonspecific to a symptom group. Comparisons by t-tests indicated significant differences in type-A behavior pattern, locus of control, with the high MDS reporters exhibiting more stress-prone traits than low reporters. (Author)",

        "description":"The relationship between birth order and how a person deals with death is investigated. Both theoretical and empirical evidence indicates that birth order influences how a person deals with life tasks. First-borns appear more achievement-oriented than their younger siblings, as exemplified by the fact that disproportionately greater numbers of first-borns have been found among eminent men. A strong achievement orientation appears to presuppose considerable concern with plans, goals, possibilities and projects, all of which require a future oriented consciousness. One's personal death is the future event which is the boundary for all achievement. It was hypothesized that, because of their achievement/future orientation, first borns would show greater death threat than either  middle borns or last borns on the Threat Index. Also, it was hypothesized that first borns would consciously report less concern with death when answering questions directly assessing death concerns. College student volunteers (66 males and 52 females), mean age 22.1 years, were administered the Threat Index (Hays, 1974) and the Death Concern Scale (Dickstein, 1972). As predicted, first borns showed a greater mean Threat Index Score than either the middle born group or the last born group. The first born group recorded the smallest mean Death Concern Scale score followed by the middle born group, then by the last born. As hypothesized, first borns, relative to middle borns and last borns, demonstrated greater death threat on the Threat Index as well as significantly less death concerns on  the Death Concern Scale. Thus a pattern emerged for first borns as being more threatened by death and as avoiding death-related issues. Findings are consistent with the notion that birth order, through its impact upon the formulation of life style, may influence the manner in which the individual deals with death. (Author/PJC)",

The publications cited focus on attendance policies and techniques for reducing truancy. The techniques mentioned include alternative individualized programs, punishments (such as lowered grades) for absences, and rewards (such as parties or higher grades) for good attendance. Programs using student aides, counselors, welfare caseworkers, and student &quot;buddies&quot; are explained. Several studies are cited including one that suggested that high school truancy is related to other deviant behaviors. Another found that larger schools in urban areas have the highest absentee rates. (JM)",

        "description":"This paper surveys the recent literature on the implementation of educational innovations and reviews and synthesizes research findings and recommendations for improving educational practices. It focuses on the implementation processes, influences, and effects that are considered to be important variables in educational change, and explores patterns of interaction between external agencies and local school personnel engaged in implementing innovations. The major section of the paper includes a discussion of trends in research on educational implementation. It reviews six models of the change process and presents case studies illustrating these models. It also discusses barriers and facilitators influencing the planning and implementation of innovations, and describes the roles of  internal and external groups and individuals involved in these processes. The summary and conclusions section emphasizes that the processes of planning and implementation--including communication, training, and assistance--require systematic attention in order to ensure project effectiveness. Finally, it is suggested that greater use should be made of research findings and that collaboration between internal and external groups and coordination of resources are desirable and probably necessary for the effective implementation of educational innovations.

It is also intended to help administrative staff, teachers, other school-site staff, students, parents, and community members and groups become aware of school-related problems that are precipitated by their actions and reactions. The manual does not contain specific methods for implementing the strategies suggested; therefore, the individuals who are selected to implement the strategies can structure approaches consistent with their skills, resources, and special needs. In creating the manual, the committee worked from various matrices that combined elements including 26 general sources of  school-related problems and six target groups. In developing the problem statements and strategies for the manual, the committee used four particularly important problem areas--individual differences/values, communication, expectations of others, and perceptions/attitudes/stereotyping. Each of the 13 most important relationships between target groups is treated in a chart presenting the problem areas, the problems, and strategies for correcting the problem. (Author/IRT)",

In analyzing the current operating expenditures for 1976-77, expenditures were divided into two components--instructional programs and noninstructional service programs--and converted to weighted pupil unit amounts. The measure of need for instructional expenses consists of four weighting factors--regular classes, vocational education classes, classes for the handicapped, and teacher training and experience. The study is limited to the critical financial factors that enter into the measure of educational need on the expenditure side. Numerous tables are included.  (Author/IRT)",

The evaluation plan is based on a framework that identifies variables and relationships among variables in four categories: IGE support system components, pupil and staff background, means of instruction, and pupil and staff outcomes. The proposed investigation is divided into four phases. The first phase is a 100-school survey, the second is a follow-up and extension study, the third is an intensive study of the degree of reform and renewal in IGE schools, and the last phase is an examination of the use and effectiveness of two curriculum products of the Wisconsin Research and Development Center for Cognitive Learning. Together the four phases of the  investigation are intended to identify the characteristics of successful schooling as designed for and practiced in IGE elementary schools. (Author/JM)",

In the first paper the author stresses the need to document the scope and nature of child abuse in American society and discusses the difficulties in defining where on the continuum discipline ends and child abuse begins. Some characteristics of situations in which child abuse is likely to occur, such as the working single parent home, are cited. Courses in parenting are suggested as part of the effort to reduce child abuse. The author finds society's willingness to accept corporal punishment as an acceptable means of discipline at the root of the child abuse problem. Six suggestions for reducing abuse are provided. The  second paper focuses on the impact of institutionalization on the behavior and development of retarded individuals. It is contended that three classes of variables determine the effects of institutionalization; they are individual characteristics, the nature of the institution, and measures of the behavioral status and growth of retarded persons (including both cognitive and motivational factors). The importance of the institutional variable is stressed, and incorporates areas such as demography, social/psychological characteristics of the institution, administrative structure, employee attitudes, and actual resident care. Results of several studies are provided. (PHR)",

The development of the earliest patterns of interaction between mother and infant is discussed, along with the relationship between developmental dysfunction and mother-infant interaction. A communication model for the early interaction between infant and mother is presented, emphasizing the importance of nonverbal communication and the rhythmic patterning of cues as a means by which each partner comes to have expectations for the behaviors of the other member of the dyad. Some major strategies for the longitudinal study of mother-infant interaction are described, and  a procedure for recording mother-child communication codes is presented. The kinds of behaviors that are recorded between mother and infant are outlined, with an emphasis on the context in which the behavior is observed. A study of 20 individual mother-infant relationships is described, with the analyses of 30 complex interactional variables for the 20 normal Ss providing a frame of reference with which data from one individual mother-infant pair is compared.

The Ss and settings are described and the procedures used are outlined. The four behaviors targeted for the study were object rolling, hand wringing, hand flapping, and repetitive verbalizations. For each S three positive behaviors (playing appropriately, head orientation, etc.) and three negative behaviors (throwing, body rocking, etc.) were identified. Findings showed that parents were effective change agents  with their children and all four target behaviors decreased when overcorrection procedures were applied. Of the positive and negative behaviors identified, head orientation was most sensitive to changes in the self stimulatory target behaviors; as the target behaviors decreased, head orientation increased significantly.

This material is designed to supplement the Defense Language Institute's course in Saudi Arabic. In order to impart awareness of Saudi cultural characteristics, 66 hypothetical situations that might be encountered in day-to-day living in the Arab Middle East are described. The student is asked to choose which of several given analyses of each situation is correct. For each choice, an explanation is offered for the correctness or incorrectness of the response. The student is required to make choices until the correct analysis is selected. The amount of time required to complete the course is therefore dependent on the individual student's ability to learn to  recognize the correct cultural explanation of the behavior of participants in a given situation.

        "description":"The extension of languages across cultural boundaries engenders a cosmopolitan literature which is often characterized by the effects of biculturalism. The evidence seems to indicate that bilingualism and biculturalism can exert a subtle influence upon a writer's choice of words, and can penetrate the author's style and grammar. Most of the resulting difficulties for the bilingual writer come from the need to think about and express in one language concepts that come from another language. In other words, the writer finds himself within a thought-language-culture triangle, part of which overlaps another culture. This overlapping creates conflicts in the expression of certain culture-bound concept categories which may differ in both the diversity of what they cover and the depth  or intensity to which they cover it. These differences in diversity and intensity may be analyzed and measured. Examples chosen primarily from French and English literature illustrate devices which bilingual writers use in their attempt to escape the influence of the other language or the other culture around him.

Results were analyzed to determine the effects of learner characteristics on the development of second language competence. Four factors in learning success were posited: attitude, strategy, aptitude, and field independence. Aptitude consistently accounted for the largest portion of the variance in achievement. Only certain strategies were found to be responsible for achievement, the chief of which was functional practice. The most critical component of the attitude factor in terms of its effect on achievement was emotional intensity. Field independence was not found to be significantly related to achievement. These findings are  taken into account in the revision of a model of language learning processes, which is viewed as having pedagogical implications. (JB)",

In a &quot;territorial solution,&quot; an individual can claim official status for his language only in a limited part of the country. This study claims that the official option for bilingualism according to the personal solution is founded on an erroneous analysis of the Canadian situation. This claim is developed in three parts: (1) Constitutional legislative and political aspects of Canadian bilingualism; (2) bilingualism from &quot;one ocean to the other&quot;; and (3) the question of a bilingual or a French Quebec. Part One discusses Article  133 of the British North American Act (1867), the Royal commission to investigate bilingualism and biculturalism, the Official Language Act, and the multicultural politics of the federal government. Part Two treats personal and territorial solutions, a bilingualism of the elite, French minorities outside Quebec, and the mechanisms of assimilation into the English-speaking group. Part Three discusses the question of false linguistic security in Quebec and the French language as spoken in Quebec. (AMH)",

The eight issues or areas of concern include: clarification of institutional purposes, clarification of programs, clarification of budget priorities, income development, program technology and management, program requirements and outcomes, academic and student behavior, and program evaluation. The phrase &quot;campus-wide governance&quot; is used to refer to those forms and arrangements for institutional decision-making, problem-solving, idea formation, and opinion expression that involve more than one constituency in the  institution. Historical background on the university and a discussion of the evolution of campus-wide governance at the university are presented. The operations of the university's campus-wide governance mechanisms in each of the eight areas of concern are examined in detail. Appendices include the Constitution of the Faculty and By-Laws of Roosevelt University, the mission of Roosevelt University, the student code of conduct and the Judicial Review Board composition and procedure, and the Roosevelt University committee list.

Among the five difficulties seen as a result of failure to achieve a balanced faculty/student ratio are that minority students will suffer from lack of role models, counseling of minority students by sympathetic minority faculty will be more difficult to achieve, and innovation and the breaking of stereotypes will be hampered. It is contended that federally mandated affirmative action programs have largely failed to produce any of the desired results. An appeal to institutional and individual self-interest is proposed as a means to achieve a balanced minority ratio. It is suggested that once faculty members understand that the future of the programs and college units in which  they work are threatened by failure to achieve a balanced ratio, motivation to bring about the necessary changes will emerge. The legitimacy of the minority status of a candidate as a factor in selection is proposed, and the Bakke case is seen as a precedent for the approach. (PHR)",

Various U.S. Office of Education programs were also reviewed to determine if they might provide student aid more equitably than the student benefit program does. The review was conducted primarily at the Social Security Administration and the Office of Education, but financial aid records for a random sample of student benefit recipients at 119 postsecondary institutions in upstate New York and Los Angeles County, California, were also examined. It is concluded that the student benefit program gives many students more money than their school costs warrant,  inequitably curtails, or bars altogether, benefits to other students, deprives nonstudents, and contributes to other federal aid programs paying unneeded benefits. The Office of Education is willing to provide aid in a more equitable way to postsecondary students now receiving payments from Social Security. It is recommended that Congress enact an amendment to the Social Security Act to discontinue student benefits for postsecondary students and take the necessary steps to assure the Office of Education will have sufficient financial resources to meet any increased demand arising from such discontinuance.

Changes resulting from the implementation of the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant (BEOG) Program in 1972 are surveyed. The resulting financial aid system (with the exception of highly skilled athletes and graduate students at a few institutions) is mostly need-based and federally dominated. The politicization of the need analysis system is explored, and the intrinsically arbitrary nature of determining need is considered. Four problems concerning the involvement of the College Scholarship Service in the financial aid arena are identified, including the need for increased interest by college and university presidents in the  subject. The ramifications of House Resolution 5192, which would enhance the role of the federal government in financial aid administration and provide substantial increases in the BEOG and campus-based programs, are discussed. It is proposed that a group be formed from the higher education community to consult with the Secretary of Education, as called for in H.R. 5192, and for other purposes. The need for self-regulation in the higher education community is stressed as a stand against increased federal regulation. (PHR)",

Among causes cited for interest in the cost of educating health professionals are concern for the cost of health care in general and the size of the budget (an estimated $7.8 billion in 1976-1977). Difficulty in understanding the costs of health professions education lies, in part, in the complexity of teaching, research, and services covered. Cost figures show that in general the greater the research focus of a school, the higher its cost, that faculty and related support personnel account for at least 70 percent of the total  cost figure, and that the lower student/faculty ratio and higher salaries are largely responsible for the greater faculty cost. Five reasons to expect even higher costs in the future, such as a decline in federal research and manpower training funds, are considered. Three recommendations, including removing the mystique from medical education, are offered. Excerpts from the remarks of eight other speakers are also included. (PHR)",

Four major issues related to degree offerings for adults were examined: clientele, access to degree programs, institutional contexts of adult degree programs, and academic components of adult programs. A description of the clientele served by adult programs is presented from the perspective of student perceptions of their program status and the institution's view of adult students. The issue of access is discussed from two perspectives: barriers that impede adults' access to degrees, and accommodations that are being made for adult students. The institutional context of adult degree programs is discussed with regard to the growth of adult programs, their availability in  various types of institutions across the nation, and their involvement in interinstitutional arrangements. The status of adult degree programs in relation to their host institutions is examined with regard to program name distinctions, enrollment size, funding base, and tuition costs. The academic components of degree programs include goals of the curriculum, curricular design, faculty instructional roles, types of learning, and evaluation of learning. It is concluded that adult baccalaureate degree programs need to be granted status equal to that of more traditional programs; adults are still barred from equal access to higher education opportunities, or at least their options are limited to a greater extent than is desirable. A bibliography and a listing of adult baccalaureate programs  by state are included. (SW)",

        "description":"A survey was conducted to gather information about the kinds of formal and informal procedures colleges and universities follow to facilitate sharing of scientific equipment. The survey data represent weighted national estimates for 676 institutions, including all public and private universities, all medical colleges, and all four-year colleges with full-time equivalent enrollments of 2,000 or more students. The institutions that were surveyed were members of the Higher Education Panel of the American Council on Education. It was found that more than one-fourth of these institutions have established systems specifically designed to facilitate equipment sharing, and an additional 18 percent were planning to do so in the near future. The value of equipment in sharing systems was  approximately 10 percent of that in property-accounting systems. Three-fifths of the sharing systems have been in operation for two years or more, and in nearly two-fifths of the sharing systems, the total value of the scientific equipment inventory in each system was at least $5 million. Most of the sharing systems were computer based and administered centrally at the institutions. One-fourth of all institutions have informal sharing arrangements that are used extensively on their campuses. Survey respondents described formal sharing techniques other than those asked about in the survey questions. A sample questionnaire is included. (SW)",

Women are being employed in the top-ranked departments in the 50 leading doctorate-granting universities, a finding which implies a significant gain in status for women in academe. However, the positions that these women occupy could not be identified from the NSF data.  Women were the most prominent in psychology, comprising 25 percent of the employees, and least prominent in engineering, comprising only three percent of the employees. Women continue to be concentrated in the life sciences, the social sciences, and psychology; they continue to be least visible in the technical disciplines such as engineering and the physical sciences. Women scientists were found to be concentrated in the very largest institutions; women in the social sciences were almost equally represented in small and large schools. Many women scientists were found to be in nontenured research positions. (SW)",

        "description":"Factors that influenced the withdrawal of academically ineligible black students from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill were investigated. It is suggested that students who involuntarily withdraw are rarely consulted as to their reasons for leaving and that academic ineligibility may mask many of the same reasons for withdrawing as are given by voluntary withdrawals. Findings of a study comparing 22 academically ineligible black students with academically eligible non-returning students indicate that the black students considered their poor academic records to be important but did not list their low grades as the most important reason for their withdrawal. The single reason listed by the most respondents was health or personal problems. Some differences between the  two groups were apparent although it is noted that judging by the comments added to the returned surveys the two groups are nearly indistinguishable in their reasons for leaving school. It is proposed that reasons for leaving the university are similar for academically ineligible students and academically eligible students. The study also suggests that academic attrition may be reduced by the sensitive response of an institution in areas of nonacademic administration so that faculty need not feel that standards are being lowered in order to retain students. The survey instrument is appended. (Author/SF)",

It is suggested that by designing the evaluation process as part of a management procedure, data useful for making policy decisions will be generated and the success of the instructional process will be insured. The foundation of the system is the development of a procedures manual that generates questions about policies that affect the administration, the students, and the operation and effectiveness of the staff and the program. The second phase of evaluation involves data analysis concerning questions of staff size, program structure, attendance requirements, grading procedures, and program costs. Data collection, the third phase, provides a record of student  progress and weekly cumulative reports. Quarterly reviews and tutor evaluations are also part of the procedure used. The final phase of evaluation is dissemination of reports to the staff, administrative units, and agencies outside the university. The reports range from one-page summaries to full-scale reports documenting procedures and student achievement. It is suggested that the management approach to evaluation evolved because the success of this program for mathematics depended upon efficient program management as well as quality instruction and materials. The evaluation components of the model are viewed as having a large effect on the success of these programs. (Author/SF)",

Descriptive data were obtained: (1) indicating the extent to which SNFs fulfilled the requirement, the methods used, and the characteristics of facilities that were unable to comply; (2) characterizing physician, medical directors and their activities; and (3) identifying and describing arrangements for medical direction. A mail/telephone survey was conducted to provide national descriptive data on how SNFs provide medical direction. Site visits were made to 21  facilities to explore--with the administrator, medical director, and nursing director--the behavioral aspects of the implementation of medical direction. Findings suggest that the vast majority of SNFs have provided some form of medical direction; that there has been limited variation in the arrangements for medical direction; that there are a number of barriers to the implementation of this concept; and that the potential exists for the concept of medical direction to be an effective force in improving patient care.

Much of the response of institutions to current or anticipated declines in enrollments or financial resources is defensive and/or negative. Some institutions plan against retrenchment by seeking political relief from the financial effects of actual or projected enrollment declines. There is also a growing willingness in higher education to adopt market-oriented, entrepreneurial behavior in an effort to maintain enrollment. If higher education pursues survival in appropriate ways, it may undermine its ability to respond to legitimate demands, thus leading to further loss of credibility and autonomy. Specific  suggestions for planning for retrenchment are offered. One implication of legislative program auditing for higher education is that auditing beyond mere fiscal review is increasing. The states increasingly will assert both their perceived right and their ability to examine the efficiency and effectiveness of higher education programs and policies. A critical issue is what the reaction of higher education will be to: (1) the increasing pressure to neglect quality in the short term for the sake of survival; and (2) the outside pressure on the institution to assess performance in ways that seriously distort the essential purposes of higher education. It is suggested that independent or private accreditation is the logical means of implementing self-regulation. (SW)",

Two quantitative approaches that are typically used for enrollment projections are curve-fitting techniques and causal models. Many state forecasters use curve-fitting techniques, a popular approach because only historical data are required. If enrollment trends are unstable, however, curve-fitting techniques are less useful and may be inappropriate. Causal models look at cause and effect relationships between independent factors and enrollment patterns. In Ohio, enrollment projection through 1992 for public higher education institutions is based on a dual approach. One, based on demographic information, is the Demographic Simulation of Ohio  (DS), and the other, the Regents Enrollment Forecasting System (REFS), is based on high school graduate pools by county, matriculation rates, institutional market shares, and historical enrollment patterns in public postsecondary institutions in Ohio. A description of these methods and their advantages and disadvantages are provided. Comparison of full-time and part-time projections is also discussed. (SW)",

During an 18-month period, the project worked closely with 30 institutions to assist them in developing such programs. Regional aspects of the project, the process of improving evaluation, and conclusions about outcomes are discussed, and case summaries from 30 institutions are presented. The brief descriptions of institutional experiences in the project include reports from two public community colleges, two state-supported four-year liberal arts colleges, two private master's level institutions, and a comprehensive public university in an urban setting. Examples are from Austin College,  Austin Community College, Jackson State Community College, Mary Washington College, Mississippi College, University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, and Virginia Commonwealth University. A report of the project evaluation by Jon F. Wergin, Albert B. Smith, and George E. Rolle is also included. A list of participating institutions, project consultants and resource persons, and references are appended. (SW)",

The literature review defines terms and addresses six topics: the concept of B.I., reasons for renewed interest in the field, the role of library schools in B.I., instructional methods, and the literature of B.I. Explanations are offered for selected indexing terms, with emphasis on those that can have multiple meanings in various contexts, and the subject index for the bibliography illustrates the application of the proposed terms. Arranged in alphabetical  order by author, the bibliography includes resources in six categories: general works on B.I., planning and implementation of programs, methods of instruction, samples of materials, descriptions of specific programs, and foreign language articles. Seven titles of special interest to community college librarians are included, as well as one citation specifically for vocational technical school librarians. (BBM)",

General demographic data on Hispanics in the United States are presented, focusing on age distribution, language and educational participation, and Hispanic professionals in post-secondary education. The section dealing with Hispanics in community and junior colleges considers enrollment trends, graduation rates, degrees awarded, and Hispanic faculty members. Subsequently, the reasons for the non-participation of Hispanics in the educational systems of this country are considered,  concentrating on the changes that are needed in recruitment, admissions processes, student financial assistance, programs and services, and faculty and student support personnel in order to alter this pattern. Finally, recommendations are made for changes in federal policy related to bilingual education, financing developing institutions, affirmative action, Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs, legislative assistance to predominantly Hispanic schools, and federal financial aid.

Survey results, based on a 65.41% usable return rate, indicate that: (1) 13.04% of the newly hired personnel for the 1977-78 academic year held a Ph.D.; (2) 9.87% of the full-time teaching faculty hired held doctorates; (3) 25.95% of the full-time administrators hired held Ph.D.'s; (4) 20.23% of full-time positions which combined teaching and administrative duties were filled with Ph.D. holders; (5) private colleges hired twice as many Ph.D.'s as public colleges; and (6) single campus districts employed a  larger percentage (13.56%) of Ph.D's than multi-campus districts (11.89%). Respondents indicated that they would increase the number of full-time faculty holding doctorates if there were an increased need for Ph.D. holders, if the money were available to secure Ph.D.'s, and if more candidates held doctorates in specialized areas such as vocational or technical education. The survey results indicate that though the employment of doctoral degree holders has increased slightly since 1971, two-year colleges will not have an appreciable impact on the Ph.D. surplus. (JP)",

Two papers presented at the roundtable follow. The first provides: (1) a definition of AT, demonstrating its small scale, localized approach to the provision of basic needs with minimum demands upon the environment; (2) profiles of AT supporter groups, including back-to-the-land enthusiasts and  low-income groups faced with rising energy costs; (3) a rationale for community college involvement in AT that stresses the parallels between the two in local orientation and pragmatism; (4) a discussion of AT activities that community colleges can sponsor; and (5) a comment on the potential role of the AACJC in AT. The second paper outlines roundtable recommendations for the involvement of community colleges and the AACJC in AT. The report concludes with additional observations pointing to current community college activities, including the alcohol fuel development program at Colby Community College. (J)",

        "description":"Though the budget of the Community College of Baltimore (CCB) increased 488% from 1967 to 1979, CCB expenditures and tuition rates show a marked decline when adjusted for inflation through the use of the Higher Education Price Index. While CCB expenditures per full-time equivalent (FTE) student rose from $1,080 in 1967 to a projected $1,896 in 1980, real dollar figures (base year 1967) show that expenditures per FTE student actually declined 23%. And though tuition rates during the same time period rose 92% for full-time students and 80% for part-time students, real dollar tuition rates dropped 16% and 21% respectively. To maintain educational quality despite inflation, CCB has assigned additional duties to its non-instructional professional staff and increased the use of  part-time instructors. Though this has increased the full-time faculty to student ratio, the college has been able to maintain its FTE student to FTE faculty ratio at approximately 22 to 1. However, more real dollars per FTE student are required, and legislation providing greater state expenditures is desirable. (JP)",

The report then outlines six evaluation goals and describes the general functions of community college presidents as determined by the Florida State Board of Education. Subjective evaluation  criteria are then presented, followed by a discussion of objective evaluation areas and a checklist of basic presidential assignments which can be made to accommodate a common evaluation rating scale. The report concludes with a discussion of the importance of timing in the evaluation process. Although not intended as an evaluation instrument, the report is comprised of easily excerpted materials that can be adapted to serve as simplified evaluation forms.

Variables included in the study were number of faculty, sex, length of time at the college, and highest degree attained. The study showed that, consistent with day enrollment, LACC faculty experienced its highest growth periods in the late 1960's and 1940's when 129 and 123 faculty members were added, respectively. The lowest growth period was during World War II, when only nine new faculty members were added. Results also indicated that 37% of the 1979 faculty members were women. During the five-year period ending in 1979, 48% of the new teachers hired were women; this  was the highest percentage of any five-year period. An examination of degrees held revealed that 17% of the 1979 faculty members had doctorates, a percentage that was higher only in 1954. The study report includes graphs and tables depicting: (1) the number of faculty by sex and year of original employment; (2) the highest degree attained by LACC faculty members; (3) the universities that awarded degrees to the 1979 faculty members; (4) the number of teachers hired during each five-year period; and (5) the percentage of female instructors.

Faculty members requesting a return to industry submitted proposals that specified the area of specialization, the tasks to be undertaken, the time required, and the resources necessary for completion. Each proposal was assessed on the basis of weighted criteria including length of time &quot;out of field,&quot; degree of technological change in the industry, and accessibility of a host. Accepted projects underwent a formative, on-site assessment conducted by the Dean of Instruction, an initial summative review prepared by the on-site supervisor, and a final  summative report prepared by the faculty member analyzing the integration of the experience into his/her teaching. A review of the 13 projects completed since 1978 reveals that: (1) the participants performed valuable services for the host industries; (2) there was an increased understanding between the hosts and the college; and (3) host industries hired an increased number of Hagerstown graduates. A third-party performance review conducted by the Appalachian Regional Commission recommended study into the duplication of the back-to-industry program at other colleges. (Author/JP)",

        "description":"A modified Extended Opportunity Programs and Services (EOPS) allocation formula has been recommended for implementation in the California community colleges by the end of 1982-83. The modified formula has been designed to shift funding policy toward performance outputs as distinct from inputs. The current formula is based upon four weighted elements: known needs (33%), potential campus and community needs (27%), actual number of students served (10%), and staff review of proposals and programs (30%). A total of 90% of the funding determined by this formula is based on input elements. The need for change is demonstrated by the facts that: (1) the formula is not understood by most EOPS directors, (2) the formula is inherently unstable, (3) minority enrollment elements may  discriminate against white EOPS students, (4) separate funding of potential need as currently defined in the formula distorts allocations, and (5) the current emphasis on cost effectiveness requires that an allocation formula stress performance rather than input factors. The three main elements of the proposed formula are: the number of students eligible (60%), the number served (30%), and the district contributions to unmet needs (10%). Each element derives its part of the allocation on the basis of the work actually performed by the college in identifying and serving needy students. (JP)",

These programs were early childhood education, computer programming, fire science, forest technology, forest products, machine shop, medical assisting, nursing, and well drilling. After defining the place of the cost-benefit study within CCC's overall Program Improvement Plan, the report summarizes the data gathered from Spring 1978 graduates. Age, characteristics, employment status, sources and amounts of financial aid, and perceptions of non-economic benefits are  provided for graduates of each program. The report then outlines the findings related to non-graduating students who began programs in 1976, in terms of their educational objectives, reasons for leaving, attitudes toward CCC, employment/educational status, and perceptions of non-economic benefits of program participation. Employers' attitudes toward the job skills of graduates are then presented, followed by an explanation of the cost-benefit model, in which a matrix summarizing instructor cost per course and student was used along with survey findings to provide cost-benefit ratios for each of the program areas.

Curriculum data gathered from the catalogs and schedules are then presented, revealing that while sociology accounts for only 4% of all science courses offered, 100% of the colleges list at least one  sociology course. General principle courses are the most widely offered, followed by general social problems, marriage and family, specific social problems, sociology of groups, and general theory.

Subjects were interviewed or surveyed using the My Biggest Problem Inventory in order to generate a data bank of gross problems faced by providers, users, or evaluators of care. These problems were then reduced to a list of non-overlapping problem statements. Using these problem statements, a check list was developed for each group of subjects on which subjects were asked to rank the frequency of each problem and their level of concern about it on a five point scale. Detailed analyses  of each group's responses are presented, with separate chapters devoted to: (1) day care center teachers' problems, (2) day care center teachers' problems with regard to infants/toddlers, (3) day care center teachers' problems with regard to school age children and adolescents, (4) center directors' problems, (5) home day care providers' problems, (6) Franklin County Welfare Department Specialists' problems, (7) parents' problems with center based care, and (8) parents' problems with home based day care.

Measures of personality, motivation, belief system, knowledge of infant development, and anticipatory socialization (knowledge, beliefs or expectations of parenting) were used to examine differences between the groups of mothers and to assess the effects of socioeconomic status. Because the project used a short-term longitudinal design, intraindividual changes across time were also examined. The first study was designed to yield information about changes in first-time mothers during late pregnancy and the first few months of a child's life. Since the number of mothers of at-risk children in the first study was too small to provide a  generalizable idea of the parents of handicapped children (N=6), the second study was included to provide a larger sample of mothers (N=42) and a control for repeated testing. Mothers in the second study began participation after the birth of their child. Results showed maternal changes across time in the variables of anxiety, self-sentiment, home parental sentiment, superego, knowledge and expectations. Differences in the means of the low- and middle-SES mothers were found for seven of the ten variables used. Mothers of normal and handicapped children were found to differ on career sentiment and expectations while mothers of at-risk and normal children showed very similar patterns of parental development. Other results are presented in detail and implications are discussed. Materials  related to the administration of the study, information about the classification of handicaps and risk, and data in tabular form are appended. (JMB)",

Retention of the conditioned response was assessed in the presence of the nonmoving mobile. Although forgetting is typically complete after an 8-day retention interval, infants who received a reactivation treatment, a brief exposure to the reinforcer 24 hours prior to testing, showed no forgetting after retention intervals of either 2 or 4 weeks. Further, the forgetting function following reactivation did not differ from the original forgetting function. These experiments demonstrate (1) that &quot;reactivation&quot; or &quot;reinstatement&quot; is an effective mechanism by which early experiences can be maintained over lengthy intervals; and (2) that memory deficits in infants are best viewed as retrieval  deficits.

One objective of the program was to teach kindergarteners that commercials are designed to persuade people to buy products. Kindergarteners were taught to recognize the difference between commercials and other classes of television content. A second objective was to teach kindergarteners to look for information about products when they watched commercials. Children were taught to recognize four types of appeals made by commercials: product information appeals, fun and entertainment appeals, premium offers, and social acceptability appeals. These concepts were taught through a variety of physical activities (for example, having children raise  their hands when a break occurred between a program and a commercial) and having children discuss their own experiences. The total time spent on training was about three and one-half hours over the two-week program. Performance was generally high by the end of the program. In addition, children who had participated in training performed better than a control group after an eight-month time delay. Following the delay, there was some decline in children's ability to identify commercials and understand persuasive intent, though performance level was still above that of the pre-training performance level.

        "description":"Differences in life outlook and self-perceived health often attributed to age differences among the elderly were found to be more accurately explained by education. The young-old (62-74 years) and the old-old (75 years and older) were compared among 495 elderly in two rural counties in western Arkansas during 1977. The respondents had a median annual household income of $3,600, a median educational level of 8.4 years, and 52% were female. The old-old were more likely to perceive themselves in better health than others their age. But when six variables (sex, age, marital status, per capita income, years of school, and number of days sick in bed) were entered into a predictive model for self-perceived health, differences were explained by education. That is, those with better  educations rated their health more positively. There was no difference between the two age groups in sick days, although the old-old reported more days hospitalized and trips to the doctor. However, no predictive model for health status measures was statistically significant. On measures of life satisfaction, the old-old were slightly more pessimistic than the young-old. Conclusions indicated that as educational levels improve, or as the better educated middle-aged population joins the ranks of the elderly, perhaps we can expect them to have an improved outlook on life. Although superior education does not guarantee against physical ailments and ill fate, it does appear to cushion their impact. (Author/NEC)",

Following the trend of Montana Indian tribes, the Blackfeet and Flathead tribes became directly involved in contracts with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to manage educational assistance monies for schools on their reservations. Allocations totalling $850,552 provided assistance to approximately 4,064 students. JOM projects included school readiness programs, graduation expenses, bilingual home-school communications, career awareness, instructional aides, curriculum development, incentive awards for school attendance, breakfast programs, remedial and tutorial  programs, rental of band equipment, and summer programs. Annual JOM sponsored activities included the statewide Montana Indian Education Conference, the Montana Indian Youth Practicum, and the All-Indian Speech and Debate Tournament. This report presents the school reports of JOM funded projects, the JOM annual financial report, the administrative budget, a summary of allocations, a summary of enrollment, and financial report. Tabular data pertain to JOM allocations and number of eligible Indian students for fiscal years 1948-77, and JOM allocations by reservations. (NEC)",

While working to realize its potential in the areas of natural resources, commercialism and education, the Pueblo must also confront the problems of housing shortages, adoption of non-Indian priorities, and loss of Laguna traditions and language. The strongest unifying forces on the reservation are the traditional religious activities and strong matrilineal clan system; both remain active and important parts of Laguna life. Much of the change on the reservation stems from the development of its natural resources. The uranium mine offers high wages and is causing many people to return  to the reservation. Plans are also underway to develop a total agricultural system. Because of the stress and importance placed on education, Laguna is number one nationally among Indian tribes on the basis of academic achievement. This report on Laguna Pueblo includes information on its natural resources, population, employment sources and opportunities, service delivery, community facilities, social services, educational system, and tribal and village government structures.

        "description":"Although provisions in countless treaties have mandated Indian educational services, federal and state governments were for many years unenthusiastic about accepting the responsibility for educating the Indian people. Inadequately funded educational services provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs did little to reflect the realities and needs of the people and Tribes they affected. Yet although the past history of Indian Education has been beset with problems, successful programs are also occurring, and money for the education of Indian children is available to public schools through such legislation as Public Law (PL) 81-815; PL 81-874, Johnson O'Malley funds, and the Indian Education Act of 1972. Other aid sources include Title I, ESEA (Pl 89-10); Title VII, Bilingual  Education; the RIF &quot;Reading is Fun&quot; program; and Ethnic Heritage grants. This paper describes each of these funding sources and includes such information as funding formulas, what the funds may be used for, and benefits or shortcomings within the various programs. Some of the most frequently advanced complaints against Indian education programs and legislation are discussed, including (1) inadequate funding levels, (2) misuse of funds, (3) programs not designed to meet local needs, and (4) duplication of services within the various programs.

        "description":"Vocational training has traditionally been a part of the services provided to Indian people by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but for many decades the training offered was inadequate and inappropriate and students completing programs were unemployable either on or off the reservation. In 1975 as Indian education began to move from federal control to Indian control, Indian people became more involved in the decisions that affected them and their children. However, even today Indian students do not receive adequate and proper academic and vocational counseling in federal or public schools. Girls in particular have been discouraged from going on to college and have instead been trained for menial jobs such as those with domestic, janitorial, or clerical duties. During this century a  number of vocational training programs have greatly affected Indians, including the 1933 Indian Emergency Conservation Work Program, the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, and the 1946 Navajo Special Education Program. Assimilation programs like the Labor Recruitment and Welfare Program and the Voluntary Relocation Program were not successful because they took people off the reservation and thrust them into trying to cope with a strange culture. Today, present vocational training opportunities include the Higher Education Assistance program, working scholarships, loans, Indian Health Service training, and numerous other programs sponsored by tribes, colleges or through state or federal agencies.

The film analysis finds distinct differences between Anglo and Native patterns of pace and movement: the slow pace of the Alaskan Natives is accompanied by a soft and rounded style of movement, while Anglos exhibit a fast to moderate pace with linear, abrupt movements. The pace of each group appears to be independent of the other when together and mutual adjustments in pace between groups are few. The analysis suggests that the discrepancy between the Anglo  teachers and Native destroy the communication process in the classrooms. Even minor accommodations destroy the communication process in the classrooms. Even minor accomodations on the part of the teachers serve to improve somewhat on the unfortunate pattern. The study confirms the importance of Native teachers for educational success in Alaska, with the critical factor being the nature of their training. Regardless of educational paraphernalia, curriculum content, or even teacher dedication, education cannot occur if there is poor communication in the classroom. (NEC)",

Migrant workers have a 33% shorter life expectancy, a 25% higher infant mortality rate, and a 25% higher death rate from tuberculosis and other communicable diseases than the national average. Common among farmworkers, diabetes and hypertension are chronic problems requiring continuous medical care, which is unsatisfied by the fragmented nature of available health services. While not intentional, migrant child neglect is often evident, usually resulting from parental lack of knowledge or resources. Handicapped children remain officially unidentified and unaided because family mobility precludes program eligibility. Among the prime causes of  migrant health problems are poor living conditions which are not improved by the often anachronistic relationship between grower and worker. Appropriations are meager for the large migrant health program and complicated eligibility requirements routinely exclude migrants from available Title XIX and XX services. Basically there is little in the way of migrant health resources, insurance, or policy leadership. The Task Force recommends establishing a national task force on migrant health, providing Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS) health records to physicians and clinics to promote service continuity, and initiating a needs assessment for exceptional children.

        "description":"Three days of hearings held on the Reservation at Window Rock, Arizona focused on the civil rights of the people of the Navajo Nation. Seeking to explore those areas of economic and social development in which the Navajo could better attain self-determination, the Commission heard testimony on economic development, private employment, health care, and education. Among the witnesses were representatives from state and federal agencies, tribal officials and medical personnel. Testimony was offered by individuals as well as in panel discussions. Peter MacDonald, Chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council, listed control of the schools, economic development programs, and resource development as the basic and primary goals in attaining Navajo civil rights. He cited the slowness of the  bureaucratic machinery as being particularly frustrating to tribal development plans. In a panel discussion a Bureau of Indian Affairs official and an anthropologist suggested that the Navajo should be viewed as an underdeveloped nation; help offered should then be considered as an aid to a developing nation rather than merely as another federal program. A panel of doctors and hospital administrators described the severe shortage of medical personnel, equipment, and facilities, citing inadequate funding as the causative factor. The lengthy session on education heard from school administrators, teachers, students, and parents the problems involved in educating the children and youth. (DS)",

The testimony offered at the public session came from representatives of local, state, Federal and Tribal governments, persons from the private sector, and individual citizens. In an opening statement, Donald R. Antone, President of the Intertribal Council of Arizona, spoke of the differences in needs and desires between city-dwelling and Reservations and of the paternalistic intervention in reservation affairs by outside &quot;do-gooders&quot;. He also listed education, welfare, industrial and tourism development, and taxation and services to  Indians by the State of Arizona as the four areas of most critical need. In another overview, two representatives from the Mojave and Colorado Rivers Tribes discussed employment problems, particularly limited chances for job advancement, misuse of Johnson O'Malley funds, enforcement of Public Law 280, poor medical service, and welfare difficulties. Medical needs were further explored in a series of testimony that included three panel discussions by the San Carlos Apaches and Indians residing in Phoenix and Tucson. Also discussed in the hearings were problems relating to education, administration of justice, and employment practices and opportunities. (DS)",

They also seek to provide a method of maximizing economic returns in Arctic communities from local businesses and enterprise. Backed by government loans, the cooperative's numbers and success have increased rapidly since their inception in 1959. Total sales volume increased from $209,000 in 1961 to nearly 3.1 million in 1969. Changes beyond the economic benefits have also occurred. Eskimos have moved from merely supplying raw materials to production, purchasing and marketing, thus eliminating unnecessary middlemen. Social benefits include the rise of Pan-Eskimo  solidarity and community-wide decision making. The co-ops have also provided a valuable training ground for native leaders. Successful multipurpose co-ops have cut across generational and sexual lines for the full utilization of human resources. Women, in particular, have acquired needed roles and outlets for their talents. The net effect of the co-ops has been a healthier, independent Eskimo population actively participating in the cooperative development of the Canadian Arctic. (DS)",

The views of private citizens and experts from local, state, and federal organizations are presented in edited form under seven subject headings: existing prison reform legislation, the role of state government in corrections, corrections philosophy, the history of corrections in Montana, the role of women in corrections, the juvenile offender, and alternatives to traditional concepts of corrections. Key issues were the special needs of female, American Indian, and juvenile offenders and the need for a viable corrections philosophy as a foundation for positive change in Montana's corrections program. Recommendations  based on the conference findings include a study to explore alternatives to incarceration, creation of an inmate advocate position, a center to coordinate services to women offenders, and legislation to protect the rights of juvenile offenders. Additional recommendations, in view of the disproportionate number of American Indians in the Montana prison population, are that an American Indian serve on the parole board and that the Department of Institutions, in cooperation with the Indian tribes, hire at least one person especially concerned with alleviation of the cultural and correctional problems of the American Indian offender.

        "description":"With a total area of 197,116 square miles, the Appalachian Region has an uneven distribution of population, income, wealth and natural resources. The Region's 19.3 million people live in 397 counties and 5 independent cities in Virginia. Under 50% of the population live in metropolitan counties while only 25% live in rural counties. In 1975 the Region's natural population growth rate was only about 70% of the nation's. As natural growth has diminished, migratory movements both into and from the Region and within it play a larger role in population changes of local areas. Economic productivity varies from one-sixth above the national average in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, to less than one-fourth of the U.S. level in eastern Kentucky. Appalachia also varies in the population's  age structure, racial and ethnic composition, educational attainment, labor force participation, poverty level, health conditions, and other facets of economic life and socioeconomic wellbeing. This reference book presents information on the Region's topography; population change, concentration and dispersal; population growth trends; population ethnicity; population 65 years of age and older; labor force, employment, and employment trends; employment by industry; personal income; poverty status; education attainment and school enrollment; nonfederal physicians, infant mortality trends; housing; coal production; mineral industry establishments; agriculture and farm land; and local governments.

        "description":"The transportation needs of the 30% of the population living in rural America, particularly those of the elderly, handicapped, poor, isolated, young, carless, and unemployed, are more critical than the needs of their counterparts in urban areas because of the lack of rural public transportation. Yet, only about 1% of the capitol federal investment and annual operating moneys spent on public transportation are allocated to help meet rural needs. Creating and running a public transportation system in a rural area can be a fairly simple job if the guidelines outlined in this handbook are followed. Basic decisions required are: defining the geographic area to be served; identifying the area's priority transportation needs and available resources; agreeing on the public/private  ownership mix; specifying the jurisdiction and authority of the sponsor; deciding on the best type of system to meet local needs; and determining if an outside consultant is needed. The most important ingredients are a strong local sponsor and a good manager. Other aspects to consider include personnel, vehicles, routing and scheduling, maintenance, accountability, economic viability, insurance, and funding. More than 93 federal-level programs can fund transportation systems, components, or rides for eligible persons. Pitfalls to avoid include resistance to coordination; a \"do-nothing\" approach while searching for the \"perfect\" formula; poor communication; aloofness from the public; and organizational \"traps\".

        "description":"To establish a better knowledge base concerning the role of developing nation paraprofessionals in facilitating rural poor access to public services and in order to identify problems that arise in developing these patterns of service, an extensive literature search and compilation and analysis of over 50 health projects and 30 agricultural projects according to a set of 25 variables were performed. Paraprofessionals were denoted as those front-line workers with minimal education serving a semiautonomous role in the delivery of health and agricultural services. Results showed that considerably more research and attention have been focused on new levels of health personnel than on similar role capacities in agriculture services. Training materials, curricula, audio-visual aids,  supervision procedures for the village health worker, plus extensive classification systems of health personnel have been developed. In contrast, this research activity represents the first effort to compile data on agriculture paraprofessionals. Findings also showed two major areas have been continually neglected-evaluation measures and community involvement. This seemed especially noteworthy since perhaps the major rationale for using low-level paraprofessionals involves their cost effectiveness as inexpensive personnel with a cultural affinity to the community which promotes participation in development. Further investigation and analysis will be required to confirm the hypothesis that the effectiveness, efficiency, and responsiveness of paraprofessionals will vary directly with their  success in linking with participatory local organizations.

Two major recommendations for the orientation of research in science education are proposed. The first is that currently espoused goals of science education should be reexamined and, if necessary, redefined. The second calls for science educators to become aware of and translate pertinent research methods, findings, and theories of behavioral scientists into appropriate instructional and research procedures for science education. The paper also applies the two recommendations as operating principles in both the development of instructional materials and in research design, providing an illustration for problem  solving in both domains.

It is hypothesized that students whose knowledge structures include misconceptions that are in conflict with concepts in the lectures and text will have difficulty in learning classical mechanics. Multiple regression analysis of scores on tests of mathematics skills and formal reasoning ability confirmed that no linear relationship exists between these independent variables and scores on a classical mechanics exam. However, an index of misconceptions about moving objects accounts for greater variance in classical mechanics exam scores. (Author)",

The authors describe a technique that they developed to probe knowledge structures with an extension of the card-sort method. The method, known as the Concept Structure Analysis Technique (ConSAT), allows for students to produce graphic structural representations directly, which eliminates the need for statistical procedures to transform data from raw form to graphic form. The advantages of the technique are: (1) having the ability to search for relations between concepts; (2) the ability to analyze structural changes of individuals resulting from instruction; and (3) the ability to search for the  integration of more than one kind of structure.

        "description":"Forty-three first-grade children, who had received no formal instruction in addition and subtraction, were individually administered 20 problems that could be solved using addition or subtraction. The problems were selected to represent the following semantic types: joining, separating, part-part-whole, comparison, and equalizing. Responses were coded in terms of appropriateness of strategy, correct or incorrect answer, type of error, mode of representation, and solution strategy. For every problem but the two addition comparison problems, over 70% of the subjects chose a correct strategy. There were very few systematic errors. Only 15 of the 860 responses involved the wrong choice of operation. The majority of solutions involved the use of concrete objects, but a significant  number used fingers or did not use any physical representation. Contrary to previous analysis of children's solution processes for addition and subtraction problems, these results suggest that children do not transform problems so they can apply a single strategy. Rather, they have a rich repertoire of strategies which they apply directly to a problem based on its semantic structure. The results also suggest that verbal problems may be an appropriate context to introduce addition and subtraction operations. (Author/MK)",

        "description":"This paper explores the impact of the hidden curriculum on students. The hidden curriculum refers to the social relations and school climate of the schools. Two theories are presented as the basis for studying the relationship between school climate and students' social beliefs and actions. The generalization theory states that students view the school as a small version of society, and that they transfer their political and social beliefs developed in school to the outside world as well. The congruence theory is based on the relationship between what students are directly taught in classes and what they learn indirectly through interaction with the school authority structure. The bulk of the paper reviews more than 30 research studies about the relationship between school  political climate and student attitudes and behavior. Results include the following: (1) in schools with high degrees of student participation in governance, students had high levels of political efficacy and trust, (2) teachers' support of student involvement in school affairs and school climate is related to political efficacy, (3) open classroom climate appears to foster positive political attitudes, and a closed climate is associated with negative attitudes, and (4) participation in school discussions and debates is related to higher levels of civic competence. Although some studies did not find such positive relationships, it is apparent that school and classroom climate are correlates of student political attitudes. Social studies educators should be especially aware of this when  they plan course content, discussion of controversial issues, and political participation projects. (AV)",

Activities involved participants in listening to formal presentations on social science disciplines and in discussing and presenting recommendations in small committees on critical social studies issues. Issues included social studies  scope and sequence, basis for content, relationship between elementary and secondary school curricula, testing and measurement emphases, teacher training, status, innovative practices, and extending the impact of elementary social studies. Recommendations included that teacher training programs should include scope and sequence issues, social studies educators should work closely with textbook publishers, conceptual and skill development should be integrated into all social studies curricula, and social studies educators should become involved in the evaluation of achievement tests.

        "description":"The author contends that conceptions of citizenship education must be updated to prepare students for participation in an increasingly interdependent, complex, and changing world. Good citizenship refers to the degree to which decisions regarding public affairs are undertaken self-consciously and purposively. Responsible citizenship involves a sensitivity to the ways in which decisions and actions may become part of the aggregative processes that give direction and structure to public affairs. Increasing interdependence has complicated the citizenship process through the advent of an era of scarcity, the growing demands of the disadvantaged for a redistribution of wealth, the mushrooming of subgroup loyalties and divisiveness in national communities, the declining capacity of  governments to govern, and the shift of attention in world affairs from military-security issues to social-economic issues. Thus, education must provide students with the ability to assess unintended circumstances, see behavior as the result of role expectations, recognize patterned behavior and the social systems which create the patterns, differentiate historical trends from current dynamics, discern the limits of historical patterns, appreciate the power of industrialization and large-scale organizations, and know when to be outraged and when to suspend judgment.

The book is presented in five parts. Part I provides an historical overview of the Norwegian and German-Russian migration to North Dakota. Part II presents three Norwegian units on mythology, language arts, and art. Students compare Norwegian myths with other mythologies, investigate contributions to society by outstanding Norwegians, and create traditional Norwegian art. Reproducible patterns for art work are included. Section III examines German-Russian geography, history, and social studies. Students trace family ties, the migration of German-Russians, prepare a German-Russian meal, and construct a scale model of a  pioneer home. Maps, recipes, and instructions for constructing the home are included. Section IV contains brief descriptions of sociology, speech, language arts, humanities, social studies, and home economics units. Section V contains a bibliography and a list of resource organizations. Norwegian recipes, an outline of ethnic characteristics, and a pedigree chart are included in the appendix. (KC)",

        "description":"The two essays in this report were presented at a colloquium on behavior variables related to citizenship education. The first essay, &quot;Political Socialization and Citizen Competencies,&quot; by Byron G. Massialas, reviews behavioral science research as related to citizenship education and identifies the most significant findings in the field. The document illustrates that the research, which is primarily on political socialization, does not match citizenship objectives, nor do citizenship programs take into account important studies in political socialization. The author stresses that research should focus on the individual and the community, qualitative as well as quantitative data, and the development of educational programs in which individuals participate directly in political  decisions. The second essay, &quot;The Definition of Citizen Capacities and Related Psychological Research,&quot; by Judith V. Torney, suggests a conceptual framework which makes explicit the global as well as the domestic orientation of citizenship education. A review of research on pre-adult political awareness, understanding, and participation, and a discussion of developmental stages, social learning theory, and the role of modeling and reinforcement in promoting altruistic, prosocial, and cooperative behavior are provided. The document concludes by outlining criteria for exploring psychological concepts in citizenship education. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Approximately 20 million workers are presently living in countries other than their homelands in order to find better job opportunities. This labor migration is determined mainly by an income gap between the sending and receiving countries. Less important determinants are historical ties, cultural or linguistic affinity, and proximity. Emigrants include highly educated professionals such as doctors and engineers, and unskilled laborers who can assume low-paying jobs in agriculture and industry, for example. Countries from which the workers emigrate benefit in that unemployment rates drop and their economies are boosted by foreign money which the emigrees send back to relatives staying at home. However, the loss of human capital in selected areas often retards national  development. Countries to which the workers immigrate benefit from incoming professionals whose training has been financed elsewhere, and from an availability of unskilled laborers willing to work for low wages. But at the same time countries of immigration suffer competition for jobs among the newcomers and indigenous minority groups, as well as effects of social tension among cultural groups. Problems caused by migration can be solved by restructuring economic relations so that people can earn a decent living in their home countries. Countries of emigration must emphasize labor-intensive development with egalitarian income distribution. Countries of immigration must restructure their labor markets to make exclusive use of indigenous worker populations. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"Acculturation patterns of immigrants into American society have been examined through various disciplinary perspectives--anthropology, sociology, psychology, psychiatry, and, more recently, communications. Although acculturation is defined somewhat differently by different disciplines, it can be generally interpreted as the overall process of change that occurs as an immigrant engages in continuous first-hand contact with a new socio-cultural system. Review of literature on acculturation from the 1930s to the 1970s indicates that the multi-disciplinary approach has contributed richness and flexibility to the research. It has also, however, resulted in confusion based on noncomplementary viewpoints of the various disciplines. These conflicting views are the result of numerous  factors including different definitions and conceptualizations of acculturation, ideologically-based conflicts, and disciplinary limitations. Acculturation scholars will improve their research if they make a concerted effort to synthesize the diverse perspectives and develop a unified comprehensive theory of acculturation. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Global inflation should be viewed more as a sympton of social problems than as an economic disease that can be cured by monetary and fiscal policy. Social problems signaled by inflation include exploding demand, rising costs for essential commodities, stagnating productivity, and a decline in the real standard of living. Inflation is interpreted as an increase in the overall level of nominal prices in the whole economy. It is significant to note, however, that crucial determinants of well being are often more closely related to prices of particular goods and services than to changes in the general price level. Circumstances which have contributed to global inflation include rising energy prices, increased government spending, increased money supplies, and lack of wage and price  controls in capitalist nations. New sources of higher prices include increasing energy and food production costs, depleted resources, and a dearth of tillable land. Governments will make progress toward controlling global inflation if they aim economic policies toward increasing supply and reducing demand, stabilizing population, encouraging conservation and recycling, changing working conditions to boost productivity, increasing opportunities for competition, and striving to provide for basic human needs in a setting of economic stability.

In 1977, questionnaires were mailed to a sample of 300 sociologists randomly selected from the membership of the American Sociological Association. Respondents were provided an alphabetical list of names found by Swatos and Swatos (1974) to have been the most frequently cited in introductory sociology texts. They were asked to rank the ten most significant sociologists. Names could be added to the list. The return rate was 61%. The number  of citations to an individual's work was calculated using the 1976 volume of the &quot;Social Sciences Citation Index.&quot; The results of all data indicated that while reputation and frequency were highly associated, citation was not closely associated with either. The author concluded that the frequency with which a sociologist's work is cited in the current journal literature provides an index of eminence that is quantitative, objective, and readily available.

Injuries due to repeated stress and physical (muscular) trauma, and biological maturation are also considered. The psychological effects are examined through a discussion of the meaning of competition and of the socializing effects sports organizations exert on participants. The monograph terminates with a discussion of unresolved problems in youth sports competition,  including the exclusion and retention of athletes, possible alternatives to highly competitive athletic programs, and the need for qualified and sensitive adult leaders in the field of youth sports.

This may be due to the fact that at least three distinct processes are involved: across-group comparisons, within-group comparisons, and the perceived evaluations of teachers. The extent to which the group structure is visible is likely to determine, in part, the relative impact of these processes. Data from a first-grade classroom, based mainly on interviews with students, indicates that when awareness of group differences in ability is low, within-group comparisons and teacher evaluations have more effect on students' academic self-esteem than do across-group comparisons. The implications of these results for future research in this area are discussed. (Author)",

Research in all three areas focused on test reliability, validity, difficulty, speededness, and equivalence of restructured and former test sections. The restructured verbal measure was shortened from 75 to 50 minutes, and included a long as well as a short reading comprehension passage. Research on the quantitative ability test involved combinations of three item types: regular mathematics, quantitative comparison, and data interpretation. The restructured test was reduced from 75 to 50  minutes, and contained about thirty quantitative comparison items in place of regular mathematics and data interpretation items. Seven new item types were evaluated for inclusion in the abstract/analytical reasoning test, based upon their difficulty, reliability, speededness, validity, appropriateness for all college majors, efficiency, and independence from the other two tests. Three of the seven item types were accepted for use in the new GRE: analytical reasoning, logical diagrams, and analysis of explanations. (GDC)",

Three general purposes of needs assessment are described: (1) providers of educational services are interested in what their market (adult population) wants; (2) public agencies are interested in whether or not all segments of the population have equal access to educational programs; or (3) researchers are interested in furthering knowledge about the attitudes and interests of adult students. Brief examples are presented to illustrate what types of information are most useful for each type of needs assessment. Only one-third of the studies reviewed have effectively used the data they collected. Certain conclusions are predictable from any needs assessment because  they have been replicated so often: level of educational attainment is a positive predictor of interest and participation in further education, and interest and participation drop sharply after age 55. Respondent's opinions are shaped by their current perceptions, rather than by their ability to imagine what might exist in the future; the surprising success of the Elderhostel concept illustrates this problem. Four types of needs assessment errors are discussed: relativity; interpretation; lumping; and consideration of the small picture. (GDC)",

        "description":"Most educational objectives can be classified as either mastery or developmental. For mastery objectives, teachers can develop satisfactory assessment instruments relatively easily and can describe student achievement as \"can do\" or \"can't do.\" For developmental objectives, there are a number of evaluation methods, and student progress varies in attaining these objectives. An adequate description of achievement of these developmental objectives requires a set of reference points to identify stages of development. Teachers develop a sense of these criteria by considering the instructional materials and the performance of various groups of students. Standardized achievement tests may help the teacher assess students' levels of development. Describing student's performance in an  educational program requires an assessment of what the student \"can do\" and an educated estimate of the student's progress in meeting important developmental objectives.

        "description":"The norm-referenced evaluation model (RMC Model A) for Title I project evaluation, consists of procedures whereby the expected posttest standing of a treatment group under the null condition is generated from their pretest standing. It is assumed that the treatment group is not selected on the basis of their pretest scores and can be considered representative of the population represented in the test norms. Given these assumptions, the Model A rule for estimating the expected no-treatment posttest status is that a comparison group given no special treatment will maintain its percentile across time (the equipercentile growth assumption). This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the no-treatment expectation estimation procedures for Model A. An alternative definition of the  no-treatment expectation is based on a structural equation model and statistical models underlying nonequivalent control group designs. Results indicate that using a measure other than the pretest score for selection reduces but does not control regression effects. If the selection measure is more highly correlated with the pretest measure than with the posttest measure, additional regression occurs between the pretest and the posttest. Biased measures of treatment effects may results. (Author/CTM)",

Three groups of 30 enlisted personnel at the Engineering School and the Defense Mapping School, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, studied a computer-assisted instructional lesson on the psychophysiology of audition. Upon lesson completion, retention of four knowledge categories addressed in the CAI lesson were tested. Groups did not differ in their performance on the final retention tests or in lesson completion time. Findings indicate that the addition of more realistic and sophisticated graphics displays in a CAI lesson do not insure  an increase in instructional effectiveness but point out the need to determine principles and guidelines for the use of graphics in computer-based training.

Following a series of student interviews to determine the characteristic problems students encounter in a CMI system, an Orientation to CMI/Time Management Lesson and a Study Skills Package were developed and implemented, including a self-rating study skills questionnaire and four modules focusing on reading comprehension, memorization, test taking, and concentration. An  Instructor Orientation and Training Package was also developed to be used in conjunction with the study skills diagnostic and remedial materials, and to provide instructors with basic skills in their new role as learning facilitators. The overall results of the project indicated that it is not only feasible but beneficial in terms of training effectiveness, efficiency, and cost to train students in the basic study skills required to perform well in a CMI environment.

        "description":"This study examines the effect of parental socialization forces on children's learning of antisocial behavior from television portrayals. The intervening variables are the patterns of parental disciplinary practices and general interaction with their children in their everyday life. Two types of parental styles were identified: induction, characterized by a loving attitude, based on reason, explanation, and pointing out the consequences of the child's actions on others, and sensitizing parental behaviors, those that focus on external consequences of social behaviors without providing the child with a cognitive frame of reference for internalizing moral guidelines. Three types of antisocial behaviors are studied: physical and verbal aggression and deceit. The relationship between  watching these types of behavior on television and the child's own antisocial predispositions were studied for different combinations of parental styles. The results indicate that children of those parents who are highly inductive and who only occasionally resort to sensitizing techniques are the least affected by physical and verbal aggression on television. In the case of physical aggression, children whose parents are mostly sensitizing and seldom utilize inductive techniques tend to be the most affected. Although the differences among correlation coefficients were not statistically significant, the trends encountered rendered encouraging support to the theoretical expectations. Data tables and a list of references are attached. (Author/RAO)",

Areas of the study which are examined include structure in text and footnotes, and experimental design, execution, and manipulation of data, in terms of holdings, use, and costs. In particular, the use of &quot;sampling,&quot; accuracy of &quot;official figures,&quot; comparative method, and cost benefit model of the study are questioned. The Kent study had produced conclusions the committee considers invalid: that Pittsburgh libraries are spending too much money on books and periodicals which are seldom or never used. Findings of the Kent study represent impetus for a change in  acquisitions policy, but the committee strongly discourages acceptance of these recommendations because it feels that the study is improperly presented and contains some inaccuracies.

Results of the first stage, a needs assessment completed in 1978, are summarized in terms of limitations and additional information needed, alternative strategies, and target outcomes for each of five areas: (1) student access to courses, (2) scheduling and class size, (3) facilities, (4) instructional quality, and (5) data and methodology used. Twelve committee progress reports are then presented to summarize the second PIP state--the implementation of twelve goals set by the college for the Division. The objectives, accomplishments, goals, evaluations, and recommendations of each committee are  graphically and textually presented. The report then outlines the third stage, i.e., integration of the PIP findings with the short- and long-range budgetary planning of the college as a whole. This stage includes cost effectiveness/benefits analysis based on PIP findings for the college's educational objectives, institutional goals, educational effectiveness, and educational efficiency; the integration of PIP data into the college's long-range planning cycle; and the correlation of PIP findings on program analysis and employee development with similar information gathered from other departments.

        "description":"Dateline: August 1989. Societal trends during the 1980's left community colleges with a smaller and older clientele taking fewer courses and providing fewer funds. Location, local support, and, most important, the attitudes of people within the college itself were the factors determining the success with which colleges met this challenge. Some colleges provided curricula responsive to the non-linear educational needs of adult students by integrating credit and non-credit areas. Other colleges, reluctant to part with transfer-oriented curricula, faced administrator-faculty disputes over class cut-off rates and the need for a marketing-oriented catalog. The former catered to older, better educated students who demanded well-prepared courses and doubled the proportion of college  income from non-credit offerings. The latter invested energy in high school graduate recruitment and saw a decline in adult enrollment. Faculty members, reacting to changing enrollment patterns, either proved flexible by abolishing tenure and cooperating with part-time teachers or fought for protective agreements. Reacting to increased stress, some administrators fostered communication within the college toward the development of new ideas; others merely froze budgets and retreated, hoping to weather the storm. All colleges, however, faced increased government control and distrust between colleges and government agencies. (JP)",

Specific competencies to be acquired in an interdisciplinary twentieth century humanities course taught at Valencia Community College were broken down as follows: (1) knowledge and thinking skills--recall and interrelate important information, analyze another person's viewpoint, and judge the worth of a viewpoint using appropriate criteria; (2) communication skills--read difficult material, build vocabulary, express what others think in one's own words, and organize ideas and present them clearly; (3) personal integration--involve  oneself in the material to derive one's own interpretation, examine personal ideas more clearly, choose and affirm one's values, and make personal commitments. At the end of the course, students were asked to evaluate their progress in relation to these competencies, and to determine whether the course had contributed to their improvement. Of the 36 students involved in the evaluation, no more than four students felt they had failed to improve in any one of the competencies.

Compared to computer applications related to instruction, counseling, and related activities which exist across the country, there was relatively little current use of the computer as an instructional tool at AC. Reasons included the lack of current computer compatibility, the newness of practical and cost-effective instructional programs, the time required to prepare them, and limited faculty awareness. The study revealed a fairly heavy reliance upon computer support  for three levels of administrative applications: administrative operations, administrative reports, and planning and management systems. In all, 23 basic administrative operations were being conducted with extensive computer support, most of which were grouped in areas of budget and payroll, student enrollments and achievement, and library functions.

In response to changing student characteristics, colleges must begin careful curriculum planning to provide students with transfer, occupational/technical, developmental, and community education programs to meet their needs. Another important challenge of the 1980's will be that of attracting students and retaining them. An understanding of marketing will be essential to student recruitment, just as an understanding of the roles of counseling, the library, teaching, and access to educational services is important to student retention. Assessing college operations will  also be a vital activity in the 1980's, especially in the areas of presidential, board, and administrative leadership; faculty and support staff responsibilities; and communication with the community and the state government. Before the 1980's bring further reductions in resources, colleges must develop plans to allocate resources, to avoid duplication of effort, to use space effectively, to compete for needed resources, and to investigate alternative methods of financial support. A final issue for the 1980's will be an increased emphasis on accountability of the board, president, and faculty. (AYC)",

        "description":"In this study researchers wanted to discover school principals' attitudes about reported increases in the proportion of men teaching very young children. Elementary school principals in southern Manitoba were interviewed about their attitudes toward beginning teachers in early childhood (nursery-kindergarten) education. At the time of writing, about 50 principals had been intereviewed concerning their opinions and attitudes about new teachers, generally, and men in early childhood education, specifically. Principals seemed less concerned with teachers' specific skills or training and more concerned with teachers' personal qualities, such as warmth, kindness, love of children, and ability to create a happy creative atmosphere in the classroom. Most principals seemed to feel  isolated from their peers and different from or more radical than them in their practices and educational philosophy. Almost all expressed a wish that more men could be found who were qualified and willing to teach very young children. None stated that the gender of a person directly determined whether or not he/she was hired. Principals were quick to point out, however, that a man had to be unusual to work in early childhood education, since he would be contradicting social expectations about what men do for livelihood.

Children 3 to 5 years of age were tested on four language tasks (two spatial and two temporal) and two cognition tasks. Spatial terms tested were: before, after, ahead of, behind, beside, together with, above and below. Temporal test terms were: before, after, together with, and at the same time as. The cognition tasks consisted of one test of seriation and one test of temporal ordering. Among the results, the comprehension of most terms improved with age. Before and after were found to be of  about equal difficulty and the terms expressing simultaneity were acquired before terms expressing succession. The combination of after/before and before/after appeared to be the most difficult. It is concluded that both simultaneity and succession appear to be salient concepts for 3-year-old children.

        "description":"Training in Interpersonal Cognitive Problem Solving (ICPS) can be a means of promoting social competence and adjustment. Empirical findings suggest that the process of being able to consider multiple options for solutions of interpersonal problems is important for healthy adaptive functioning, even in children as young as 4 years of age. If one can or does consider only one or two solutions to a problem, no matter how good those solutions may be, the chance of his succeeding at solving the problem may be less than if he has a repertoire of solutions available to try again. Problem solving dialoguing, an ICPS skill, appears to be an important element in producing positive behavior change. The goal of dialoguing is to help children recognize a problem, consider what might have led  up to it, and evaluate options and consequences. Formal dialoguing training closely simulates the use of dialoguing in real life situations. This may explain its effectiveness as a training technique. ICPS has the potential to reduce or prevent maladaption in a variety of populations. It has been used with retarded children, hyperactive youngsters, adult alcoholics, and short-term inpatients and is currently being tested with drug abusers, child abusers, depressed university students and pregnant teenagers.

        "description":"This paper reports to two experiments designed to develop a behavioral procedure to teach young children emergency dialing skills. Experiment 1 evaluated the effects of a behavioral procedure administered by the classroom teachers. In the classrooms training focused upon making phone calls in emergency situations. Six steps in emergency dialing were taught to young children in a period ranging from 7 to 15 days. Three conditions were compared: behavioral training, teacher-devised training, and no training. The conditions were administered to six classes at two different schools. The subjects were 33 males and 27 female children (mean age = 5 years, 1 month; range = 3 years to 6 years). The behavioral training program led to significantly greater improvements in emergency dialing  skills when compared to teacher-devised and no-training conditions. Experiment 2 examined a discrimination training procedure with selected subjects from Experiment 1 to ensure that the children not only knew how to make the emergency phone calls but also knew when to make them, i.e., under what conditions. Training on when to make emergency telephone calls was provided over a 30-day period. In a multiple-baseline design across children, training improved performance in discriminating when to make the phone calls. While the results do not necessarily reflect changes in overt behavior outside of the context of training, this study demonstrates the effects of behavioral intervention on young children's emergency dialing.

        "description":"Frequency difference thresholds were determined for fourteen 4- to 9-month-old infants (mean age, 6 months 10 days) using a discrimination learning paradigm, following a one-up, two-down staircase procedure. The subject heard 500 msec tone bursts repeated at a rate of one per sec, with a fixed standard frequency. At various points in this pulse train, the frequency of the tone burst changed for 6 sec. If the infant turned his head 45 degrees to his right within the 4 sec response interval following the change in frequency, a visual reinforcer was activated for 2 sec. Once the infant had learned the task with a relatively large frequency change, (96 Hz), the size of the frequency change was systematically decreased on each subsequent trial until the infant failed to turn, then  increased again, and so on, in order to obtain an estimate of the smallest difference in frequency that the infant could detect. Following two correct responses, the frequency difference was decreased by one step; after one incorrect response the frequency difference was increased by one step. The results showed that infants could detect 2-3% changes in frequency at 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz, while adults detected changes on the order of 1%. This finding supports the contention that infants could be using frequency difference as a cue in speech discrimination tasks. (Author/SS)",

This study was concerned with how scripts may be influenced by the structure of different events and the child's experience with them. Forty children, ranging in age from 2 years, 11 months to 5 years, 6 months, divided into younger (under 4,5) and older (over 4,5) groups, reported twice on 6 events selected to reflect differences in familiarity, social character, centrality of child's role, affectivity, and the basis for and variability in the temporal structure. Examples of events were: getting dressed in the morning, making cookies, going to the  grocery store, going to a restaurant, going to a birthday party, and having a fire drill. Results indicated that older children reported more acts, and events low in personal involvement and/or familiarity elicited less output. There was no overall age difference for act consistency; however, there were age differences for individual events due to amount of child responsibility in events and event complexity. Both groups showed few errors on act sequence consistency. Temporal terms were apparently used by younger children only when temporal structure was compelling, while older children used temporal terms for all events. (Author/MP)",

Historical approaches to the study of cultures like the normative approach, taxonomic concept, componential concept, and existential approach have all had impacts upon concepts of Chicano culture. When utilizing the normative approach, for example, non-Chicano analysts and researchers have set up normative sets of ideal and operational behaviors that hardly reflect the actualities of Chicano thought and action; thus, they have begun their studies from an already biased position. Basic propositions from the foundations of culture (e.g., cultural determinism, assimilation-integration-acculturation, bilingualism/biculturalism, cultural  syncretism) also have implications for Chicanos. The patterns of culture used by Anglo researchers to define Chicanos have been misinterpreted at best, spurious at worst, and already existing stereotypes have been further reinforced. The general tendency has been to regard Chicanos as Mexicans in the United States and carriers of the Mexican culture. This is erroneous, for the Chicano culture is an intermeshing of Anglo-American and Mexican elements. To define Chicano culture, a Chicano perspective is needed. (Author/DS)",

Chicanos should develop their own communication system, a system that would include high-circulation newspapers and journals, as well as radio and television stations. Chicanos must  now undertake the kinds of education and training that will prepare them for roles beyond that of teachers of bilingual education.

On questionnaires students and teachers indicated that out-of-district travel brought substantial educational benefit, but Community School Committee Members (CSCM's) were not so positive. All felt the need for even distribution of travel among the student population and better planning and preparation. Students and  teachers placed less value on in-district travel. The mini-courses helped students make friends and learn new skills but had limited academic value. Students and teachers rated the Ken Cook program as more successful than STARS, but students preferred to travel to other locations for vocational programs. The evaluation also concerned program expectations and priorities. CSCM's and students felt strongly that the program should include preparation for employment. CSCM's desired bilingual education and wanted greater involvement in decision making. (SB)",

        "description":"The Tennessee Self Concept Scale was used to study the effect of outdoor adventure activities on the self concept of university students. Related studies have found significant changes in self concept following survival training and Outward Bound experiences. The study population consisted of 99 students enrolled in 1 of 4 classes at Eastern Washington University. Three classes included an adventure activity, e.g., overnight survival camps, rappelling, back country hiking, as part of the course curriculum; the fourth class, the control group, was a traditional lecture course. The Tennessee Self Concept Scale was administered to all four classes in the first week of the Spring Quarter 1977 and again nine weeks later, in the last week of the quarter. Two measures were obtained from  the scale: one reflecting overall level of self esteem and one reflecting capacity for self criticism. The separate variance t test was used to measure statistically significant differences in class means for pre and post test scores. The comparison of means suggested a positive change in self concept for the classes featuring outdoor adventure activities, but levels of change did not reach statistical significance for self esteem or self criticism scores. Additional research is needed using a larger population and other measures of self concept such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. (JH)",

These objectives are divided into eight texts which are subdivided into units. Most units  include two or three chapters and the related excursions or resources. Within each unit, the objectives based on the core and the remedial excursions of the student materials are listed in the order of their development in the student materials. These are followed by the objectives for the general and enrichment excursions or the resource objectives. (Author/HM)",

Five basic research paradigms are characterized; major directions of research on number, measurement, geometry, and adolescent reasoning are identified. Most of the research was built upon the work of Piaget and his associates. However, recently translated Soviet research and information processing techniques are also discussed. Potential education applications discussed include: content and sequencing of mathematical topics, matching instruction to appropriate levels of development, and choosing instructional strategies.

The cognitive capacities of interest were logical reasoning ability and information processing capacity. The hypotheses predicted that children who had not yet developed the capacities would experience difficulty learning certain measurement concepts or skills. The results confirmed the predictions with respect to logical reasoning ability. Subjects who conserved length and reasoned transitively, performed significantly better than those who did not on the set of assessment tasks which made direct demands on logical reasoning abilities. No significant differences were found between the high and low  information processing capacity groups. The results of this study indicate that some cognitive developmental abilities do affect children's mathematics learning, but only on specific concepts. (Author/MK)",

A model is presented in an article by Kulm for the classification of task variables into broad categories. The model attempts to draw realtionships between these categories of task variables and the stages of problem solving which they principally influence. Articles by Barnett, Webb, Goldin, and McClintock define and discuss each category of task variables, give examples, survey the existing research literature, and explore the theoretical implications of task variables within the category. The categories covered are syntax variables, content and context variables, structure and complexity variables, and heuristic processes. Experimental studies for which the  description or control of task variables was a major theme are summarized in articles by Goldin and Caldwell, Waters, Days, Luger, Harik, and Branca et. al. These studies illustrate the various techniques described earlier, and provide evidence of their importance to research outcomes. In articles by Caldwell, Luger, and Schoenfeld, teaching applications are described, with examples of unit plans based on the systematic manipulation of task variables for instructional purposes. The book concludes with reaction papers by Jerman and by Kilpatrick, noted researchers in mathematics education. (MP)",

Discussion of the first topic covered definitions of citizen education, the benefits of bilingual education, and racism as an impediment to social change. Discussion of the second topic cited the need for access to equal educational opportunity, reduction of discrimination, awareness of cultural alternatives, and clarification of students' attitudes and self-concepts. The traditionally Anglocentric emphasis of school curriculum was identified as a barrier to recognizing true cultural pluralism. Discussion of the third topic emphasized the need for changes in social values, curriculum, and teacher education to promote acceptance of all cultural groups. (AV)",

A major problem with regard to the rapidly changing world oil outlook is that cars will be competing with more essential claiments for scarce oil supplies including food production, industrial power, home heating, and running trucks and busses. Developing nations, which are particularly dependent upon the automobile, are likely to experience the most profound economic impact. Estimates of future oil supplies and prices maintain that $40-a-barrel oil is a distinct possibility in the near future and that the extraction of oil will soon begin to substantially exceed reserves and new discoveries combined. Leading candidates to replace petroleum as automobile fuel include alcohol,  liquid fuels from coal, and oil from tar sands and oil shale. Although technology related to these fuels is improving, alternative fuels still cost more and do less than conventional automobile gasoline. Other means of solving automobile-related problems include improving automobile efficiency, reducing speed limits, producing smaller and less powerful cars, encouraging car pooling, and traveling by bus and train.

The objective is to describe the use of combined concepts of education, economics, and early childhood in developing a value conscious approach to energy education. The paper is divided into four parts. Part I emphasizes consumer education as a solution to the energy problem, examining educational decisions concerning individual benefits of energy education, the target audience, and effective methods of teaching this topic to young children. It also describes the program, \"Energy Education: The MIZER Series,\" a home and school based delivery of information using a value conscious approach. Part II  discusses the program in relation to the process of value development, coordinated support systems of home and school, and early childhood learning styles. Part III describes the program evaluation, which tested impact, family involvement, and level of satisfaction. Findings showed parental increase of energy awareness and a smaller amount of behavioral change, involvement of older siblings, and a high level of satisfaction. Part IV offers conclusions and a recommendation. Conclusions are that reinforcing the link between school and home based learning is an effective technique; that families moved from energy awareness to conservation; and that the model may be useful for other topics. The recommendation is that educators further explore and evaluate the model using a variety of topics,  age groups, and audiences. (CK)",

        "description":"The document presents a curriculum module designed to help 11th grade students become intelligent consumers of educational services by focusing on relevant contemporary legal developments. The major goal is to promote students' awareness and understanding of their role as consumers of educational services, their rights and obligations, legal aspects, and ways of influencing educational decisions. Three general topics are treated using hypothetical and actual cases: 1) the right to education and the responsibility to go to school, 2) student constitutional rights relating to freedom of expression, due process, and unauthorized search and seizure, and 3) student and parent involvement in educational decision making. Discussion questions are included in the material for each topic.  Time allocation suggested is five days; each day's work is outlined suggesting instructional objectives, general teaching strategies, and needed preparation and homework. Tests include a 20-question opinion pretest and a 20-question multiple choice unit test. Appendices list Constitutional amendments most relevant to students, excerpts from &quot;Educational Law Manual&quot; published by the New York Statewide Youth Advocacy Project, excerpts from actual court cases, three hypothetical cases, a section on employment and drop-out procedures, issues and court comments for teachers to use with advanced students, bibliographies of student and teacher resources, and pretest and unit test answers.

Organized using primary sources, the basic materials were a selection of Cicero's letters and Caesar's Commentary on the Civil War. The first paper, by the classroom teacher of the unit, contains brief factual information about the materials, children, and classroom conditions, and records the author's impressions. Six children selected from public and parochial schools in the Cambridge, Massachusetts area participated in the daily one-hour classes. The classes concentrated on sources of and reasons for conflicts in the accounts of Caesar and Cicero. The author's evaluation of the course centers around difficulties in translations, the need for background information, and relevant  materials. The second paper records events from the point of view of a linguist and offers suggestions about the relation of linguistic skills to the ability to read, study, and write history. The necessary skill of critical reading is discussed in terms of the students' ability to infer information from written material. The author reports results of a test given students in which they were asked to point out the ambiguities in selected quotations. The difference between students interacting with each other as opposed to interacting with the material is also discussed. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Written in 1965, the author describes the initial stages in the development of the elementary level curriculum, Man: A Course of Study. The structure and form of the course and three pedagogical techniques are discussed. The course is organized around the humanizing forces of tool-making, language, social organization, the management of man's prolonged childhood, and man's urge to explain. Plans for the section on language include a consideration about what communication is, the design features of a language, arbitrariness, acquisition, and the role of language in shaping human characteristics. The tool-making section is designed from a philosophical approach; the object is to explore how tools affected man's evolution. The unit on social organization focuses on the nature of  structure in a society, roles filled by people, and the world view of a society. The childrearing unit centers around three themes: the extent to which and the manner in which the long human childhood leads to dominance of sentiment in human life, the human tendency toward mastery of skill for its own sake, and the shaping of man by the patterning of childhood. The fifth unit concerns itself with man's drive to explicate and represent his world through symbolic systems. The three pedagogical techniques emphasized to achieve the goals of these units are contrasting, using games, and stimulating self-consciousness about assumptions. The author states his plan to create far more units than could possibly fit into a school year in order to provide the teacher with flexibility in planning.  (KC)",

The author notes that the reason for choosing the political theme is that the school is the most influential agent of political socialization in the child's life. The report outlines the concepts of intellect and education upon which the curriculum is based, the goals, rationale, central theme, and framework of the curriculum, and describes the three units. The curriculum is based on discovery learning and the goals are described as providing children with experience in generalization, valuing, and causality. Following a discussion of the framework of the course, the three units are outlined. Inventing the Western World  (Grade 7) encompasses the time span from the 5th century B.C. to 1600 A.D. and presents a variety of case studies related to power and political culture. From Subject to Citizen (Grade 8) draws its material from 17th and 18th century British and American experience. The Civic Culture (Grade 9) examines the nature, problems, prospects, and evolution of American political culture. Materials are designed to: provide children with the kind of data that scholars themselves work with, present data that demand deductive analysis, give children an opportunity to discover structure in the relationship of ideas, and increase the power of the student to deal with the modern condition.

The context of the course, a basic theory of myth, principles of art, and examples of Bushmen and Eskimo myths are presented. The author suggests two reasons for the study of the Eskimo, Pygmy, Bushmen, and a group of Australian Aborigines: the societies are relatively simple and their structure is easier to understand than the complex Western societies; and the study of hunting societies offers a student contrast with his own culture. Included in the section on mythology is a definition, a discussion of myth as communication and as document, and of structural analysis, lyrics,  ceremonials, folklore of hunters, riddles and proverbs, rites of passage, and the functions and interconnectedness of symbols. In the section on art, the author outlines differences between myth and art, the ecology of art, art and cognition, art in instruction, and the functions of art. Tales included in the final section are the Bushmen origin of marriage, of the sun, and of death, and the Eskimo tale, Earth Gives Men Their First Children and a poem, My Breath.

The unit deals with the colonial period in America in terms of the evolution of the political American. Separate sections of the paper discuss the format of the course, the Englishman in the 17th century, the lure of the new world, changes over the generations in the new world, slavery, the influence of geographical differences in North and South in shaping people's lives, the old colonial system, and royal government in America. The final section of the paper traces the conditions which gave rise to American political attitudes. The author notes that even though early settlers patterned their governments after English Parliament, a very different kind of government and  attitude toward government existed. Since government in the colonies was everybody's business, it lost the sanctity and awe with which it had been surrounded in England. A table of contents of the four-part unit is included. Some titles in Part I include: What Motivated Englishmen to Plant Colonies in America?; On New England; and On Virginia. Part II presents Bodo, the Life of a Medieval Peasant, and two articles on Virginia. Part III is the game, Empire (see SO 012 054), and Part IV covers the New American, sections of Samuel Sewall's diary, readings about an indentured servant, a slave, George Washington, and the conflict between the colonial assemblies and the royal governors.

        "description":"The author explores the utility of educational games in elementary and secondary social studies classes. Separate sections of the paper discuss types of games, similarities among formal games and social studies topics, educational game design, and examples, advantages, and limitations of educational games. Game playing in society is described as either formal or informal; formal games comprise three categories: showdown, strategy, and a combination of the two. A table of social studies topics which include the subject areas of history, geography, civics, and economics that can be broken down into elements common to formal games is presented. Next, the process of game design is explained in three steps: system analysis, simulation design, and refinement. System analysis defines  the major actors in a process, their interactions, and their decision rules in responding to each others' actions. Following the discussion of game design, eight examples of educational games relevant to social studies and designed by the author are briefly described. The final section notes several advantages of games in the classroom setting: they present concrete problems in a simplified but dramatic form; the attention span of elementary school children is increased; the player gains a growing sense of structure among the game variables; and the games which simulate reality can present the great problems of contemporary society on a level of specific human action that directly relates the student's decisions to the larger world. Disadvantages are discussed in terms of teacher  attitudes and the attractiveness of games to children. (KC)",

        "description":"Written in 1966, the author examines the evolution of teaching in relation to the development of the elementary social studies course, Man: A Course of Study. The act of teaching is traced from play practice of primates to teaching-in-context of primitive societies to the more complex abstract teaching in separate schools of contemporary society. Five specifications about how a society must proceed in order to equip its young are noted: it must convert what is to be known into a form capable of being mastered by a beginner; the learner must be saved from needless learning; a society must place emphasis on how one derives a course of action from what one has learned; all societies must maintain interest among the young during the learning process; and a society must assure that  its necessary skills and procedures remain intact from one generation to the next. The author then examines the relationship among teaching in separate schools, how a society equips its young, and the content of Man: A Course of Study. The recurring questions of what is human about human beings, how did they get to be that way, and how can they be made more so, form the structure of the course which examines the humanizing forces of tool making, language, social organization, man's prolonged childhood, and the urge to explain. Problems in constructing the course are noted in terms of the psychology of subject matter, stimulating thought in the school setting, the personalization of knowledge, and the encouragement of self-conscious reflectiveness.

        "description":"An assessment of educational game playing in the classroom is presented. The assessment is based mainly on observations and reports of the game Empire (Educational Services Incorporated). In separate sections of the report, the author considers arrangements for game playing, the motivational appeal of educational games, and how and what children learn from games. The expenditure of time and money and the utility of educational games are also considered. Six reasons for the motivational appeal are: the classroom routine is interrupted; children are encouraged to talk to fellow students; children like the manipulative aspects of games; children like to win; game playing is a familiar and non-threatening activity; and not much reading is required for participation. In discussing  intrinsic and extrinsic learning from games, the author points to problems of misleading the child through falsifications and oversimplifications of the reality the game is intended to portray. Conceptual and factual learning is also examined. In addressing these problems, the report stresses the necessity of game design and teacher follow-up. The author concludes that games are most useful at the junior high level and are least successful with bright students. (KC)",

Grouptalk, especially useful in the elementary grades, is a formal discussion of a question by a small group and a leader. Participants follow the specific rules that all contribute relevantly to the discussion and that all help in the effort to summarize it. Basic features of a Grouptalk session include a regular weekly meeting from 30 to 45 minutes in a special room equipped with a chalkboard, tape recorder, and definition cards. The definition cards illustrate the rules of Grouptalk; the question written on the chalkboard enables the group to refer to the topic at all times. Three to six children comprise the most effective group. The functions of the leader are to  guide strategy, to keep the group relevant, and to see that a summary is achieved. Cognitive skills enforced by Grouptalk include being relevant, summarizing, integrating, categorizing, defining terms, pinpointing causes of disagreement, and becoming conscious of strategy. Skills gained through effective participation in Grouptalk are the ability for self-expression, cooperation, and leading a discussion. Implications for the use of Grouptalk in evaluating students, in curriculum construction, and in psychological research are noted. (KC)",

        "description":"Educators can help people adjust to rapid and continual social change by borrowing techniques developed in the field of futuristics. Specifically, educators can encourage people to think about and react to projected changes. Futuristics (the field of study concerned with systematic study of the future using a wide range of disciplines) is based on the assumption that decisions made now will shape the future. Aspects of futures research that differ significantly from other types of research include that futures planning is action oriented, designed to suggest multiple alternative courses of action, dedicated to anticipating and planning genuinely different concepts of the future, heavily dependent on the rational study of anticipated developments and their consequences, and  concerned with creating a probabilistic environment. In addition, the concept of alternative rather than inevitable futures is fundamental to futuristics. Futurists attempt to determine possible alternative futures by considering factors such as history, chance, policy decisions, scenarios of the future, and projections based on group as well as individual opinions. Educators can incorporate futuristics into the curriculum in a variety of ways, including career awareness activities with a future orientation (elementary school), review of utopian literature and library research (secondary school), and interdisciplinary courses on the future stressing forecasting techniques, public policy, technology and educational futuristics (college level).

Objectives are to examine the philosophy underlying values education, identify problems in values teaching, describe processes used to teach values, clarify differences between values education and indoctrination, and to suggest how values education can be improved. The document is presented in eight chapters. Chapter I questions whether cognitive or affective objectives should be higher priorities in the classroom. Chapter II focuses on problems encountered by teachers in dealing with values in a pluralist society. Chapter III investigates the philosophical relationship of moral beliefs to intellectual truths and assesses the schools' responsibility for perpetuating  democratic ideals. Chapter IV questions the right of teachers to indoctrinate students. Chapter V points out the interrelationships between the schools, families, and society. Chapter VI reviews literature and research on child-rearing and education. Chapter VII reviews ways in which children's values are influenced by teachers, teaching techniques, and educational materials. The final chapter concludes that values education will develop social conscience in children if it involves them emotionally through literature and drama with historical and/or contemporary moral issues.

Perspectives on educational objectives can be organized into three major approaches which stress 1) what schools are asked, expected, or called upon to do (goals); 2) what schools do or are used for (functions); and 3) what schools should do (aims). These approaches to the question of what schools are for are complicated by recent demands that schools fulfill variously defined social purposes in addition to more traditional functions such as teaching children to read, write, and do basic arithmetic. Educators and policy makers  should focus reform efforts on a given population of students in a community setting rather than on the total school system, encourage communication between the principal and teachers, strive for positive interactions with administrators and superintendents, encourage a wide variety of instructional modes in accordance with individual and class needs, and mobilize community resources for educational and cultural enrichment. The conclusion is that schools can best fulfill their prime role of developing the full potential of each individual by concentrating on educational functions in a common school setting. (DB)",

The data are cross-sectional aggregate data, longitudinal aggregate data, and cross-national attitudinal data taken from a five-nation study. The manual contains 10 exercises. The first four examine a series of journal articles about the social and economic conditions associated with successful democracy. Exercise five introduces longitudinal data from the Minnesota Political Data Archive for analyzing sequential relationships among political, social, and economic  variables over extended periods of time. The remaining five exercises involve reanalysis of major research findings concerning the attitudinal characteristics of democratic systems. Students do not need previous training in statistics or methods. The only equipment needed to complete the exercises is a counter-sorter, although a calculator would also be helpful. Staff for the course will need a key punch and reproducer. (Author/AV)",

Chapter I describes the development work as stressing analysis and understanding of a human or social situation using varied methods and interpretations of the social sciences, investigation of the nature and meaning of forces shaping society, development of learning skills, values education, and opportunity for research and development. The program's intent was to emphasize the interaction of the quality of things learned with the quality of the intellectual experience acquired in learning. Chapter II examines the elementary school program. Using the  overall theme of man, his nature, and the forces that shaped and continued to shape his humanity, the course focused on five humanizing factors and their interactions (tool-making, language, social organization, management of childhood, and man's urge to explain). Chapter III presents plans for the junior high curriculum. Using the theme &quot;Man as a Political Being&quot;, three units are described: (1) Inventing the Western World, (2) From Subject to Citizen, and (3) The Civic Culture. These units stressed concepts of political power and political culture. Chapter IV discusses three parts of the high school social studies curriculum, which dealt with the impact of technology and science on society in the 19th century, the relation between ideology and reality in the 19th and 20th centuries, and  a philosophical reflection on the nature of social studies.

The program occurred during the 1975 summer session at Oklahoma State University. Twenty retired persons attended classes, participated in other phases of campus life, and lived in a university dormitory. Twenty-three students acted as surrogate grandchildren to the older participants. Both groups were tested extensively to determine the effects of the program on them. Also, administrators, faculty members, and students were interviewed regarding the effects of the program on the existing university structure and the anticipated effects of the program on the existing university structure and a permanent program. Results indicated that attitudes toward the program were very  positive. Elderly participants described the experience as providing a renewed sense of meaning, promoting and providing an atmosphere where two generations can interact, and creating an atmosphere where retired adults along with younger students can develop abilities and talents. Faculty and administrators also had positive attitudes toward the program. Most faculty believed that retired persons made a positive contribution toward classroom interaction. The author concluded that the results leave little doubt that such a program is desirable and feasible. Research instruments, tables, and figures are included. (KC)",

Section III offers quantitative analysis of results of tests of students in MACOS and non-MACOS social studies courses. Emphasis is placed on factors delineating the environment in which MACOS was taught, children's interpretations of course emphases, and patterns of student responses. (DB)",

Findings indicated that films, stories of other cultures, and simulation games were closely associated with high student interest in MACOS and with increased knowledge about subjects covered in the MACOS curriculum. The second section discusses observation of MACOS and non-MACOS social studies classes from 1967-1969. Findings indicated that MACOS teachers were more open with their students than were other teachers and that MACOS lessons were more often aimed  at conceptual development than non-MACOS lessons were. The third section reviews objectives of social studies teacher education programs and offers case studies of MACOS workshops. The final section offers interviews with teachers who worked with MACOS for at least one year. In the interviews, teachers stressed that working with MACOS made them understand the importance of active listening, communicating, observing, sharing in group exchanges, and expressing ideas orally.

Popular culture is described as those elements in society which have the primary function of entertaining or selling and which are becoming a familiar, recognizable, and identifiable entity for a large number of people. Some reasons for studying popular culture are that it is intimately connected with the individual's personal and social development; students possess an intimate and detailed knowledge of popular culture; the resources are abundant and inexpensive; and popular culture has lasting social importance and significance. Teaching suggestions include the areas of popular music, television and movies, social gatherings, printed materials,  fads and fashions, and careers. Music activities include listing qualities and rating stars, rewriting lyrics to tell of a local incident, and voting on values depicted in selected statements from songs. Television provides a study of propaganda and of distortion of reality through video techniques. An examination of social gatherings could lead to simulations and creative writing exercises. Popular magazines can be investigated according to audience appeal and a history of clothing fashion show could depict fads and fashions. Finally, strategies for career education include exploratory mini-courses and classifying jobs in terms of glamour. (KC)",

        "description":"Generalizations and implications of results from three National Science Foundation studies of elementary and secondary social studies education are reported. Results indicate that the teacher's beliefs, values, knowledge, and techniques are the key to what happens in the classroom and that textbook content rather than inquiry tends to be the center of instruction in social studies. Also, the back to basics movement is important to teachers. This commitment has serious implications because it tends to take students away from using social studies content as a means of teaching reading. In addition, results indicate that teachers have different views of schooling than do university professors and curriculum developers. Major concerns of teachers are classroom management and  socialization, or teaching students to behave in the system and how to learn from printed materials. Further, many teachers do not feel comfortable with innovations and with new curricula. Other generalizations are that teachers function in a system which supports a stable view of society; the principal is an important part of the teacher's social system; and teachers want to be accepted by the community, parents, and students. Implications for curriculum development include the need for developers (1) to help modify the social system to relieve pressure on teachers; (2) to recognize that financial and moral support of the principal are important for adoption efforts; and (3) to recognize the importance of the teacher's commitment to stability and opposition to change.

        "description":"This paper suggests a model for the preparation of social studies teachers based on the writings of sociologist C. Wright Mills. In 1961 Mills stated that the purpose of social inquiry should be to help people understand the connection of their personal lives to the social structure, the institutional arrangements of society. Based on this statement, the author's model emphasizes the concept that every aspect of a social studies program should demonstrate to students how their lives relate to society. This Mills-based model (MBM) is described as preferable to the popular competency-based teacher education (CBTE) approach. The bulk of the paper critiques common CBTE components and describes a methods course which implements the MBM. One particularly successful element of the MBM  course explores the public relations and corporate structure of McDonalds, the hamburger empire, in a way which can be relevant to teachers and children alike.

        "description":"This pamphlet identifies fallacies of sex stereotyping and discrimination against females, and reviews recent research on sex-role development conducted by Educational Testing Service (ETS) in New Jersey. Throughout history women have been regarded as physically and intellectually inferior to men. Beginning in the 1960s national efforts have been made to demand equal opportunity for women in education, at work, and in the professions. Among these are supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment and members of the National Coalition of Organizations for Women and Girls in Education. Research at ETS shows that stereotyped sex-role development begins at birth. Infants are treated differently by parents according to their sex, and common toys for boys and girls suggest sex-role  differences. In school these differences are reinforced when boys are assigned most leadership roles and classes are separated on the basis of sex for certain activities. The myth that women do not have an aptitude for math has been disproved when certain teaching and counseling techniques are used to promote students' positive attitudes about their capabilities. ETS is developing several new projects to help women identify their skills, especially those acquired through homemaking, and translate them into marketable job skills. (AV)",

        "description":"The paper examines the controversy over an appropriate philosophical basis for law and assesses attitudes about decriminalization of various behaviors based upon conviction about the function and objectives of the legal system. On one side of the controversy, proponents with a traditional view maintain that there is a strong connection between law and morality; for example, the view is expressed in the Declaration of Independence. Proponents of the second view, sometimes called zero-based morality, believe that law should be based on a limited contract between society and government. To assess the strength of popular support for a zero-base morality, researchers analyzed responses from surveys undertaken by the National Opinion Research Center from 1972-1977 regarding  decriminalization of marijuana and abortion, pornography for adults, and support for the rights of homosexuals to teach college. It was hypothesized that support for zero-base morality regarding these behaviors would be stronger among groups who do not share Anglo-Protestant traditions, and that support for decriminalization of various behaviors would be highly intercorrelated. Analysis of data indicated that there is considerable intercorrelation of decriminalization of these behaviors but that, contrary to expectations, this support tends to come from powerful, wealthy, educated, and high status occupation groups in society. The conclusion is that there is considerable support for decriminalization of the behaviors analyzed and that this support comes mainly from individuals espousing  zero-base morality as a basis for the legal system.

Section I examines models of cognitive processes such as Bloom's Taxonomy of the Cognitive Domain, Dewey's Stages in Problem Solving, Gagne's Conditions of Learning, and Guilford's Structure of the Intellect Model. No single model was found to be ideally suited to the curriculum developer. Section II focuses on 36 sources of curriculum theory organized to literature dealing with general cognitive processes; early childhood, science, and  social studies instruction; and specialized skills. The third section presents a taxonomy of cognitive skills. Sixty-three skill-based instructional materials are sorted into the components of the Higher-Order Cognitive Skills Taxonomy. The materials are further divided into three levels: preschool to second grade, third and fourth grade, and fifth grade and beyond.

Group discussions were tape recorded of both junior high school teachers and parents of junior high school students in Philadelphia, Memphis, Minneapolis, and Los Angeles. Results indicated that both groups believe that the public schools unavoidably play a role in M/E instruction since teachers (whether or not they seek it) are seen by students as role models. Emphasis was placed on specialized training for M/E teachers and a general familiarity with M/E programs for all teachers. Most agreed that present efforts in M/E instruction are inadequate. Concerning the content of M/E programs, participants generally believed that consideration  for others should be taught and that socialization for participation in society should be a major objective. There was general agreement that self-actualization should be an outcome of moral/ethical programs and that the content should be relevant to student concerns. The most significant conclusion is that consensus was found on a wide number of M/E issues among the groups. The group moderator's guide and a summary of teacher and parent opinions on individual questions are provided. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"The necessity for social studies professors and curriculum developers to recognize the reality of teacher attitudes and classroom situations is discussed. The author contends that teachers are not very reflective about what they teach and about the effect of their teaching on students. This lack of introspection can be traced to teacher education programs. Part of the problem is that teachers are trained to be teachers prior to their gaining experience as teachers. A suggestion is to spend less time in preservice education by preparing would-be teachers for the minimal requirements of lesson planning and classroom management. The emphasis on teaching techniques, curriculum methods, and philosophy would be reserved for inservice teachers. Other conflicts between (1) social studies  teachers and (2) professors and curriculum developers are a result of the focus of both groups. Social studies professors and developers tend to focus on conceptual structures which will excite, interest, and develop independent thinking. Teachers focus on how to control and manage students. Also, conflict results from the democratic mandate for both stability and progress. Social studies teachers, members of a community in which values of conformity dominate, gravitate toward stability, while university professors advocate teaching controversial issues. It is important to pay attention to the social system in which the teacher operates and the reality of the setting in which teaching occurs. (Author/KC)",

Section I defines the six major goals of citizenship education: the development of participatory skills and of intellectual skills; growth in knowledge of facts, concepts, and generalizations; personal development; development of dramatic values; and citizenship action both in and outside of school. Section II describes four programs of values education which relate to citizenship goals: values analysis, values clarification, cognitive moral development, and the organization of alternative educational programs. Section III discusses the values programs in relation to the citizenship goals. The author concludes that while each of the programs contribute to some of the  goals, the most effective programs of citizenship action are not part of the four major programs discussed. The final section outlines the elements of a comprehensive citizenship education program: it should extend over many years of schooling and well beyond the social studies courses; it must change the hidden curriculum as well as the overt curriculum; it must include an intensive, long-term teacher preparation program; new curricular materials, particularly in social studies and English must be acquired; and the comprehensive program must be carefully evaluated.

        "description":"Written in 1973, the document describes the application of Jean Piaget's pedagogical principles to an elementary and secondary social studies curriculum: Social Encounter and Research Curriculum for Humanization (SEARCH). In Part I, it is stressed that SEARCH is the first innovative curricular program that strives to teach the major concepts of social studies at the same time it seeks to structure these concepts into an individualized instructional design based on Piaget. Part II discusses Piaget's pedagogical principles. For Piaget, the role of action lies at the base of a child's development. Also, he maintains that intellectual development follows a fixed and regular sequence. The particular chronological stage of a child determines how he can react to a given experience. Part  III describes the premises of SEARCH. Four levels comprise the total program. Level A (ages 5-7) covers the cognitive operation of pre-operational thought. Level B (ages 8-11) is characterized by concrete operations. Level C (ages 12-14) focuses on early formal operations, and Level D (15-18) on formal operations. Content is organized around five psycho-social functions: self-realizing, governing, producing and consuming goods and services, utilizing environments, and generating and interpreting. Each stage contains ten units; each unit contains several activities built around the unit theme. In all units, multimedia materials are the chief means by which instruction takes place. (KC)",

Topics discussed in the five major speeches and small discussion groups included  the relationship of citizenship education to traditional civics courses, current trends in citizenship education, school/community cooperation, strengths and weaknesses of citizenship education programs, citizenship competencies, and the growing globalizations for emphasizing a global dimension to citizenship education included relating local community events to the global scene, emphasizing similarities in human experiences, and encouraging teachers to increase their commitment to global education.

The major paper characterizes cognitive decisionists, describes strengths and weaknesses of their approach, and assesses the extent to which empirical knowledge is available for the approach. Cognitive decisionists believe that the primary goal of moral education is to teach students to make and act on rational decisions about moral issues. The major strength of the approach is its ability to distinguish between education and indoctrination. A major weakness is disagreement among theorists about the standards that apply to moral judgment. Empirical studies tend to focus on behavior without concern for underlying reasons. The author concludes that  cognitive decisionists should give more attention to the development of teacher training materials and to research to identify inadequacies in moral reasoning. The first critique defends the cognitive-decision approach as legitimizing the school's claim to autonomy in moral education. The second critique suggests an approach to moral or civic education, and the final critique proposes a community-based program of moral/citizenship education rather than a new curricular offering in the schools.

The paper discusses the common goal of values education approaches which is to help individuals lead personally satisfying lives and become constructive members of society. Values clarification, moral development, and cognitive-decision-making theories are examined as well as the traditional models of moralizing and modeling. The author proposes a synthesis of values education objectives. Further research activities are suggested, with an emphasis on furthering knowledge of each of the separate approaches and in undertaking major integrative studies which address basic issues in the field. The final section briefly examines the general community  reaction to values education. The first critique takes issue with the proposed synthesis of values education theories and with the author's slighting the social context of values education. The final critique contends that the author of the main paper assesses the state of the art in values education with optimism clouded by uncritical eclecticism. (KC)",

It was found that the use of CRT's was limited, although some serious attempts were being made to develop and administer them. Progress was noted in such areas as equipment related skills, but little evidence of CRT development was found in &quot;soft skill&quot; areas or in team performance situations. There was general consensus that clearly-written CRT construction guides were needed. Difficulties were observed in CRT development and use: lack of task analysis data  and well-defined objectives; inattention to prioritizing tasks; disregard for practical constraints; insufficient number of items in the item bank for alternate test forms and lack of item analysis techniques; omission of test reliability and validity studies; and lack of standardized testing conditions.

These items were administered to 721 soldiers at three Army installations; the sample consisted of 540 men and 181 women--401 of these were officers and 320 were enlisted personnel. Factor analysis of these 174 items indicated one strong factor--traditional versus contemporary orientation toward women. Thirty-seven items loaded highly on this factor. From these 37 items, eighteen were selected to form the rating scale. In order to construct a second, shorter, attitude scale, seven of the 18 items were selected, based upon high item reliability (.70 to .80) and unambiguity. Reliabilities of the 18-item and 7-item scales were .88 and .78, respectively. Validity of the measures was  supported by their correlations with other variables which would be expected to be related: sex, education, political beliefs, and parent and peer attitudes. Results of the field test with 721 soldiers indicated that women (as compared with men) and officers (as compared with enlisted personnel) held more contemporary attitudes toward women in the Army.

        "description":"Using game theory as a model, suggestions are made to improve tenured public school teachers' individualized professional improvement plans. Seven basic concepts are discussed: (1) the game concept, a situation which involves decision making by the participants; (2) strategy--a plan for behavior under varied circumstances; (3) payoff--the value of an action; (4) rules--directions which structure the game; (5) information--the data available; (6) coalition--the temporary alliance among some players; and (7) timing--the choice of when a strategy will be implemented. Based on the assumption that administrator--teacher conflict is present in in-service education, the concept of payoff is discussed. Four types of payoffs are associated with teachers' workshops: reward for attendance;  penalties for absence; temptation for defecting from the cooperative position; and sustaining the attending and cooperating position. Payoff charts for conflict situations are used to provide insights related to rational decision making; to emphasize key elements; and to encourage recognition of the dilemma between individual and group needs, and of the need for solutions. It is suggested that the current workshop game which teachers and administrators play must be reconceptualized; they must work cooperatively on a teacher improvement plan. Supervisors should implement a new payoff chart and demonstrate leadership by rewarding teacher improvement. (MH)",

Scatter was defined as range of scaled scores on: (1) five regular verbal tests; (2) five regular performance tests; and (3) all 10 regular subtests. Pairwise combinations of 11 subtests were also evaluated for deviations in scaled scores. A discrepancy of 3 or more points was defined as significant deviation. A significantly greater range of scaled scores over the 10 subtests was found for the LD sample as compared with the 1976 standardization sample for the WISC-R. On the separate major scales, LD children on the average showed greater range over performance, but not verbal scales. Pair deviations for LD children were generally similar to those of  normative children Most notably, all pairs including coding showed greater deviation for LD children. Among LD children, differences in test scatter were associated with age, but not IQ or sex. LD children under 11 years showed a greater range of verbal scale scores than older LD children. All statistically significant differences were of small magnitude, so that test scatter, by itself, would not be recommended as a major diagnostic sign. (Author/GDC)",

Three parallel characteristics of change groups are identified: the ideological basis of change; the intended outcomes in terms of social change; and the change techniques. Data used in developing the ideological model are based  on a project evaluation, funded by the Women's Educational Equity Act (WEEA) to increase the number of female public school administrators within a particular state. It is suggested that evaluation should encompass not only the goals and outcomes of a project, but also the ultimate goals, the justification for those goals, and the manner in which the goals are attained. Also, it is advocated that evaluation methods include an assessment of ideological concepts and social justice. (MH)",

Learner variables were field dependent/independent cognitive style, visual/haptic perceptual style, trait anxiety, scores on the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Tests, and achievement scores on the Sequential Tests of Educational Progress. These learner variables were investigated in relation to forward observers' performance in locating a target when given a map in a field, as measured in three different testing situations. Results indicated that under certain circumstances, field dependence, anxiety, and intelligence quotient had an effect upon performance. Regression analysis indicated, however, that the learner variables  only accounted for 20 to 30 percent of the total variance. (A learning task review indicated possible problems with present instructional procedures, and suggestions for more complete investigations into the instructional sequence were submitted.

Presently, the federal role is described as limited to providing information, research support, and technical information, although some government officials support national competency standards. Most activity has occurred at the state level, with the emphasis on integrating testing programs which combine earlier testing of basic skills with periodic assessment during high school. Local school districts are also active, as exemplified by the Basic Skills Assessment program. The basic skills of reading, writing and mathematics are the focus of  most MCT programs. Both positive and negative impacts will be experienced by students, teachers, schools, administrators, school boards, parents, potential employers, and test developers. Guidelines are offered for appropriate and inappropriate test use and for selecting and scoring tests. For those who favor MCT, a cautious approach to program development is recommended, using an advisory group composed of community members and educators; instituting a pilot program; and studying the results before setting standards and operationalizing a program.

The data were collected as part of a research project to assess the assimilation of females at West Point and to determine how females were being trained for effective leadership roles. Using the Leadership Opinion Questionnaire, male and female platoon leaders described two leadership characteristics: consideration and structure (task accomplishment). Subordinates rated the platoon leaders on the same dimensions. Results were interpreted in terms of three issues: (1) the importance of sex roles as a leadership variable; (2) the leader's perception of the relative importance  of consideration versus structure; and (3) the subordinates' perceptions of performance behaviors which are important in a platoon leader's role. It was found that there were no significant differences between male and female leaders' self description on the dimensions of consideration or structure. It was determined that subordinates perceive female leaders as having more concern for the welfare of the troops, but that both male and female leaders were perceived as equally capable of accomplishing the tasks.

        "description":"The concepts of competency can be conceptually separated into two dimensions: minimum competency testing (MCT) and competency based education (CBE). One of the major weaknesses of the MCT movement is the growing reliance on single test scores as indicators of the total capability of students. Minorities do not reject the idea of competence, but they oppose the use of MCT as a rationale for organizational resegregation or as a justification for maintaining the status quo by denying mobility and choices to minority groups. CBE may change the educational process by structuring educational goals around specific outcomes; and by using various measures to diagnose individual needs, to provide individualized instruction, to use appropriate and adaptable learning activities, to use  flexible scheduling, and to evaluate programs, students, and teachers. MCT alone blames the student for failure, while CBE involves education and support processes to remediate student weaknesses. Minorities are also concerned about the lack of curricular and instructional validity in schools which administer MCTs. Minority groups, although supporting competence, do not support MCT in isolation from the responsibilities which should be borne by the total educational system. (MH)",

        "description":"Most of the arguments lodged against minimum competency testing are really observations about the abuses of testing. Blacks and other minority groups are understandably mistrustful of recent developments in minimum competency testing--possible grounds for legal challenges include the adequacy of the phase-in periods; the match between tests and instruction; past and subsequent discriminatory practices; and the rationale for setting standards. Problems have been evident in New York City, Virginia, Florida, and North Carolina. Despite these reservations, Americans of all races who were polled about their educational attitudes favored minimum competency testing; 90% favored standards for grade promotion and high school graduation, and 80% favored prompt remedial instruction for  students failing competency tests. The American public, and particularly blacks, indicated low levels of confidence in the quality of public school education. There is evidence, however, that testing programs have shown gains in student achievement in Anacostia (District of Columbia); Greensville County, Virginia; Denver, Colorado; Gary, Indiana; and Detroit, Michigan. Minimum competency standards constitute a guarantee never before asked of public schools--that no child will leave school as a functional illiterate. This is why minorities can, and do, support the competency testing movement. (GDC)",

Suggestions are presented within the context of the PMS theory and focus on the teacher's role in developing questions and activities that address the home, school and street subcultures of the learner.

For example, inadequate funds are allocated to maintain facilities and services for its prisoners. As a result, many of the prisons are antiquated, overcrowded and understaffed. In addition, minorities are not hired proportionate to their numbers in the State's population. Discriminatory racial patterns are also found with regard to minority prisoners in prison work assignments, educational and vocational opportunities, and in the overall treatment of inmates. In order to rectify some of these problems, it is suggested that the State legislature and the Board of Corrections take action to recruit more black employees' provide more opportunities for  inmates to learn marketable skills, and to expand academic training for prisoners.

This report focuses on the attempts of Livonia, Michigan, to obtain funds under the act. Examined are the areas of citizen participation, assistance for eligible persons, and civil rights compliance. It is stated that in all three areas, Livonia's application for funds under the 1974 act and the process leading to its development have been deficient. One particular problem is said to have been the city's failure to affirmatively address the housing needs of non-resident workers who may wish to reside in Livonia. It is recommended that the Federal Government amend  selected procedures for application for funding, and that the Livonia city government also modify parts of its application for funding in order to increase compliance with affirmative action and other civil rights legislation. Appended to the report are descriptions of several civil rights laws affecting the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. (Author/GC)",

Like the 1974 act, the older Federal model cities program (1968-72) was designed to benefit low and moderate income families, provide alternative uses for available funds, and allow city governments discretion in determining how money would be spent. The Michigan Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights has analyzed the history, intent, structure, implementation, regulation, and results of both laws, as well as the opinions of primary participants in both programs in the State of Michigan. The Committee has found that in terms of citizen participation, low income and minority individuals have  had fewer opportunities to participate in decisionmaking under the newer act than they had under model cities legislation. Secondly, communities have increased the amount of resources going to physical development and decreased the amount for public service projects. This shift in funding has not been due to changing community needs, but primarily to the dismantling of citizen participation procedures prevalent under the model cities program. Both administrative and legislative actions are necessary to correct these inequities. (Author/GC)",

Intended for grades 7-14, this curriculum emphasized the increasing options for women in vocational education programs and non-traditional careers. First, the curriculum was pilot tested using a first-draft version of all materials in two Illinois high schools with two classes. As a result, a few problems in implementing the curriculum and assessment instruments were identified and the materials were revised. In the second phase, the revised version was tried out in four Illinois schools with eight classes and resulted in further refinement of materials and administration procedures. In the final  phase of the field test, the curriculum was used in seven Illinois schools with eleven classes. An analysis of the results showed that male and female students at all grade levels participating learned from and enjoyed the course. However, female students and students with female teachers seemed to be more sensitive to the problems of sex discrimination. Based on all the data, it was concluded that the curriculum could be used with male and female students in all parts of Illinois and at all secondary grade levels. (BM)",

        "description":"Examination of selected national and state level career education curriculum development projects provided the basis for consideration and comparison of major strategies used in deriving curriculum content. Those found most useful included the theoretical base, philosophical base, introspection, function approach, task analysis, Delphi approach, and critical incident technique. Using a theoretical base involves questions of theory validity, whereas a philosophical base can serve as a general foundation even though it may fail to allow for work-related specificity. Introspection has inherent shortcomings since the content may not be relevant and realistic. Adams' DACUM (Developing a Curriculum) approach makes good use of introspection, however. The function approach focuses on  identification of content in terms of unifying characteristics across a particular industry or business, and can cut across traditional teaching lines. Task analysis, while expensive and time consuming, has much value in identifying career preparation content. The critical incident technique, focusing on identifying behaviors which are value-laden, has greatest applicability in career preparation and exploration, in contrast to the task analysis approach. The Delphi Technique is most useful in setting priorities, establishing goals, and forecasting the future. It should be remembered that strategies are not mutually exclusive--use of multiple strategies has great potential if one is aware of the comparative strengths and weaknesses (as can be derived from the accompanying tabulation) of  each respective approach.

        "description":"Using the Attitudes toward Women Scale (AWS), a comparative study of college student attitudes concerning sex role stereotyping and sex bias was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of a project consisting of inservice training for college faculty and staff, a training program for 375 child care providers (child development students), and a model program of nonsexist curriculum development. The child development students (experimental group) and 718 psychology students (control group) were assigned to two pretest-posttest and two posttest-only groups. The training program included consultant and community workshops, practicum experiences, and parent involvement activities designed to eliminate sex bias. An analysis of variance found no significant differences between  experimental and control group pretest scores or when the pretest-posttest and posttest-only groups were compared. When these latter scores were compared by department, the experimental group scores showed significant change whereas the control group did not, indicating training effectiveness in changing student attitudes. Utilization of results included availability of nonsexist materials to college faculty, staff, and students as well as community facilities; journal articles; packets of materials for child care providers; and consulting services availability. It was recommended that a comprehensive inservice training program be set up for postsecondary level vocational education personnel, and that a model training program for child development students be tested in community colleges.

        "description":"To identify why developing countries have inadequate abilities to establish sound financial management in the public sector, a study of five Latin American countries in varying developmental stages was conducted. The review of U.S. assistance activities and all other programs designed to provide the countries visited with indigenous financial and management expertise was planned and executed as a case study. A symposium followed in which a panel of experts reviewed results to define existing problems and make recommendations. Problems centered in four areas: (1) need for improvement in auditing and accounting practices to correct a lack of integrated financial information, under-utilization of computer systems, and weak auditing and internal control; (2) a shortage of trained  financial managers due to low salaries, professional status, and ineffective civil service systems; (3) low government priority for training programs; (4) need for additional effort to strengthen training in financial management. Specific recommendations included urging Congress to ammend the foreign assistance act giving attention to financial management, cooperating with major donors to strengthen institutions offering training, determining needs of developing countries, strengthening U.S. capability to plan and implement management programs and urging AID (Agency for International Development) to increase focus on training in management and public administration. In addition it was suggested that an international symposium be convened to launch a coordinated effort to encourage  development of a financial management improvement program. (FP)",

Focus is on studies of assessment methods and data needs (Part 1) and recurrent education (Part 2). The first three studies emphasize the development of assessment methods. One suggests a general methodology for assessing cooperative education programs in the U.S. and offers specific guidelines; another gives information about the Work Experience Program in Britain and assessment criteria; a third uses economic and sociological inquiry to suggest expected outcomes of apprenticeship policies in France. Other studies report findings from recent surveys of programs: In one, the authors outline the goals and operation  of part-time compulsory education in Holland; another examines off-the-job skill training for young school leavers as a link between schooling and life; several new Italian programs to improve school-to-work transition and reduce unemployment are described in a third; two Swedish programs, covered by the fourth study, offer employment subsidies for the hiring of young people to replace older employees during the latter's training periods. The first study in Part II asks why, in the light of fiscal, demographic, and labor force trends, there is so little recurrent education; the second presents data on &quot;further education&quot; in France and Germany and how this relates to the school-to-work transition.",

This is an important element of participatory research, a process towards gathering new knowledge with the people capable of defining that knowledge. This method combines research and participation, an involvement of the subjects which is influenced by researcher attitudes and characteristics as well as research methodology. The value system of the researcher influences the possibility of participation. A researcher who would aspire to listen to a subject to mutually develop knowledge must value intuition and sympathetic understanding. Several personal  characteristics and interactional patterns of the researcher also influence the quality of participation: (1) reciprocity, (2) vulnerability, (3) understanding of what the participants define as reality, (4) constant refinement of one's perceptions and assumptions, (5) awareness of one's own observational limitations, and (6) attrition of ethnocentrism. Research methods which influence and amplify the nature of participation include sufficient time to deal with the problem, a mode for reflection, and the permanent sequence of analysis, statement, action, reflection analysis.

        "description":"Popular theatre that speaks to the common man in his own language and deals with directly relevant problems can be an effective adult education tool in the process Paulo Freire calls conscientization--a process aiming to radically transform social reality and improve people's lives. It can also serve as a medium for participatory research. Popular theatre offers a methodology for massive scale application which is manageable by village-level animateurs because (1) it can create awareness of people's own resources and mobilize them; (2) it provides continuity in definition, analysis, and solution of community problems; (4) as entertainment, it attracts and holds interest; (5) the researcher is a committed participant and learner--not a detached outsider; (6) as collective  expression, it fosters cooperative thinking and action. Important features include the discussion after every performance, when people share ideas and identify problems, and participation, since everyone can manage theatre, given a predetermined plot line for dialog improvisation; actors are already familiar with issues and situations. Furthermore, this already familiar medium defuses feelings of educational inferiority arising from social prejudice or illiteracy. Adult educators in Botswana have used popular theatre in community education campaigns, resettlement education, Freirean literacy work using theatrical story-telling instead of pictures, and as part of extension work in choosing appropriate technology for rural development. Descriptions of these four examples are included in the  paper as each moved through problem identification to action while demonstrating popular theatre's role in social transformation programs.

        "description":"The size of the earnings gap between men and women has not changed substantially in recent years. The sustained earnings differential contrasts significantly with recent gains women have made in the job market. Several factors contribute to the wage differences: (1) The majority of women are in lower-paying occupations and lower-status jobs even though increasing numbers are in higher paying occupational groups, (2) the rise in women's labor force participation has resulted in larger proportions of women who are in or near entry level, (3) the type of education received is often different so that the marginal return on a similar educational investment is greater for men than women, (4) women generally put in less overtime; however, statistics show considerably less earned for  like amounts of overtime work than men, and (5) women often have fewer years of experience than men in similar jobs; again, statistics show that as beginning workers, men receive better financial offers than women. Additional earnings differential factors include age, race, marital status, U.S. region, and industrial concentration. Studies have shown, however, that even after adjusting for such factors, much of the female earnings differential remains unexplained. Data indicate that women experience unusual difficulty in getting hired and promoted. (Eight tables, constituting a major portion of the report, compare the earnings of women and men showing mean income and distribution by various occupational groups and highlighting differentials by age, race, marital status, and region.)

Among the findings of the work session was that the group favored increased involvement of organized labor in education. Group members believed that  labor could provide significant input because of its expertise, and they recognized that it was important for labor to participate so that its view could help shape the direction of work-education policy. The committee also believed that career awareness could be expanded through improved guidance counseling and infusion of labor studies into the curriculum. Responsibility for providing work experiences, in the judgement of the advisory group, should rest with the joint collaboration of labor, education, and business and industry. (LRA)",

Part 1, The Search for Goals, includes a variety of observations, anecdotes, etc., dealing with the problems of establishing realistic and attainable goals for a nation of lifelong learners. Many selections are marked with musical cleff symbols signifying they are woofers, sometimes disturbing and sometimes solemn, and tweeters, sometimes humorous and sometimes annoying. Part 2, The  Realities/The Obstacles, deals with events, accomplishments, failures, and problems that must be overcome. The third section, Coming to Terms, is a series of papers by individual authors on approaches to the linking of resources for lifetime learning. Topics include open education, curriculum as a human agenda, educational leadership responsibility, the individual as culture maker, and a comprehensive model for lifelong learning with learners, experiences, resources, and authentication as major components. Appended are brief profiles of the contributing authors and a directory of Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development board of directors and staff. (FP)",

Federal legislation provided no specific provisions or funding for R&D or D&U prior to the Vocational Education Act of 1963, which was followed by the increasingly more supportive Vocational Education Amendments of 1968 and the Educational Amendments of 1976. In particular, the \"impct statement\" of the 1976 Amendments emphasizes D&U by pressuring R&D personnel to show that their work is useful. Assessments of current D&U show that dissemination  networks inadequately disseminate reporting which is often poorly done, that the target audiences need help at all levels of D&U, and that practitioners are often unaware of innovations. Improvements in D&U will require coordinated efforts by vocational educators at the national and regional levels to continue development of the nationwide network with trained personnel and adequate R&D funding and at the state and local levels to establish D&U, which is largely a state responsibility, as a high priority. At this level adequate financial support should be provided, responsibility for coordinating the vocational education activities assigned, D&U activities emphasized in the program improvement section of the state plan, and statewide networks for D&U activities established.

Findings of background research to isolate demographic and cultural variables of the primary target audiences are summarized. An organizational evaluation is also described which studied the goals, objectives, procedures and accomplishments of 250 New York City agencies (profit-making, community service, and government) involved in processing and dissemination of job market information. The job preparation model itself begins with explanations of youth needs and problems followed by appropriate intake procedures including various types of testing and assessment. Next, training objectives are discussed in light of the  assessment results with emphasis given to a total training design including job skills, self-awareness, and motivation. Some suggested training tools are listed with mention made of mainstreaming, traditional skills training, and youth staff. Preparation for the world of work includes a discussion of motivation methodology, survival education, and a continuous counseling program. Job development procedures are suggested and emphasis is given to development of job banks, communication with job sources, planning, research of job market, and creation of jobs. (FP)",

Traditional sociological and economic theories applicable to the problems of unemployment and occupational and status achievement are initially reviewed along with empirical studies that have examined some of the major propositions of these theories. Next, the concept of \"sponsorship mobility\" formulated by Ralph Turner (1970) is utilized and elaborated as a policy approach to dealing with the problem of black and disadvantaged minority youth unemployment. The major hypothesis advanced and that forms the basis of the policy approach suggested is that an improvement in employment opportunity for black and other disadvantaged youth can be facilitated through the establishment of  functional support systems and sponsorship groups that effectively mediate the relationship between disadvantaged youth and the employment structure. Various strategies for formulating support systems and sponsorship groups are offered. Concluding remarks indicate a need for reordering national priorities and public relations and education regarding affirmative action for black and disadvantaged youth. Appended tables include unemployment figures, a model for youth employment and policy interaction at the state and local levels, and organizational activities of federal level youth employment service.

The first employs 1960 and 1970 census data to examine the impact of local labor market structure and changes in the structure upon the employment growth of black and white youth. The second part uses data on individuals from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men to examine the determinants of spells of unemployment and the duration of those spells. The final part of the study employs a variety of sources to determine whether there is any evidence that racial differences in aspirations or behavior can explain the employment differential. Among the findings of the study was that black employment is more sensitive than that  of whites to the industrial composition of the labor market and to competition from adult women. The analysis of individuals found that racial differences in background characteristics can account for only half of the differential in unemployment experience. No evidence is found of important racial differences in aspirations or behavior. (LRA)",

        "description":"Recurring evidence that workers with similar skills do not necessarily earn the same wages led to the formulation of an alternative to the conventional market theory, namely, the segmented market theory. This theory posits that certain skills are distributed not among prospective employees but among jobs, in relation to the technology of those jobs. These technologically defined skills can be acquired only on the job. If this is indeed the case, then the redistribution of earnings would require policies designed to improve the technology that characterises low-skilled jobs and eliminate hiring discrimination. This study develops a theoretical framework for analysis of technologically induced labor market segmentation on the economic returns to such institutionally acquired forms  of human capital as formal schooling and manpower training. This theory refines the dual-market hypothesis by proposing a positive feedback model in which technological innovation is an endogenously determined mechanism. The study poses three specific questions left unanswered by existing market segmentation theories up to now. First, if market segments do exist, how can they be isolated? Second, what specific roles do schooling and technology play in the market segmentation process? Third, how do market segmentation and technologically induced skill specificity affect returns to employment? (CP)",

        "description":"Two concerns that underlie preoccupation with health care costs are that society may not be getting a &quot;reasonable return&quot; from increased expenditures and that the quantity of services per expenditure could be provided more cheaply. Concern arises because the &quot;market&quot; for health care deviates significantly from other &quot;free enterprise&quot; markets, it being the provider rather than the consumer who makes or helps make key decisions of what, when, and where to purchase services. Recent growth in expenditures, both per capita and as percentage of GNP, has been phenomenal, the largest share going to hospital care. Increased government financing and insurance payments have resulted in a decline of out-of-pocket expenditures (from 68% in 1950 to 30% in 1977), yet medical costs comprise the  single most common cause of personal bankruptcies. Since Total Expenditures = Price Per Unit x Number of Units Purchased, policies aimed at controlling one will not necessarily control the other, given such factors as increased demand due to growth in health insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid, and production costs resulting from the introduction of cost-enhancing technology. Lack of systematic policy coordination also hinders control. It is recommended, then, that policies to limit hospital expansion and to regulate rates be implemented in concert, along with review mechanisms to reduce inappropriate service utilization in combination with policies that lead to a relatively scarce supply of hospital beds.

The Classroom Management Questionnaire, an instrument designed to measure socialization style as derived from Aronfreed's Induction-Sensitization Paradigm, was administered to a sample of elementary teachers. Those scoring one standard deviation above or below the mean were selected for classroom observation using the Flanders Interaction Analysis Categories System. The two groups displayed significantly different teacher-student interaction patterns. The inductive teachers used specific praise with students, minimal amounts of criticism, and small group activities with a focus on accepting and expanding student ideas and feelings. The sensitizing teachers used  perfunctory praise, public criticism of students, large group activities with an emphasis on student misbehavior. While most teachers tend to display a combination of behaviors, each teacher does display an overall socialization style that can be observed and measured. The next step in the process is to determine the effects of these styles on the cognitive and affective development of students. (Author/CKJ)",

Analysis of variance was used to test for differences between motivational groups within employment status categories on the demographic variables of personal income, age, educational level and number of children and on the attitude variables of satisfaction with employment status, marital happiness, general happiness, husband's attitude, satisfaction with family relationships and sex role attitude. It was concluded that relationships existed between motivation for full-time employment and general happiness, between motivation for part-time employment and age of subject and number of children, between motivation for full-time homemaking and age of  subject, number of children, satisfaction with employment status and husband's attitudes, and between motivation for volunteer work and satisfaction with family relationships. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences between the employment category groups (disregarding motivation) on the demographic and attitude variables. Differences between the groups were observed on the variables of number of children, educational level and personal income level. (Author)",

        "description":"The hypothesis that verbal humor may serve as a technique of social influence was tested for the first time under experimental conditions. Humor-moderating attempts at social influence and an examination of potential intervening variables tested the prediction that verbal humor would produce compliance. In a dyadic bargaining paradigm, at a predetermined point in the negotiation, subjects received a demand (from a confederate) that varied in size and was administered in either a humorous or a non-humorous way. Results supported the major hypothesis that humor would result in an increased proportional concession. While sex differences, size of demand and possible intervening variables produced different responses, they did not affect compliance. Humor increased concession amounts,  the subject's laughter and liking for the task, while marginally lowering self-reported tension. Where tension-reduction and liking of the partner are important mediators, humor, therefore, may prove helpful. (Author/LS)",

        "description":"To dispel the myths of linguistic deficiency among nonstandard English dialect speakers, evidence that repudiates these myths should be examined. These myths include suggestions that nonstandard dialects are ungrammatical and cannot be used to form concepts, and that speakers of such dialects receive little verbal stimulation as children. The result of this language impoverishment is thought to be poor performance in academic, social, and economic life. Research evidence repudiates these myths by indicating that in less formal testing situations and in natural surroundings, the monosyllabic speakers of formal test situations are actually verbally productive people. Linguists have noted that nonstandard English dialects are highly coherent, logical, and structured. Poor academic  performance cannot be caused by the nonstandard dialect alone. Positive instructional techniques include recognizing dialect renditions of oral reading as high level acts of comprehension, utilizing the language experience approach as a bridge between the two dialects, and overcoming negative attitudes toward nonstandard dialects.

Tests were administered to every child in selected schools at four grade levels at yearly intervals from 1973 to 1977. The results indicated that for each grade at each time of testing the rank order of mean reading scores was always the same: group one, the children of professionals, white collar workers, and owners of large farms, consistently earned the highest mean score. Next, came group two, the children of skilled workers. Children of unskilled  workers, owners of small farms, and the unemployed were always in third place. Some evidence existed for a progressively widening reading gap between social class groups in Ireland, although the effects were not large. (MKM)",

Metalinguistic awareness describes a child's ability to understand the reading register, that special terminology used to teach reading. The children were asked to identify the auditory stimuli as one word or not one word. More than 50% of the younger children (ages 5.6 to 6.5) consistently failed to recognize a spoken word as a word. Children in the second group (ages 6.6 to 8.0), in their first year of formal reading instruction, appeared to possess an accurate concept of short words; but they still showed confusion about long words. The children in the second and third grades (ages 8.1 to 9.5) showed improved ability but they  still experienced cognitive confusion of &quot;long&quot; spoken words. Few children in any of the age groups consistently recognized that isolated phonemes and syllables were not words. The results suggest that the average child's metalinguistic awareness of a spoken word improves with age, and that significant relationships exist between children's metalinguistic awareness of spoken words and reading achievement.

What techniques could those teaching reading employ to more closely simulate that learning?

A brief overview of basic writing theories is presented, and the theories are categorized into two approaches: a traditional approach of teaching by prescription in an authoritarian classroom atmosphere using William Strunk and E. B. White's \"The Elements of Style,\" and a nontraditional approach of teaching by practice with emphasis on the personal and the teacher as friend. The basic writing theory recommended in the paper suggests that students who use nonstandard English learn that the development in standard English of conventions of scholarly discourse was designed to legitimize knowledge, that access to  these conventions has been limited by society and has kept nonstandard users powerless, and that mastery of these conventions is a political act.

        "description":"Between 1959 and 1975, television replaced newspapers as the public's major source of news. To examine this trend in further detail, a national sample of 1,519 adults were asked to construct diaries of their activities during one day in the fall of 1975. These adults were also interviewed for their use of television news and newspapers. In a static context, the media appeared to follow a supplementary rather than complementary/competitive pattern. In a cross-time context, however, free time increased significantly from 1965 to 1975, while time devoted to newspapers decreased. Moreover, television viewing increased dramatically, particularly among older people. Increased television viewing was found for younger people, but the younger age groups also gave evidence of a \"tradeoff\"  between newspapers and more specialized media (magazines and books). The results suggest that American television's second stage of development, in which news and reality-oriented content increased, made inroads on newspaper reading habits. In its third stage of development, the coming age of more personalized packaging via tapes and discs, television may challenge the specialized media of magazines and books. (RL)",

The paper reports the responses of 124 magazine editors to a mail questionnaire (with a 24.08% response rate). Dealing with each research area  consecutively, it builds a composite description of the &quot;average&quot; magazine editor. It reveals a heavy involvement of editors in most editorial office activities and an almost even split in the presence or absence of editorial policies, but a strong reliance on editorial formulas. It also shows that &quot;talking with the editor&quot; is the strongest source of information on acceptable editorial office performance, that the mean number of editorial employees per magazine is 4.79, and that the task consuming the largest amount of time is &quot;editing, correcting, and proofreading.&quot; (Author/FL)",

The growth of competition between shoppers and newspapers and the effect of concentration of ownership on paid newspapers is explored. It is suggested that in towns where the chain newspaper faces no competition, advertising rates soar; whereas in towns where the independent shopper offers competition, advertising rates stay firm or even go down. It is also contended that to the extent that  shoppers continue to compete, it will be much easier for a new paid newspaper to enter the field.

Results indicated that listening to pop music appears to be an integral part of adolescent  patterns of living, exposure to pop music may be adolescents' most frequent and extensive connection with the media, motivations for listening tend to center on diversion, and--since respondents were generally unable to provide even minimal feedback about song content--the impact of pop music on adolescents is in areas other than their cognitive development.

First it provides sketches of the work motivation theories of McGregor, Maslow, Herzberg, and Deci. Next, the paper examines the work and problems of teachers. Finally, it offers a review of strategies for enhancing the motivation of teachers, such as praising and providing feedback. The paper concludes that administrators should accept teachers as partners in a collective pursuit. They should seek to ease the frustrations of teaching and encourage teachers' effectiveness and achievement of psychic rewards. (Author/LD)",

        "description":"The purpose of the teacher-learner strategy (TLS) project is ostensibly to test different instructional arrangements in different national contexts to see which ones obtain the best results. The logic of this approach is compelling. Yet it is the orderly appearance of the TLS project that might be its greatest problem. The doctrine of external appearances refers to an intellectual and reductionist treatment of a problem such that once a systematic set of procedures that appear to address a problem is adopted, it is assumed that the problem disappears. That is, the systematic set of procedures becomes the focus rather than the problem itself. Looking at the past, there is no evidence to support the view that programs such as the TLS have made any difference in measurable outcomes  or in processes of schooling. Even if the TLS experiments are designed in ways that are technically acceptable with respect to sampling and data analysis, the pitfalls of cross-national experiments are overwhelming in four areas: specification and identification of treatments, the determination of appropriate criteria of effectiveness, the conduct of the experiment, and the interpretation and generalization of results.

The first part of the paper outlines the assumptions that have characterized the field in recent years. These assumptions are concerned with planning as social research; the distribution of education; the quantity, quality, and content of educational planning; educational planning at subnational levels; and what lies beyond the design of educational plans. Against this background, the second section briefly reviews how the changes discussed are likely to affect the role and the competencies required of the people who will be in  charge of planning and the relationship of these changes to the training of planners. The areas discussed are the research component in training; distribution, disparities, and equality in education; the determinants of educational outcomes; regional and local planning; and the implementation and evaluation of educational plans.

Chapter 1 describes the variety of approaches that individual countries use to finance their primary schools and the major trends in school finance policy in each country. Chapter 2 of the study compares and contrasts the diverse arrangements that countries have developed to accomplish particular educational policy objectives. Finally, chapter 3 summarizes the report and indicates some of its limitations as well as its contributions to comparative study. One of the findings that emerge is that some of the  federal countries equalize at as high, or at even higher levels, than do some of the unitary states. Also, the presence of a federal form of government structure does not appear to be controlling with respect to either the intensity, or the success, of equalization efforts. (Author)",

This report seeks to clarify both. What is needed to perfect meaningful coordination in this field appears to be more modest and manageable than some of the efforts and proposals of recent years: not a new layer of bureaucracy, but a series of specific arrangements to identify real interagency problems as they emerge and a predisposition on the part of the agencies concerned to deal with them case by case. In this report the General Accounting Office offers some suggestions as to how the new International  Communication Agency might fulfill its presidential mandate as the coordinator of government exchange programs and a governmental focal point for programs in the private sector. (The appendixes include the questionnaire to selected agency heads and a proposal for closer coordination and information-sharing among U.S. international exchange and training programs, a selected listing of international exchange and training directories, and descriptions of U.S. government international exchange and training programs.)

The students' responses were analyzed for each of the following subscales: (1) Should schools prepare students for the work world?; (2) Jobs available for young people are undesirable; (3) Doing other things is more interesting than holding down a good  job from age 16 to 24; (4) Taking an inconvenient or undesirable job is preferable to being on unemployment insurance; (5) It is important to hold down a high quality job from age 16 to 24; (6) Jobs available for young people are high quality; (7) Those in authority are doing things to reduce unemployment; (8) Youth unemployment exists because of the attitudes of the young; (9) Being on unemployment insurance is preferable to taking an undesirable job; (10) The rate of youth unemployment inspires the young to try harder; (11) The rate of youth unemployment results in feelings of depression among the young; (12) Youth unemployment exists because foreign countries benefit from Canadian resources. (The data are summarized in this report for each subscale and conclusions are made; results of  the first survey on desires and experiences concerning work are found in ERIC document ED 162 132.)

Subjects in the controversy conditions were induced to have a high level of defensiveness by a disconfirmation of personal competence or a low level of defensiveness by a confirmation. Subjects in no-controversy indicated more conceptual conflict (uncertainty) and were more accurate in taking the cognitive perspective of the confederate than were subjects in the confirm no-controversy condition. These results support Piaget's and Kohlberg's views of the role of controversy in perspective-taking and cognitive development and Berlyne's theory of conceptual conflict and epistemic curiosity. Subjects in the disconfirm controversy  condition experienced more uncertainty and were more accurate in cognitive perspective-taking than were subjects in the confirm controversy condition. Subjects in the disconfirm controversy condition also experienced more internal distress, derogated the confederate and the confederate's position and arguments to a greater extent, and indicated greater closed-mindedness in responding to the confederate and the confederate's arguments than did subjects in the confirm controversy condition.

Based on questionnaire responses from institutionalized girls in two juvenile reformatories, findings indicate that attitudes of those engaging in serious delinquent activity were similar to the attitudes of those who did not. This argues against the common assumption that delinquents have values different from nondelinquents. Instead, support emerged for the argument that delinquents drift into and out of delinquent behavior. It appears that individuals engage in delinquent behavior because they are periodically released from moral  constraint. (BN)",

        "description":"There are several social and personal characteristics that may differentiate those college graduates who will achieve high-salaried positions as business executives from those who will not. Some conclusions about patterns that seem to be associated with becoming a high-salaried business executive can be drawn from the findings of the Utilization of Education Survey, conducted in 1974-75 for the CPC Foundation and the National Institute of Education. The data in this survey, based on the responses of college graduates who participated for over a decade in a survey panel, illuminates the family background, scholastic achievement, college education and self-assessment of a number of business executives. Findings show that the highest salaried business executives are more likely than  others to have college-educated fathers, high grades in high school and college, and to have attended a very selective college. They report a positive self-assessment, indicating a high degree of drive to achieve and intellectual and social self-confidence. No relationship was found between majoring in business and attaining a high-salaried position as a business executive. The findings suggest that a certain amount of brilliance in intellect, performance and style is more important than what one studies in college in order to become a business executive. (Author/PK)",

The psychologist's assessment could provide relevant information concerning whether to remove a child from the home, whether there is a danger to siblings, or whether the case would be amenable to treatment. Furthermore, an assessment of the dynamics of child abuse necessitates a professional understanding of a complicated interaction of social and personal factors. Family group interviews, which may include members of the extended family, may be utilized in treating a case of child abuse, a psychologist may also use a range of therapeutic techniques, such as group therapy, crisis therapy, couples therapy and family therapy.

Examples of such events are the growth of nontraditional educational mechanisms, the marked increase in the proportion of females in undergraduate enrollment and the increased need and importance  of retention programs.

High congruence between those two kinds of structures seems well established. What is less clear is how and why those structures differ from that for immediate judgments of the same behaviors. The time interval between perceiving the pertinent behavior and making a judgment about it is involved in such differences. Another is the level of abstraction involved in the variables usually used. More fundamental than this ongoing controversy, however, is the fact that there is no one personality structure: personality structures change with the variables studied and even with the instruments used to measure any  one set of variables. To get dependable, replicable findings, the observer's idiosyncratic contributions must be separated from his judgments. This can be done by concentrating on simple, short actions. Alternatively, how people make attributive judgments can be studied as well as the evaluative judgments that people must make about others, in carrying out the activities of everyday living.

        "description":"Several treatment approaches to cigarette smoking were investigated, including a nicotine fading procedure in which subjects changed their cigarette brand each week to one containing progressively less nicotine and tar; a self-monitoring procedure in which subjects plotted their daily intake of nicotine and tar; a combined nicotine fading/self-monitoring procedure; and a slightly modified American Cancer Society Stop Smoking Program. Smokers (N=40) were assigned to one of the treatment programs. Results at the six-month follow-up showed that the nicotine fading/self-monitoring treatment was the superior procedure on all dependent measures: abstinence rate (50%), daily nicotine intake (69% reduction from baseline), daily tar intake (71% reducation from baseline). While the  combined treatment program produced success rates in the range of those obtained by the aversive rapid smoking procedure (the most successful procedure to date), the nonaversive combined program did not share some of the inherent limitations of the aversive procedure. Results suggest that the nicotine fading/self-monitoring approach may be a more reasonable treatment for persons with heart disease, emphysema and asthma, and may hold promise for the more general cigarette smoking population as well.

The intentional changes turned out to be mostly through self-help. It was largely the person herself or himself who chose, planned, and implemented the change. The person often obtained significant help from friends and other peers, but only rarely from professionals or books. On four measures of magnitude and success, the changes were generally rated quite high regardless of whether or not they involved professional help. Results indicated that changes clustered into seven areas of life, involving: (1) job, training, or education; (2) human relationships, emotions, and self-perception; (3) enjoyable activities; (4)  residential location; (5) body and physical health; (6) basic knowledge or skill in diverse situations; and (7) personal finances and home maintenance.

Specific questions included: (1) whether the current types of legal reform eliminate or reduce the prejudice which reportedly inheres in the common law rules of evidence; (2) the extent to which empanelled adult jurors utilize such evidence without prejudice in a deliberated judgment context; and (3) the extent to which the different types of reform interact with varying degrees of victim consent.

College students attributed their success or failure on two chemistry tests to ability, effort, luck, or task difficulty, and indicated how well they expected to perform on a subsequent test. Among students who succeeded on the tests, expected and actual performance on the next test were positively related to ability attributions and negatively related to luck attributions. Among students who experienced failure, expected performance was negatively related to ability attributions and positively related to effort attributions.

The study of sex roles cuts across several disciplines, as well as being the major focus of women's liberation, thus creating the possibility for reappraisal of the field and its assumptions. Two positions have been taken about the bases of sex roles. One view, taken by the school of sociobiology, asserts that males are superior as social animals. The second, taken by environmentalists, states that sex differences are the result of societal intervention. Further studies implicitly accept the polarized model of male/female development. Analysis of the research shows that the basic assumptions of the field actually create  rather than explain reality. The literature on sex roles assumes that women really do have stereotypical personality traits which result in inferiority. Acceptance of the assumptions constitutes a denial of the real and constant forces which make it difficult if not impossible for women and most men to achieve, to be independent, to be socially mobile, and to develop intellectually regardless of their psychological states.

Two competing explanations for this performance deficit (learned helplessness and egotism) were tested. Subjects were given either solvable or unsolvable discrimination problems and then a series of anagrams which were alleged to be either highly or moderately difficult. Subjects previously given unsolvable problems did better on the anagrams when led to believe the anagrams were highly difficult. This result is contrary to a learned helplessness theory interpretation which attributes performance deficits following unsolvable problems to the belief that outcomes are independent of responses. Instead, this result supports an egotism explanation which maintains that people are not likely to try hard  on a task following experience with unsolvable problems. That is, following failure, people are not likely to try hard on a task, unless a poor performance would not pose a further threat to their self-esteem. (Author)",

Models of institutional influence and of within-school processes are developed for both secondary and post-secondary education to integrate and refine the literature on school effects and returns to schooling. Rather large occupational status and earnings differentials are associated with gross school-to-school differences and with qualitative differences in educational experiences within institutions. Secondary school characteristics and experiences weigh particularly upon the market outcomes of youth who terminated formal schooling at high school graduation.  The use of traditional quantitative indices of schooling (such as years of school completed or certification levels) in assessing the market consequences of investments in education needs to be supplemented by information on qualitative variations in educational experiences. Additionally, the likelihood that school experiences may have quite different implications for selected target populations deserves further consideration. The simplistic assumption implicit in much of the school effects literature that institutional effects are homogeneous may actually mask quite important consequences for certain students. (Author)",

Comparisons with scores on the Spence-Helmreich Attitudes toward Women Scale (AWS) revealed that the sample was more liberal than the original AWS sample. Men held significantly more traditional attitudes toward motherhood than women. Younger subjects also agreed more with the myth of motherhood. Catholics more than non-Catholics  rejected abortion and supported the primacy of the woman's role as mother. Education produced the most pronounced effect on attitudes toward motherhood, with college graduates holding more liberal attitudes. (HLM)",

Limitations of these modalities were revealed in the followup studies. Implications for treatment and policy include: (1) methadone detoxofication as a short-term program is a relatively ineffective treatment technique, but the longer a client remains in treatment, the more likely it is there will be a positive outcome; (2) procedures of intake should make the alternatives available to clients clear to them at time of entry; and (3) aggressive client followup which makes continuing care available to the client at time of exit from the program helps to ensure  the client's successful integration into the community.

The settings include two university clinical psychology programs at Alabama and Kansas; the Memphis Internship Consortium; the University of Arkansas Student Development Center component of the Counseling Unit; and two county social service agencies, Benton and Washington counties in Arkansas. The evaluations of the clinical psychology training programs are described in some detail herein to augment (and antedate in methodology) the separate presentations of programs in the other four settings. The model format includes entree to setting, shared planning, participation in data collection by setting personnel, informal oral feedback with all setting participants,  formal feedback between researcher and program, and a continuing relationship between researcher and program. The model encourages a continuity of relationship between researcher and program to stimulate shared involvement over time, increasing the likelihood that findings will have an effect upon future program practices. Methods include interviews with participants, group meetings with participants, stream of behavior accounts and occupancy counts of behavior settings, needs assessment data, time logs of activities and concurrent feelings of program participants, and questionnaire data. These methods separate persons and settings so that feedback of findings may be individualized, and personally relevant data as well as program relevant data may be provided to participants.

In general, evaluation favors men over women when a competent performance is being assessed, while women are favored over men when an incompetent outcome is being evaluated. These findings are explained in terms of sex-role congruency. In addition, research on causal attributions of performance is reviewed. It is found that successful male performance tends to be seen as repeatable; attributions are made to stable and internal causes such as skill and ability. It is further shown that repeated successful female performance cannot be depended upon, since attributions are made to luck, an external  factor, or to effort, an unstable factor. Also, lack of ability is used to explain female lack of success more than male lack of success. Finally, the process of evaluating women's performance is summarized in three major steps: initial perception of performance, comparison of such perceptions to norms, and prediction of future performance.

Noting that the psycholinguistic model of reading views reading as a process of predicting meaning based on the reader's prior knowledge of language, the paper describes recent research that has led to a definition of reading comprehension that considers linguistic competencies, syntactic and semantic knowledge, and factors related to the printed page and to the reading environment. It then examines the characteristics of schemata, which represent generic concepts that are stored in memory, and explains how schema theory provides the concepts for explaining how readers interact with texts to interpret and comprehend. It provides examples to show how readers call upon  schemata in reading and points out that in schema theory bottom up and top down processing of input occur simultaneously. Finally, the paper shows how schema theory points up the importance of such instructional methods as assisting students to relate new concepts to those already known, assisting them in setting up the dominant structure for comprehending a text, developing vocabulary concepts, and developing effective question/answer relationships.

Among the problems seen by educators to be either difficult to resolve or occurring with noticeable frequency were invigorating student interest in reading, achieving a sense of professional worth, and building skills in reading comprehension. The factors emerging from the analysis also revealed interesting assumptions and convictions about teaching, the reading process, learning, and curriculum.

Four of the test items were from the original event sequence, two were \"new\" but a part of the original sequence, and two were \"new\" but inconsistent with the event sequences. After testing, informal interviews were conducted with the students to determine their rationale for decision making. Analysis of the results indicated that good readers were more accurate in identifying old test items as logically belonging  with the event sequences than were poor readers, but that no ability effect was present for responses to new items. In addition, students appeared to be less accurate in identifying inconsistent pictures than inconsistent sentences.

        "description":"The central feature of language is symbolic meaning, and the act of reading is a part of the symbolic process that characterizes human life. Meaning occurs as a result of interpretation in a context, not as a result of response or reaction. Signs have a literal meaning in a specific context, while symbols have a figurative meaning in an implicit context of metaphor. A question of principle--how does what we read mean?--and a question of practice--how can reading be made meaningful?--may be posed. Perhaps the teaching of reading comes down to making reading more interesting and less tough. Two half-truths about meaning should be dispelled: that text has a single meaning and, at the opposite extreme, that a text means anything any reader wants to claim. In fact, meaning is not \"in\"  anything because it is not a thing but a happening or process. To make reading meaningful, teachers can involve readers in decisions about text, after facilitating the connections on which meaning is built by asking questions. Their questions should be designed to elicit divergent and creative thinking and to build the curiosity and interest that might make reading more interesting and less tough. (Illustrative discussion questions are posed about a familiar nursery rhyme.) (GT)",

Two subtests were constructed from subsets of items that were identified by their extreme ratings. Subtest A was judged to require classification operations from respondents; subtest B was judged not to require them. Twenty-two third grade students were assessed on five Piagetian classification tasks and designated as classifiers, transitional, or nonclassifiers on the basis of this assessment. The subjects were then administered subtest A and subtest B. Analysis of covariance of the subtest A scores (effects of subtest B controlled) revealed a significant effect for group placement. The results  were interpreted to mean that reading test performance is partially influenced by the student's mastery of hierarchical classification because some test items require this ability. Such items discriminate among children on the basis of developmental maturity rather than on instruction-related knowledge. (Author)",

The study focused on children's use of intensional and extensional information in the acquisition of basic and superordinate categories. The intension of a concept is its definition or set of defining attributes; its extension is the set of all exemplars. The children completed a concept training task using natural categories assigned into basic and superordinate levels. Each child was trained on two categories at the same level, one through extensional information alone and one through combined extensional and intensional information. After training on both categories, each child participated in two successive tests for each category: a discrimination test that measured learning in  terms of the child's ability to identify old training exemplars as positive, to generalize to new exemplars, and to discriminate between exemplars and distractors; and a sorting exercise that required the children to sort a series of pictures used in the training task into groups of positive exemplars and nonexemplars. The results indicated that the children acquired basic level categories more easily than superordinate categories, that intensional information benefited the acquisition of categories only at the superordinate level, and that children's ability to take advantage of the intensional information for their acquisition of superordinate categories developed with age.

It is of current interest because literary critics have moved toward linguistics and linguists have moved toward texts and the two groups have met on common ground. Also, interest in text analysis is related to the rise of knowledge about hermeneutics--the rules, methods, and theory governing exegesis. There are several approaches to text analysis including cotext, pretext, intention, and context, each of which is related to the types of knowledge one needs to read a text. Text analysis can help composition  teachers because it affords the possibility of giving conscious control of the text to students by providing them with descriptions of texts that are more complete and more accurate than those presently available. It also can help heighten students' awareness of the differences between a spoken text and a written one. The greatest contribution of text analysis may be political--it may unite people from different disciplines around an interest in texts and what text-building is in different disciplines. (TJ)",

The behavior survey asked teachers to tell what they did in their classes. Also, teachers were asked to grade a sample student essay as they would any paper in their courses. It was found that most faculty members saw composition instruction as the task of the entire college; English faculty members required more papers than others, although a majority of courses included  writing assignments; and most faculty members commented on the content of student writing as well as on the form.

This accusation was not made about Canadian coverage, with one major exception, and Canadian tourism to Jamaica increased during those years while U.S. tourism fell off considerably. A study was conducted with the hypothesis that coverage of Jamaica by the Canadian press was more positive than that of the U.S. press and that coverage of social change was less often presented in a cold war context in the Canadian press. An analysis of six daily newspapers in the U.S. and three in Canada showed that negative coverage in the two countries was about the same but that U.S.  coverage did tend to emphasize the cold war context more than the Canadian coverage did. In addition, interviews with travel agents in both countries revealed that Canadian travel agents discounted negative news much more than their U.S. counterparts. It is suggested that media coverage had less effect on tourism than did the mediated influence of travel agents. (TJ)",

        "description":"Since 1939, legal recognition of the public forum concept has been gradually extended to include the public schools. This expansion of the free speech right has been accompanied by a movement of similar intensity aimed at narrowing the scope of regulatory action that might inhibit First Amendment freedoms. Ultimately, recognition of the public school as a public forum was coupled with the narrowed scope of allowable regulatory action. The result has been a philosophical revolution in which the student press, once conceived as an educational tool fully controlled by school authorities, is now seen as enjoying the same freedom from regulation afforded any other speech activity in a public forum. While this philosophy has not been universally accepted as yet, it has been recognized  by all levels of federal courts and several state courts. The implication of these developments is that students who edit, produce, or distribute literature on school grounds are subject to regulatory action that is consistent with First Amendment public forum policy as defined by time, place, and manner of distribution restrictions. Additionally, material shown to have caused substantial interference with educational processes is not protected. Censorship based on content alone, however, is no longer seen as being compatible with the functions of the student press. (Author/FL)",

While excellence is sought and revered, it is often made to serve ulterior ends such as higher pay, higher scores on tests, or higher grades-an intrusion shifts the focus from excellence to something else. In education, excellence has come to be judged on an industrial model of efficiency and products that has distorted the educational process. The subject of English has been reduced from the deep, mysterious, and panoramic miracles of speech and literature to drill exercises on spelling, punctuation, and grammar. These latter tasks could be taught as  well by computers as by human teachers, and using such aids might allow teachers to stop the suffocating lock-step at which students presently go through the educational system. Through excellent teaching of English, teachers may help students come to intellectual and ethical excellence along with developing knowledge, skills, and values to help them achieve the best of which they are capable.

        "description":"Remedial writers tend to be students who have never written very much, who come from families or neighborhoods in which more than one language may be spoken, and who have sensed their problems but have been unable or unwilling to do much to alleviate the difficulties. Unfortunately, the environment and attitudes of many college remedial programs often represent only one more cage for many of these students. Because little stature is given to individuals who work in remedial programs, many tend to be staffed by unqualified personnel. This situation can lead to serious attitude problems that inhibit students' progress. Structure is another major cause of the failure of remedial writing programs: they lack flexibility, clearly defined goals, and materials that are matched with the  learners. Another concern is what happens to remedial writers when they leave a basic writing program. The supportive atmosphere of such a program may lull them into thinking they will receive special treatment everywhere. They also tend to have poor reading skills, and the process of catching up is slow and painful for them. Some suggestions for improving basic writing courses include developing better teacher training, educating the public about the need for staff and materials, working with publishers to get better materials, and continuing to investigate better ways to teach remedial writing students.

        "description":"The cognitive/developmental theories of Jean Piaget and John Dewey assert that people learn by doing and that they grow intellectually by tackling demanding problems. It is this active, problem-solving orientation that is central to a cognitive/developmental approach to composition teaching. Six core principles can serve as guides for composition teachers who want to apply the approach to their classrooms. The key is to provide holistic writing tasks with genuine aims and audiences in mind. The second principle is to emphasize writing as a process without making the process sound too easy or simplistic. Third, composition classes should facilitate social interaction, reflecting the real purpose of writing--correspondence, collaboration, and communication. The fourth principle for  teachers to follow is to recognize the importance of student attitudes; and the goals of this principle are to eliminate apprehension about writing and to get students to willingly invest their energies in composing. Fifth, teachers should extend student language facility, using such teaching techniques as free writing and sentence combining. Finally, teachers need to deal forthrightly with student writing errors, helping students learn from their mistakes. (RL)",

The articles discuss censorship from a variety of perspectives that include: reasons why censorship is on the rise at this time; the historical, social, educational, and human dimensions of censorship; the risks and chance element involved in taking censorship issues to court; and the characteristic rhetoric of censorship and anticensorship groups. The articles that present ways to deal with censorship suggest such approaches  as preparing a model policy and rules for selecting instructional materials and preventing censorship crises by preparing detailed written policies and rationales and by communicating with parents. The book also includes a bibliography of books, journals, and pamphlets on censorship and on procedures for establishing policies for material selection. (MAI)",

The handbook also describes the process for &quot;Defense Day,&quot; an activity that is integral to the seminar, and suggests ways that the teaching methods might be adapted  to other authors and their works.

A critical analysis of representative articles determined that they represented significant criticism as defined in Theodore Peterson's &quot;The Social Responsibility Theory of the Press.&quot; It was found that city magazines have adopted media criticism as a standard editorial practice, that most articles were published by the magazines in the largest cities, that most were about the print media, that most concerned local media performance and power, and that magazines in the Northeast and Far West were the most diligent media watchdogs. Common criticisms  were that newspapers are inaccurate, sensational, and without substance; that they boost and protect &quot;sacred cows&quot; rather than criticize; that they ignore problems and issues out of self-interest; and that they allow advertising and class pressures to influence the news.

Respondents in each of the samples were administered the same set of 11 bipolar adjective scales. Evaluations of the first magazine, &quot;Horizons,&quot; were gathered in Venezuela and in the Philippines, which allowed for the assessment of cross-cultural patterns in the evaluations. Evaluations of the second and third magazines, &quot;Topic&quot; and &quot;Interlink,&quot; were obtained from two matched samples in Nigeria, allowing cross-magazine comparisons within a single country. A  discriminant analysis using the 11 evaluation scales as the discriminating variables was carried out for each of the four data sets to identify the linear combination of the evaluation scales that would maximally discriminate between regular and occasional readers. A large number of attributes did not discriminate between regular and occasional readers in any of the studies. Only three attributes--impartiality, accuracy, and visual attractiveness--were present in at least three of the four derived functions. Although statistically significant, these functions were able to improve prediction of readership only 14% to 17% above chance in a classification analysis. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"The nature and scope of eighteenth century rhetoric were defined by three dominant taxonomies of knowledge. In the oldest taxonomy, which clung to the liberal arts tradition, rhetoric was seen as a means of achieving social dominance, and its distinctive characteristic was the exercise of control through persuasion. Treatises representing this point of view comprehensively reviewed the accumulated lore of rhetorical devices in search of persuasive devices. The second ordering of knowledge followed a Baconian structure and reflected the division of mental faculties employed in generating, recording, and transmitting knowledge. Within this structure, rhetoric was seen as the art of adornment within the broader organ of transmission. The works of many theorists show how this  conception led to an emphasis on vivid description and imagery and to an expansion of the scope of rhetoric to include nonpersuasive discourse. In the final pattern, eloquence was defined as a fine art and rhetoric was associated with a number of plastic arts. Theorists from this school agreed that the essential characteristic of the fine arts, and of rhetoric, was the expression of ideas. In practical treatises on rhetoric, the emphasis on expression was associated with a declining interest in the instrumentality of rhetorical discourse and in a growth of interest in delivery and the &quot;elocutionary movement.&quot; (GT)",

The paper concludes that the construction of significant theories on television aesthetics, insofar as viewers' perception, interpretation, and response are concerned, should be based on empirical research that relates scientific findings (studies on visual perception, neurology, and physiology)  with subjective interpretations (studies on visual communication and art composition). Such research, it contends, will bridge the gap between factual information and intuitive choices and will enhance the field of visual communication. (Author)",

        "description":"Rather than simply recreating a real or imagined event or experience for entertainment purposes, the wisdom stories of the American Indians were sophisticated teaching devices that kept alive the history and traditions of the tribe at the same time that they instructed the young tribe members in the areas of history, geography, nature study, and ethics. Centuries old, these stories were passed by word of mouth from generation to generation and their telling was entrusted to persons who were highly respected within the tribe. Each story was constructed so as to stimulate inductive and deductive thinking by providing alternate viewpoints and by challenging the listener to formulate individual conclusions. Some of the concepts and principles that are found consistently in Indian  wisdom literature include the following: an Indian is a human being capable of good and bad behavior, who lives according to the traditions of the fathers; the word \"different\" does not involve a value judgment; decision making is a human function and the only wrong decisions are choices never made; everything is alive and has a spirit, even rocks and trees; and power is the capacity to overcome human weakness without physical dominance, rather than the ability to rule others.

        "description":"A total of 79 college students participated in an investigation designed to clarify the function of conversational closings. Multidimensional scaling was used to derive a three-dimensional representation of the semantic meaning conveyed by 20 frequently used conversational closings. Regression analyses of the scaling solution suggested that the dimensions could be interpreted as reflecting the degree of inaccessibility, the degree of social distance between partners, and the degree of the support for the relationship signalled by the terminals. The results indicated that the semantic meaning of closing terminals would allow them to serve two functions: signalling inaccessibility and signalling support for the relationship. The obliqueness of the dimensions suggests that a  terminal might simultaneously fulfill more than one function and that the functions are not independent. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"A model of need gratification inspired by the work of K.E. Rosengren suggests a theoretical framework making it possible to identify, measure, and assess the components of the need gratification process with respect to the mass media. Methods having cognitive and behavioral components are designed by individuals to achieve need gratification. Deep gratification occurs when the behavioral act meets the intrinsic requirements of the method and when the method gratifies the need. Thus, if a mother perceives that being a \"good mother\" includes regulating a child's television viewing experience, she may gain satisfaction from regulation when the act meets the requirements of the method and the method reduces the disequilibrium (the need to feel like a good mother) that energized the  drive. Differences between the Rosengren model and this one are: this model includes \"drive\" as the physical force; this model sees \"society\" and \"individual characteristics\" as influences too prohibitive to come within the limited scope of the model; and in this model, the organism is understood to assess the utility of each method, and judgments about the success or nonsuccess of method employment precede the experience of felt gratification or nongratification.

The role of the parliamentarian is entirely advisory. This person should work closely with the presiding officer, be available to members and committees for consulting, and give opinions only when called upon or to correct serious errors in the proceedings. Typical problems facing parliamentarians are: maintaining objectivity while being full members of the assembly they advise, lack of knowledge of the rules of order on the part of members and presiding officers, their overreliance on the parliamentarian, and the directing of nonparliamentary questions to the parliamentarian. Problems can be overcome by providing the parliamentarian with all  necessary documents pertaining to the assembly's business, through consultation between the presiding officer and the parliamentarian before a meeting, by providing consultation to committees and members in preparing reports or motions, and by being prepared to play an educative role for members and officers.

The audit process is one intervention that fits an action research model of organizational development and accomplishes the following: measures information flow, message content, and communicator attitudes; provides attitudinal, perceptual, and behavioral data; and allows for organizational comparisons. Follow-up  should assure that management is held accountable for action taken to increase the effectiveness of the organization and should include training others to use some of the consultant's skills.

The researchers collected about 80 studies that yielded over 700 comparisons of the achievement of smaller and larger classes. The results showed that as class size increases, achievement decreases. For example, the difference in being taught in a class of 20 versus a class of 40 shows an advantage of 6 percentile ranks. The relationship between class size and achievement is slightly stronger at the secondary level, but it does not differ appreciably across different school subjects, levels of pupil IQ, or several other demographic features of classrooms. The report suggests that  schools cannot afford the consequences of maintaining large classes all the time and must find ways to finance smaller classes for some pupils or for all pupils for part of the school day.

This report briefly describes how the MITT staff handled a problem in the companion study of reducing the number of predictor variables while still retaining as much information as possible about all of them. They did so by using multiple linear regression to combine conceptually related variables into clusters or blocks. Once the researchers had identified a group of variables that logically comprised a cluster, they regressed the most logical dependent variable in the group (if that were possible to determine) into the others. For each school, they  multiplied the resulting raw score regression weights times the obtained score on their respective variables to produce a predicted dependent variable score; conceptually, such a predicted score reflects all the information shared among the variables in the block.

The history of the ESA is outlined, and studies of the education service agency in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and other states are examined. These studies lead to specific recommendations regarding generally appropriate roles and functions. Roles and functions for the ESA in dissemination evolve from recent federal legislation focusing on  research relative to educational change, broker/facilitator roles, nature of the educational enterprise, state and national dissemination agencies, and educational renewal and reform. A number of specific conclusions and recommendations relevant to the ESA and RDx are offered: no nationwide single-agency system or configuation for dissemination can adequately respond to all education needs; the professional community must support comprehensive research and development evaluation studies about regionalism; and the RDx configuration needs more client user input at all levels of planning, management, and stages of development.

        "author":["Dembowski, Frederick L."],
        "description":"Banks are usually reimbursed for their checking account services either by a fixed service charge or by requiring a minimum or minimum-average compensating cash balance. This paper demonstrates how to determine the optimal minimum balance for a school district to maintain in its account. It is assumed that both the bank and the school district use the Miller-Orr cash management model and that not maintaining a minimum compensating cash balance will result in charges for approximately 99 overdrafts a year. Calculations presented for a sample school district indicate that the district should not maintain a minimum compensating cash balance but should negotiate an annual fee to compensate the bank and invest the funds that previously constituted the cash balance. The paper concludes  that the use of negotiated bank charges, short-term lines of credit, zero minimum checking balances, and investment of cash balances in short-term investments could result in thousands of additional dollars for school districts.

        "description":"This report evaluates alternative approaches to and measures of equity in state school finance plans. It also evaluates the Federal Expenditure Disparity Measure (FEDM). Following an introduction, Part II describes alternative conceptions of equity in education and identifies three components of these conceptions: groups treated, alternative treatments, and criteria for equity. Part III presents numerical models that show how alternative combinations of group, treatment, and criterion can yield different conclusions when applied to a hypothetical school district. In Part IV, the value judgments that underly the alternative conceptions of equity are examined. Since few value judgments are widely held, a number of equity conceptions must be considered valid. Also in Part IV, the  value judgments inherent in Per Pupil Expenditure Disparity Measures (PPEDMs) are reviewed and analyzed. In Part V, the theory behind the FEDM and the way the Office of Education applies the FEDM to calculate measures from state data are discussed. In Part VI, recommendations concerning equity measurement in federal regulations and particular procedures used by the Office of Education to measure expenditure disparities are presented. A lengthy appendix considers social welfare theory, social choice theory, equity measures calculations, and the tax price of education. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Community school centers have evolved from many experiments in interagency cooperation and community involvement. A community school center is a place that provides a variety of services that may include health, recreation, day care and after school care for the young, senior citizen programs, job placement, vocational and manpower training, public library, adult education, performing and creative arts, crafts, family and youth counseling, municipal services, and public K-12 education. It is also a forum for focusing community action and improving the quality of life for the residents. This booklet is the first in a series that examines community school centers as a phenomenon of national importance to the coordinated delivery of social services, better use of public resources,  and revitalization of community life. The publication is organized as a series of responses to questions about characteristics of centers, how the coordinated services work, shared space, governance, financing, planning, examples of existing centers, declining enrollments, assessing community needs, and how to get started in planning a community school center.

The 112 comprehensive high schools in Georgia offer a combination of vocational and traditional academic programs. This report focuses on the input, process, and output of the comprehensive school system. Questionnaires were distributed and interviews conducted with principals, faculty, and students in vocational programs. Highlights of the findings showed that a majority of the students intend to pursue postsecondary training; vocational instructors have the most influence on students' selection of programs, jobs, and postsecondary training; graduates feel vocational programs prepare them slightly better than academic  programs; and employers favor graduates of comprehensive high schools over those from strictly academic high schools. Recommendations are offered for guiding the future development of the comprehensive high school system in Georgia. (Author/LD)",

The research approach used was reputational analysis, a survey method whereby the reputed influence of leaders is measured rather than taken for granted. Also used was a technique developed by Bonjean and Noland to identify visible, concealed, and symbolic leaders in the community. Findings showed that those who influence curriculum decision-making in the local community do no work overtly. Their power is in the minds of others who, for unknown reasons, allow themselves to be influenced. The study offers two warnings about reputational analysis. First, when school officials use this method to communicate with community leaders,  serious legal, political, and democratic-ethical problems are raised. Second, this method weighs reputations more heavily than actions so that its very use results in the discovery of elitism and hierarchy. (Author/LD)",

It is argued that the role of higher-order levels of linguistic analysis in speech perception can be productively studied. Theoretical issues appropriate for such study are outlined; the discussion centers on fusion phenomena occurring in speech perception, i.e. when the simultaneous presentation of two or more disparate stimuli causes an observer to perceive some third stimulus different from either of those actually presented. Pilot research confirming the existence of phonological process fusions is reported; these are suggested by existing fusion phenomena, but have not been previously  observed. Among the general conclusions is the view that the speech perception system can exploit specifically phonological knowledge and that lexical knowledge appears to play some role in speech perception.

        "description":"Although educational psychologists are concerned with the acquisition of knowledge, particularly in the classroom, language acquisition and knowledge of language are areas slighted in their textbooks. Integration of developmental psycholinguistics into educational psychology courses should employ the recently emerging rationalist view rather than the older empiricist view. The rationalist view suggests that the human mind contains preconceptions about the nature of language, enabling persons to implicitly determine the linguistic rules of their community. This position has three major implications for teaching: (1) language differences among children do not reflect differences in cognitive ability, but rather differences in the speaker-hearer community; (2) individual differences  in children's linguistic performance in classroom settings should be distinguished from their linguistic competence, and each aspect should be dealt with accordingly; and (3) teachers who have an understanding of language acquisition and knowledge can provide experiences that develop the child's metalinguistic awareness. Several practical methods for implementing each of these three aspects of psycholinguistics in the classroom are discussed. Suggested source materials and annotated bibliographies for student and instructor are appended. (Author/MHP)",

Literature on communicative competence is reviewed and the implications for foreign language instruction are discussed. It is shown that: (1) from the very beginning of language instruction, the classroom setting, exercises, language activities, and tests should lead toward the objective of attainment of communicative competence; and (2) teaching methods must take into consideration sociolinguistic factors. In this context, an English teaching situation in Polish secondary schools is described and its inadequacies, especially in the area of grammar instruction, are indicated. It is noted that the teaching techniques used do not lead to a functional  knowledge of grammar and so do not result in the development of communication skills. Therefore, a description is provided of a sequence of exercises consisting of four phases that aim at a functional mastery of a grammatical item. In connection with grammar exercises the problems of error correction and testing are dealt with. Finally it is observed that the teacher's most important task is to get students to talk and that this objective must be central in all classroom activities. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on language diversity in Chicano speech communities in the United States and its relation to the teaching of Spanish to Chicano bilinguals. Attempts to teach standard Spanish to Spanish-speakers in the United States have been unsuccessful for the most part, because the schools recognize only a single standard of \"correctness\" that is not always the same as that used in the communities. Attempts to teach Spanish as a mother tongue to Chicano students are reviewed, and the need to establish guidelines for the evaluation of current positions and programs is addressed. The sociopolitical, socioeconomic, and educational experiences of Chicanos are reviewed based on an assessment of the present sociolinguistic situation of Chicanos. This situation consists of a  language repertoire with various codes that depart from the Mexican Spanish linguistic tradition, an asymmetrical type of bilingualism, and the use of Spanish viewed as transitional and not valued in the broader society. It is concluded that collaboration between sociolinguists and language instructors is needed since Spanish language instruction for Chicano bilinguals is not equivalent to instruction in a first language.

In addition to proper names, there are two major types of address forms in general usage: the traditional respect forms, such as \"ma'am\" and \"sir,\" and the so-called terms of endearment. A third possibility is that people may avoid using any address form at all. It was found that two of the three major address types occurring in service encounters can be and are used in absolutely parallel fashion to men and women. The use of the third address type, terms of endearment, in a non-reciprocal pattern paralleling its use by adults to children, carries the implication that the addressee is in some  way subordinate to the speaker. Cases were found in which women were addressed by these intimate forms while men were not, but the opposite was not found. (SW)",

        "description":"The rise of American English as the medium for exhange of scientific and technical information worldwide is a linguistic phenomenon. For some time, applied linguists in Britain have provided texts to meet the demand for English for special purposes and English for science and technology. Their works use a British form of language and cover British applications. Lately, American educators also have entered these fields. Typically, they cover the terms and concepts of a particular profession or trade like engineering or the use of hand tools, and they show model forms of technical communication, including resumes, letters, and reports. Technical English, American style, however, is not essentially professional jargon or simply standard English applied to special purposes. It is a  distinct variety of American English with definable semantic features, morphology, and syntax. Its lexicon is delimited, and its phonology is characterized by low-level American phonetic rules. Along with the English writing system, it relies heavily on pictorial representation; and its rhetoric, strongly deductive, has distinguishable characteristics. Precise descriptions, like those provided here, may be useful as an aid in developing and implementing instructional materials in technical English. (Author/AMH)",

The first essay explores the larger opportunities that part-time studies provide for access, the clientele, and the impact of such studies on higher education institutions, within the context of postsecondary education in Ontario. In this essay, concern is limited to part-time undergraduate study for degree credit. The second essay looks at the post-1945 expansion of higher education in Great Britain, concentrating on the last fifteen years. The objectives are to  chart the nature and causes of the expansion, to examine how increased access has affected and been affected by government policy, to determine whether the expansion in numbers has led to a greater equality of opportunity, and to look for indications of future developments in this area. The third essay describes the recent reorganization of the Swedish system of colleges and universities, the latest step in an overall reform of education in that country.

        "description":"Some findings about attrition from two- and four-year colleges and universities are presented based on NCES's National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. Attrition is generally defined as withdrawal from college without completing a degree; in this report, students who had attended courses in the first two years after high school but did not attend in fall 1974 are defined as withdrawn unless they had completed a two-year program. It is shown that after two years, the four-year institutions lost 23.5 percent of their entrants, which is a lower rate than most earlier studies reported, with estimates ranging from 21 to 46 percent. (However, the figures are not strictly comparable, since other studies usually measure attrition four years after entering college.)  Among two-year college students, 39.3 percent withdrew without completing a degree, so two-year colleges clearly lost more students than four-year institutions did. Private schools and schools with higher than average test scores for entering students had lower attrition rates. The majority of students who worked full-time withdrew at nearly double the rate of those with a part-time job or no job at all. (Author/LBH)",

        "description":"The Evergreen State College, Washington's newest four-year college, was established in the midst of an unprecedented enrollment expansion. It also responded to contemporary calls for reform in higher education. Two conditions, the recent lack of growth in higher education and a subsiding of enthusiasm for nontraditional higher education, have created problems for the college. In 1977 the state legislature called for a study and recommendations on the curriculum and costs of the college, in order to broaden its clientele and reduce total operating costs, which are relatively high, to the level of the state's regional universities. The response to that request is organized in seven parts. The first describes the series of decisions leading to the establishment, location, size, and  style of the college, and the second examines the pertinent demographics. The third examines cost and identifies the enrollment level at which it is believed Evergreen's unit costs will become comparable with those of the regional universities. The fourth part describes the curriculum and the changes since its establishment, and includes findings of the two major peer reviews it has undergone. The fifth part reports on &quot;client&quot; evaluations, and the sixth reviews national trends in nontraditional education. The final chapter summarizes the findings and presents recommendations.

VEAP is a pilot program designed to promote and assist the all-volunteer armed forces program in attracting qualified persons to serve by offering educational assistance. Several factors that appear to have limited participation in the program include: failure of the cognizant agencies to develop comprehensive program guidelines in a timely manner, variances and inaccuracies in program information provided to recruits, the timing and sequence of VEAP briefings within certain services, and a low opinion of VEAP that appears to be held by some of the personnel responsible for program implementation at the installation level.  Questionnaires were administered to an arbitrarily chosen sample of recruits eligible to participate in the program at nine reception stations and training centers to determine current enrollment rates, compare enrollees with nonenrollees, and determine why recruits were electing not to participate. Out of the 2,534 respondents, 512 or about 20 percent had enrolled in the program. Reasons for nonparticipation are presented. Information on the efforts of each of the military services is presented, and recommendations are offered to the Administrator of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense to improve the VEAP.

Key elements of this project, which is funded through the Women's Educational Equity Act, are: a course designed to provide engineering and career information and practical experience; a means of evaluating the methods and results; wide dissemination of all useful information generated by the experimental course; and the collection of information relevant to programs for women in engineering. The program includes lecture-discussions of contemporary problems in the field by role-model lecturers; career-planning and counseling session; and &quot;hands-on&quot; laboratory experiences broadly related to the field of engineering. The first experimental course was evaluated by pre-testing and  post-testing with standardized tests and specially-constructed surveys relating to educational goals and self-concepts of students. The pilot course was revised and offered again as a set of three modules to provide more flexibility to meet student needs. Test results for both years (1977 and 1978) are included. Information dissemination about the program has included a slide-tape set about the model program and experimental course; conference papers; professional journal articles; an Associated Press news story; and public service television spots. A brief annotated bibliography focusing on pre-college backgrounds and college and post-college development of women in engineering is presented, and comments from two students are included. (SW)",

Three distinct trends contributing to the changing characteristics of college students are: the decline of 18-year-olds in the population, the rising proportion of new students in the college population, and the increase in adult part-time learners. New students have resulted from equal opportunity and the expansion of open admissions community colleges. These trends will affect colleges differentially, depending on whether they serve national or local clientele, whether they are located in areas of declining or growing population, and what kinds of students they attract or are prepared to attract.  Factors that can be considered in projecting college enrollments are demographic trends and the type of college. Demographic trends behind the adult education movement and characteristics of adult learners are described. The analysis also considers: how the labor market will affect education, differences between actual learners and those who say they are interested in education but who are not currently participating, advantages that would result from funding education information centers, characteristics of the new students, and the lack of federal effort to acknowledge the social desirability of lifelong learning and adult education.

The 161 upper division undergraduates rated each of three specific grades on 20 semantic differential items. Two descriptive questions were answered: (1) What are the basic dimensions of the connotative meanings of grades? (2) How does the continuum of connotative meanings (as measured by \"semantic distances\" between adjacent grades) compare to the quantitative continuum that grades are assumed to represent? Factor analysis identified four factors: evaluation, realism, complexity, and salience. Comparison of the continuum of connotative meaning and the quantitative continuum revealed discontinuities. Findings are discussed in relation to the general theoretical  assumption that grades have meaning to the extent that they initiate in the student an internal process which mediates the intended value judgment of the teacher regarding the performance of the student as a learner.

Trends based on earlier surveys on the same topic are analyzed. Department heads were also asked to estimate the number of faculty they expected to hire for 1978-79. The survey was limited to colleges and universities that award the Ph.D. degree, and inquiries were directed to departments in 16 science and engineering fields. Usable responses were recieved from 203 of 235 institutions and 1,366 of 1,684 departments. National estimates were derived from survey responses by a weighting procedure. Results of  the survey were weighted to cover 1,809 doctorate-level departments at 288 institutions. In 1977-78, 24 percent of the full-time doctoral faculty of these departments were defined as young. The data show that the proportion of young doctorates in science and engineering departments continues a pattern of decline evident in three previous surveys going back to 1968. On the average the young faculty members submit research proposals with greater frequency than do the senior faculty, and they are only slightly less successful than their senior colleagues in obtaining funds for the research proposals. Statistical data and a sample survey are presented. (SW)",

Identifying the elements of competence involves an analysis of: physicians' activities through self-reports, observation, and task analysis; analysis of critical incidents and expert judgment; and analysis of health care needs based on public health statistics, medical records, and social, economic, and political realities. A model is presented to evaluate professional performance through  consideration of the client, the problem, and the setting.

With much of the research component completed, the service component is operational, providing Ontario educators with online bibliographic references in education and the social sciences and with access to original documents. Findings of the report are reviewed in four areas: (1) It identifies EISO users over the past three years, presents their reasons for seeking information, provides analyses of how information they received impacted upon their local situations, and identifies factors that contributed to the use or non-use of information received. (2) It describes factors  affecting interview effectiveness in online bibliographic retrieval, outlines a 5-stage pattern or structure in negotiation, discusses the use of open and closed questions and the part role and status play in interview relationships, and develops a preliminary model of the negotiation process. (3) It discusses a systems evaluation model of user satisfaction with EISO. (4) And it reviews the current status of EISO--the result of research, development, dissemination, and evaluation. (JD)",

        "description":"A library survey to examine and analyze locally generated title derivative keyword indexing in academic and public libraries and its findings are presented. The project was organized in two phases. The first attempted to identify successful title derivative indexing programs through a literature review, correspondence with individuals known to be working with such systems, and through notices placed in professional library journals. Phase two involved study of 10 derivative indexing programs chosen to represent those institutions working with a variety of applications, those using the technique for a unique application, and those with unique computer programs. Findings indicate that title derivative indexing was prompted by failure of the local institution to provide adequate  bibliographic control of the collection in question because of high acquisition rates, and long length of processing time between receipt of materials and availability to patrons. The keyword-out-of-context as opposed to keyword-in-context technique was most utilized. Problems with KWOC Title derivative indexing include inadequacy of some titles, and use of a variety of terms to describe common subjects. Non-word lists--e.g., articles, prepositions--were also employed to exclude non-descriptive terms. Index structure and format are described, along with discussions of costs, computer programs, user acceptance, and advantages and disadvantages. Appendices include a list of institutions utilizing title derivative indexing. (Author/MBR)",

        "description":"This study examined the patterns of ongoing play manifested over a year's time by 141 three- and four-year-old boys and girls at nursery schools and daycare centers. The relationships between such play and concurrent language usage and the child's patterns of television viewing at home were examined during this period. Parents of the children were also randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups or to a control group. Intervention groups received training either in stimulating the children's imaginative play, stimulating the child's cognitive and language development, or in controlling the child's television-viewing frequency and encouraging more discriminating use of the set. The control group merely kept logs of children's viewing as did the other parents. Based on  this research, eight recommendations were made. Family interview data relating to home organization, daily routines, patterns of discipline, parental aggressive behavior, and traumatic events or stress, suggest that the laxity of control over TV viewing and a general lack of alternative interests by the family may expose children to greater influence by the TV programming and yield the danger of more initiative aggressive or hyperactive behavior.

With regard to short-range computer aspects, it is determined that the more systems the computer-based materials can run on, the less interesting pedagogically the materials are. Major problems regarding short-range innovative teaching aspects are political and sociological or involve instructors learning whether available materials are suitable for their course and reliable. Due to  the changing computer technology, when we consider the long-range point of view, no computer aspects of transferability are important. However, the long-range view of innovative learning aspects poses problems with the marketing of future materials, the development of new materials based on the existence of the computer, and new modes of education.

        "description":"This study describes the development of an innovative instructional technique, peculiar to television, that presents information in a dramatic form through televised skits. Primary concerns of the project were the measurement of student attitudes toward receiving instructional television material in skit form, the measurement of the amount of learning that occurred as a result of viewing the skit-lectures, and the development of a systematic approach for producing the televised lessons. Two expository lectures comprising all instructional information delivered by the television teacher, each containing two segments of 33 to 35 minutes, were produced as the control lessons. Identical lectures, each containing six or seven 2 to 5 minute skits, were produced as the experimental  lessons. A survey solicited student attitudes toward receiving information in skit form, and four 10-question multiple-choice tests were constructed to measure learning. The attitude survey indicated that students had a positive attitude toward learning from skits, that they found them enjoyable, and that the skit content was easy to learn. T-test data showed that students learned as much from the skit-lectures as they did from the expository-lectures. (Author/RAO)",

An examination of microcomputers as a solution to library problems focuses on hardware and peripherals, including mass storage devices and man/machine interface devices. Systems software is discussed, with emphasis on program development aids, file management programs, operating systems, and applications. Criteria for system selection are identified, and library applications in the areas of acquisitions,  cataloging, serials, circulation, interlibrary loan, reference and information services, and administration are explored. Based on these applications and requirements for space and personnel, guidelines are given for system selection and evaluation. The roles of the library, agency, federal government, and private sector in the application of minicomputers are discussed, as well as future trends.

A review and analysis of statistical data supplied by the 4-year institutions and community college system in the areas of staffing, collections, usage, acquisitions, and institution size, provides the basis for the recommendation that the library resources portion of the formula be stated in terms of number of acquisitions per year, based on mathematically determined relationships of acquisitions to collection size derived from the experience of comparison institutions and states. These acquisition units would then be converted into dollar amounts based on each  institution's experienced unit costs adjusted for inflation. Questions were raised regarding staff years, branch libraries, and the standard dollar amounts for staff years and binding. These questions were primarily related to the interpretation of the recommendations and accompanying definitions and guidelines contained in the council's final report. As a consequence, slight modifications to three recommendations, more explicit guidelines, and specific examples of interpretations of recommendations have been added to the \"Operations Element\" section of the report.

        "description":"This report of a study of the state of networking in school library media programs nationwide and the role of such programs in the National Program for Libraries and Information Services covers the rationale for inclusion of these programs in library networks, contributions of such programs to a national program, the benefits to the users of participating in networks, and problems and recommendations regarding participation in networks by these programs. This study was carried out by the Task Force on the Role of the School Library Media Program, appointed by the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) with assistance from the American Association of School Librarians (AASL). The task force was assisted in its work by two papers prepared for use by its  members--&quot;School Media Programs and Networking: A Position Paper&quot; by Mary Frances K. Johnson and Theodore Hines, and &quot;Networking and School Library Media Centers: A Position Paper&quot; by David V. Loertscher. Additional evidence was gathered at five open meetings attended by members of the profession, as well as by representatives of publishing companies, book distributors, cataloging services, the library press, and professional associations. Appendices include a list of task force members, examples of existing networks, and definitions. A bibliography is also provided. (JEG)",

        "description":"An approach is described for decreasing the costs and difficulties associated with providing adequate feedback to the student concerning his interpersonal performance when he performs operational tasks in simulated or actual job situations as part of his training. The computer is used to assist in the process of eliciting appropriate feedback from judges and providing this feedback to the student, both in coordination with videotaped recordings of the student's performance. Computer programs designed to help judges rate interpersonal performance along a variety of dimensions were developed and tested. Although these programs also are suitable for providing feedback to the student, formal tests of this aspect of the process were not conducted in this project. Several potential  benefits of the procedures for interpersonal skills training were demonstrated as a result of both the formal and informal tests of the system. (Author/JEG)",

        "description":"Research on incidental learning by children from television is both a cause and effect of the increasing attention being given by social and behavioral scientists to the influence of mass media. Laboratory-type experiments and data collected from everyday life are consistent in their findings, providing convincing evidence that television can influence the immediate behavior of children. When this altered behavior is carried over into social interaction, the foundation is established for more far-reaching influence. Television also has varied cognitive and attitudinal effects on children, e.g., it is their principal source of information on public affairs. Television designed to convey information can be quite effective, and entertainment programs occasionally provide  instruction, but their impact is sometimes limited by redundancy with one another. Commercials also instruct children by influencing preferences for the value placed upon products. Tastes and preferences in programming and time spent with the medium change along with individual interests and needs as young people grow older. The study of television's influence requires both laboratory-type experimentation and the collection of data from real life, the former to establish the possibility of causation and the latter to confirm the presence in real life of experimental findings.

        "description":"If colleges were to accept the mission of helping each student to learn as much and as well as possible, the organization of education would change. In that the three fundamental practices of education--classes, semesters, and grades--are counterproductive to the goal of maximizing student learning and exist only to meet administrative and fiscal requirements, they would no longer serve as the bases of education. Individualized instruction, such as that currently demonstrated in the computerized systems at Miami-Dade Community College, would free instructors to do those tasks which only humans can do--understanding individual learning problems and offering personal encouragement--and would force administrators to find new measures of learning productivity on the parts of both  student and teacher. The goal of maximum learning for individuals is best captured by the concept of mastery learning, which makes achievement a constant, and which has both cognitive and affective advantages. Another issue in this view of educational change is that of the adult, non-traditional student, who is more self-directed, more pragmatic, and more experienced than the younger student. Treating these adult students like adults would involve acknowledging their orientation toward competence improvement, and individualizing instruction and curriculum. (MB)",

        "description":"About 10% of the approximately 6,000 two-year college mathematics teachers were surveyed to assess their views on graduate training needs in their field. A profile of these teachers revealed that two-thirds were less than 45 years of age, all but 6% held masters degrees, 22% were women, and over 60% had high school teaching experience; typically they spent 16 hours per week in the classroom and an additional 15 hours per week on other professional activities. They expressed considerable interest in applied mathematics and felt their teaching background was least adequate in that area. They felt their outstanding problem to be teaching unmotivated students. In terms of desirable professional qualities, the teachers believed it to be essential to think of oneself primarily as a  teacher, to be able to move into new areas of teaching as the curriculum evolves, and to be willing to take on remedial courses. This can be contrasted with their perceptions of which activities were being rewarded by their colleges; these included administration, taking courses, and obtaining advanced degrees. Recommendations for the content of graduate programs included teaching internships, problem solving, and courses on methods for remedial mathematics. Continuing education interests included attending short courses and studying math applications to science and engineering. The survey instrument is included. (MB)",

        "description":"In fall 1978, Sacramento City College initiated the Higher Education Learning Package (HELP) to promote the success and retention of students with basic skill deficiencies while mainstreaming them into regular courses. Students work with instructors and tutors in small groups and on a one-to-one basis. Using an integrative team teaching approach, instruction builds on student experience, and progress is measured in terms of established competency criteria. Students commit themselves to a two-package one-year program, taking one package each semester. Package 1 consists of English (written communication skills), psychology (personal relations), mathematics (basic arithmetic), and developmental reading. Package 2 consists of speech (oral communication skills), social science  (American institutions), and human development (basic college skills such as note-taking and career planning). By the end of the year students should have completed 24 units towards an associate of arts degree. During the first year, attrition among the two groups of 39 and 45 students each was approximately 25% and 22% respectively. External factors, over which the college had no control, were responsible for many students leaving the program. Another factor influencing attrition was that many students entered the program with skills below the sixth grade level around which the program was designed. (MB)",

        "description":"Developmental studies programs are a reality in many colleges and universities, and where they do not now exist, the likelihood of their presence in the near future is high. Student developmental programs are a key ingredient within institutional resources to improve chances of success for students in developmental studies. Student development is not a student personnel program. It is a set of educational practices, grounded in developmental education theory, designed to marshal all available resources within an institution into a process which will produce a predictable result--self-sufficiency in students. Both developmental studies and student development programs should move from the penumbra of college curricula to the mainstream. Pivotal issues which bear upon the  probability of success in developmental studies include creating a condition of critical mass, the significance of residential settings, and the centrality of self-sufficiency in developmental education. Student development/developmental studies programs which can be adapted to specific campus environments and characteristics of the developmental studies program and its students include: (1) the Self-Assessment Laboratory, (2) the Life Planning Center, (3) the Curriculum Planning Laboratory, (4) the Human Development Curriculum, (5) an Interdivisional Counseling Network, and (6) the Environment Assessment Laboratory.

Approximately 65% of the administrators indicated that the MBO system did not change the amount of formal contact between superior and subordinate, though the administrators were generally pleased with the amount of change. In response to whether superiors encouraged suggestions during joint goal-setting meetings, 83% indicated that suggestions were encouraged. A slight majority perceived an increase in the amount of job responsibility following joint goal-setting meetings with their superiors. Similarly, 57% perceived an increased role in decisions within the  administrative unit. Though a slight majority (54%) indicated that MBO had contributed positively to communication within administrative units, negative effects on administrative communication were identified in relation to communications across division lines. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) MBO programs can increase formal contacts between superior and subordinate; (2) they encourage suggestions from subordinates and are likely to result in a higher percentage of suggestions being accepted by superiors; and (3) MBO can clarify the responsibility of the administrator and increase feelings of taking a greater part in decision making.

Teacher aides trained in storytelling techniques read a story to small groups of children each day. The subjects, randomly selected from two schools in the Title I Program and one school not eligible for Title I, responded to questions about three pictures. The children's responses were taped in the fall and again in the spring. An interviewer met with the children individually away from the classroon, showed each child each picture, and asked questions pertaining specifically to each of the three pictures. A comparative analysis of the responses and increases in  vocabulary of Title I and non-Title I children indicated that the average amount of gain for the Title I children was greater than the average amount of gain for the non-Title I children, even though overall, the non-Title I children had greater language fluency. These results indicated that telling stories had a beneficial effect on the Title I children and it was concluded that the program should be retained as an integral part of the language program.

        "description":"This study deals with three questions concerning the political socialization of young children: (1) at what age evidence of political socialization begins to emerge; (2) at what age media, principally television, begins to socialize children politically; and (3) how a Presidential election campaign and the media relate to other sources of political socialization such as schools, peers, and parents. Fifty-two 4- and 5-year-old preschool children were interviewed prior to the 1976 election campaign and on the day after the election in order to measure their awareness of candidates and others involved in the campaign. It was hypothesized that: (1) children's awareness of political candidates would increase significantly from pre- to post-campaign; (2) 5-year-olds would show  significantly more learning than 4-year-olds; and (3) that parents would be the most frequently mentioned source of political information. Results showed that 5-year-olds learned more than 4-year-olds; and that television was a more important source of political information about Jimmy Carter than parents for 5-year-olds, while parents and television were equally important as sources of information about President Ford. Results also indicated that females learned more than males and that Ford was better known than Carter at the start of the campaign but that children were more aware of Carter than Ford by the time the campaign was over.

        "description":"This research study examines the types of social behaviors portrayed by families in various television series and explores children's impressions of the TV family members. Content analysis of nine family-oriented TV series was employed to describe the ranges of behaviors of fathers, mothers and children on television. Eleven shows from each series was taped. Behaviors portrayed were coded as being either pro-social or anti-social. Survey data were collected from 388 children in second, fifth and eighth grades. Each child interviewed was asked to &quot;Describe a (character) so that someone would know what he was like and why he was like that&quot; in order to elicit children's impressions of father, mother and child characters from two series. Results of the analyses indicated that  depictions of families on television are fairly pro-social. Fathers' and children's behaviors were mixed, while mothers' behaviors were consistently pro-social. Children at all three ages fairly accurately perceived TV characters' behavior patterns. Both father and child characters were uniformly well liked by the children regardless of their behavior patterns, while mother characters were less well liked overall. It is suggested that future research should investigate how TV character portrayals might build children's expectations of how people should behave. (Author/RH)",

Subjects were 18 children attending a university preschool in Southwestern Ontario. Data for each child were collected in 1-minute daily observations for two 3-week periods, three months apart. Analysis of variance indicated that four activities changed in duration over time but preferred activities remained nearly identical. Cognitive dimensions of play with vehicles and blocks differed over time. Males played more with vehicles and sand and water, and spent less time in painting and art construction than females. Findings for sex  and types of play in a particular activity were stable over time. The degree of &quot;freedom&quot; in free play appears to be influenced by available materials. For instance, group and dramatic play may be inhibited by the availability of art activities, which appears to encourage non-social and constructive behaviors. Findings are seen to validate results of earlier studies on children's free play activities. Implications for educational programs and recommendations for further research are indicated.

The study was designed to test the assumption that the play of young children develops in a progressive manner. Ten 3-year-olds and ten 4-year-olds were observed during free play each day for four 3-week periods over 3 months. The coding of behavior was based on Parten's categories of social play (unoccupied, solitary, onlooker, parallel, group) and Smilanksy's categories of cognitive play (functional, constructive, dramatic, games with rules). Two additional categories included reading (or being read to) and active conversation. Children showed a decrease in the amount of time spent in unoccupied, onlooker,  solitary-functional, and all functional play, and an increase in the amounts of time spent in reading, games, parallel-dramatic, all group, and all dramatic play. Only the games with rules category showed a differential age-by-time interaction. Alternative explanations of the data are discussed. Data on age and sex differences are also reported.

Subjects were 24 children at each grade level. An additional aim was to see if such experience with taxonomic material would influence both the manner in which these subjects instructed first graders as well as the recall of these younger children. Some third and sixth graders were given alternating sort/recall trials with two sets of categorical items; other subjects received unrelated items. Following these trials, all children were given two sort/recall trials with unrelated materials. Each child then instructed a first grader concerning the memory task and the strategy he used.  Examination of the third and sixth graders' data indicated that experience with taxonomic materials improved third graders' recall, facilitated their use of organization, and enhanced their strategy communication in teaching the first grader. For the sixth graders, the experience did not affect their recall, but did increase the probability of their giving strategy information to the first grader. Exposure to categorical materials may occur in the classroom and may contribute to the acquisition of organizational strategies in the child's natural environment. (Author/RH)",

Forty nine field independent (24 girls, 26 boys) and 36 field dependent (19 girls, 17 boys) children in third grade were analyzed as they viewed either seven dynamic or seven static segments from the Children's Television Workshop program. It was hypothesized that both good readers and field independents would exhibit more sophisticated scanning strategies and that the dynamic mode of presentation would result in significant eye movement differences from those exhibited in the static mode. Regression analyses revealed that eye movements were rather stimulus specific. Supplantation of mental operation by the stimuli was also  an important consideration of this study. (Author/MP)",

A model of the nursery room was used to assess 37 preschoolers' recognition, recall, and spatial memory for school objects. Children were asked to verify their memories in order to determine verification strategies, and, following an opportunity to re-examine the criterion, memory was reassessed and performance compared to initial memory relative to these strategies. The results indicated that few children at first knew an objective way to verify but that after prompting most seemed aware of its utility. Although memory and verification scores were generally unrelated, spatial memory after  verification was positively and significantly correlated with measures of verification. The memory verification paradigm introduced appears useful for studying purposeful behavior in young children. (Author/MP)",

The 124 subjects dealt with each of those questions on three different tasks. Measures of achievement (crystallized ability), field dependency (FDI), locus of control, divergent thinking, concept identification, and the Category Width Test  were also employed. Results indicate that all true variance in the measures of formal thought is explained by these ability and personality measures.

        "description":"This paper reviews the literature concerned with the effect of various social systems (e.g., the family and the school) on the growth of social competence in the individual child and makes suggestions for further research. The discussion employs the contemporary view of socialization which emphasizes reciprocal causality (i.e., the reciprocal consequences ensuing each time a child interacts with another individual). The first section deals with research on the major social worlds of the child--family, peers, and school--and stresses both how those worlds affect the child and vice versa. For example, the relations between a child's parents will influence the child's social development, but the child's actions also influence the parents' relationship. The second section discusses  the interrelationship among the child's social worlds, with a focus on how family relations affect peer relations and vice versa. Considerable use is made of primate studies in arguing that secure family relations have important consequences for peer relations, although the nature of the social interaction differs greatly between the two systems. It is concluded that family relations provide the basis for the child's exploration of the social world which is necessary for social adaptation. Throughout the document, recommendations are made for more detailed empirical analysis of the child's interactions with others and their effects on social development. An extensive bibliography is appended. (Author/BH)",

University of Chicago studies of behavioral processes and British investigations of parental experiences and attitudes and material conditions in the home were analyzed to determine if the studies differ in predictive validity. From a systematic search of educational, psychological, and sociological literature, 18 studies of 5,831 first through twelfth grade students in eight countries over a 19-year period were selected. Eight items of information were recorded for each correlation: the size, age, sex, and socioeconomic status of the  sample; the home assessment and learning measures employed; Chicago or British research school; and type of correlation. It was found that correlations of intelligence, motivation, and achievement with indexes of parent stimulation of the student in the home are considerably higher than those with indexes of socioeconomic status (SES). Specifically, the median of 92 simple correlations of home environment and learning is .37 (with a range of .02 to .82) and the median of 62 multiple-regression-weighted composites is .44 (range .23 to .81). Jackknifed regression estimates indicate that the gender and SES of the sample condition the sizes of the correlations and suggest priorities for future primary investigations. (Author/RH)",

Data is reported which seem to support this view. A review of recent literature indicates that an adequate account of child development requires an interdisciplinary effort involving family sociology and developmental psychology. A conceptual model is proposed in which there are reciprocal interrelations between the child's development, parental behaviors, and husband-wife interactions. Data drawn from a previously published study appear to support this model with respect to interrelations (1) between paternal (and maternal to a lesser degree) parental behaviors and husband-wife  interactions, (2) between parental behavior and infant exploratory competence and (3) between infant competence and husband-wife interactions. Further research about these interrelations as they change over time is recommended. (BH)",

        "description":"This paper reports two studies of the effects of empathic instruction on first graders' evaluations of other people. In Experiment 1, 23 children received either empathic or non-empathic instructions, listened to a taped conversation in which the main character obtained either a positive or negative outcome, and then evaluated both the main character and the person who provided the outcome to the character. It was found that empathic instructions increased positive evaluation of the main character under negative outcome conditions only and produced a change in evaluative perspective in regard to both members of the interacting dyad. In Experiment II, 80 children received either empathic or neutral instructions, were informed that the main character was similar or dissimilar to  themselves, and listened to a taped conversation in which the main character always obtained a mildly negative outcome. Female subjects evaluated the main character in the predicted sequence: empathy instructions and similarity information led to greatest liking, neutral instructions and dissimilarity information led to least liking, and the other two combinations led to intermediate levels of liking. Unexpectedly, male subjects responded to empathic instructions by evaluating the main character less favorably. Explanations for the males' evaluative behavior are discussed. Results are discussed in terms of whether empathic responses can be directly induced by instruction. (Author/RH)",

Designed to provide state legislators with information they need to better understand rural implications of statewide education reforms, the handbook presents a range of legislative alternatives in key areas. Chapters embody five basic guidelines for rural school reform: respect for primacy of local circumstance; expansion and strengthening of bonds between school and community; more equitable balance between outside regulation and local control; treatment of structural and substantive reforms as separate and distinct issues; capitalizing on strengths of rural schools as well as correcting deficiences. This report to state legislators contains  the following chapter focuses: (1) overview of rural America and its schools in terms of demographic, economic, and educational factors; (2) school/school district organization in sparsely populated areas, with emphasis on the consolidation movement; (3) school finance issues with special relevance for U.S. rural areas: (4) background information on personnel issues in rural education (teacher salaries, training programs); (5) delivery of educational services and development of educational programs appropriate for rural communities. Specific legislative alternatives are presented in chapters two to five. (RS)",

        "description":"Members of the farm related population generally lag behind their nonfarm related counterparts in the number of school years completed, number of persons completing high school and college, functional literacy rates, participants in adult education, and labor force status. In 1975 White farm males trailed metro and nonmetro nonfarm males by 1.2 and 0.8 years respectively in median school years completed. Black farm males and females trailed their metro counterparts by 5.7 years for men and 4.0 years for women. Functional illiteracy for Black farm males remained about the same (40 percent) while illiteracy among Black farm females rose from 23.1 to 31.9 percent. Farm-related youth are not seeking post-secondary schooling at a level approaching that for metro youth, and older  farm-related people are less inclined to pursue adult education opportunities. Thus, many members of the farm related population lack the formal education needed to improve chances for success in complex modern farming as well as in professional career fields elsewhere. Census data from between 1968-1975 are used in this study on the educational characteristics of two farm related population components: nonmetro farm residents and farmers and farm laborers. The educational status of subpopulations (Blacks-Whites, males-females, younger-older persons) is particularly emphasized. (Author/DS)",

Because migrant families may need educational and other human services of several states in the course of a year, the need for effective intra- and interstate cooperation and communications is great. Preschool care and records transmittal for secondary students are also important. Federal and state legislatures should enact early childhood education legislation supported with adequate funding. All agencies receiving federal funds for migrant children should utilize the Migrant Student Record  Transfer System (MSRTS), which should be expanded and updated to include health information, student individualized education plans, and student credit accrual. To further enhance chances for student success and graduation, and to increase interstate continuity in migrant education program planning, the U.S. Office of Education, governors, state legislatures, and boards of education should adopt policies that encourage cooperation at all levels and in all agencies. There are no recommendations regarding parent involvement due to lack of consensus. These recommendations combined with those of the First Interim Report provide the basis for continued Task Force efforts. (SB)",

First, there is lack of coordination at the funding level and the operations level among the many federal agencies and programs involved in providing early childhood education services to Indians. The feasibility of establishing a National Center for Early Childhood Indian Education programs should be explored. Second, there is a backlog of about $900 million (a possibly inaccurate figure) in Indian school construction projects, but the 1979 Administration budget allocation is only $29.5 million. An analysis, with report and recommendations, of fiscal needs for such construction should be completed by December, 1978. Appropriate agencies should support resulting necessary budgets. Third, there is little  coordination among federal programs sponsoring Indian education and training or attempting to provide jobs; a review of such programs is necessary. Fourth, to meet the education and training needs of the Indian community, there is a need for expanded research and development efforts with the dissemination of significant findings. The National Institute of Education should analyze all existing federal efforts, noting gaps in research and reviewing the organizational arrangements within concerned agencies. Fifth, efforts should begin immediately to clarify the responsibility of the state to Indian people, as well as certain federal and state jurisdictional ambiguities in funding and control. (SB)",

        "description":"Career and career related preference expressed by a number of rural Southern high school youth were found to moderately predict their early adult behaviors. Preferences for post high school education were the dominant influence and single best predictor of subsequent educational attainment. Moderate linkages were also found to exist between preferences for early marriage, residence, and military service with the corresponding early adult behavior. These findings resulted from a study of a broad population of rural Deep South youth over a six year period. Three sets of social surveys followed the same individuals from the high school sophomore year in 1966 into young adulthood, four years past high school. Responses were gathered on career preferences, educational aspiration,  marriage plans, and fertility and residential expectations, with the final phase of the survey seeking data on actual educational and residential attainment, marital status, and fertility. Whether male or female, Black or White, an overwhelming number of the rural youth shared the American success dream of high educational attainment and career preference. Blacks, however, consistently were less likely to enact their preferences, due to such possible causes as differential opportunity, barriers, knowledge and racism. Black rural students were more likely at both the senior year and early adult period to hold residential preferences (in effect migration preferences) to urban residences. (DS)",

Congress should consolidate the programs into a single agency which would then be better able to identify those reservations with the best potential for business development, and to promote it aggressively in those locations while providing financial, technical, and managerial assistance when needed. For other reservations, the agency should determine whether long-term federal  financial assistance is needed or alternative strategies should be developed. The Bureau of Indian Affairs should also correct its administration of the Indian Financing Act of 1974, in part by reevaluation of its loan policy and by obtaining and evaluating required documentation prior to awarding loans or grants. Finally, Congress should determine whether the approximately 300,000 Indians excluded from obtaining guaranteed loans via the Indian Financing Act should be eligible for its benefits and if so, Congress should amend the Act accordingly.

        "description":"Two experiments explored whether the facilitatory effect of context on lexical decisions is limited to words subjects generated when given the context as a prompt in a production task, or if the effect is wider in scope. The first experiment provided evidence of a wide scope of facilitation from single word contexts. In the second experiment, the contexts consisted of sentences with the final word deleted. Norms were collected to determine the most common completion for each sentence frame. The experiment yielded three main findings: (1) lexical decisions were fastest for words that were the most common completions; (2) among words not given as completions in the norming procedure, decisions were faster for words related to the most common completions than for words unrelated to  the most common completions; (3) among words that were not produced as completions, decisions were faster for words that formed acceptable completions than for words that did not. These &quot;relatedness&quot; and &quot;sentence acceptability&quot; effects were independent, so that the relatedness effect held even when the target words formed anomalous sentence completions. To account for these results, a model combining two types of processes is required. In one such model, schematic knowledge operates upon a semantic network to activate particular nodes, and this activation spreads to related concepts. (Author)",

It argues that journlists' beliefs about the appropriate format, style, and content for a news story work in concert to obscure the structure of the story and the relations among subparts, and thus serve to thwart their presumed goal in writing: providing an account of events that will be easily readable by an ordinary person. The report concludes that there are clear counterparts to editors standards for the format and style appropriate to books intended for beginning readers, and hypothesizes that children who are exposed primarily to texts written to conform to these standards (short sentences, no paragraphing, relations inexplicit between events recounted) may fail to  become good readers because they do not learn to expect connection among ideas, and frequently fail to see it, even in better-written texts.

In the first study, sixth grade students read two unfamiliar passages and were able to recall metaphoric structures better than literal paraphrases of the same information. In the second study, third grade subjects read a more familiar passage and exhibited no difference in recalling metaphors and literal descriptions. In the third study, in which third and sixth grade students read familiar and unfamiliar metaphors and literal material, there was a significant passage familiarity by version (metaphor or literal) interaction. Conclusions drawn from the three studies were that (1) children's recall of metaphor  is always as good as and often better than their recall of comparable literal paraphrases; (2) when passage material is familiar, metaphors are no more salient than their literal counterparts; (3) whatever metaphor effects exist appear limited to their surface structure boundaries. The possibility exists that metaphors are better recalled than literal passages not because they elicit greater comprehension, but because they are more vivid and novel and, therefore, more memorable.

        "description":"A complete analysis of a story's structure must rely on more than a simple grammar of story components; it requires a consideration of the characters' plans as they are stated or implied in the story. Furthermore, these plans are recognized as the characters' beliefs, and beliefs about interactions among plans are crucial determinants of a story's structure. A notation system representing such interacting plans may be applied to a simple children's tale about a fox and a rooster, describing various phenomena that appear in this story. For example, a character in conflict with another may try to conceal his or her real plans or try to deceive the other character into acting in a way that serves his or her own interest at the other's expense. A character may thus construct a plan  that is intended to be believed by the other, but is not actually carried out. Such a virtual plan plays a central role in the fox and rooster story and is common in other stories in which characters interact. (Author/AEA)",

One prereading technique, which proved successful in a study involving social studies instruction, involves presenting many examples and nonexamples of relevant (critical) attributes of concepts to help  students clarify the concepts. In another technique, which employs graphic postorganizers, students construct their own hierarchy of terms used in the material they have learned. These techniques enable teachers to ascertain what learners already know and to teach them accordingly, using both receptive and discovery learning techniques. Teachers should be the primary sources of information; textbooks should be used to reinforce concepts they have previously developed. (GT)",

The reading specialist at one high school reported that boys had an interest in \"Sports Illustrated\" and motorcycle magazines, and that girls were interested in \"True Stories\" and modern romance magazines. In a survey conducted at the second school, 89 students listed 88 magazines that focused on cars/motorcycles, hunting/fishing, men's entertainment, fashion, women's interest, general interest/news, humor, teen-adult interest, sports, and teen interest. According to the Fry and Harris-Jacobson readability  formulas, only three of the listed magazines had reading levels of seventh grade or below, which would make them suitable for the levels of problem readers. All the other magazines, even those expected to reach teenagers and students with lower reading levels, ranked above eighth grade reading levels. These results show that students with elementary reading skills are interested in popular magazines written above their reading levels, indicating that teachers could capitalize on these interests when developing reading curricula.

Both producer-orientation and product-orientation in the composition classroom can shortchange process. Producer, product, and process are not mutually exclusive, however, and all three elements, determined by the purpose of the discourse, can function together to turn the classic, one-dimensional communication triangle of encoder-signal-decoder into a three-dimensional prism. Teaching or  writing must provide aims and occasions and be centered on process, allowing individual writers the freedom to engage process in ways that observation and experience have shown writers really use.

Psychological research in referential communication and the development of social-cognitive skills supports the theory that a writer's egocentrism and audience awareness affect composition. At the high school and college levels, student writers appear to experience difficulties when adapting referential discourse to an audience because of three basic failures: (1) to take the needs and abilities of the reader into account; (2) to consistently maintain the reader's perspective; (3) to apply strategies for analyzing audience needs in a specific situation. Teachers of speech communication are familiar with techniques of audience analysis, and  composition teachers could modify some of their suggestions for the writing class.

This is unfortunate, for the social sciences are important enough and different enough to require both their inclusion and &quot;special handling&quot; in science writing courses. As with pure and applied sciences, social science creates a need for news writers to &quot;translate&quot; its terminology; and the relative newness of the discipline creates special challenges to reporters who must sift through data to interpret the most methodologically sound findings. Once journalism teachers recognize the efficacy of including social sciences in their science news writing courses, they  can expose their students to the problems and challenges of social science news reporting in the following ways: compare the central issues of daily news stories with current social science research topics; involve local social scientists in class activities whenever possible; have students develop glossaries of social science terms; have students critique local media coverage of science news; have students write science news articles based on original research reports, then compare student work with professional articles based on the same reports; and make students aware of the basic references in the social sciences.

The subjects responded to a questionnaire that was designed to measure the extent to which teacher attitudes revealed an acceptance of K.M. Hess's nine linguistic principles: that language is symbolic and arbitrary; highly personal and social; crucial to people's humanity; dynamic; learned, noninstinctive behavior; oral; used for a variety of purposes; systematic; and conventional. Results indicated that NCTE members who are in leadership positions at the local  level as English department chairpersons demonstrated only mild endorsement of modern linguistics and that their attitudes differed significantly from those of linguists for every one of the factors established by the study. However, significant differences that existed between their attitudes and those of their staff members suggest that efforts of NCTE to promote modern linguistics as it relates to the classroom have been somewhat successful.

These nine family groups were observed over three months in family group viewing situations.

The findings challenged the view that a child's ability to understand television advertising is determined at age-graded stages of cognitive  development. As skilled interactants at early ages, children identify and define the nature of television commercials in relation to consumer-related levels of interaction with parents, make demands and requests of parents and others in relation to the character of viewing situations, seek out information about commercial content and other social events, plan future social actions toward and through television commercials, and negotiate various joint acts with others while situated in front of the family television set.

Quantitatively evaluated prewriting exercises can help students in two ways: first, students learn to use procedures that can prepare them for more sophisticated devices; second, students unfamiliar with peer critiquing can learn to evaluate one another's prewriting work before they are asked to critique either more complex prewriting exercises or finished essays. Through a series of exercises, students practice substantiating or illustrating generalizations through the use of particular details or examples, then critique one another's papers by an actual count of the number of details used. Versions of the  exercise call for two evaluators per paper and for an author's response. Problems with this form of peer critiquing are that basic writers do not always feel competent or willing to judge their peers' work, students are often unable to differentiate between details that are really examples of the generalization and details that are tangential, and much more work is created until students become familiar with the peer critiquing system.

        "description":"The PEACESAT (Pan Pacific Education and Communication Experiments by Satellite) project has the mechanism for the facilitation of communication with the Pacific islands and is based on a good understanding of the island systems that comprise the participants in the news exchange experiment. What has been lacking in the experiment is a systematic study of the journalist-participants, the values they hold toward the news, and the content areas they feel would have the highest reader or listener interest. Through a three-level paradigm, supplemented by a content analysis of past exchanges (and planned analyses of future exchanges), the PEACESAT news exchange experiment working group hopes to answer the questions of value, content, and interest as a basis for designing innovations to  the basic exchange format. A primary means of investigating these questions will be a series of roundtable dialogues via PEACESAT among Pacific island journalists. It is hoped that participation in these dialogues will also encourage increased participation by the journalists in the basic news exchanges. (Author/TJ)",

It was found that there was marked dissatisfaction with present television fare among a sizable segment of the sample, that more respondents were aware of religious broadcasting than watched it, that seeking spiritual guidance was the most important factor influencing exposure to \"The 700 Club,\" and that the greatest interest in alternative programing was for  prime time and early evening news. However, no strong and systematic relationship existed between satisfaction with present programing and interest in the CBN alternative--although people who felt there was too much sex and violence or felt there should be more censorship of present television programs were more likely to express interest in and view CBN alternatives.

        "description":"Project English--a federally-funded research and development project in English education--existed from 1961 to 1968. Conceived in a frantic era of educational reform, Project English was designed to focus on research. Following an initial planning conference, the first curriculum study centers were funded, and areas of research were suggested. Among the types of activities funded by the project were study centers to develop and field-test sequential curricula, demonstration centers, centers for teacher preparation, and small contract research projects. The materials prepared at the four most productive study centers (at Carnegie-Mellon, Hunter College, and the Universities of Nebraska and Oregon) attempted to define English, to deal with extended sequences of instruction, and to  model inductive teaching. The death of Project English was due to attacks from within the profession, the lack of credibility of the educational system in the late 1960s, and the fact that its efforts were largely unknown to English teachers. However, Project English was of value not only to its participants, but to classroom teachers and students of curriculum and educational history. Not only did it make available innovative methods and materials, but its existence posed basic questions about the nature of knowledge and learning. (GT)",

Discouraged from working during the Depression years when jobs were scarce, in the 1940s women were eagerly invited to join the labor force to help mobilize for global war. With &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; as their national heroine, wartime magazines proclaimed women's capability to perform almost every kind of theretofore &quot;male&quot; task. With the closing of war industries and the return of job-hungry soldiers, however, the magazines began to tell women to go home. In the late 1940s, popular magazines featured aproned housewives once again content in a  completely domestic role. (Author/MKM)",

Among the problems the author describes are her suffering at being forbidden to use Spanish, and at being punished when she did so, in elementary school; her shame at being ridiculed by a junior high school English teacher because she and the other Mexican-American students had never heard of Tom Sawyer; her pain in high school at having her oral reports frequently interrupted with pronunciation corrections; her shame in a college public speaking course at having her \"poor\" English pronunciation  corrected in a cruel and humiliating manner; and her continuing apprehension about public speaking. She also describes current episodes showing that similar problems continue to exist for students. The author argues that English instruction creates a negative attitude toward English and that English teachers are responsible for the high dropout rate among Chicanos and Chicanas, and she concludes by urging English teachers to treat students and their native languages with respect while reinforcing the acquisition of English language skills.

Responses indicated that cases were the most common kind of instructional aids and that discussion was the most prevalent format. Several respondents reported the use of a project as a teaching device while others used a variety of realistic exercises. The major problem reported in teaching was the poor preparation of the students while the major problems reported for students were their lack of business or marketing skills or preparation, lack of career goals, and general motivation problems.  Most respondents reported that their schools had made no major changes in the course during the past two or three years, and those reporting changes indicated that these changes only involved adding new textbooks and updating or revising cases. Asked to design the ideal advertising management course, the respondents noted that such a course would need more and better cases, a good readings textbook, realistic exercises, small-group simulations, and small classes. They also suggested that the ideal course would explain how advertising management differs from normal management processes. (The questionnaire used is appended.) (TJ)",

Galtung's structural theory of imperialism and to explore the relationship between the remoteness and isolation of the Pacific press and its sources of news. The Galtungian concepts of center-periphery and dominance-dependency were related to sources and conditions of remoteness. A content analysis of 32 newspapers was conducted--20 from the Pacific Islands and 12 from the Pacific Rim countries of North America and Asia. Eleven coding categories were used and the space of each item was measured, a headline/summary was recorded, and advertising and &quot;newshole&quot; were measured. In all, 4,710 international news items were coded from 162 issues of the newspapers. The  resulting data were consistent with the Galtungian construct that the flow of news will be from the center to the periphery and that the center countries, particularly those with historical colonial ties, will predominate as sources in the periphery press. An additional finding was the general lack of &quot;cross bloc&quot; use of sources--the &quot;British/Australian Pacific&quot; used British sources, the &quot;American Pacific&quot; used United States sources, and the French areas depended on French sources.

Most of the students were in advanced writing and editing courses, while 32 were in magazine courses. Questions in the survey dealt with beliefs related to James Grunig's theory of information systems. Factor analysis suggested a single problem recognition factor, two concepts relating to decision rules, two on constraints, and a single audience-orientation variable. In general, students rated newsroom decision making as complex and high on uncertainty (problem recognition). They saw a strong need for audience study. Also, while expressing a preference for formal newspaper makeup and high regard for objectivity, they tended to downgrade &quot;news elements&quot; in news  assessment, event reporting, and sensationalism. Although students in both magazine and nonmagazine courses agreed on beliefs about the newspaper setting in general, the magazine course students did stress perceived audience interests more and their own preferences less in newspaper editing. Overall, the data suggest that the &quot;neutral&quot; and &quot;participant&quot; perspectives underlie belief clusters held by today's journalism students. (Author/RL)",

Specific information was sought concerning the cost of establishing a newspaper, the cost of materials and supplies, the number of employees and their pay, the value of the newspaper and job printing work produced, and the financial returns of the newspaper-publishing business. The data were then compared with similar data on all businesses in Wisconsin in 1860. The results revealed that the newspaper establishment was smaller than other businesses in all input and output measures except the number of employees. Newspaper publication and job printing done in association with publication were labor-intensive businesses;  therefore, the payroll was the larger proportion of the total actual costs of operation. As production increased, however, the value of raw materials increased more than did payroll. The operating costs for doing newspaper publication and job work were greater than initial investment, and the costs of newspaper production increased per unit of total output at a greater rate than did job printing costs, indicating that newspaper production was relatively more expensive to do than job work.

Although a number of studies have found that sentence-combining groups display greater writing improvement than control groups, perhaps sentence-combining should be viewed as a helpful device to overcome the effects of large classes, rather than as necessary to improved writing. Gains in syntactic and usage skills may result from very small classes, constant feedback, constant rewriting, and a focus on levels smaller than the essay. (AEA)",

In a program involving cross-curriculum writing instruction at Beaver College, three or four liberal arts faculty members, one of whom is in English, work together in a course cluster for a semester to improve writing in their classes. They discuss ways to make writing a natural part of each class meeting and consult with each other on improving responses to student writing. Students get needed practice in writing; learn to express what they know first to themselves and then to others; learn to think  and write in the special ways that humanists, social scientists, and scientists think and write when they are discovering and communicating ideas in their fields; and improve class discussions. Faculty members become more sensitive to their own similarities and differences as thinkers and writers, begin to pose questions about academic discourse and the nature of evidence in various fields, and begin to explore forms of literacy beyond the verbal.

Psychologists studying memory for discourse have neglected to give attention to the source of the information to be remembered. In a study to determine what effects adding information has on remembering initial discourse, subjects listening to taped interviews seemed to alter their memories in accord with what they thought really happened, based on assumptions drawn about the speakers. Additional experiments designed to test this source brought similar results. Listeners in ordinary contexts incorporate what they know about the speaker and what they can infer about that speaker's intentions into the actual facts stored in memory. (AEA)",

This idea was tested on 64 college students with normal hearing, using a Sternberg item-recognition task. Results indicated that sentences presented to the right ear did produce a longer recognition latency than sentences presented to the left ear. The faster left ear response occurred with both a manual and a spoken response. These results were interpreted as support for greater \"depth of processing\" by the right ear/dominant hemisphere than the left  ear/minor hemisphere. (Author/RL)",

Frame-by-frame analysis revealed that there were few cues to deception in the facial area, with only a marginally significant main effect for head nodding and no relationship evident for smiling, eye contact, or blinking; that there were no significant cues to deception in the body; and that in the paralanguage area there were more speech disruptions and a greater time duration in making deceitful responses.

It discusses four effects on the amount of money spent by school boards, namely, enrollment, quality of schooling, efficiency of use of resources, and current market prices. While enrollments are the driving force behind school costs, the real crisis lies in the decrease in financial support, the paper says. Thus the need to expose the true nature of school costs endorses the need for a specific, well-constructed school price index. The paper concludes that the continued imposition of austerity measures will result in an inferior school system. (Author/LD)",

It reviews theories of innovation diffusion in organizations, documents their application in the advocacy of the California Coalition for Sex Equity in Education (CCSEE), and presents a series of vignettes from case studies to illustrate problems encountered, the change strategies employed, and projected outcomes. Based on the stages of the adoption and diffusion of a new idea, CCSEE has designed and presents a change model that includes a systematic process for problem-solving, identification, and resolution of barriers to  the achievement of sex equity.

Rising energy costs, continuing inflation, and worsening financial conditions in general only compound the situation that has been estimated to amount to as much as a $35 billion accumulated maintenance deficit. A framework for carrying out the survey of deferred maintenance work is provided and survey guidelines include an example of a maintenance survey organized by class of work and subdivided into priorities. Items to be considered in developing an appropriate presentation for funding deferred maintenance are discussed. The role of the facilities manager is  defined. It includes responsibilities involved in identifying goals, establishing an organization to execute work, and adopting policies and procedures to assure a program with a strong sense of accountability. The appendices contain guidelines for evaluating facilities management, examples from three institutions of facility reviews that show work needed and estimated costs, and an analytical approach often used to determine whether a facility should be renovated or replaced.

The major presentation begins by tracing the central importance of process orientation through a review of literature within community education. Then a variety of different perspectives on process orientation from related fields and disciplines is explored. A typology of process perspectives based on different value frameworks is offered as a reference point. This includes process orientation as procedure, as problem-solving, as power, and as psychological and social development. Finally, at the end of the major presentation, community education and several developmental dimensions associated with a process orientation are discussed.

Professionals from many youth-oriented fields attended. Conference objectives included initiating dialogue among those concerned with delinquency prevention, generating ways to engage youth in meaningful school and community activities, and designing a way to assess a community's responsibility to its youth and its ability to affect youth-related problems. The conference used a think-tank method called indicative planning. This method involves determining steps that need to be taken, identifying problems and constraints, creating proposals, and planning of tactics.  Each of these components was the focus of a workshop. Results of each component of the process are presented in this publication. Twenty-four needed directions were identified. Twelve major contradiction areas were named, and many practical proposals were suggested. Finally, five tactical components were identified, and action steps were recommended. (Author/JM)",

In addition, the paper describes the results of the questionnaire distributed among members of teachers' associations in Ontario and Alberta, Canada. Part 1 describes the negotiating tactics that are at the heart of the instrument, primarily reliance on coercion or force. Part 2 describes the attitudes of a sample of teachers in regard to those  tactics. Part 3 describes to what extent the attitudes of teachers varied with different contractual matters at stake. Finally, part 4 examines how teachers tend to group the tactics in terms of the different effects they are seen to have. (Author)",

Naturalistic, ecological data are urgently needed concerning the behavior of educational administrators. Such data can considerably change the knowledge base of the field and may also speak to such operational concerns as management and planning. A running narrative record called a chronolog has been developed at Indiana University that can be used to reliably collect such data. Studies so far have investigated the behavior of a university administrator, superintendents, principals, school psychologists, and child advocates. An earlier study using a similar method explored differences between  effective and ineffective teachers.

On the basis of a diagnostic evaluation, professional staff devised an individualized treatment program plan consisting of outpatient psychotherapy at the treatment center and the training of parents to continue the therapy with the child at home. The rationale for this parent participation is presented, and the diagnosis and assessment aspects of the program are discussed. Also reviewed are both the clinical and home  treatment components, parent group meetings, program staffing, and special facilities and resources. Program graduates were found to retain many benefits, though the rate and type of progress of individual children depended, in part, on the severity of their initial biological handicaps. Many showed sufficient lessening of their psychotic symptoms to attend school, though they retained some minor behavioral problems; and some showed dramatic gains in intellectual functioning. (DLS)",

A cadre of men and women from the community were screened and trained to establish satellite nurseries in their own homes, which they then operated on a full-time, regular basis. Program aspects covered include trainee screening and selection, training the caregivers, parent involvement, staffing, and special facilities and resources. Nursery operation, coordination, and supportive services are discussed  and illustrated with brief glimpses of the procedures used in several of the satellite nurseries. Most of the parents of children involved in the program were able to stay off welfare assistance; and on the average, the children themselves showed steady gains in cognitive, language, socioemotional, and psychomotor development as a result of the program.

Parents visiting the pediatric clinic with children 20-30 months of age are invited to participate in the playroom program, which teaches them play skills they can use with their children at home. Those who choose to join the program are then asked to come to the playroom on a regular basis, with visits coordinated, whenever possible, with pediatric appointments. Each child initially  undergoes a developmental evaluation which serves to identify cognitive handicaps requiring special medical and psychiatric services of the clinic. At subsequent appointments, the playroom trainers work individually with parents, who then use their new skills with their own children. Program aspects reviewed include the basic parent education curriculum, program staffing and staff development, and special resources and facilities. A study of children whose parents completed the program revealed apparent behavioral benefits, and showed that the children gained, on the average, 6 IQ points. (DLS)",

It is explained that information was gathered from structured interviews with principals, teachers, and 28 parents of language handicapped children, as well as visits to 72 agencies or schools. Initial chapters focus on the scope and purpose of the study, criteria for selecting children as language handicapped, and research on seven topics (sample subtopics in parentheses): normal child language acquisition and development (linguistic basis of research, phonological development, semantics); language delay and deviation; early childhood autism and language disorder (echolalia and pronoun reversal,  prevalence of autism); developmental language disorder (cause/nature of aphasia, difference between aphasia and autism in language function); assessment of language disabilities (test reliability and validity, language samples, future needs in assessment); programs (content, structure, sequence); and analysis and selection of language programs (use of alternative symbol systems, specific behavior management strategies). Part II presents the empirical data for the following topic areas (sample subtopics in parentheses): methodology, assumptions, and background of the study; characteristics and needs of study children (interrelationships of administrative, educational, and diagnostic factors); language behavior of children (general findings on language level and fluency); program  organization, staff, and resources (teachers' views on developments and improvements); the mail sample analysis of programs; and parents' views (suggested improvements in program, family changes resulting from the handicapped). Two final chapters review programs in Ontario and abroad for language disordered children. (CL)",

The concepts, strategies and conclusions are applicable to learners of any second language. Basically, the point is that the conceptual function of language, that language is self-expression, has to be operative in composition instruction for native and non-native speakers alike. All composition students have to be taught to think originally and logically, to plan, write and rewrite. However, learners of second languages have additional problems to surmount and these have to be considered by teachers of ESL. These problems are considered here under five headings: (1) Sentence Structure and Grammar; (2) Rhetorical Structure  and Organization; (3) Reading; (4) Vocabulary, Spelling and Idiom; and (5) What Students Write about and How They Feel about English: Content and Attitude. Each of these sections contains a discussion of the problem and a number of strategies for dealing with it. Bibliographical notes conclude the document. (AMH)",

In the first section, automatic, or generative grammar, is defined as one formulated in such a way as to be applied mechanically in the construction of sentences. In this context the discussion deals with the process of analysis of existing sentences, structural description, formulation of rules, structural ambiguity, and the process for applying rules. The second section dealing with methodology  covers the development of a system of analysis of texts with the help of a computer. Things to be considered in this context are lexical ambiguity, identification of rules, levels of syntactic analysis, formulation of rules, and paraphrasing of word groups, locutions, clauses, and sentences. The third section discusses techniques used in analysis of methods as these relate to the study of scientific language, with particular emphasis on the question of words and context. (AMH)",

        "description":"This paper draws from a number of sources, from Muhammad Ali to TV commercials, to demonstrate the quite different conceptions that black and white Americans have of the meaning of boasting and bragging. For blacks, boasting and bragging are two distinct ways of speaking and communication. Boasting is a joking, playful verbal bahavior, not to be taken literally. A good boaster is admired as is a good joke teller; in fact, the verbal behavior involved is very similar. On the other hand, bragging is a serious form of self-aggradizement, quite distinct from playful boasting. For whites, especially Anglo-Saxon whites, both boasting and bragging are to be taken seriously and both are considered to be in bad taste. People who boast and brag are called egotists and \"show-offs.\" It is  shown: (1) that white conceptions and interpretations of boasting/bragging and black conceptions and interpretations of boasting/bragging are in conflict, and (2) that there is great potential for misunderstandings in black-white interactions because of this conflict. It is important for individuals in public service roles who interact with both blacks and whites, and especially with both groups simultaneously, to be aware of the differences in black and white communicative behaviors and the potential for conflict and misunderstanding.

Following classic test analysis procedures, three diagnostic dictation tests (one in Ladin, two in Surselvan) for second graders were constructed, statistically analyzed, and given the series title TOR (test d'ortografia romontscha). Spelling standards were then established, and error analysis procedures devised to facilitate a proficiency ranking among the students. The history of the tests is given in German with complete data.

        "description":"English essayist literacy shares many features with the discourse patterns of English speakers. Where these patterns are different from those of another ethnic group, literacy will be experienced as interethnic communication. Athabaskan discourse differs from that of English in (1) presentation of self (an Athabaskan is silent with new acquaintances); (2) dominance and display (in Athabaskan culture silence is submissive, talk dominant); (3) projection of self-image (Athabaskan courtesy prohibits speaking well of one's self); and (4) closing formulas (Athabaskan has none). These differences result in mutual ethnic stereotyping. To an Athabaskan, to acquire English essayist literacy is to become smug, boastful, talkative, and arrogant. It is suggested that non-Western forms of  literacy may be useful in approaching the problem of Athabaskan literacy. For instance, the Kutchin Athabaskans once developed a native literacy on the model of some African peoples, by reading and memorizing scripture (an authoritatively presented text) and spontaneously adopting therefrom forms of writing for practical use.

        "description":"Most reforms related to pluralistic education have been rejected by mainstream American educators primarily for ideological reasons. The fading of the intergroup education movement of the 1940s and 50s is an instance of the failure of educators to internalize the philosophy of multiethnic and multicultural education. The positions of mainstream and pluralistic educators are derived from incomplete analyses of the nature of ethnicity in America. Neither extreme assimilationist nor extreme pluralist ideology can effectively guide curriculum reform. A multiethnic ideology, on the other hand, suggests specific goals for curriculum reform by analyzing the structure of ethnic subcultures embedded in the mainstream American culture. This analysis suggests, for instance, the goal of  cross-cultural competency, or the capacity to be at home in a once unfamiliar culture. The relationship of ethnic to mainstream American culture is illustrated with diagrams. (JB)",

        "description":"In a discussion of the crisis in graduate education in the sciences and engineering, focus is on factors that threaten American capability to produce world-class science in universities. While finances play a part, the causes are basically structural--the rigidity of university faculties, stemming from a significant expansion in tenured positions, and the scarcity of new faculty positions for younger doctoral scientists and engineers. After a rapid growth in universities, due to the post-war baby boom and a growing affluence, federal support declined from 42 percent in 1967 to 23 percent in 1975. Meanwhile cost inflation eroded the value of the dollar, austerity budgets were implemented, and sciences and engineering felt the squeeze. More recently the federal government has  increased its basic research fundings (up about 8 percent in 1972 constant dollars). College enrollment is expected to peak in 1980, with about 7.4 million degree students enrolled in colleges and universities; however students enrolled in sciences and engineering are down 12 percent from 1973. It is suggested that the problem of tenured faculty might be met by a government incentive program for faculty who decide to embark on a second career well before retirement age. Other solutions are grants that would free university money to hire young faculty members or the creation of research institutes funded by industry, with tax incentives. (PHR)",

The research was designed to determine the major functional role of the national center administrator, and to identify techniques to improve organizational structures and establish guidelines for the training of multidisciplinary administrators. A general overview of role theory is provided as well as a list of related terms and definitions. Role theory and role-set concepts related to administrators are applied to both the university and national  center settings. Ten hypotheses were devised and a sample of 316 research administrators and directors were surveyed. Directors and administrators indicated similar role expectations as did governmental staff and administrators. Directors of graduate school programs and administrators indicated dissimilar role expectations in management areas. Coordinators of state programs and community development directors expressed similar administrative role expectations. Three major areas are suggested in which further research can aid in the development of role theory as it relates to the administration of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research training and service.

Focus here is on five of the book's seven main conclusions. Freeman's evidence documenting the new depression for college-educated workers is examined and his model of how the college labor market operates and why the market became depressed in the 1970s is critically summarized. The demographic consequences of the baby boom cohort and speculation on why cohort size may matter for employment and wages is discussed; and an alternative to Freeman's explanation is offered. Welch's findings are contrasted with those of Freeman as they project the future economic viability of  college for those entering the labor market in the 1970s. The second half of the review concentrates on Freeman's evidence on how the labor market changes impacted on blacks and women. It is concluded that the data do not reveal an overeducated American but rather relate adjustments to larger entering cohorts. Supporting statistics are cited and a bibliography is included. (PHR)",

The history of the Title from its inception is traced. Designed to strengthen the academic quality of financially weak institutions, Title III is viewed as a reflection of the social context of higher education in the mid 1960's. The Federal government recognized the need to aid the development of curriculum, faculty, administration, and student services in struggling institutions. Title III authorizes financial assistance for four types of activities: (1) increasing administrative efficiency; (2) faculty development; (3) curriculum improvement; and (4) improvement of student services. Eligibility  requirements of Title III, and the resource sharing and cooperative arrangements between institutions are detailed. Two divisions were formed in 1973 to more effectively deal with the variety of eligible institutions seeking aid. The Basic and Advanced programs are explained. The funding history of the Title, application procedure, and selection process are also discussed. Statistical aspects are tabulated in Appendix A and examples of successful Title III projects are found in Appendix B. (SF)",

This legislation would make technical and conforming changes in the student financial assistance programs and provide a one year extension of those programs that expire at the end of fiscal 1980. A change in the ceiling on the special allowance paid to lenders under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program is urged to avoid a substantial decline in available loans. The limitation on carry over of surplus funds in the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Program would be waived with the passage of this legislation. Provisions that will reduce student loan defaults and facilitate the recovery of defaulted  funds are also contained in the bill. This report suggests that these changes are necessary to insure that 700,000 independent students will receive the full Basic Grants for which they are eligible as a result of provisions in the Middle Income Student Assistance Act. Background letters and other information, an extensive review of the components of the bill, and changes in existing law that would occur due to H.R. 4476 are examined. (SF)",

The importance of this concept is examined in light of increased marketing efforts on the part of higher education institutions. It is emphasized that students are consumers and their rights should be protected. Possible areas of abuse compiled from student complaint analyses and literature include: refund policies, recruiting and admissions practices, advertising, instructional programs and staff, disclosure in written documents, equipment and facilities, job placement services, student orientation practices, housing facilities, keeping of student records, misrepresentation or misuse of accreditation status, and financial stability. The responsibilities of  students, state agencies, and federal agencies for protecting student consumer rights are discussed. Efforts to reduce the incidence of student abuse through the use of federal eligibility standards in administering federal student aid assistance programs are examined. It is suggested that the accreditation process can provide assistance in improving student consumer protection provisions. A stronger emphasis on the examination of student rights during institutional self-study, site visits, and continuing self-evaluation and improvement is recommended. (SF)",

The IEP enables peer institutions to compare information about their resources, activities, and educational outcomes. The technical findings of six universities (University of Colorado, University of Illinois, University of Kansas, Purdue University, State University of New York at Stony Brook, University of Washington) based on their experience in implementing IEP are discussed. Eight steps that each university followed in implementing the costing procedure are described. A discussion of the major findings covers the areas of faculty activity  analysis, departmental research and the joint-product problem, MRU accounting procedures, modifications in the full-cost procedures of IEP, discipline and student-program data, and modifications to NCHEMS's costing and data management software. The strengths and weaknesses of IEP for MRUs are analyzed. It is concluded that although the data were not substantively or technically comparable, advances had been made through the pilot study toward achieving technical comparability between institutions. The need for substantive comparability in the IEP is noted and discussed. Potential applications of cost data for each pilot-test institution are described. (SF)",

Findings of the resident pediatricians showed that there was a significant difference between American and foreign residents, and that there was a high correlation between performance ratings and integrity scores. The residents in internal and family medicine were a much smaller group and none of the correlations were statistically significant. Limitations of the study included the nature of judging values,  sampling procedures, and the use of adjusted performance ratings.

The study was conducted by the Ohio State University School of Allied Medical Professions and focused on the following 10 allied health professions: Circulation Technology; Medical Communications; Medical Dietetics; Medical Illustrations; Medical Record Administration; Medical Technology; Occupational Therapy; Physical Therapy; Radiologic Technology; and Respiratory Technology. Emphasis was on the curricula of the programs involved, activity of faculty members in each of the 10 programs, the clinical preceptor activities, the cost of the clinical component of the total  educational program, and the identification and allocation of costs to related programs. Major elements examined in the cost analysis were: program description, student enrollment, faculty, and total program costs. One of the many conclusions reached was that the student contact hours, student enrollment and faculty-student group size are essentially &quot;demand&quot;-related factors, while elements such as faculty contact hours, faculty-student ratios, faculty availability and faculty requirements are &quot;supply&quot;-related factors. It is suggested that the methodology applied in this study should be applicable to similar cost evaluations in other institutions as well as serving as a catalyst for future study.

The theory construction phase, the first of two phases, identified the instructional variables, postulated cause-effect relationships, and proposed optimal configurations of instructional conditions and methods through the construction of a model (or theory); the second phase included the application of the instructional model to the design of a course in a subject-matter area and the development of procedures for implementing this model in the design of new instruction. Four major products of the project are described: (1) an instructional model for sequencing, synthesizing, and  summarizing related parts of a subject matter; (2) a taxonomy of the variables that are included in the model; (3) a set of procedures for designing instruction, based on the instructional model; and (4) a 'blueprint' illustrating the application of those procedures for the redesign of the Navy's Basic Electricity and Electronics course.

        "description":"Comparisons were made between the use of microfiche materials and conventional printed materials for individualized instruction in two short military courses on aviation and ground maintenance. One group of students in each course used printed instructional materials and microfiche for course achievement tests, while another group used microfiche for instructional materials and tests. In both courses a control group used printed materials and tests exclusively. There were no test score differences among any of the three groups in each course; however, while results indicated that microfiche materials had an initial adverse effect on training time in the first course, this effect decreased rapidly in the second course. Before commitments are made to an extensive use of microfiche  materials, it is recommended that their long-term effects be evaluated in a study with sufficient power to assure potential users that real differences in training time as large as those found in this study do not exist. Appendices include a list of course modules, sample learning guides, tables showing cell means for interactions and correlations between attitude and training time, and two student attitude questionnaires with results.

Specific applications were (1) the conversion of color intensive audiovisual modules to microfiche; (2) the formatting of the microfiche to deliver both primary and alternative track modules in an integrated multi-track module, and (3) the use of microfiche in testing and test control. A primary consideration was the investigation of computer output microfiche (COM) technology as a means of authoring, revising, and  managing instructional materials. A microfiche system was designed, utilizing existing AIS computer resources, which satisfied administrative as well as instructional requirements. Applications were then developed in which specific AIS lessons were formatted for multi-track, color intensive presentation on microfiche. In addition, block tests were produced using COM production techniques. Based on classroom evaluations, results suggest that the Dual-Fiche concept charts a path that promises to be a cost-effective alternative to existing AIS instructional media, as well as a means of routinely updating and revising instructional modules that combine text and graphics. Appendices contain questionnaires used for implementation feedback. (Author/CMV)",

Thirty-six students from the Basic Electricity and Electronics School, Service School Command, San Diego, were randomly assigned to one of four groups differing by the instructional presentation sequence used. The first group saw lessons in a rule-examples-practice sequence; the second, in an examples-rule-practice sequence; the third, in a practice-examples-rule sequence; and the fourth, in a random sequence. The lesson materials were three computer-based instruction lessons delivered via PLATO IV  terminals, one on voltage in series circuits, and one each on using the Simpson Model 260-5P multimeter as an ammeter and as a voltmeter. There were no consistent differences in performance among the four groups during the three lessons. Conclusions and recommendations for further study of instructional sequencing are outlined.

These simulations are used to provide students with an integrated research training experience without the problems which often accompany real data collection. Background information and an introduction to simulated research are provided; the student then receives a list of variables available for manipulation and available dependent variables, generates hypotheses based on possible relationships between these variables, and designs an experiment to test them. Output provided by EXPER SIM is analysed using SPSS statistical analysis programs, and students submit reports of their  projects. Follow-up studies are designed, with each student submitting several reports during a semester. Initial analysis of student experiences suggests they have a better understanding of the research process than in previous semesters. Current projects at Indiana University-Bloomington involve the development of models for use in two graduate courses in music--Experimental Aesthetics and Music as a Reinforcer for Non-Music Behaviors. The model for the aesthetics course is described, and a sample of the input program is attached. (Author/BBM)",

Information was gathered through statewide planning meetings involving public librarians, as well as people from educational agencies, community organizations, other types of libraries, and interested citizens. Telephone surveys were conducted to assess current public library programming for adults, particularly in the humanities, and to intiate a survey to judge circulation of adult humanities materials. Insights gathered from the humanities meetings identify  some gaps in programs and topics, attitudinal and resource barriers, planning considerations, possible evaluation techniques, and ideas for topics and formats that could be used for humanities programming. A brief listing of sources is provided to help planners locate people, traveling programs and exhibits, special collections, and further guides to programming. Funding sources are also listed and outlined. Included is a directory of humanities resource people in Minnesota representing teachers, writers, and practitioners willing to assist in planning, participate in programming, or assist in grantwriting; area library and topic indexes to the directory are provided.

Task #1 was to review written information and data available from two existing state organizations--the Commission on Governmental Reform and the Community College Financing Project. An effort was made to develop policy recommendations based on this information in the four areas of mission and function, finance, governance, and management. In Task #2, the Commission was asked to review philosophy, operational realities and the financial limitations resulting from Proposition 13, and to suggest any changes in mission, activities, or financial  structure. Principal recommendations of the Commission included: (1) community colleges must remain open-access; (2) top priority must be given to lower division transfer, occupational, and basic skills programs; (3) financing should be supported through sales taxes--student tuition should be considered; (4) academic tenure should be retained with provision for periodic review by a state board; and (5) the strong local policy base which characterizes California community colleges should be retained and enhanced.

Science faculty members analyzed course offerings, identified specific course prerequisites, and developed instructional objectives. Since reading skill is often used as a placement criterion, a study was done to correlate reading scores with science performance. It was found that 13% of the students enrolled in biology courses were reading below the ninth grade level and thus improperly placed. In an effort to improve placement, strategies used by other institutions were investigated. A 23-item needs assessment questionnaire was administered to 121 students in Spring 1979 to generate a student profile, and evaluate  students' preparation and career plans as they related to the science curriculum. A science educator from a local university was invited as a consultant to review the SCC science program and make recommendations in interim and final reports. Information presented at a National Science Foundation conference was shared with faculty members to stimulate development of innovative instructional methods. Results of the various investigations are presented in the text of the report.

Definitions of MIS are numerous and often vague, but management systems (as distinguished from other information systems) should promote real-time management, incorporate computer-assistance, and support the decision-making process. Real-time management refers to management that occurs throughout all stages of an activity or program with feedback occurring continuously. Computer-assistance is essential to this process, and all activity should be designed to support decision-making. Most community colleges have utilized computers solely in operations functions--payrolls, student records  and financial transactions. MIS can also be successfully utilized to implement administrative decisions and policies (control function), as well as aid in long-range planning and policy development (management function). The development of complete management information systems that can handle all these administrative areas--management, control and operations--requires joint effort of management personnel and systems analysts to identify goals and objectives and design a system adequate to meet those goals.

To respond to the challenges of new programs and new constituencies, educators must concentrate not only on methods of communication but also upon what is communicated. The sophomore literature course at University College (UC) in Ohio was revised to adapt traditional course content to new programs being developed in response to community needs. It now investigates literary approaches to such topics as: (l) The American Ethnic Experience; (2) Culture and Counter  Culture--American Life Styles; (3) Divinity: Affirmation or Denial; (4) Utopia: The American Dream of Perfectability; (5) Conformity--Nonconformity: The Individual versus Society; and (6) The Paradox of Material Success. Revision of traditional courses is only one way to integrate technical and humanities courses. Other methods that have proven successful at UC include joint programs with local industry representatives; Project Assert, which involves senior citizens in the educational process; and the Playhouse in the Park program, where students earn a portion of their grades by providing the playhouse with needed services.

Additional personal information on each student was also collected, including data on how, when, and where registration occurred. Results indicated that the survey sample (N=684) was somewhat unrepresentative of the entire student population; particularly underrepresented were part-time and unclassified students. For those students  responding (N=436), overall ratings were good in all service areas. Availability of information about the college, the admission procedures, and the bookstore received the highest mean scores (2.95, 2.88, and 2.87, respectively). Faculty advising and the registration process were rated somewhat less favorably, with mean scores of 2.66 and 2.53, respectively.

Additional information on the Maryland community college system was included in the data analysis. Comprehensive community colleges are available in 23 of Maryland's 24 counties, serving 99% of the state's population. Average annual tuition for full-time students is about $500. Black students enroll in approximate relationship to their number in each college's service area. Considerable differences were found between the characteristics and educational experiences of Black and White students. Black students were more likely to be  female, to attend full-time, and to be in business and commerce programs. Over half of the Black students received Basic Educational Opportunity Grants of just over $600. While Black students were somewhat older and took more credits than Whites, the Black students completed fewer credits and were less likely to achieve an associate degree goal. Black students did not achieve their transfer goals as often as Whites, but no differences were found in rate of employment goal achievement. The study report includes a discussion of the Maryland community college system, and the policy implications that result from the data analysis. (Author/DR)",

The study revealed: (1) 15 colleges offered developmental education for credit in English and mathematics; (2) 15 colleges offered courses in reading and/or study skills, and provided tutoring, counseling, and self-paced instruction; (3) total enrollment in remedial courses in fiscal year (FY) 1978 was more than 42,000--30,000 in credit courses and 12,000 in continuing education courses; (4) direct costs for FY 1978 totaled about $3.4 million (direct remedial instructional cost for each remedial full-time  equivalent (FTE) student statewide was $931); and (5) developmental programs tended to be decentralized, with most programs conducted within academic departments. Another aspect of the study involved measuring a sample of students enrolled in developmental English courses at eight colleges against the success of a sample of students enrolled in English 101. Developmental students tended to complete fewer college-level English courses and make lower grades than the control group. The study report considers the implications of the findings in terms of placement, open admissions, professional development, organizational structure, evaluation, and funding. (DR)",

Costas  Boukouvalas and Melvin Gay consider the provision of services to the hearing-impaired. Grace Hodgson describes the role of paraprofessionals in working with handicapped individuals. Virginia Lockhart, Alison Caughman, Shirley Woodie and Mary Bauer, Anne Stewart, Maxwell King and Muriel Elledge-Heimer, and Patricia Walsh contribute articles to the section on programs designed for women. Issues under consideration include: reentry education, non-traditional careers, special needs of rural women, equity, innovative delivery systems, and directions for the future. An ERIC review of sources and information concludes the monograph. (DR)",

The data resulting from these studies are organized into four categories: (1) preschool effects on target children's later school performances, including retention in grade, significant changes in achievement and intelligence test scores, and assignment to special education classes in the primary grades; (2) attitudes and values of the children and parents involved in the program related to children's achievement motivation and self-esteem and parents' aspirations for their children; (3) kinds of preschool programs that were most effective in helping the target children avoid placement  in special education classes; (4) determinants of special education placements. Data showed that the early education programs studied apparently had lasting effects in the following areas: reduced number of target children assigned to special education classes; reduced number of children retained in grade; higher achievement test scores for children at the fourth grade level; higher IQ scores for target children than controls (in three projects); higher achievement oriented attitudes and values. All programs were found to be about equally effective in helping target children avoid special education placement. (SE)",

Eighty-three randomly selected urban kindergarten children were interviewed three times over a 7-month period. Photographs and drawings were used to elicit children's preferences in relatively unstructured interview sessions. Interviews were recorded and content analysis was conducted to extract from the children's words a sense of the ways children viewed the schooling experience. Categories of response were developed and analyzed with non-parametric statistical techniques. Variables such as family income and parents' education were  treated as independent variables and replies to interview questions were treated as dependent variables. Among the results, children appeared more able to tell what teachers are to do in school than what they themselves are to do. Change in children's perceptions of student role was toward more disciplined behavior and greater orientation to cognitive activity. Children's views of school, student and teacher roles, impulse control, sex differences, amount of time spent in day care, preschool experience and student role, and impact of peer group are among the topics discussed in conjunction with the findings.

        "description":"In Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior, three categories of environmental control over instances of verbal behavior appear to be relevant to the study of infant vocal development: the mand, the tact, and the echoic categories. Procedures used in the remediation of language deficiencies and procedures found in work in the area of language learning and communication may also be relevant to the functional analysis of the acquisition of vocal behavior by infants. Topographically, infant vocal development progresses from diverse and indiscriminant vocal behavior to differentiated and discriminated vocal/verbal skills during the first year of life. One valid operant explanation of the functional development of infant vocal behavior is that the infant's differential responding to the  vocal environment she/he is experiencing is consequated with homeostatic reinforcers which are in turn paired with social consequences parents typically provide. As a result of experiencing this pairing process intensively, the tactile, visual, and auditory stimulation provided by the parents take on discriminative as well as reinforcing properties for the infants. Once established and maintained as a discriminative and reinforcing stimuli, these adult behaviors could function to set the occasion for and consequate approximations to adult behavior by the infants. This explanation would account for the manding, echoic, and tacting functions that appear to be characteristic of much of the first year of the infant's vocal behavior. (JMB)",

The developmental needs of most children could be met with standards requiring less staff than those mandated by Federal Interagency Day Care Requirements (i.e., those requirements specifying standards for group sizes, staff-to-child ratios, and services to be provided). Methods used by the states to compute staff-to-child ratios were inconsistent. Family home day care was generally provided by persons with no formal training in child development. Graduated fee schedules are needed to help income-eligible families make an orderly transition from subsidized to nonsubsidized day care. Some states  were not providing employment-related day care for two parent families. Recommendations for the formulation of guidelines in the areas of minimum care standards, staff-to-child ratios, minimum training requirements, and graduated fee schedules are made. This report was submitted by the General Accounting Office to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. (Author/RH)",

Pertinent empirical research in the following areas is summarized and critically evaluated: imitation in infants, observational learning, clinical use of modeling, and the relation of imitation to aggression, prosocial behavior, and self control. Among the author's general conclusions: (1) there is very little pertinent research on identification, but it appears that identification is not an all-encompassing unitary process; (2) the child's general cognitive level has an impact on what he or she can learn by observing models; (3) children are active cognitive processors of the model's words and actions; (4) Piaget's work with infants is the  closest approach to date of a stage analysis of imitation; (5) young children may acquire, from brief periods of observation, certain motoric and verbal behaviors that appear to be associated with aggression in real-life situations; (6) the results of research on the long-term effects of television violence are equivocal; (7) experimental studies of observational learning of sharing behavior indicate that models do increase prosocial behavior in children; however, (8) prosocial behavior does not seem to be enhanced by watching television programs with prosocial content; (9) exposure to models who yield to the temptation to perform a prohibited act, and are not punished, has a disinhibiting effect on children; the effects of exposure to models who resist temptation, however, is less clear  due to demand characteristics of laboratory research.

        "description":"A set of studies investigated the relative importance of operative schemes and figurative (rote) memory. In Study I, 60 concrete operational children from grades 1-4 were asked to reconstruct two types of stimuli from memory. In order to separate the effects of operative and figurative skill use, learning disabled children with poor figurative memories were compared to children with normal memory skills. In one type of stimulus condition (an arbitrary color sequence) the elements of the display were presented in an unorganized manner so that operative schemes would be of relatively little use for memory. In a second type of stimulus condition, (a seriated array) elements were organized so that operative schemes would be highly relevant. As predicted, a significant Group X  Stimulus interaction was found, with the learning disabled children performing comparably well to normal children on the seriated stimulus, but worse than the normal children on the arbitrary stimulus due to their deficient figurative memory skills. In Study II, 20 preschool children (mean age, 4 years, 6 months) classified as nonseriaters were given the same memory tasks to determine whether the tasks were equivalent figuratively for children lacking the relavent operative schemes. As predicted, there was no significant difference between performance in the two types of stimulus conditions. To determine whether preschoolers could understand the organized stimulus, 14 preschool children classified as seriaters were tested on the same tasks in a third study. Performance in the organized  stimulus condition was significantly better than performance in the unorganized stimulus condition. These results lend support to Piagetian theory. (Author/SS)",

Music fulfills an inner drive to express feelings and experiences in a symbolic, abstract, creative, and acceptable manner which is positive and valued. Musical nurture should begin within the home environment at birth and continue in nursery school and kindergarten. It should be centered around two basic goals: (1) to increase significantly the enjoyment and basic response to music through beautiful, appealing and imaginative experiences, and (2) to help children formulate basic concepts about the constituent patterns of the sound experienced. The first of these goals is most important. Musical nurture and learnings may be  developed through enjoyable and attentive listening experiences, performance with instruments (including singing), and the creation of original compositions, effects, accompaniments, and other related activities including free interpretive dance and movement. The most significant of these activities is listening. Children from roughly 4 to 6 years of age are capable of learning a vast number of additional basic concepts about music. Learning of rhythmic, melodic, instrumentation, harmonic, dynamic and textural concepts is best facilitated through a combination of listening, performing and creating experiences. Children should be given the opportunity to grow musically in their early years, when much can be achieved easily and naturally. (Author/RH)",

This study pursues the issue of early sorting with infants as young as 6 months, and with a broader range of stimuli than has been used previously. Forty-eight infants, eight male and eight female at 6, 9 and 12 months were presented with eight sets of small, manipulable objects. Each stimulus set consisted of two groups of four objects each, the groups differing in size, color, form or some combination of these dimensions. Stimuli thought to be of high salience were included. Variables coded were: which object touched first; the order in which objects were touched; grouping together of  objects. At both 9 and 12 months, infants showed a high level of sorting activity. At 9 months, 94% showed sequential touching of like objects, while 100% did so at 12 months. At 9 months, 13% and at 12 months 44%, demonstrated at least primitive object grouping. At 6 months, selective manipulation was conspicuously absent, leading to the conclusion that this activity must emerge sometime between 6 and 9 months. (Author/RH)",

Among the conclusions: (1) the PAT program, as it existed during the 1978-79 school year, was not able to alter the mother's perception of herself as a parent-teacher when the PAAT Inventory was employed to assess this variable; (2) the children's problem solving abilities, as indicated by mean scores on the PSAC, did improve between pretests and posttests; and (3) the PAT Program can in fact alter maternal linguistic behavior as demonstrated by the significant difference existing between the maternal pretest and posttest mean scores.

        "description":"This Early Education Project consisted of a home and school approach to early intervention with moderately to severely handicapped children. A home based parent training program incorporating an infant teaching/learning intervention system was combined with a school based classroom project for toddlers to provide instruction in early childhood skills and knowledge. The program employed a developmental task analyzed curriculum with a criterion referenced assessment method to determine a child's competencies and skills and to identify the goals of the intervention in behavioral terms. A systematic data collection format to evaluate each child's progress in four major areas (language skills, motor skills, cognitive skills, and self-help skills) was employed either at home or in the  school. The normative data indicated that children's rate of achieving developmental milestones was significantly accelerated in mental development and language development for the school program and in mental development for the home program. The behavioral data demonstrated that moderately to severely handicapped children could attain profound and rapid increases in knowledge and skills when they were directly taught such skills and knowledge.

The naturally occurring behaviors of forty toddlers and their peers were time sampled in day care settings. Day care facilities were community based and varied in group size, age composition, and the number and type of play objects. Experience with preschoolers as siblings or playmates and aspects of the inanimate environment in different day care settings influenced peer behavior. Small, mixed age groups in family day care facilitated talking. Center toddlers with older siblings engaged in more prosocial behaviors. Peer play was more complex when using nonportable objects in day care centers and space relationships in  family day care. (Author/RH)",

The subjects were 109 students who scored one standard deviation or higher above the mean for their grade level on the Measure of Elementary Communication Apprehension (MECA). The students were assigned to one of three treatment conditions: (1) control; (2) informed teacher (in which the teacher was given a written explanation of communication anxiety (CA), was notified which of his or her students were high in CA; and was given written suggestions for dealing with CA in the classroom), and (3) cognitive modification (an approach combining systematic desensitization and cognitive restructuring). The  cognitive modification treatment sessions consisted of ten 45-minute sessions over a period of five weeks. The MECA was used as a post treatment measure of failed. These results indicate a relation between how children organize or tests indicated that cognitive modification significantly reduced communication apprehension, while informed teachers did not. Grade level and interaction effects were not significant. Both teachers and students found the time spent in the CM classes worthwhile. Results suggest that removing students from regular classroom activities to participate in a CM class can be justified to parents, teachers, and administrators. (Author/SS)",

The ultimate preventive goal is identification and removal of lead in the environment before it is absorbed by the child. Until this occurs, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and environmental management will continue to be necessary public health activities. Topics discussed in the statement are: (1) the background of past experience with lead screening and the nature of the effects of lead on health; (2) aspects of screening procedures, including the goal, target population,  schedule, methods, and interpretation of results; (3) the types of procedures to be followed and tests available for diagnostic evaluation of the patient's lead absorption status; (4) suggestions for clinical management of children diagnosed at various risk determinations (urgent risk, high risk, moderate and low risk); (5) environmental investigation and intervention, including common methods for reducing lead-based paint hazards; and (6) health education. The statement also includes a list of references and reprints of two papers published by members of the Center for Disease Control: &quot;Exposure to Lead: Sources and Effects,&quot; by Dr. Herbert Needleman, and &quot;Treatment of Lead Poisoning,&quot; by Dr. Julian Chisolm.

The primary focus is on developing parental support systems which extend learning into the home through creative and effective use of materials. General considerations such as the larger social context of the learning process, historical changes in family interaction patterns, the role of play, and the role of the community in children's learning are briefly discussed. The current status of mass market materials is discussed in more detail, with consideration given to materials for different age groups, materials concerned with contemporary society (those concerned with human ecology, nutrition, health education, consumer education, social relations,  etc.), and materials designed to offer parental support in fostering informal learning in children. Also covered are special home-school-community programs that foster parent-child interaction with respect to school learning; publications on parenting; and inadequacies and gaps in the mass market supply (sex-stereotyped materials; lack of consumer guidance in toy selection; lack of multicultural materials; safety problems; lack of creative educational materials; lack of materials adapted to the needs of handicapped children and their families; and lack of materials reflecting current knowledge about child development). A plan of action for materials development and distribution is recommended for implementation by the National Institute of Education. (Author/SS)",

The pooled data bank of the 12 research groups making up the Consortium provided information on approximately 3,000 low income children who either participated in early intervention programs or served as controls. The common information across projects includes various pre-enrollment measures of the children's home background, a pretest IQ score, and at least one IQ test score collected immediately after the preschool experience. Each investigator also  collected a variety of cognitive and behavioral measures which are not common across all projects. In 1976-77, members of the Consortium collaborated in a common follow-up data collection effort. These data include both child and parent interviews, children's IQ and achievement test scores, and information on whether the children had ever failed a grade or been assigned to special education classes. The children were aged 9 through 19 years old at the 1976-77 follow-up. The findings showed that high quality early education programs for low income children had lasting effects in five areas: (1) reducing the number of children assigned to special education classes, (2) reducing the number of children retained in grade, (3) increasing children's math achievement scores at fourth grade, (4)  increasing IQ scores at least up to age 13, and (5) influencing aspects of children's and mothers' achievement orientation.

        "description":"The recent, widespread trend toward rural migration can create disturbances in the organization of the host community by overloading community services and by creating conflict between oldtimers and newcomers. To obtain information about community disturbances and migration in Michigan, questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 21,792 households; 13,296 of these (68%) resulted in usable responses. The questionnaires included 55 items which respondents rated as not a problem or as a slight, moderate, or serious problem in their community. Ordinary least squares regression techniques were used to examine the relationship between migration and specific indicators of community disturbance. Findings supported the hypothesis that inmigration has caused structural disturbances in  Michigan's small towns and rural communities. Migration was strongly associated with perceived problems concerning education, social welfare programs, crime and public safety, and municipal services. Unexpectedly, the employment outlook was more favorable in high growth than in low growth areas. Rural planners and community leaders should be aware of the potential problems of the migration turnaround in order to benefit from the many positive aspects of community growth. (JH)",

        "description":"Satisfaction with one's community is an elusive quality related to a variety of physical and social factors. As changes in the community become imminent, levels of satisfaction may also change. Residents of two communities were periodically questioned as their personal satisfaction, (happy place, suitable size), satisfaction with services (schools, recreation, police protection), attitudes toward planning (limiting development, access to information), and general optimism (peace, personal influence). One of the communities, Ranchland, was predominantly rural while the other, Valleyville, was a small university town of approximately 20,000. Valleyville residents generally viewed the rapid changes occurring in their community as naturally occuring, as progress accompanied by  increased diversity and opportunity. Ranchland residents, however, faced a different situation, for large scale coal development was imminent and the change agents were to be \"foreign\" decision makers such as mining corporations, energy companies, and state and federal governments. Within two years Ranchland residents became much more critical of their area and the planning efforts within it, even though actual changes had not yet occurred. Apparently changes in perception related to a place need not be associated with actual changes which have occurred there so much as to perceptions of who would control the change in the event it occurred. The difference in acceptance primarily appears to be due to a willingness to favor development. (Author/DS)",

In 1975, white nonmetropolitan women completed an average of 12.2 years of school as compared to 8.9 years for black and 7.7 years for hispanic nonmetropolitan women. Very few white women but 19% of the black women and 31.1% of the hispanic women were functionally illiterate. As did their labor force sisters, non-labor force white women averaged a high school education and were consistently better educated than non-labor force white  men. White women in the labor force apparently underutilized their education, entering the lower paying, lower skilled positions. In contrast, greater educational attainment appeared to pay off in greater labor force participation for black women, who were nonetheless low on the scale of economic payoffs (perhaps reflecting the triple disadvantage facing rural minority women). Career and vocational education, guidance counseling, education of the disadvantaged, education of farm women, and improved socio-economic conditions can help ensure full usage of rural women's educational attainments.

Of the respondents, 24% had lived in the county 7 years or less, 32% had lived in the county 8 years or more, and 44% had never lived outside the county. Findings indicated that urban to rural migrants were younger, more educated, and had higher incomes than other residents of the area. All groups were in substantial agreement that tax money should be directed to medical facilities, law enforcement, improved roads, services to senior citizens, and fire protection. There were differences between age  groups on spending more tax money to improve schools and build playgrounds but there were few differences among migrants within age groups. Over 66% of respondents felt the county was increasing in population and felt that the change was good. There was wide support for attracting industry, business, services, and new employment opportunities, and moderately strong support for the county to attract tourists and new residents.

        "description":"As rural communities strive to meet the demands of both their citizens and of higher levels of government for increased local services, they must rely more and more on outside assistance. The maze and complexity of federal and state mandates forces officials to seek technical assistance from a network of public and private agencies. The dynamics of this dependence was the focus of a study of eight rural localities in Virginia where local officials were questioned as to the decision making and technical assistance they received in such areas as fiscal planning and management. Areas in which help was most needed included (1) evaluation of the cost effectiveness of programs, (2) planning capital projects (including education and recreational facilities), (3) assistance in sewerage  and water activities, and (4) determining future operating costs. Although dependent upon outside sources for both financial aid and planning assistance, the officials were concerned with the quality of assistance available and the strings that were sometimes attached. Sewerage and water development as mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency were seen as the most threatening interference from the federal sector. In order for local officials to preserve their independence and autonomy, they must become more proficient in dealing with higher levels of government; they must seek to modify and reinterpret bureaucratic regulations to secure maximum group benefit.

        "description":"Assessment of farmworker needs and resource agencies revealed that a significant number of migrant and seasonal farmworkers are not receiving essential services available to them. Interviews conducted with 475 farmworkers gathered demographic data and information about perceived needs, knowledge and use of agencies, and satisfaction with services. Assessment of resources focused on Florida State Employment Service, Manpower Services (Comprehensive Employment and Training Act), and Adult Migrant Education Programs. Interviews with program managers and questionnaires completed by support staff provided information about agency procedures, compliance with federal regulations, problems in delivering services to farmworkers, and staff attitudes toward client groups. Data analysis  using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences led to specific recommendations for improving service delivery, e.g., expansion of the Migrant Education Program, more effective use of local news media to publicize farmworker services, and numerous measures to expand employment opportunities. Three program models which could improve coordination of agency services were proposed: a centralized, comprehensive referral and intake system; an inter-agency staff training program; or a consolidated outreach staff for all agencies serving farmworkers. Data tables and research instruments are appended. (JH)",

Proposed techniques are based on experiences of four pilot projects funded to develop effective coordination of Department of Labor programs that serve migrant and seasonal farmworkers; the organizational framework and specific goals of these pilot projects are summarized. Background information, illustrating the failure of the federal government to provide a model for coordination, includes discussion of problems experienced by federal manpower programs as a  result of program overlap, fragmentation, and poor information sharing. The special problems of farmworker programs are reviewed in light of the lack of coordination among the six federal agencies which serve or collect data on the farmworker. Principles of effective inter-agency coordination are discussed with emphasis on the need for identifying mutual goals and benefits, establishing well-defined agency roles and responsibilities, and communicating effectively with other agencies and with the client.

Organizational representatives and individuals responded to interviews and questionnaires designed to test perceptions, desires, and behavior. In addition to school and community college programs (considered the most important source of arts activities in most communities), art, civic, and social organizations in all counties provided many and varied arts-related activities including community art shows and concerts, community and professional theater, painting societies, choruses and  bands, drama lessons, and artist-in-residence programs. Respondents particularly enjoyed theater and annual community celebrations. Despite differences between northern and southern counties, the population surveyed was generally satisfied with current opportunities for participation in the arts, but dissatisfied with arts opportunities for youth and the arts activities available. Successful arts programming for rural areas must consider the individual character of target communities. Programs for youth stand a good chance of involving parents who normally would not participate in arts activities. (SB)",

        "description":"University for Man (UFM) has developed into a major national organization, impacting the worlds of lifelong learning, alternative education, and rural and community resource development. It was founded in 1968 when Manhattan, Kansas, residents secured several hundred dollars from the Kansas State University student government to organize seven courses, led by volunteers, free of grades, credits, and charge, and open to anyone. Based on the assumption that anyone can teach and anyone can learn, regardless of their formal academic qualifications, community projects have required seven developmental steps: (1) identification of interested community members; (2) formation of an advisory board to assist in planning, to avoid duplication of existing community services, to aid with  publicity, and to generate funding; (3) a survey to determine participants' interests and needs; (4) publication of program brochures; (5) distribution of the brochures; (6) registration of participants; and (7) presentation of workshops to provide support and guidance for lay teachers. UFM currently offers about 900 courses annually for over 12,000 Manhattan participants and has provided a vehicle to bring together, in a non-threatening atmosphere, people of all persuasions, with a common interest in learning and development. From this common base all kinds of activities can occur on personal, group, community, county, regional, and national levels. For example, in Manhattan a food coop, community gardens, a crisis hotline, a women's center, an evening childcare facility, and all forms  of political alliances have grown from courses offered through UFM. Similar developments have occured in other projects around the state of Kansas. Milestones in the growth of UFM have included the 1973 town-hall forums on public policy issues and a 1975 grant to replicate the Manhattan model of community education in 12 rural Kansas communities.

Most of the 1244 Aboriginals surveyed attended state schools and 75% were schooled in rural areas. Their attendance was regular but they had more extended absences than non-Aboriginal students. At the primary level (where the father's occupational ranking is the most significant factor affecting academic achievement), Aboriginal students performed consistently lower than non-Aboriginal students on academic achievement tests. At the secondary level, lower achievement by Aboriginals was especially evident in math and reading. Although  non-Aboriginals in primary school had more positive attitudes than their Aboriginal agemates, this difference disappeared in secondary school. There were no marked differences noted in educational or occupational aspirations, but more Aboriginal students left school at age 15. Specific to Victoria, results did not support the view that low achievement of Aboriginals could be attributed to poor motivation, poor self-concept, or dislike of school. Research is needed to study what factors determine whether or not a student likes school. (SB)",

        "description":"Between 1960 and 1970 economic opportunity and progress for women in American non-metropolitan areas was mixed. While women in metropolitan areas were more likely to be labor force members than were non-metropolitan women, the difference in metropolitan and non-metropolitan labor force participation rates narrowed during the period. For women between the ages of 35 and 44 there was almost no residential difference by 1970. Existing differences in labor force activity were not associated with commuting. In non-metropolitan counties women became an important labor resource, accounting for 89% of the job growth between 1960 and 1970, as compared to just 58% of the metropolitan job growth. Although non-metropolitan women were not forced into traditional rural pursuits, they were more  likely to hold low-wage clerical, operative, and service jobs. These lower status jobs accounted for most of the employment gains for non-metropolitan women in the 1970's. The decentralization of employment to non-metropolitan areas has created jobs for both black and white women where few existed before, yet the lower status of most non-metropolitan employment implies lesser social, economic, and personal rewards for non-metropolitan women workers.

        "description":"This study, presented at the 1979 meeting of the American Educational Research Association (AERA) in San Francisco, examines the relationship between a student's mathematical problem-solving ability and the nature of the student's recall of information from previously-solved problems. Seventy-seven seventh-grade students completed tasks measuring their initial perceptions of problem relatedness, their ability to solve verbal problems, and their recall of information from previously-solved problems. Results suggested that good and poor problem solvers differed in the nature of their problem recall. Good problem solvers tended to recall information about a problem's structure, whereas poor problem solvers rarely did. Nevertheless, poor problem solvers were sometimes able to recall  the details of a problem's statement better than were poor problem solvers. A significant transfer effect was found from the solution and discussion of one problem to the solution of a structurally related problem. (Author/HM)",

        "description":"Widespread concern over the use of calculators by young children prompted a broad year-long study of the impact of calculators on elementary school mathematics learning. Two teachers from each of grades 2-6 from five midwestern states participated in the study, which was designed to approximate a \"first use\" level of calculators in schools. Pupils continued to study from their regular mathematics textbooks and teachers were encouraged to select calculator activities from reference materials made available by the study. The experimenters made no attempt to prescribe calculator activities or a specific frequency of calculator use. The following conclusions seem warranted: (1) there are no measurable detrimental effects for the first-year use of calculators for teaching mathematics  in grades 2-6; (2) children have a high, positive attitude toward using calculators in mathematics; and (3) children learn to use calculators for computation with 30 minutes of instruction and can perform computations much more successfully than children not using calculators. Informal observations by site directors and teachers suggest that curriculum implications for calculators in the elementary school could be dramatic. The authors recommend further research on the effects of longer and more intensive calculator use. (Author/MP)",

In addition, the document should be helpful to preservice teachers because of its comprehensive explanations of developmental background of various skills. Three broad categories of skills are dealt with: (1) information acquisition skills (direct observation, using questions, using prepared sources), (2) information processing skills (comparing, conceptualizing, hypothesizing), and (3) self-management skills (decreasing stereotypic, egocentric, and ethnocentric perceptions). For each category, a  definition is presented, followed by skills, utility, lesson objectives, and long range objectives. Lesson objectives are grouped in sets of three according to appropriateness for various grade levels. Activities involve children in map and globe skills, grouping objects, and describing concepts (grades K-3); discussing information gleaned from stories and writing statements about testing various hypotheses (grades 4-5); and generating hypotheses from information presented and creating newspaper stories about suggested topics (grades 5-6).

They were selected on the basis of their utility in providing an understanding of citizen education, and their influence on existing programs. Citizenship education is defined as those programs and processes that can provide the knowledge, skills, values, and experiences people need for responsible citizenship. The booklet is divided into five sections. Section I discusses general literature, focusing on mainstream histories, pluralistic perspectives, and revisionist analyses. Section II examines changing attitudes toward citizenship education in the schools, listing documents about early guidelines and  curriculum patterns, later influences, and goal-oriented approaches. Section III notes information emanating from the business world. Section IV discusses labor education sources and their publications, such as union-conducted programs, university based programs, and community service involvement. Section V examines general volunteer organizations, community organizations, and foundations. Conclusions show that each sector of society emphasizes one or two of the learning areas (knowledge, skills, attitudes, and participation). For a national effort in citizen education, recommendations are that each sector be assigned responsibility for one or two skills, or all sectors redesign their programs to include all four skills.

The objective is to analyze the economic basis of progress in technical education. The document is presented in four chapters. Chapter I summarizes historical background prior to 1940, noting causes of frustration in efforts to develop technical education such as the economic weakness of the area and a tendency to value classical education more than technical education. Chapter II views growth in the economy and education during World War II, discussing British and American contributions to technical education, effects of wartime economy on industrial growth and unemployment, and the impact of that growth on  technical education. Chapter III outlines post-war trends and developments, including the establishment of institutes of technology and technical high schools, the impact of rapid urbanization and industrialization on the need for technical education, its accompanying growth in status, improvement of apprenticeship conditions and training, increased involvement by industrial companies, and mounting demand for skills education. Conclusions in Chapter IV reemphasize the influence of economic factors on education, changing attitudes toward technical education, and efforts made to relate education to the needs of the islanders. Recommendations include offering more trade training, short courses, and scholarships for teacher training, establishing technical education centers in the smaller  islands, and developing regional technical education centers.

The primary educational objective is to involve students in the decision-making process through role play. The game is designed to facilitate consideration of economic problems preceding construction; known economic, social, and political facts; and a wide range of alternative actions and their consequences. The teacher's guide describes the game, which takes place in 1792 in Boston. The game involves 19 players, whose problem is whether to invest capital in the building of the canal. Teacher and student materials are listed, decision rules are noted, and nine suggestions for orientation  are made. The guide includes a checklist intended to measure student data comprehension and interpretation, as well as 14 lead-in questions. The game itself contains one page noting the objective, time, and place, listing the cast, and stating the problem. Materials include 19 profile cards describing each role's vita, nine correspondence, population, and economic cards containing background information, an overview of the geography of the New England region, and a map of 1790 New England. Other relevant documents include a case study of the Middlesex Canal (SO 011 887) and a set of gas station maps of New England to be obtained by the teacher. &quot;Teaching with Case Studies&quot; (ED 100 764) would be helpful in using the material.

Economic, social, and political factors related to planning, building, and implementing the canal are considered. The document is presented in three parts. Part I states reasons for studying the Middlesex Canal. It was the first lengthy canal in the United States and served as a model for other canals. In addition, the problems that arose are typical of those that must be dealt with in relation to any type of transportation system. Part II describes events leading up to the canal opening in 1803, including legislative grants, court regulations, surveys, the introduction of the magnetic compass, and actual construction with its  concomitant employment and technical problems. Part III outlines events and factors affecting the rise and fall of revenues, and concludes with the canal's demise in 1853 following the growth of railroad systems. 1804-1815 saw growth and extension of the canal into New Hampshire, which helped alleviate competition with the Connecticut River. From 1816-1835, the primary problem was in making the canal more attractive than hauling by land, and cloth hauling from Lowell to Boston and back was set up. However, in 1836 the Boston and Lowell Railroad was opened and canal traffic dwindled until the canal was closed in 1853. Railroads were better adapted to Massachusetts needs, because they could operate year-round, cost less to build, and were available for all to use. (CK)",

        "description":"The document presents an introduction to the study of philosophy. It is intended as an aid to secondary school social studies classroom teachers as they develop and implement programs which help students understand the relevance of philosophy and appreciate philosophical thought. The document is presented in four sections--a general introduction and three modular units. The introduction describes philosophy's purpose and objectives and explains how philosophy can be added to the social studies curriculum. Unit I focuses on the origins of western philosophical thought. Topics discussed include transition from mythological understanding to philosophical reflection, search for order and harmony, identity and change, and the Aristotelian universe. Unit II discusses contemporary  western philosophy, including historical roots, traditional philosophical problems, and the value of a philosophy as a basis for an individual's philosophy. The final unit investigates the relationship between people and ideas. Topics discussed include the nature of man, freedom versus predetermination, and political philosophy. For each module, information is presented in chart-outline form on specific objectives, concepts and/or issues, supplementary materials, and learning activities. (DB)",

        "description":"Addressing the growing interest in qualitative research methodology, the paper describes the process and results of a team evaluation of a college day-care center. The purpose of the study was twofold: to conduct research which would provide team members an opportunity to develop skills in qualitative research methods and to assess the child care center's student teacher program. The five-member team first met with the coordinator of the center to establish the means of conducting the study, after which an abstract of the proposed study was presented. During the next three weeks team members engaged in proposal writing, methods study, or initial site visits. Fieldwork was conducted for the next five weeks. The physical and human settings of the center were documented and the  roles of the lead teachers and currently placed student teachers were assessed. Interviews with present and former student teachers, with the center's coordinator, and with academic personnel were also conducted. Next, team members investigated data to identify central patterns, and compiled a list of recommendations based on relevant anthropological theory. Recommendations included suggestions for making student teachers feel less exploited and isolated, for more formal structures in determining the student teacher's role, and for easing the burden of lead teachers. The author concludes that the team approach is valuable for in-process sharing and for accomplishing more in less time. (KC)",

Over 1,000 learners and 57 teachers who had participated in a Law in a Changing Society Workshop provided data for the study. The workshop provided participants with law-related materials and instructional techniques for standard social studies curricula at various grade levels. Classroom sets of data covered five subject areas: fifth grade United States History, seventh grade Texas Studies, eighth grade American History I, ninth through 11th grade American History II, and 12th grade Civics. Control groups were comprised of classes with teachers who neither attended the workshop nor received law-focused materials. Instruments  for both teachers and students contained affective and cognitive items. Results indicate that differences among teachers regarding content knowledge, instructional skills, and teaching experience result in cognitive attainment differences among classes of learners. However, the effect of the individual teacher is more pronounced in the upper grades. (KC)",

The objective is to provide detailed classroom lessons illustrating ways economic ideas can be taught at differing levels of difficulty. The 18 lessons are concept-based and can be modified for use in existing curriculum. They seek to develop economic literacy from the standpoint of the ways economic concepts are used in the decision-making processes of consumers and business managers, and how these decisions affect individuals as wage earners and citizens. Procedures such as group discussion, case study, comparison, analysis, simulation, systematic decision making, and evaluation are suggested.  Sample lessons are entitled: \"Consumer Marketplace Decisions,\"\"Competing for the Consumer's Dollar,\"\"Mass Markets, Advertising, and the Product Cycle,\"\"Market Simulation-The Big Apple,\"\"An Evaluation of Income Tax Provisions,\" and \"Shaping the Budget of a Local Government.\" Title, time required, recommended grade level, major and related concepts, instructional objectives, rationale, materials needed, teaching procedures, evaluation, and student handout sheets are listed for each lesson.

        "description":"The paper investigates the qualities which distinguish representative democracies from other forms of government, particularly direct democracies, dictatorships, and oligarchies. Representative democracy is based on the precept that political authority should be located in offices which are specified by a popularly ratified or accepted constitution and filled by contested elections. The hypothesis is that democratic values are morally superior to other political values. Representative democracy encourages citizens to adopt distinctive attitudes toward conduct, self-concept, and all authority in society as well as authority in political matters. Specific ways in which these attitudes are exemplified in a representative democracy include exhibiting independence of spirit in matters  such as voting, engaging in conscientious dissent, and seeking political office; understanding all interactions which can to any degree be understood as political; and accepting moral indeterminacy. In general, although representative democracy is committed to respecting the boundaries of the individual and the related separation of the individual and society from the state, it encourages a high degree of interaction between the public and non-public sectors. It is concluded that representative democracy is the best way to preserve democratic values in modern societies which have become much too large and complex to sustain direct democratic forms of government.

        "description":"An analysis of the treatment of political parties in four history and civics textbooks is presented. Three high school and one junior high texts, all currently in use, were examined to identify any mentioning of a political party. Variables included mention of all or both parties, the degree and locus of conflict mentioned, the context in which the party was mentioned, the presentation of issues, mention of the function of parties, treatments of patronage and corruption, and the subjective nature of the presentations. Findings indicated that third parties are generally ignored. Also, although the party function of policy direction was stressed somewhat more than had been anticipated, electoral functions were dominant in the treatments. Mention of excessive patronage and  corruption was far less than hypothesized; neither individual parties nor parties generally were portrayed as corrupt or overly indulgent in patronage activities. In analyzing the subjective nature of the texts, it was found that history books are likely to be more negative than positive while the reverse is true for civics books. Finally, the parties' stands on issues and party functions tended to be weakly illustrated. The author concludes that a sophisticated and dynamic conception of political parties is missing from the texts. Further, students do not understand why parties exist and what they actually contribute to the system. (KC)",

Findings show that 31 departments of education endorsed elementary and secondary arts education through policy statements; two out of three of those states reinforced their statements with dollar support; all states but one used federal funds for arts education; most frequently used federal programs were educational innovation and support, library and learning resources, education of the gifted and  talented, and education of the handicapped; state priorities for new funds would be inservice training and integration of the arts into the school curriculum; there was more cooperation in planning between the state arts and the state education agencies for the Artists-in-Schools program than in implementation and evaluation; and states with an enrollment of more than one million students reported greater involvement in arts education than those with fewer.

        "description":"This study of the federal government's evaluation of social programs indicates that it is virtually impossible to establish a bias-free, valid, and reliable system of inquiry to determine the effects of social programs. Divided into five chapters, the document examines the aspirations and limitations of evaluations, methodology, evaluation in the legislative and executive branch, and considers the need for continuous assessment. The authors point out that data for describing the nature and extent of social problems provide only rough approximations; although methodologies are sophisticated mathematically and statistically, results are not relevant. Also, federal evaluation efforts suffer from being conducted in an institutional climate that abounds with administrative barriers  and which perpetuates service to political interests. Although the General Accounting Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress, has maintained its reputation for independence, their studies offer little constructive commentary on what is feasible social policy. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) relies upon secondary sources for their evaluations. Finally, the reality of the world in which social policies are formulated and implemented is the most serious limitation of the usefulness of social program evaluations. Social programs are narrow, arbitrary, and fail to take full account of the global nature of many social problems. The authors conclude that the future role of evaluators seems to be that of analyzing program operations rather than passing judgment on program  impacts. (Author/KC)",

Major achievements of the NEA under Carr's leadership include creation of NEA regional offices, employment of consultants on teacher salaries, strengthening of NEA's research division, creation of  numerous fellowships for teachers and students, support for teachers' rights, and extension of the program of NEA's Commission on Professional Rights and Responsibilities. The biography concludes with enumeration of Dr. Carr's activities since his retirement in 1972, including graduate teaching, conference speaking, and active involvement with various professional education associations.

The report is intended for use by persons who administer, are affected by, and/or make policy decisions regarding the system of federal support for the production and application of knowledge of social problems. The report is presented in six chapters. Chapter I summarizes the report, with emphasis on expenditure of the two billion dollars per year which the federal government invests to acquire knowledge of social problems and work toward their solution. Information is presented on types of activities, organizational location, audience, and application of knowledge. Chapter II explains the focus of the study. Chapters III and IV describe the system of federal support  for research on social problems. Chapter V investigates problems which weaken government efforts toward an effective research-based understanding of social problems. Chapter VI recommends how the system of social knowledge production and application can be improved. Recommendations include systematic planning by federal research administrators, creation of problem-exploring research agencies, involvement of research-based knowledge from outside the government, and periodic evaluation of all work funded by the federal government.

The objective is to help students understand the world realistically, to point out ways each person shares in world problems, and to instill the knowledge that they can make a positive contribution toward a solution. An additional aim is to offer a series of foundational learnings necessary for futures planning and to introduce steps to use in that plan. The teacher's guide outlines objectives for 22 topics, such as issues and causes, change and the power to change, learning how to be creative, creating alternatives, setting priorities and goals, framing objectives, finding strategies, and planning  actions. Supportive learning activities are suggested for each topic including group essays, a debate, a mock trial, research, case studies, brainstorming, and evaluation. The student workbook contains activities reinforcing the concepts taught in each topic area. Sample activities include listing social problems and possible personal contributions to them, making deductions from a photograph, choosing one book to have on a desert island, ranking concepts, planning a personal utopia, setting social goals for the world in 2000 AD, listing contributions and hindrances to those goals, and planning specific objectives and actions that might lead to their realization.

It also offers a number of hypotheses regarding the emergence, maintenance, and elimination of sex discrimination. This document is presented in six parts. Part I focuses on sex role socialization, with particular emphasis on sex typing of behaviors, women's achievement and motivation, and women's educational and vocational choices. Part II discusses cross-cultural patterns of sex role socialization in selected developed and developing nations including Greece, Sweden, England, The United States and Tunisia. Part III examines occupational and educational sex discrimination, with  particular emphasis on race and sex discrimination against black women. Parts IV and V survey theory and research related to sex discrimination and sex stratification systems. The final part assesses changes in sex role stereotypes and identifies incongruities in men's and women's perceptions about values held by the opposite sex. Information is presented in essay form, with authors and dates of relevant research identified in parentheses after each major topic. A section of references concludes the document. (Author/DB)",

It attempted to (1) determine the interrelationships among the events and the final scores, (2) look for areas of difference compared to sub-8,000 point performers, and (3) decide whether the performance levels can be predicted on the basis of significantly fewer events. Compared to earlier performances, the results were more balanced in relation to the scoring tables, and the correlations among and between the events and the final scores were generally lower than in previous studies. In addition, it seems that elite-level athletes turn in a more balanced performance in their  non-specialty events than do lesser competitors, and that in training the higher-level decathlete, early attention towards developing all ten events equally towards an optimal skill level should be encouraged. It also appears that the use of predictive formulae are of little value when considering elite-level competition. (Author/LH)",

Male students were found to receive a significantly larger amount of encouraging teacher attention than did female students in 18 of the 21 classes sampled.

A survey of teacher planning practices was conducted to find out how teachers in general view the process of planning. Teachers described the various kinds of planning they engage in, factors that affect their planning, and the reasons for which they engage in planning at various levels. In the laboratory study of teacher planning, the ways in which teacher judgment is used to select teaching activities was investigated. In a field study of  teacher planning, case studies were made to trace the entire process of planning from inception, through elaboration and adaptation of the plan to fit a particular class, to implementation of the plan, and, finally, evaluation of the entire process.

They also exhibited superb task analysis and an expertise in coordinating teacher and student activities in the most efficient manner. The \"less effective\" managers appeared to suffer from the lack of a clear set of expectation regarding student behavior and student work level. They considered student activity  primarily on the basis of discouraging refractory deportment and did not display an adequately aggressive disposition towards positive student involvement.

        "description":"The measurement of change in quasi-experimental educational research was discussed. Problems related to measuring change exist to varying degrees in all research designs; these issues are less troublesome in experimental studies because the investigator can manipulate the interest variables and observe their effects on other variables. Measuring change is more difficult in quasi-experimental studies because the investigator lacks the freedom to manipulate the variables. This study focused on issues of change associated with the latter design. Specifically, this study utilized the non-equivalent control group design, in which the results of one or two pretests are available prior to the investigation. Four models, or solutions to the fan spread hypothesis, in which variables can  be used to predict change, were compared: (1) gains in standard scores; (2) single covariable analysis of covariance with estimated true scores; (3) gain scores adjusted for differential growth rates; and (4) multiple fallible covariable analysis of covariance. Methods (1), (2), and (3) were found to be suitable when the pretest-post test correlation of individual growth was unity. When this correlation was imperfect, methods (1) and (3) estimated the desired effect. (GDC)",

The utility of a simple pegword mnemonic for Army enlisted personnel, representing three levels of general technical ability, was examined. Half of each ability group was instructed in use of a rhyme pegword mnemonic and half served as a control group. Response items were rated in terms of their potential for evoking memory images. It was found that initial acquisition was a function of the imagery level of the response items, as well as a positive function of the general technical ability level of the personnel. It was also found that only the high general technical ability group was able to employ the mnemonic to advantage. The final  recall test indicated a precipitous lose of information across lists for all conditions. (Author/RD)",

The present study involved multivariate analysis of first through third grade achievement data in three Parent Follow Through communities. The three communities were a large southwestern urban area, a large southern urban area, and a small midwestern city. Two groups of children were included from each community: Parent Education children and comparison, or Non-Parent-Education children. The evaluation findings supported and elaborated the results of prior external evaluations of the programs. For the most part, the Parent Education groups performed equal to or better than the  comparison groups on measures of reading and mathematics achievement. In the smaller midwestern community, difference did favor the comparison group, but it could be demonstrated that this was due to the unavailability of an appropriate comparison group. In addition, there was some indication that achievement test scores of program children in this community converged on those of the more advantaged comparison children by third grade. The authors concluded with a suggestion that multiple evaluation techniques be utilized to accurately assess such program outcomes. (Author/RD)",

Four activities involved in attainment of this goal were discussed: (1) development of statistical logic needed to define the sampling distribution associated with the hypothesis to be supported; (2) examination of the role of Type I and II errors and power; (3) definition of effect size; and (4) generation of critical values on noncentral sampling distributions of a test statistic. Differences between the traditional procedure of rejecting the null hypothesis and the new procedure allowing support of hypotheses were discussed. Specifically, the new procedure specifies that the researcher must choose a trivial  effect size; that the level of significance the experimenter controls for is the Type II (not Type I) error rate; and that a noncentral sampling distribution is defined by the index of effect size and the degrees of freedom upon which the critical region is located.

What did appear to be a problem was the efficiency of the estimates. That is to say that while the estimates were not consistently off of the expected true value (bias), there was considerable inaccuracy in the results (inefficiency). Several recommendations were made with respect to selecting and placing into treatment and control groups. Furthermore, some concern was expressed over the use of the  regression model to evaluate educational programs at all. (JKS)",

Efforts to improve reliability reduced the scale from 24 to 18 items, and increased the number of principals rated. Three factors of effective leadership were indicated by the responses of 1,478 teachers who completed the APLS: (1) instructional leadership; (2) personal warmth; and (3) managerial  effectiveness. A refined scoring procedure was implemented to improve the meaningfulness of principal evaluations.

By generalizing the LIFE technique it can be applied to the situation of studying and predicting any dichotomous dependent variable.

Judgments by peers, supervisors, or teachers are hampered by low interjudge reliability, halo effects, and low discriminant validity. The latter problem is due to an inability to distinguish creativity from other constructs such as intelligence or achievement; or the inability to discriminate among dimensions of creativity, such as fluency, flexibility and inventiveness. Tests and inventories are best described as  correlates of real life creative behavior; they explain something about the behavior, but are not acceptable for selection. The most serious measurement problem is a lack of convergent validity among all these methods--correlations between methods are low. A simple and straightforward inventory of creative achievement appears to be the best measure because it is direct, observable, and validated in research as the best predictor of future creative behavior.

Nedelsky's approach requires that a rater examine each distractor within a test item to determine the probability of a minimally competent examinee answering correctly; whereas Angoff uses a judgment based on the whole item, rather than each of its components. The reliability of these approaches depends upon the extent to which raters agree in their judgments. Generalizability theory was used to quantify the magnitude of error variance in each procedure; to compare data resulting from each procedure; and to examine the impact of rater disagreement on test reliability. Five subject experts rated the probability of answering correctly for a total of 126 four-option items in a health-related  area. Both procedures were used by the same raters. Cutting score was assumed to be the observed mean (probability) over raters and items. In this sense, the expected variability of the observed mean was error variance attributable to the procedure used. Results indicated that both the cutting scores and their expected variance were considerably different for the two procedures, and suggested that differences between the procedures may be of greater consequence than their apparent similarities.

        "description":"Reflections on past and future uses of intelligence tests are presented. Three current approaches to intelligence tests are described: (1) neural efficiency, which relates the speed or quality of functioning of the neural system to test results; (2) information processing--cognitive micro-processes used in solving test items; and (3) psychoeducational, which relates classroom phenomena and test content. In projecting the future of intelligence testing, suggestions are made to discard the term IQ; to use commonly understood words; and to label specific skills by the content being tested, such as \"addition\", rather than \"quantitative skills.\" Predictions on the future of intelligence tests involve the reporting of separate scores, each of which reflects a distinct ability; use of a  different standard of measurement, rather than the IQ ratio; and a reporting system which will have greater educational value. Measuring the development of separate skills rather than an aggregate is recommended, as well as constructing tests related to classroom instruction that are designed to measure specific skills as they develop over the years. Comparable tests of the same abilities which measure children's competencies in the dominant language, as well as in the language of instruction, are also recommended. (MH)",

Data were collected for individuals who took the test; individual high schools; school districts; and counties. Although the analysis was incomplete, some conclusions were drawn: (1) information about the availability and desirability of taking the CHSPE was not made uniformly available by all schools; (2) test scores were positively associated with  the educational attainment of household heads and grades in academic subjects; (3) test scores were negatively associated with Black and Hispanic students and with having a language other than English spoken at home; and (4) students from upper socioeconomic backgrounds performed better than students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.

The proposed results of this program indicate that these urban impacts would have been minimal, but consistent with an urban policy that seeks to improve the economic viability of distressed urban areas. The program would have reduced the incidence of poverty, reduced income disparities among individuals and among urban areas, reinforced current regional growth trends, and concentrated fiscal relief on States now making relatively high welfare payments. While it would have distributed public service jobs toward urban areas with low per capita income, it would have failed to target them toward areas with the most serious  unemployment problems.

The administrative guide is designed to assist the principal in promoting the development of citizenship competencies. It is presented in five parts. Part I considers the importance of citizenship education for  schools and principals. Part II describes elements of citizenship education by defining civic literacy and identifying seven basic citizenship competencies such as acquiring and using information, assessing involvement, making decisions, making judgments, communicating, cooperating, and promoting interests. Part III explains how principals model citizenship behavior for faculty and students. Part IV discusses three ways principals can promote better citizenship education, including curriculum and instruction, school climate, and linkage of school and community. Part V suggests leadership strategies for principals. Eight appendices include a summary of citizenship competencies, evaluation sources, bibliographies, school climate checklists, and a community resource checklist.  (Author/CK)",

The guide is designed to help parents consider the problem of promoting good citizenship in a systematic manner, using a common vocabulary and a common set of guiding principles. The guide defines citizenship as comprised of &quot;the rights, responsibilities, and tasks associated with governing the various groups to which a person belongs.&quot; It also states that &quot;citizenship  education must involve learning and instruction directed to the development of citizen competence.&quot; Seven basic competencies are listed and discussed: acquiring and using information about political situations; assessing one's own involvement and stake in political situations; making thoughtful decisions regarding group governance and problems of citizenship; developing and using standards to make judgments; communicating ideas; cooperating and working with others to achieve mutual goals; and working with bureaucratic institutions in order to promote and protect one's interests and values.

        "description":"Descriptions of models for policy analysis in future studies are presented. Separate sections of the paper focus on the need for appropriate technologies of social science in future studies, a description of \"compact policy assessment\" (CPA), and a comparison of two CPA methods, Compass and Delphi. Compact policy assessment refers to any low-cost, short-term approach to project evaluation and decision making. It employs structured workshops to define key policy choices and issues, intensive short-term research on major points of uncertainty, special attention to lessons of historical experience in appraising new proposals, and use of concise, graphic reporting formats to gain early feedback. Both versions of CPA, Delphi and Compass, are designed to address complex problems with a  fairly simple procedural formula, offer results based on judgment rather than objective data, encourage divergent exploration of new perspectives, emphasize the value of fruitful tension between opposing views, and seek to economize on information processing. Differences include compactness (Compass is a half-day procedure; Delphi is more elaborate), definition of issues (Compass is open-ended; Delphi employs standard survey research techniques), and methods of handling differences of opinion. An illustration of the use of Compass in assessing educational alternatives projected to the year 2000 and a discussion on the use of CPA to achieve a more sophisticated role for all citizens, including children, conclude the document.

The objective is to foster and create more effective and equal education by better understanding the relationship between personal attributes and educational environment. The material is presented in 15 chapters. Chapter I discusses teachers' implicit theories of the teaching-learning transaction in relation to person-environment interaction. Chapter II examines the issue of creating environments for learning which are adaptive to individual needs. It suggests six principles for the design and implentation of adaptive school programs. Chapters III through XIII each focus on a personal attribute and its implications for school processes, policies, and research.  Topics are socioeconomic status, language, achievement and motivation, sex differentiation, ethnicity, culture, identity, health and nutrition, affective response tendency, cognitive style, and environment. Chapter XIV explores the current role of schools in relation to human diversity, recommending practices, programs, and research which would increase sensitivity to students. Chapter XV summarizes each chapter and the document as a whole. Recurring themes are a concern for setting or situational influences, person-environment interaction and its relation to behavior, the necessity of subjective evidence, and the problem of transcontextual validity. Conclusions are that personal dimensions of diversity must be examined and understood in the context of their interaction, and that most  effective development and learning are achieved when diversity variables are in balance.

Using data from the Survey of Income and Education (SIE) conducted by the Bureau of the Census and the National Center, the document studies Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Pilipino, and Vietnamese Americans. The objective is to relate nativity to current language exposure and usage. Data was collected from 160,000 households in independent samples from all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Findings show a wide variation between ethnic groups on all counts, and that birthplace is related to current language exposure and usage. Findings show that: 1) 57% of those studied were born in Asia, ranging from 33% of the Japanese to  almost all of the Vietnamese; 2) 66% of the subjects live in Asian-speaking households and 40% speak their mother tongue; 3) 60% of the United States-born Asians live in households speaking Asian languages, as compared to more than 80% of the foreign-born; and 4) 95% of the Asians who speak their mother tongue as a primary language were born abroad. However, fewer than half of the foreign-born use the Asian language primarily. The bulletin notes the data source, SIE related reports, percentage of error, and term definitions. Six tables conclude the report showing statistics for each ethnic group and its language characteristics including persons with English-language backgrounds, with Asian-language backgrounds, in English-only households, in Asian-language households, with English usual  individual language, and with Asian usual individual language.

        "description":"Eight papers which discuss rational and nonrational modes of knowing and consciousness and their relevance to educational practice are presented. Richard Jones in \"Looking Back and Forth on Consciousness\" considers two modes, the rational and the metaphoric, in a discussion of dreams. Alfred Kuhn discusses random variation and selective retention (RVSR) as operations of left and right brain. The combination of the two produce rationality. Maxine Greene focuses on imaginative literature as expressing an array of modes of consciousness. Arthur Wellesly Foshay in \"Intuition and Curriculum\" pleads for the legitimacy of intuition and offers several examples of how the intuitive leap may be encouraged in school. Ronald Lippit and Eva Schindler-Rainman in \"Knowing, Feeling, Doing\" call  for a fully linked person. The three elements in the title are necessary for the education of the whole person. Robert Samples makes a sharp distinction between right and left hemisphere activities and explains the dominance of the linear, logical, rationalist mode of thinking in schools chiefly through the lack of trust engendered in the classrooms. Mark Phillips describes confluent education, which recognizes and employs all forces present in classroom activity at a given time. John Haas discusses the term synectics, which refers to the unity of the metaphoric and the analytic in the creative process, and uses examples drawn from actual experience. The implications of all the papers are that there are many modes of knowing of which the rational is one and if we are to function fully we  ought to make full use of all modes. (Author/KC)",

The item pool contained 180 items concerning educational measurement that were calibrated separately by a one-parameter logistic model and by a three-parameter logistic model. The 110 undergraduate students were each tested at two sessions a week apart with both one-parameter and three-parameter tailored tests at each session. All tests were administered on a computer terminal. The results were studied for several  characteristics including: goodness of fit of the observed responses to those predicted by each model; the information function of each test compared to a fifty-item traditional paper-and-pencil test; the reliabilities of the tailored tests; and the content validities of the tailored tests. A unidimensional tailored test of vocabulary was also administered, with satisfactory results. The achievement tests generally produced unsatisfactory results, presumably because of the discrepancies from appropriate conditions. (CTM)",

        "description":"Simulated tailored tests were used to investigate the relationships between characteristics of the item pool and the computer program, and the reliability and bias of the resulting ability estimates. The computer program was varied to provide for various step sizes (differences in difficulty between successive steps) and different acceptance ranges (precision with which selected items must match desired item difficulties). Item analysis and ability estimates were based on a one-parameter logistic (Rasch) model. Item pools varied in size from 9 to 181 items, and in shape to include normal, bimodal, rectangular, and postively skewed distributions of item difficulty. In addition, item difficulty distributions were designed to fit either precise theoretical distributions or actual  test distributions. The acceptance range parameter was important because it influenced the point at which testing was discontinued; there was a fixed maximum of 20 items but a minimum in some circumstances of 4 items. Two different tailored test programs were used, TREE1P and SIM1P. Results were based on 25 simulated administrations under each of the various conditions. (CTM)",

        "description":"A national sample of 3,300 elementary and secondary school teachers, who had recently administered the Metropolitan Achievement Tests in their classrooms, responded to a questionnaire concerning various standardized achievement test issues. Teachers gave their opinion on: the amount of such testing in their schools; personal use of test results; possible test score applications; and various test moratoriums and other test-related policies. The teachers were instructed to base their answers on their attitudes toward standardized tests in general. Data were analyzed according to teacher's grade level (K-4, 5-8, or 9-12) and type of school system (small public schools, large public schools, or private schools). The teachers' opinions about the amount of testing in their system were  generally found to be positive. Grade level and system differences were small; however, high school teachers were generally more satisfied than elementary teachers. Nine percent of the respondents indicated that they made considerable use of test results; 48% made \"some\" use of test data. Specific uses and applications were also indicated. Responses favoring a moratorium against standardized testing involved intelligence tests, state-mandated achievement tests, and testing in large school systems or in the primary grades. Fifty-nine percent favored the use of competency testing results to determine high school graduation. (GDC)",

        "description":"College instructors evaluted the quality of their own teaching and were evaluated by their students in 331 different courses. Student evaluations of teaching correlated with instructor self evaluations in courses taught by teaching assistants, in undergraduate courses taught by faculty, and in graduate level courses, demonstrating their validity at all levels of university teaching. Both student and instructor ratings were reliable, and separate factor analyses indicated that the same nine evaluation factors influenced both sets of ratings: learning/value; instructor enthusiasm; organization; group interaction; individual rapport; breadth of coverage; examinations/grading; value of assignments; and workload/difficulty. Student-instructor agreement on each factor was independent  of the factor's agreement with other factors. While correlations between student and instructor ratings on the same factors were high, correlations between their ratings on different factors were low. This finding supports the distinctiveness of the different factors, as well as the use of multifactor evaluation instruments developed with the use of factor analytic techniques. These findings establish the validity and accuracy of student evaluations at all levels of university teaching, and suggest the possible usefulness of instructor self evaluations.

Input was solicited from students, parents, teachers, school administrators, and professors of  education. After factor analysis and intraclass correlations were performed, 63 competencies were chosen. These competencies were grouped into six categories: personal qualities, procedural and recordkeeping skills, instructional skills, classroom management skills, expertise in basic skills and subject areas, and interpersonal skills. In addition to teacher evaluation, one of the major goals in developing the evaluation instrument was for use in staff development purposes. Plans were formulated to compile the data from the evaluation forms and to analyze the ratings. (MH)",

It is pointed out that the funding of education through property taxes is not realistic in areas where there is a large concentration of Federal companies or military installations, and that Federal funds are necessary to equalize the education of children in these areas with the education of those living in high tax supported communities. It is  also argued that Federal funds should be made available for building and maintaining school facilities in areas where the low tax base cannot provide sufficient funds for these purposes.

Major issues addressed include: (1) police policies and practices that affect relations with the community; (2) the Memphis community's perspective of police treatment of citizens, especially minority citizens; and (3) past efforts to improve police-community relations in Memphis, including the involvement of the Federal government. Evidence is presented to show that misconduct on the part of some Memphis police goes virtually unpunished by either police or city and local officials. Numerous recommendations for the improvement of police-community relations are directed  toward the community at large as well as local and police officials. Recommendations are also made concerning the responsibility of the Federal government in preventing and combating the systematic denial of rights, including discrimination on the basis of race, in the administration of justice by local law enforcement officials.

The emphasis in this study is on the policies and practices which were either effective or ineffective in helping each of the principals deal with the task of managing a desegregated school. Different actions taken by the principals in response to student, teacher, parent, and community demands, and their respective consequences, are described and discussed. It is pointed out that despite the different approaches used by the principals in dealing with desegregation related problems, resegregation was the result. It is concluded that applied social research must be made more relevant to the issues and problems surrounding desegregation. Policy considerations  for such research are outlined. (EB)",

        "description":"Tuition aid plans that are contained in negotiated labor contracts covering one thousand or more workers were analyzed to describe their characteristics, identify barriers to worker participation, and recognize the benefits of giving employees financial aid to pursue courses offered on or off company or union premises. Procedures included a review of literature on the educational activities of workers and development of a conceptual framework for the process of tuition-aid utilization involving society, employers, unions, workers, and educators. Information was collected from matched pairs of fifty company and union officials and from 910 workers covered by the same contracts. Based on results, it is estimated that 1,600,000 workers are covered under 198 different negotiated  tuition aid plans. Four types of plans were identified: tuition advancement or reimbursement, educational leave and leave-of-absence, training funds, and scholarship and educational loans. From the findings on the nature of negotiated tuition-aid in the private sector and the problems and barriers related to its use by workers, program and policy recommendations were formulated. Program recommendations focus on the need for new information delivery systems, for better counseling services, and for improvement of linkage between work site and educational providers. Policy recommendations point up need for additional research on aid and educational opportunities for adult workers, for a federal interagency panel on labor education, for greater collaboration between those initiating or  operating tuition plans, and for better understanding of the issues by all members of society.

Subjects were married mothers, 53 from a community college (Group 1) and 109 from a state university (Group 2). A measure of home-career (H-C) conflict was developed for the study using four TAT-like narrative cues. Results indicated that story cues suggested negative consequences of various kinds to 41 percent of Group 1 and 43 percent of Group 2. Twenty percent of Group 1 and 17 percent of Group 2 responded with clinical \"denial\" to story cues presenting a women and child. Thirty-five percent of the continuing education women and 33 percent of the college women wrote stories which were neutral and reflected no conflict as long as  they viewed the mother's activity outside the home as occasional. Only four percent of Group 1 and seven percent of Group 2 wrote stories reflecting a harmonious blending of work and family roles, with positive effects for other members of the family. It was concluded that findings indicate the existence of the discomfort experienced by married women returning to college, and suggest some content validity for the H-C measure developed.

Based on a review of the literature, 123 competency statements were selected and grouped into seven areas: classroom management, planning, and teaching methods; coordination of cooperative vocational education; counseling and human relations; curriculum development; assessment of student progress and analysis of student needs; program management; and professional development. From this list a panel of consultants selected sixty-two competencies which were essential but not a part of the regular vocational teacher  education curriculum. Special education teachers, special vocational education teachers, and vocational teachers were surveyed using an instrument based on the sixty-two competencies. Survey findings indicated a high level of agreement between vocational teachers and special education teachers regarding the importance of competencies. In addition, it was found that special educators perform the competencies daily or weekly, whereas the vocational and special vocational teachers performed the tasks occasionally or never.

The mandate of NACAE is outlined listing several methods of involvement: annual reporting to the President, advice on policy matters and regulations, testifying before Congress, critiquing administration and effectiveness of programs, establishing a communications system, eliciting citizen involvement, developing policy recommendations for other adult programs, reviewing research needs, and disseminating findings. Committee structure and activities are listed along with a record of on-site visitations made. Minutes from meetings of the Council and a summary of the project on Urban Programs held in Chicago are given along with a case history of the Council's response to the President's &quot;National Urban Policy.&quot; Appendixes include the Adult  Education Act with 1978 amendments, lists of Council members and officers, and state allotments (1965-1980).

Summaries and critiques are given of two theories of occupational development of females: Zytowski's theory of the duality of women's roles and Psathas' theory of occupational choice for women. A review of literature in part 2 focuses on the three major hypotheses of this study, sex differences in (1) self-concept and sense of competence; (2) motivational aspects including related attitudes, aspirations, and  expectations; and (3) acquisition of educational means (knowledge, training, skills), which includes discussion on implementation and impact of career and vocational education legislation. Part 3 is a discussion of the most important socialization influences on the occupational development of women including influence of teachers, parents (attitudes, expectations, maternal employment, socioeconomic status), peers, and visual media. Part 4 is an overview by age level of those interventions to enhance aspects of girls' occupational potential. Description of the interventions are given with occasional delineation of effects.

It also promotes consumer awareness and access to information through the &quot;Consumer Information Catalog&quot; and a mail order distribution operation. Through research, the Center can learn the needs and wants of consumers, help make decisions about marketing and distribution of information, and select publications for the Catalog. One of three methods of research is the nationwide testing survey, performed quarterly on 2,500 households: it involves interviews in-home where subjects are asked to respond to twenty consumer titles. Responses are then organized demographically for future comparison. The second method is the catalog audience  survey designed to elicit responses to similar items from catalog subscribers. Finally, a sampling of 1,000 catalog orders is made for indications of preference. Overall results indicate a &quot;respondent effect&quot; due to enthusiasm on the audience survey and a significantly lower interest on the nationwide survey expressed by those over 65, those earning less than $10,000, and those with some high school education or less. When suggesting topics for publication, consumers consistently select similar items. Research results are used to establish consumer information priorities, and to target certain publications to certain demographic groups, and to reach less responsive audiences through radio, television, and the popular press.

Because study of the sociology of women and the family has been carried out primarily in the positivistic paradigm, the emphasis has been on the constraints of existing social arrangements as well as the description and analysis of these arrangements. Over-reliance on positivism has also meant over-reliance on the methodology of positivism, i.e., the use of questionnaires, scales, and other objective tests. A multiparadigmatic approach would allow researchers to ask a greater variety of questions, deal with feminist critiques of sexism, vary methodological approaches, and permit social policy decisions to be  made on a greater breadth of data.

This evaluation focuses on the impact of the Guidance Information System (GIS), a computer information system, developed by MOICC. Data indicate that GIS has had an impact on career awareness of its users, on goal setting and in decision making skills. It has little impact on self-awareness, a function not built into the files. Agency users have better knowledge of job-keeping skills than public school users. Many students were confused with the operation and use of the system, and counselors should be more available to help students. The computer is not an accepted or valuable tool for all students. Alternatives to  the GIS need to be developed. Data suggest a more precise strategy is needed to introduce potential users to GIS.

The assumption was that since texts can be analyzed at a variety of levels, comprehension requires a basic strategic coordination of processing activities. Forty second grade, fifth grade, and college students read and recalled stories under four sets of orienting instructions. These treatment conditions consisted of an intentional memory set and three secondary orienting tasks differing in the amount of semantic processing required. Adults' recall reflected the level of semantic analysis involved in the orienting task; the younger groups were only affected by the least semantic task. Beginning readers appeared to lack the processing flexibility necessary to  establish goals for reading and for efficiently achieving them. (Author/MKM)",

Each of 44 first grade and 22 kindergarten students was tested and interviewed three times during the 1977-78 school year, and their responses were sorted and tabulated to determine whether each of 22 hypotheses should be accepted or rejected. The hypotheses considered the order of learning letters and words in spoken/written contexts and how concepts about books and reading attitudes were developed. Four conclusions were drawn from the study: knowledge of letter names is present among all children who learn to read words, whether the letter names are learned in school or before entering school. There is a stage in  letter/word concept development during which a child believes that a word must be more than one letter. Children without the concept that print and not picture is read still are able to recognize words, but only those with the concept can actually read words. Some letter recognition ability may be prerequisite to performing satisfactorily on the Word Enumeration Task and to matching upper and lower case letters. (RL)",

Results indicated significant training effects on both tasks, that trained children did  particularly well on an appraisal task, that inadequate comparison processing contributed to children's poor communication performance, and that teaching children to engage in comparison activity facilitated performance.

It recommends that investigators should provide detailed descriptions of their stimuli, have standardization of stories across studies, and use extended story grammar analysis. The paper points out that this last technique would provide an explicit analysis of stimuli thereby helping in the  construction of materials containing the kinds of information the researcher wishes to depict for subjects, might suggest manipulations of stimulus content that have interesting effects on comprehension or evaluations, and might identify some of the types of information that have important effects upon children's moral judgments that might otherwise be overlooked.

Methodological issues of how speech acts should be defined in a plan-based theory are illustrated by defining operators for requesting and informing. Plans containing those operators are presented and comparisons are drawn from J.R. Searle's formulation. The operators are shown to be inadequate, but by refining the operator definitions and by identifying some of the side effects of requesting, compositional adequacy can be achieved. (Author/AEA)",

Such strategies should avoid use of prepackaged commercial kits and collections of articles (content-simulated materials) and should stress the application by students of comprehension strategies directly to the narrative and expository materials that they are required to use in their academic course work. This approach facilitates transfer of instruction and prevents assumptive teaching often found in college reading improvement programs. One strategy for guiding growth in comprehension is the guided writing procedure, which is designed to encourage active comprehension and recall of content area  material through a writing and discussion exercise. A second strategy is a brainstorming activity in developing content area vocabulary that emphasizes the active learning and retention of technical vocabulary from a content area unit. (Author/TJ)",

        "description":"The theme of this report is that recent theory and research related to the cognitive domain of children's comprehension of stories have implications for the social domain of children's understanding of interpersonal interaction, since there are important overlaps between the abilities necessary to comprehend stories about social events and those necessary in actual social situations. The report first discusses overlap at a theoretical level by describing similarities in the processes involved in understanding stories and in understanding social interactions; it concludes that comprehension in each domain involves the ability to make causal inferences among events, a process frequently dependent on the comprehender's prior knowledge about specific actions. It next discusses  overlap at a structural level by comparing the event structure of simple stories to that of actual social events, and it shows that event structure has implications for research on the development of social skills as well as for research on the development of story comprehension skills. Finally, the report describes some research that used a storytelling procedure to ascertain children's prior knowledge about one type of social event, friendship. Throughout, the report discusses how such cognitive research overlaps with other efforts to describe and train behavioral characteristics of successful friendship interactions. (Author/GT)",

        "description":"Comprehension monitoring was investigated by asking college students to read and recall passages that contained intentionally introduced confusions (inconsistent information, unclear references, and inappropriate logical connectives). Subjects were then told that confusions had been present and were asked to describe them and comment on how they affected comprehension. Subjects failed to report a surprisingly large proportion of the confusions. Confusions involving main points were detected more frequently than those involving details, and confusions of inconsistent information and unclear reference were more often reported than inappropriate connectives. Retrospective reports and analysis of the recall protocols revealed that failures to report confusions were often due not to  failures to monitor comprehension but rather to the use of repair strategies to resolve the potential problems.

Many of the problems concerning the teaching and learning of comprehension result from a lack of basic knowledge of comprehension processes; and although research is currently studying the comprehension process, a gap still exists between what is known and what is practiced. Research to translate existing findings into instructional strategies is sorely needed, and transmitting such information to teachers also  presents a problem. Continuing teacher education seems to offer both the greatest promise for improving reading and yet, in terms of time and resources, the greatest problem. (Author/RL)",

Several descriptive variables were associated with these roles. Those who worked in public relations agencies tended to indicate that a problem solver/manager role was most appropriate for themselves, while those in nonagency organizations tended to indicate that a journalist/technical communicator role or a good will ambassador role was most appropriate. Females tended to indicate that they saw their roles as journalist/technical  communicator, good will ambassador, or meeting organizer. The older the practitioners the more likely they were to indicate a public/community relations role as appropriate. The more experience in public relations, the more the practitioners saw themselves as problem solver/managers.

The linguistic concepts of immediate and transferred utterances and nominal-verbal pairing, and the work of L. Vygotsky on inner and external speech, support the premise that giving form to fragmented concepts and ideas is a sophisticated process transformation of bits and pieces of thought into syntactically articulated discourse that basically involves writing and connecting sentences. The four levels of basic writing can be defined as: (1) the simple transcription of inner speech; (2) transcription of inner speech with nominals inserted; (3) use of the  simple sentence as the primary tool of discourse with simple addition as the only rhetorical device; and (4) use of sentences with some coordination and subordination as connecting devices. Instructional activities in the basic writing classroom should include emphasizing ways to connect sentences rather than to construct sentences bringing sentence patterns to students' attention so nominal-verbal pairing might appear in their writing, suggesting punctuation that continues rather than ends a sentence, and using sentence exercises only as they affect the rhetorical connections the students attempt.

The findings revealed that at least three-fourths of all the newspapers surveyed were published weekly, biweekly, or monthly; had fewer than 20 staff members; were distributed free; contained paid advertising; were offset printed by a source not connected to the college; and had the typesetting or paste-up done by the staff. Cross-tabulating the environmental conditions with six satisfaction responses identified which conditions gave the most satisfaction. The most satisfied editors and  advisers were found to use a journalism course as their primary source of recruitment; to emphasize the use of AP/UPI newspaper style standards; to compensate staff members through money or academic credit; and to stress having the newspaper offices strategically located and highly useful to staff members.

Similar to multiple regression analysis, the described procedure has four steps that are based on information about periodic waves and their components, how to create models of wave components by using least squares estimations of amplitude and phase, the estimation of frequency, an algorithm for computing estimates in multiple component models, significance testing with these estimates, and harmonic analysis. The paper reports on the use of the procedure on data concerning news stories about the Concorde supersonic transport in the Washington, D. C., mass media, noting that the procedure's adjustments  to hypotheses about intervals between Concorde stories helped predict cycles in the data that accounted for large amounts of variance. The paper concludes that as communication data becomes increasingly time based, procedures such as the one described should become more prominent. (RL)",

        "description":"One of the most pressing issues for educational researchers is the utilization by courts of social fact evidence. The purpose of this research was to empirically analyze the performance of federal trial courts in a broad sample of representative cases. Using computer screening, a sample of 65 federal cases decided during 1970-77 was identified. Intensive studies were also made of two educational policy litigations, Chance v. Board of Examiners and Otero v. Mesa County School District No. 51. Inquiry into the legitimacy of judicial activism focused on the extent to which decisions were based on fundamental principles as compared with social policy factors, and the extent of representation of all affected interests in court deliberations. Analysis of judicial capacity emphasized  the courts' capabilities for assessing complex social fact issues, and the courts' abilities to implement effective remedies. The paper concludes that the courts exhibited a reasonably high level of capability to engage in policy-oriented fact-finding and remedial processes. The legitimacy of the courts' exercise of these capabilities in particular circumstances was strengthened by their tendency to concentrate their activities nearer to the principle pole of the continuum reaching from principle issues to policy issues.

        "description":"Researchers in the Procedures for Adopting Educational Innovations Program at the University of Texas have developed an &quot;Intervention Taxonomy&quot; to help classify and define interventions and components of interventions. It is hoped that this taxonomy will enable change facilitators and researchers to make conceptual and operational distinctions among actions and events that influence innovations. Data were obtained from descriptive protocols developed by ethnographers observing interventions over a two- to three-year period in school systems undergoing change. The data have been the subject of quantitative and qualitative analyses. As well as providing definitions, the taxonomy identifies several levels of intervention from policy level down to incident level. A distinction is  made between sponsored and unsponsored interventions and their components. Implications drawn from the study are that (1) a change effort succeeds or fails at the incident (lowest) level, (2) the &quot;game plan&quot; for a change effort should be specified in detail and in advance, (3) how long unplanned influences on the change effort are allowed to continue is directly related to the skill of the change facilitator, (4) developing stereotypic names to classify interventions may be useful, and (5) coding systems for other levels of interventions may be useful.

Pupil weighting systems are alternative approaches to funding the special needs of students. They establish formulas based on the relative costs of serving different types of students. Research presented in this report is based on interviews with over 200 policy-makers and educators in Florida, New Mexico, and Utah and on examination of five years of data from each of these states. The major divisions of the guidebook discuss what policy-makers expect from weighting, provide answers to the most  common questions about weighting, and review problems of implementation. An overview of the larger, technical report that serves as the basis for this guide is presented at the end. (Author/LD)",

Chapter 1 discusses state support for education in Pennsylvania and the method the state uses to distribute aid to its school districts on an equal basis. A step-by-step calculation of a district's state aid allocation is outlined, and exercises for understanding the state aid formula are provided. Chapter 2 evaluates the impact of the state's finance plan by discussing the way the plan addresses disparities both in the raising and in the distribution of resources for education. Property  wealth, tax effort, and expenditures among Pennsylvania school districts are also reviewed, and tables are provided throughout.

Dorothy Rich and colleagues list practical ways to involve parents directly in the education of their own children. Phyllis J. Hobson explains the organization of the District of Columbia Title I Parental Involvement Program and lists five essentials for parental involvement. Lois S. Steinberg reviews recent literature, discusses several new forms of parent participation and considers evidence of their potential  effectiveness. Suzanne O'Shea reviews court rulings and analyzes the rights of parents to withdraw their children from instruction. Delmo Della-Dora shows how parents can participate at each step of the curriculum planning process. Ned S. Hubbell points to population shifts (more than two-thirds of all adults now do not have children in schools) and says that the way to communicate with both parents and nonparents is to get them involved in school affairs. John W. Alden says that service as a school volunteer is a form of citizen participation that many people would rather perform than be members of advisory councils. (Author/MLF)",

An introductory section provides background information, including an overview of Head Start policies regarding handicapped children. Chapter 2 presents findings on the number, types of handicaps, and severity of handicaps served. Among results cited are that handicapped children accounted for 13% of the total enrollment in full year programs; and that the distribution of handicapped children categorized by primary handicapping condition ranged from 52.7% speech impaired to .4% blind. Chapter 3 summarizes the following types of Head Start services: outreach and recruitment, diagnosis and assessment,  mainstreaming and special services, training and technical assistances, parent services, interagency cooperation, and summer Head Start programs. Results of a 2-year study on mainstreaming in Head Start are included. Among four appendixes are survey results of handicapped children in Head Start by state. (CL)",

        "description":"The study involving two profoundly retarded, multiply handicapped children (8 and 11 years old) was designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the time delay/stimulus-transfer procedure and a progressive cue teaching strategy on the initial acquisition of verbal control over motor behaviors of Ss. The time delay strategy consisted of two components: the delivery of the verbal stimulus by the trainer and the completion of the motor response by the child, with or without the physical help of the trainer. The progressive cue strategy consisted of increased levels of trainer intervention until the child's behavior reached the criterion level. Data, recorded for each trial and probe, consisted of the sequential recording of trainer and child behaviors. The replication across Ss  clearly demonstrated that motor responses of profoundly retarded children can be modified by the application of a systematic teaching strategy. Results of both of the children's graphs suggested that the progressive cue procedure was not efficient in comparison to the time-delay procedure, and that the Ss may not have benefitted from the demonstration.

        "description":"A 1 year ethnographic study was conducted to investigate the possibility and better understand the process of role transformation of the school psychologist during organizational change, specifically regarding the delivery of mainstream services to special needs children under Chapter 766 (Massachusetts' law which mandates procedural safeguards and team delivery of educational services for handicapped students). To collect and analyze data, a team of investigators trained in ethnographic methods was used. In response to mainstreaming legislation, school psychologists assumed one of two roles: child advocate or member of the school's staff. Child oriented psychologists worked effectively in schools with low structure, participative organizations where they met with staff on a one  to one basis to develop program changes in response to the child's needs. School oriented psychologists were found to be effective in high structure, bureaucratically organized schools where they work with the staff as a team to serve the child through existing school programs. Other findings included that despite the mainstreaming legislative mandate to use collaborative team organization in special needs cases, many teams continue to function in accord with bureaucratic principles.

        "description":"Twenty-eight moderately and profoundly retarded children (9 to 17 years old) on one unit of a center for the developmentally disabled were taught a nonvocal symbol system based on that developed by D. Premack. Children varied in speech level from totally nonverbal to some who had simple language skills. The symbol system used a behavioral approach involving plastic shapes to represent words of varying degrees of abstractness. A prior pilot study (N=8) had shown that retarded Ss could learn such a nonvocal system. The present study showed that this larger group could also learn, although rate of learning was considerably slower, and amount learned was lower, when Ss' mental ages were at 2 years or below. Twenty-five slow learners with mean mental age of 1.9 learned an average of  10 words over a 6 month training period. Of this group, 13 also learned one and two word sentences, involving verbs. Three fast learners, with mean mental ages about 6 years, learned significantly more words and also combined these words into sentences up to nine words long. Matched control groups of 10 Ss each, on the same and different units, were given equal time, one-to-one interaction, and the opportunity to manipulate analogous material. Neither control nor training groups showed differences pre- and posttraining on IQ, MA, or vocalization. However, attention span increased significantly for the training group and decreased significantly for the controls. It was concluded that although there were wide individual differences in learning rate and amount, a nonvocal symbol system can  be helpful to permit at least minimal communication where no other mode exists and no other approaches have been feasible.

Generally speaking, the situation in both the country of adoption and the country of origin has changed radically since that time, as well as the situation of the migrants themselves. In order to indicate with some clarity the specific characteristics of the new Lebanese immigration, the causes, volume, and socio-economic factors of the earlier immigration are presented in the first section of the report. The remainder of the report is divided into three sections dealing with the  causes of the new immigration wave and the integration and acculturation of the immigrants. The causes of the new wave are discussed according to social, family, and individual reasons for emigrating. Integration is treated in terms of problems of adaptation, particularly living arrangements, and problems of integration in work, professional relationships, and primary group relationships. The material and formal acculturation of the immigrants is discussed in the concluding section emphasizing experiences of acculturation on the level of perception and on the level of affectivity.

Recordings of the speech of three children aged two to three were analyzed for spontaneous phonological, morphological, lexical, and syntactic repairs. After tabulation, repairs were identified as &quot;for the listener&quot; (reflecting the child's need to make himself understood) or &quot;for the system&quot; (reflecting self-monitoring of those parts of the language that the child is in the process of acquiring). A similar analysis was made of the speech of several children aged four to seven, in a pretend play situation. Here it was found that monitoring and self-correction were aimed at the use of speech appropriate to the role being played. The overall conclusion of the study is  that children monitor the gap between their knowledge of language from input received on the one hand, and their own language production on the other. This monitoring results in repairs which eventually close the gap. (JB)",

In a concluding article, Ringbam summarizes some findings. Swedish Finns, being accustomed to encounters with a language other than their own, seem to develop comprehension of English most easily. Swedes exceed  Finns in spelling errors, but Finns have a lower articulation rate; this reflects the differing emphasis on writing and speaking skills in two educational systems. The only difference in communication strategies among the three groups lies in the Swedes' greater use of paraphrase. These and other findings suggest a complex of factors affecting second language proficiency, including cultural conditions and relatedness of first and second language. (JB)",

The objectives of the study were: (1) to discover the nature and the importance of people's attitudes toward the Irish language and its restoration, and (2) to ascertain the degree of public support for political measures aimed at restoring the language. Because the success of language-related politics depends on public behavior as much as public opinion, it was necessary to discover factors favoring the learning and usage of the language, as well as factors mediating between public opinion and learning the language on one hand and knowledge and use of it on the other. Preliminary research was done in order to  derive the data for the opinion poll in the main portion of the study that would be based on real opinions and not opinions the people were supposed to have. The results of the study were analyzed under four headings: linguistic competence, utilization of the language, language attitudes and the inter-relationship among these three factors. The conclusions considered valid for all linguistic minorities were that political independence alone does not insure linguistic survival, and that intensive compaigns promoting the language can intensify positive attitudes by they will not necessarily modify language behavior.

        "description":"Errors can be considered concrete representations of stages through which one must go in order to acquire one's native language and a second language. It has been discovered that certain errors appear systematically, revealing an approximate system, or \"interlanguage,\" behind the erroneous utterances. Present research in second language acquisition is largely concerned with these approximate systems in order to characterize the learner's psychological process operative in the creation of such systems. Researchers intended to use the data to develop a new approach to language instruction that would facilitate the learning task and make the acquisition of the second language more efficient. The present study concentrates on: (1) an analysis of the more important theoretical and  experimental studies in error analysis and the concept of interlanguage, and (2) the bearing of this research on second language instruction. Concepts related to language teaching are clarified and developed, such as selection and ordering of things to be taught, scientific versus pedagogical grammar, and communicative versus linguistic competence. The concept of teaching reduced systems based on learners' needs rather than the whole language is considered, and a proposal is made for the establishment of a reduced system that could serve as a basis for teaching methods and materials. Three specific aspects of \"reduced systems\" are treated: phonological, lexical, and morphosyntatic. (AMH)",

Assessment is defined as a more complete challenge to both the process and the content of a student's learning, achieving a more personal, specific and integrated view of her developing competence. The book raises several inevitable questions (e.g., reliable observing, accurate sampling of a student's abilities, defining appropriate criteria), and explains how the faculty of this small, urban Catholic college for women discovered assessment as essential to their approach to liberal learning. It is shown that the authors' view of competence as &quot;generic,&quot;&quot;developmental&quot;  and &quot;holistic&quot; requires certain qualities in each Alverno assessment technique. Ways in which faculty members design assessments are demonstrated, as well as how assessors are recruited and trained. In one chapter, students reflect on the experience of being assessed and learning to assess. A final chapter reviews the elements of the college's assessment system, and assessment's impact on the faculty. The book repeatedly stresses beginning with a clear focus on the outcomes to be assessed, in developing individual techniques or an overall system. It is emphasized that assessment is a learning experience for students and faculty alike. (Author/LBH)",

        "description":"The third in a series of four monographs, this study focuses on Black engineering students at Purdue University who persisted, withdrew, or transferred. A survey of the students was conducted to determine factors that influence retention and attrition of Black American students in engineering. A comparison of the pre-college and college characteristics of Black and non-Black freshmen engineering persisters, transfers, and withdrawals is also included. Survey results indicate that the prevailing reasons for attending Purdue were its academic quality and the type of academic programs available. The more important reasons for studying engineering related to salary, job opportunities and an interest in problem solving. Most Black students who were admitted to Purdue but later  cancelled, attended college elsewhere, usually in engineering. Engineering persisters were more apt to be achievement-oriented and more often participated in professional activities and programs designed to assist Black students. The transfers changed their career decisions most frequently due to low grades and lack of interest. The survey also indicated that college grades were much more significantly and positively related to persistence in engineering for both Black and non-Black students than pre-college variables. It is concluded that admissions policies primarily based on relative high school performance and supportive programs appear to be the keys to assuring Black Americans equal access to engineering careers. The survey instrument and sample survey responses are appended.  (Author/SF)",

The theoretical framework, methodology, and working model developed in this study are designed to reduce the uncertainty associated with long-run forecasts of the demand for higher education and provide a tool that will be of continuing use to the planning community. Enrollment is predicted by examining two factors. First is the complex economic and demographic phenomena that jointly determine the size and distribution of the population pool feeding higher education. Second is the network of environmental and behavioral  relationships that determine participation rates in higher education. The study concludes that enrollment will peak in the late 1970's, remain essentially stable through the early 1980's, and then decline steadily until the mid-to-late 1990's. Other conclusions drawn by the study suggest that four-year institutions will fare slightly better than two-year schools and female enrollments will grow relative to males. Tables include statistical information on economic projections, enrollment patterns, structural equations, and exogenous variables.

        "description":"Alternative techniques for analyzing student outcomes were investigated. Two traditional statistical methods (one-way analysis of variance and two-way analysis of variance) were compared with an innovative input-output analysis. The input-output analysis is a two-step analysis consisting of a regression analysis to determine the relationships among input and output variables and an analysis of variance of the residuals grouped by treatment to determine treatment effect. Student outcome data used in the study were generated in a typical classroom experiment comparing three different methodologies of presenting material to students. Pre- and post-measures of student achievement on a final exam were taken. Some measures of student input characteristics, including grade point  average, age, sex, year in school, and residential status, were also taken. While the traditional analysis techniques failed to show any treatment effects, the input-output technique showed one of the treatments to be superior to the others. It is suggested that the traditional analysis of change scores in experimental research may not be directly applicable to most research conducted on students. The treatment effects on student outcomes may well be a function of input characteristics and an interaction over time for individual students, which are not always discernable with traditional statistical analysis techniques. However, the input-output analysis allows for these problems by including other input characteristics in the analysis and allowing for the separation of data by  individuals. It is concluded that student outcome research could benefit from the application of the input-output technique. (SC)",

It is suggested that although it is a basic tenet in instructional development that teaching improvement is closely linked to effective evaluation, it is ironical that most instructional development programs have themselves been evaluated only superficially, if at all. There is very limited evidence that teaching practices and learning effectiveness have been substantially changed as a result of the instructional development. Evaluation strategies on three levels are discussed: (1) activity within the program, which can be monitored in terms of number of contacts made and distribution of instructional materials; (2) attitudes can be measured (teaching, learning, and program); and (3) the collection of  empirical evidence for changes related to improved learning and teaching. In practice most evaluation of instructional development programs has been confined to the first two levels. A recent informal survey of instructional developers in several countries revealed that not only are evaluation efforts scarce, but many instructional developers are resistant to the very notion of formal assessment of their activities. The reasons for this, such as budgetary considerations, are explored. (Author/PHR)",

        "description":"Developmental education and underprepared entering college students are discussed in light of the increasing diversity in college student bodies. It is noted that larger numbers of older students are gaining access to higher education. Although specialists in the field of developmental education are equipped to deal with the problems of these new students, it is suggested that the average faculty member is not. Diversity is continuing to increase in student bodies, but volume or enrollment rates are remaining stable or declining. Problems created by these concurrent conditions center around demands for change and setting of priorities. It is recommended that efforts be focused on helping faculty members deal more adequately with diversity in their classrooms while keeping cost  increases to a minimum. Special services such as counselors and tutors may be too expensive and it is recommended that students must assume more responsibility for their own learning. More alternative educational options should be made available such as: off-campus programs, flexible scheduling, and credit for prior learning. Advantages and disadvantages of these nontraditional approaches are discussed. The importance of reorienting the educational system to create self-directed learners is emphasized. (SF)",

        "description":"Trends and changing conditions likely to affect state higher education boards and their functions, and responses to the changes are the focus of this paper. Three underlying factors are identified--that all changes will not affect all states in the same way, that no two state boards are exactly alike, and that many of the more recently established boards, in particular, were set up to deal with rapid growth and may not be designed or empowered to function with the radically changed conditions. Among the changing trends identified are enrollment projections and demographic information, growing fiscal restraints, increasing concern with accountability (especially at the state level), recognizing social justice issues (for such groups as women, the handicapped, and the economically  disadvantaged), and the relationship between the higher education board and the executive and legislative branches of government. It is concluded that the picture is more one of gloom and doom than bloom and boom, but that it also offers the opportunity for the development of a leaner but healthier system of higher education. Six recommendations are made, including that more attention be directed to performance criteria. (PHR)",

A 24-item questionnaire was developed and 89 usable questionnaires were returned from women administrators in Pennsylvania. Subjects were classified into one of three position categories--major academic, middle academic, and major support. Background characteristics, such as age, marital status, and education, are reviewed. Findings revealed that many women had changed positions recently; the majority of women, however, have built their careers in one institution. Forty percent of the women said they anticipated a move to another position within the next five years. As to the question of a mentor, only about one third of the major academic  respondents indicated that a mentor was important to them in their careers. The other two categories of women administrators were split nearly evenly between those who had mentors and those who did not. The majority of women felt that having held a particular position was the significant career influence. As the findings were limited to Pennsylvania, the sample was considered too specific to permit generalizations. (PHR)",

Of major concern is the impact of increased student charges on enrollment levels. Rates of participation in public postsecondary education in California are among the highest in the nation and student charges are among the lowest. The costs and benefits of California public education system are examined in detail and data concerning state expenditures are tabulated. Various methods of setting student fees for both the two- and four-year institutions that are discussed include: cost-of-instruction method, charges based on the level of the student and on comparison to similar institutions, community college charges based on credit/noncredit distinction,  charges based on future earnings of the student, and charges based on anticipated deficits in segmental budgets. Studies investigating the impact of price on the demand for higher education are reviewed. From these studies components of a model for assessing enrollment affects are presented and four possible student fee policy options are examined in depth. It is concluded that any appreciable increase in student charges would reduce enrollment in all public postsecondary segments and diminish educational opportunity in the State of California. (SF)",

This report focuses on issues relative to married couples with children and specifically to college faculty couples. Modifications in life style required in these circumstances are discussed and it is suggested that while educational equality for men and women is increasing there are relatively few dual career marriages. Traditional career advancement is viewed as discriminatory toward women. Women's professional career patterns are examined and four stages are noted: (1) marriage; (2) childbearing; (3) professional preparation; and (4) the assumption or resumption of professional practice. The distribution of  household and parenting responsibilities is discussed as well as financial problems and the effects of dual career marriages on children. Specifics of various types of marital relationships are discussed as they relate to the success of dual careers. Competition is viewed as a substantial hurdle in dual career marriages. Conditions that employers and society can create to make dual career marriages easier to attain are proposed. It is recommended that rational, cooperative decision-making will augment the success of a dual career marriage. (SF)",

The benefits of patenting are outlined and it is suggested that these benefits provide justification for initiating a program to increase disclosures. Important considerations when establishing such a program include: analysis of the institution's objectives and potential disclosure output, utilization of program results, and faculty/administrator cooperation. In creating an invention disclosure organization it is recommended that a patent committee be formed to determine the institution's patent policy and budget guidelines. The formation of an office of invention administration is discussed along  with the role of the invention administrator. Identification of patentable inventions is viewed as an essential component of an invention program. Also important are: written communications, seminars, and inventor follow-up. It is suggested that simplifications of written invention disclosures and their proper handling will encourage inventors to seek patents. Recommendations are also provided for disclosure evaluation. It is concluded that this type of program recognizes the rights of the faculty and institutions to receive a fair share of royalty income. (SF)",

Various impacts of information systems on institutional research are  also reviewed, including issues of data quality, control of the system, and the degree of system integration. It is suggested that effective utilization of information systems centers on communication between processors and analysts. The need for institutional information systems to adapt to the rapidly changing climate of academe is emphasized. The role of on-line data base systems is discussed and the impact of state and national information systems is examined.

        "description":"The historical development of academic advising, the methods employed to provide this service, and the interrelationship of this process with other campus constituencies are examined. Academic advising in American higher education has evolved from a routine, isolated, single-purpose, faculty activity to a comprehensive process of academic, career, and personal development performed by personnel from most elements of the campus community. The most common advising delivery systems include faculty advising, professional staff advisors in advisement centers, and peer or paraprofessional advising programs. The advising and registration functions provide an effective interface for cooperative effort, and another administrative interface is consolidated under the area of student  affairs. The most obvious interface in the advising program is with the faculty, primarily through development and implementation of the curriculum. Three primary conclusions are drawn from the analysis of the literature on academic advising: (1) advising cannot be done in isolation; (2) there is no single formula for a successful advising program; and (3) academic advising will play a more prominent role in the future of higher education. A bibliography and eight recommendations that could be used by institutions as they assess their advising program--including implementation of assessment studies and reward systems--are included.

Concurrently, two observers recorded in the children's school environment incidences of successful resolutions of interactions, amount of derogation, and the number of times a child was approached by peers. A positive relationship was predicted between moral development and frequency of success, proportion of success, and number of times the child was approached by others. Negative relationships were predicted between morality and frequency of unsuccessful responses, proportion of such responses, and derogation. The same predictions were made for social problem solving and the behavioral variables. Vocabulary  was the disciminant cognitive variable; thus, no relationship to behavior was predicted. Results confirmed the positive relationship of the moral variable with proportion of successes and numbers of times subjects were approached by peers. Further, the predicted negative relationship between the moral variable and proportion of unsuccessful outcomes held. When vocabulary was partialed out, these relationships did not hold for social problem solving reasoning. As expected, vocabulary did not relate to competent social behavior. The results support moral judgment as an ecologically valid social cognitive construct. (Author/SS)",

        "description":"Written for professionals who design and teach in preschool programs this paper reviews research on memory abilities of young children and examines the relationship between knowledge and memory among preschool children. Preliminary research of the hypothesis that elementary school environments press children to develop memory strategies is reported. Parents of preschool children and teachers of pupils in the primary grades were interviewed and surveyed. Questions focused on home and school learning, memorization requirements at home and at school, and parent and teacher behaviors related to memorization demands. Data provide some support for the schooling press hypothesis. The memory abilities of the preschool child are characterized as unintentional and bound to the immediate  and concrete goals of the activity in which the child acts. Preschool children do not seem to conceptualize memory activities as a distinct part of the on-going activity. Since preschool children do not realize the need to remember as they enter a situation, the adult must first present and emphasize the importance of remembering. Memory tasks should be arranged within the context of some activity that is meaningful for the child. Preschool children do not consciously employ memory strategies. Adults should provide situational means for remembering. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"In recent years various structural approaches have been used in the United States to improve the delivery of elementary and secondary educational services to rural students. Post World War II interest in reorganization of local districts into larger administrative units has shifted to three other approaches popularized in the 1970's (each with supporters and opponents), i.e., provisions of specialized services from decentralized state education agencies (SEAs), formation of special district education service agencies (ESAs), and development of education cooperatives. A current study of characteristics of 31 networks of all types of service agencies in 26 states reveals that a majority of the Special District ESAs are making more significant contributions of programs and services  to public Local Education Agencies (LEAs) than a majority of the Regionalized and Cooperative ESA networks. Most Special Districts have a more comprehensive, faster growing staff. Federal involvement in all three approaches appears crucial. Regional SEA/ESAs enjoy more state involvement and Cooperatives have more public LEA involvement. The federal government should adopt a consistent funding policy for ESAs and all districts should receive their fair share of services. Federal school improvement efforts should take advantage of the unique ability of ESAs to service rural schools. (SB)",

The district implemented a Curriculum Development Center, a bilingual/bicultural program, and new staffing patterns. In 1974 the district also contracted with Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory for the Rural Futures Development (RFD) Strategy, a method of achieving significant educational innovation via broad community support while preserving local control. Six education agencies helped plan for the Strategy activities which included selection of four facilitators, needs assessment,  identification of three School Community Groups (SCGs), determination of educational concerns, and facility planning. By 1979, when 50% of district Navajo students attended public schools, the RFD Strategy of community involvement had resulted in passage of a $7 million bond issue, construction of one high school and planning of another, SCGs in every county community, and increased communication between educators and the community. In addition, the district had produced many Navajo language instructional materials and employed Indians in professional and paraprofessional positions. (SB)",

By law funding formulas must consider two criteria: relative district wealth, often determined by property values, which have a low correlation to median family income; and concentration of low-income families, which depends on the number applying for aid at often inaccessible rural agencies or on historically underestimated rural unemployment rates. Inaccessibility and transportation problems can limit participation dispersed populations. Rural vocational education may not provide diversified skill training to offset rural underemployment or skills essential for rural living, such as auto repair. Rural conservatism and values  may block implementation of nontraditional federal policy, such as women's education. Self-employment, self-reliance, and wide-ranging skills are rural values which run counter to those implied by imposed schedules and industrial specialization. (SB)",

Rural women of all ages need locally available educational services including intensive literacy programs, job preparation programs (especially focusing on small business entreprenurial skills), and programs focusing on their rural values and heritage. They also need career planning to help with skills identification and development, and sensitive counseling regarding their problems Once trained, rural women  need expanded and improved employment opportunities. The forceful implementation of existing federal policy could offset sex discrimination in public employment. Local education programs could help private employers reconsider their discriminatory practices. Finally, rural women need access to services, or to information and training that will help compensate for the lack of services. Federal policy can help by providing research on rural women, good educational programs based on rural strengths and values, and independent funding of rural and metropolitan programs. (SB)",

The primary role of rural schools is to instruct in basic content areas and career preparation, not to solve non-school problems. Realistic federal policy, related to specifically targeted federal dollars, should: deal directly with rural isolation problems in the delivery of staff development programs; focus on the recruitment and training of promising residents of  specific rural areas for teaching careers; support the development of specialized training programs for teachers of rural children; and support the development and implementation of teacher training programs for both early childhood and adult education.

An effectiveness study of 14 currently used U.S. rural education reform strategies reveals that successful strategies are highly congruent with community cultural setting and perceived needs, support and are supported by an important community sector, and are long lasting, low-budget programs. The &quot;one-best-system&quot; approach often seen in consolidation efforts is unsuccessful because rural schools are unique in their values, staff,  and perception of total education. Rural education would be improved with better leadership and better teachers, access to services available to urban systems, more direct community involvement, heavily federally funded model systems, and more adoption of proven educational practices. State and federal eudcation policy should consider rural community differences, rural education development capability should be nourished, and alternative solutions to rural education problems should be encouraged.

A characteristic lack of education and employment opportunities is combined with a restricted realm of attainment in rural areas. Rural people are negatively stereotyped by the mass society, as seen in an examination of linguistic terms describing rural people and activities. This results in cultural oppression with very real consequences in the competition for education and jobs. Social research findings regarding the positive relationship between attainment and social origin, and the influence of &quot;significant others&quot;, have positive implications for the success of rural youth programs that encourage achievement. Research on adolescent formation of adult attainment  attitudes among rural youth reveals rigid sex stereotyping in occupational choice. This critical difference in the individual processes of achievement between rural males and females is a crucial target for program development. The single most effective policy alternative would be to explicitly identify the rural youth population as a special needs group in existing government programs. Research and development in the areas of occupational knowledge acquisition and transition from education to work in rural areas is needed. (SB)",

        "description":"A complex and multi-faceted problem faces those seeking to provide special education to the thousands of handicapped children residing in the nation's rural areas. The major challenge facing rural administrators is how to deliver special education effectively to small numbers of handicapped children who are probably scattered geographically. A rural district may contain a wide range of handicapped conditions spread over multiple grade levels; few teachers can deal with such a diverse array of conditions. Rural districts tend to be those lowest in income and cannot easily supply facilities or special equipment or recruit specialists to provide the range of special educational services required by state and federal laws. Regionalization of several school districts can allow for a  wider range of services, but often the distances involved are prohibitive. Federal, state, and court mandates have given rise to a number of training, analysis, and resource coordinating activities, and the 1970's have been a time of great expansion and change in special education for rural areas. The U.S. Bureau of Education for the Handicapped has invested in such endeavors as 16 Regional Resources Centers, 19 Direction Service Centers, and a number of collaborative agreements with other major federal agencies. Efforts undertaken within individual states are described at the conclusion of this document and the author lists a number of recommendations for future efforts. (DS)",

The incomplete and fragmented education migrant children receive is further compounded by low expectations from teachers and inappropriate curriculums. Legislative action has attempted to address the special needs of migrants through numerous health assistance, housing, nutrition, job opportunity, and educational acts. The Migrant Student Record Transfer System was instituted to gather, store, and transmit student academic and health information. Although the national migrant program is working to provide solutions to migrant problems, findings from a review of the literature, research and state evaluations indicate  areas for improvement. Some recommendations are that (1) the Migrant Students Record Transfer System Data Bank should be more timely and should also be used for gathering; (2) long range plans for the national migrant program should be developed; and (3) duplication should be eliminated in agency services to maximize the use of resources. This report reviews relevant literature and research pertaining to the migrant population, reports on legislative actions, and makes recommendations for consideration in decision making and policy development.

In Alabama the Tuskegee Institute cooperates with philanthropic organizations and federal, state, and local governments in developing a wide variety of programs. A grant by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation established the Human Resources Development Center which was designed to coordinate all outreach programs to address the needs of rural people in the 12 Black Belt counties of Alabama. The Mott Foundation aids  community education; the Ford Foundation provides management training to certain agriculture cooperatives. Others involved in the Institute's work include the Rockefeller, W.T. Morris, Ushkow and Twenty-First Century Foundations as well as such organizations as the Heifer Project International, Lutheran Church, and Control Data Corporation. Federally supported social, education, and economic programs are also carried out; state and local governments lend what assistance they can. To truly understand rural conditions, a staff of Institute people go into the rural areas, talk to the needy people, discern the actual problems, and determine what is being done or can be done to provide services.

Four teachers plus Title I Migrant aides used a team teaching approach to provide specialized counseling and raise student achievement to that of the peer group. Oral language development was reinforced using Buy's &quot;Speaking By Doing&quot;; reading improvement was based on the Westinghouse PLAN kit; and social studies programs were centered around thematic film units. Project evaluation consisted of standardized testing, teacher observation, and academic success of students in other classes. In 1976 the  program was changed to 18 individualized quarter courses including media study, reading skills, economics, American culture, Mexican culture, and Spanish. Proration of all students into the courses eliminated stigma but caused problems due to the inflexible guidelines created by various federal funding agencies. Therefore, it was recommended that all federal programs should be consolidated using Title I supervisors to regulate funding applications; all eligible students should be labeled &quot;disadvantaged&quot;; and annual funding should be based on the number of students plus a percentage of additional monies. Brief descriptions of several program courses are included. (SB)",

        "description":"For educational delivery systems to meet the needs of special rural populations of minority children, teaching and learning strategies must take into account the three factors of human identity, culture, and ruralness itself. Children who are members of special populations often have an even greater need than most children for recognition, acceptance, and development of self-esteem. Their racial and ethnic culture must be considered and they need to know about their own cultural heritage. Negative prejudices based on race, ethnic origin, and social class status permeate our educational system; these attitudes can damage self concept, sense of environmental control, and students' interest. The individuality of students must be recognized, their respective backgrounds accepted and  understood, and building done on the strengths populations the children bring to the classroom. The academic performance of minority children is also hampered by such teacher behavior as using inappropriate curriculum materials and expecting less of the children. These special populations of children frequently come from homes not oriented toward school and educators must devise more creative, imaginative, and innovative approaches to teaching and learning. (The author has a distinctive perspective on the education of special rural populations as he speaks from his own experiences as a minority member, a person raised in the rural South, and as an educator.)

Bicultural instruction was inherent in the program which used both languages for a portion of all the curriculum. On a budget of $271,530 the program served over 1400 elementary students in six schools using 6 1/2 professional staff, 20 teacher aides, and 7 support staff. Students receiving Spanish instruction met objectives regarding acquisition of basic concepts and improved language proficiency, but not Spanish reading skills. Students receiving English instruction met English reading objectives. The program met most objectives  regarding staff training, supervision, materials, team teaching, and bilingual aides, but not the important objectives regarding curriculum development and parental involvement. Compared to students not in the program, students in bilingual classes learned more Spanish and as much English. It was recommended that the program be continued at all six schools and be available to all Spanish-dominant students and to those whose parents want them in a bilingual program. Other recommendations were that the position of parental involvement specialist be discontinued and that teacher training emphasize using teacher aides effectively. (SB)",

To address the need for Indian heritage to be presented without bias, use of stereotypes, or perpetuation of myths, the Commission on Indian Services established a working committee representing Indian communities to conduct an intensive review of 29 grade 4-12 United States history textbooks scheduled for possible adoption by the state of Oregon in 1978. Community committees composed of Title IV staff and concerned parents reviewed 7 or 8 tests using uniform criteria established by the working committee and the State Textbook  Commission. The criteria evaluated such aspects as: accuracy of data; Indian history as an integral part of American history; Indian culture as a dynamic process; national and worldwide contributions of Indians; the special social, economic, and political position of the Indian in American history; religious and philosophical contributions; illustrations; overall objectives of the text; presentation of content; style and tone; and learner appropriateness. Six texts were judged acceptable, 3 were acceptable if supplemented, 1 was found not applicable, and 19 were rejected as unacceptable. Specific strengths and/or weaknesses were cited for each text.

Interviews with both agency representatives and randomly selected household repondents examined the health and social services delivery systems in such areas as agricultural extension, alcohol and drug abuse, day care, counseling, family planning, employment services, and medical services. The study addressed specific problem areas, their possible causes, services gaps, types of services needed, and inadequately served geographic areas. The greatest needs identified were for medical services, public transportation,  improved housing, day care, improved roads, and social and employment services. The single most important barrier to overcome in increasing utilization of existent services was one of cultural obstacles: the feeling that it is somehow wrong to accept free or reduced rates for services even when the need is great. Better service delivery could also be provided by (1) the development of services based in rural areas or branch offices, (2) the decentralization of service delivery, and (3) the development of special transportation programs. Existing community buildings also stand under utilized and could be used to house service facilities. (DS)",

The songs, never directly naming the deceased person, tell of how much the person is missed by his family and friends and of the good deeds the person did when he was alive. The songs fall into three basic types: (1) the mask dance songs, sung with the typical Eskimo words accompanied by the beating of the hand drum; (2) the washtub songs, to which the people dance around a peeled spruce pole moving a piece of calico up and down with their  hands; and (3) the stick dance songs, sung only during the proper time at the Feast for the Dead. Each song is presented with lyrics in Athabaskan and English, a brief history of the subject of the song and its composer, and appropriate illustrations by Dinah Stephenson.

        "description":"Indian students who have withdrawn from public schools for various reasons may receive alternative education at Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Boarding Schools, but they may also face academic, environmental, and personal problems. Attending a boarding school involves a radical culture break. Students are often far from home, deprived of parental guidance, family support, and cultural reinforcement. BIA schools have historically discouraged the use of the students' native tongue. Students are plunged into a strange, faster-paced environment with confining rules and regulations. Often there is little counseling and many students feel no one cares about them. Peer pressure can be intense. The curriculum itself can be a problem in that many students are one to three years behind in  academic skills even though they are of average or more intelligence. This contributes to a high dropout rate. As a result students become dependent upon this strange new system, its rewards, and its objectives. They exhibit depression, anxiety, and poor self-concept, and tend to abuse alcohol. Indian students can help alleviate the problems inherent in boarding school life by making and communicating openly with close friends at the school. Schools can help by aiding the transition to boarding school life. (SB)",

An attempt is also made to illustrate training in mathematical modes of thought, sometimes labeled problem solving or creative thinking. A second objective is to define and illustrate some classroom procedures and their psychological bases, which are appropriate for all levels of instruction. The third objective is to assist teachers and supervisors in extending and applying the ideas of the book in their own situations. Chapter topics include number and operations, relations and functions, proof, measurement and approximation, probability, statistics, language  and symbolism, modes of thought, implications of the psychology of learning for the teaching of mathematics, and promoting the continuous growth of mathematical concepts.

        "description":"This report is a study conducted by the Australian Council for Educational Research to evaluate the influence of science material resources, provided under the Australian Science Facilities Program, on science education in Australia. Under the Australian Science Facilities Program some $123 million was spent, between July 1964 and June 1975, on laboratories and apparatus in both government and non-government schools. The study is based on the examination of three levels of impact of the program: (1) the impact of the program on the standard of science facilities in schools of different types; (2) the influence on the standard of resources on the quality of science teaching; and (3) the effects of better resources and different teaching methods in student achievement. In addition,  an exhaustive examination of the administration of the program is reported. The report shows that while there was a general improvement in the standard of resources for science teaching over the period of the program, some schools with inadequate facilities remain. Questionnaires used in the study and a list of references are also included. (Author/HM)",

Following the completion of the program, several recommendations were presented. The project staff and consultants generally felt: (1) that study in instruction and math content should be coordinated; (2) that programs in preparing teachers to teach math should be upgraded by consulting mathematics faculties, education faculties, and public school personnel; (3) that school experience  should be included in the coordinated content-methods instruction; and (4) programs in teacher training in mathematics should contain at least two mathematics courses.

The information presented is related to decision-making by policy makers and prospective graduate students. Included are the measurement instruments which were developed to sample 24 doctoral programs in chemistry and psychology and 25 in history. The study concentrates on quantifiable measures of both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the programs. The study begins with a presentation of the program characteristics which were judged important to quality of doctoral programs. The first few chapters cover background and purpose of the study, the study procedures and program purposes. Each remaining chapter focuses on data analyses and conclusions related to ratings of  departments as measures of program quality, faculty training and performance, student abilities and achievement, quality of resources and environment, program contents and procedures in each department, and alumni accomplishments and opinions. An appendix divided into seven sections presents: (1) communications with participating universities; (2) institutions which participated; (3) Deans' ratings of program characteristics; (4) copies of the various questionnaires used; (5) characteristics of programs and questionnaire respondents; (6) scales formed from individual questionnaire items; and (7) examples of feedback reports to individual programs.

        "description":"This document is part of a series of chapters described in SO 011 759. Working from the premise that temporal analysis is indispensable for the study of change, the document examines major alternatives in research design of this nature. Five sections focus on the features, advantages, and limitations of temporal analysis. Four designs which concern both quantitative and qualitative outcomes are evaluated: panel, event-count, event-sequence, and event-history. Panel designs record state occupancy of a sample of units at two or more points in time; for example, voters disclose voting intentions in a sequence of surveys leading up to an election. An event-count records the number of different types of events in an interval (employed, unemployed; married, not married). An  event-sequence design records the sequences of states occupied by each unit and is useful in a study of careers. An event-history design records timing of all moves in a sequence. For example, a study of collective violence recorded the dates of all such events greater than some minimal scope. Conclusions are that event-counts, event-sequences, and event-histories permit much finer model testing and should be used more often in sociological research. Also, sociologists have begun to devote more attention to modeling change processes which permit richer use of temporal data. Finally, the need to examine linked changes in quality and quantity is expressed. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"This technical document, part of a series of chapters described in SO 011 759, describes a basic model of panel analysis used in a study of the causes of institutional and structural change in nations. Panel analysis is defined as a record of state occupancy of a sample of units at two or more points in time; for example, voters disclose voting intentions in a sequence of surveys leading up to an election. The author first defends use of the model by comparing it with a more complex alternative. Three arguments for using the basic model are presented: that the basic model approximates the true causal structure, that the model relates levels of X and Y to changes in X and Y, and that the basic model is a reduced-form of the proper model which allows for causal effects over the  study period. The next section identifies special methodological issues, outlines strategies for addressing them, and cites relevant technical literatures containing more detailed treatment. Issues include autocorrelation of disturbances (variables omitted from the study such as material infrastructure), technology, cultural organization, national history, the assumption of constant error variance, measurement errors, and functional forms of relationships.

Addressing the question of effective models to measure change and the change process, the author suggests that linear structural equation systems may be viewed as steady state outcomes of continuous-change models and have rich sociological grounding. Two interpretations of the models are reviewed: negative feedback and partial adjustment. In seeking to strengthen the relationship between structural equation methods and continuous-time dynamic analysis and to provide an integrated treatment of qualitative and quantitative outcomes, the author discusses six issues. The questions of deterministic or stochastic models, linear models for rates of change, time paths of change (integral equations), linear systems,  and comparisons of linear systems with some widely used alternative models are examined.

Eleven sections comprise the report. The first considers two broad approaches to empirical studies of SDEs: estimating structural parameters directly from integral equations or using discrete approximations. After arguing for the first approach, the author addresses issues such as autocorrelation of disturbances,  unit-specific effects, pooled cross-section and time series estimators, fixed effect estimators, random effects estimators, Monte Carlo studies of small sample properties, and unequally spaced observations. A continuous-time perspective for dealing with problems of analyzing unequally spaced panel data is proposed. The report concludes that researchers can make use of available methods to solve many of the practical problems that arise in applying continuous-time, continuous-state models in sociological research.

        "description":"The document, part of a series of chapters described in SO 011 759, examines sociological research methods for the study of change. The advantages and procedures for dynamic analysis of event-history data (data giving the number, timing, and sequence of changes in a categorical dependent variable) are considered. The authors argue for grounding this analysis in a continuous-time stochastic model. This approach permits the data to be fully utilized and allows a unified treatment of the many approaches that use only part of the information of this data. The report focuses on the familiar continuous-time Markov model, summarizes its properties, reports its implications for various outcomes, describes extensions to deal with population heterogeneity and time-dependence, and outlines  a maximum likelihood procedure for estimating the extended model from event-history data. The discussion is illustrated with an empirical analysis of the effects of an income maintenance experiment on change in marital status. Event-history analysis is contrasted with cross-sectional, event-count, and panel analyses. The conclusion is that event-history analysis has substantial advantages over these other approaches.

        "description":"The document, part of a series of chapters described in SO 011 759, considers the problem of censoring in the analysis of event-histories (data on dated events, including dates of change from one qualitative state to another). Censoring refers to the lack of information on events that occur before or after the period for which data are available. Unless censorship is dealt with, researchers are likely to make erroneous inferences about the change process. The report considers several approaches to estimation when event-histories are censored. A constant rate (Poisson) model is considered because the methodological issues are more easily understood. Models in which the rate of an event depends on exogenous variables or time and in which there are multiple kinds of events are also  analyzed. The report then discusses approaches to estimation based on maximum likelihood (ML), pseudo-maximum likelihood, the method of moments, and recent work by statisticians on methods that make weak parametric assumptions. The conclusion is that an important advantage of the ML approach to the censoring problem is that it is easily extended to different data structures and different models. (Author/KC)",

The document contains a programmed text, a pronunciation guide for archaeological terms, and a multiple-choice test. The bulk of the document, the programmed text, proceeds according to a question/answer format. Students are directed to fill in blanks, complete language puzzles, match correct responses, define terms, and circle correct answers. They are then directed to proceed through the text to find correct responses to the questions. The pronunciation guide lists and divides into syllables over 25 vocabulary terms from the programmed text. The archaeological methods test presents 50 multiple-choice questions  based on the text. An answer key is provided. Also available to accompany the unit is a tape to aid students in acquiring the new vocabulary. (DB)",

        "description":"Major arguments and background of the worldwide land reform debate are reviewed. In developing nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the control of farmland remains a principal key to wealth, status, and power. Rural landless peasants at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder, estimated by the World Bank at more than 600 million people, are unable to meet basic needs such as food, fuel, shelter, education, health care, and family planning. Review of international agricultural output data indicates that the economic case for land reform often rivals the social case for redistributive policies. Not only do grossly skewed land ownership and oppressive tenancy conditions have social consequences, they also result in a system which uses land and capital less efficiently than  small family farms. In addition to increased crop output, the economic case for land reform also rests on self-propelled economic development, full employment, and political and economic stability. However, although United Nations officials and diplomats from developing countries realize the contribution that land reform can make to agricultural progress, land reform is generally avoided by political maneuvering. The conclusion is that if developing nations combine land redistribution with population stabilization and intelligent use of foreign capital, they will generate more equitable and efficient land use.

The case study projects are designed to be used in primary, intermediate, junior high, senior high, and college, and are organized into five chapters by grade level. Chapter I suggests ways to teach economic concepts in grades K-3 through activities using a minisociety simulation, a classroom corporation, discussion of economic roles throughout history, and building a house. Chapter II, for grades 4-6, focuses on neighborhood economics, comparison of interdependence in bees' systems with that of humans, the role of transportation in society, and the economics of running a school. Chapter III offers projects on the relationship of economic  and political decisions through use of a simulation, a work experience painting classrooms, a study of market economy, and career education for junior high school students. Chapter IV, for high school, teaches practical economics to low-income students, some of them slow learners; economic concepts within a western civilization context; and consumer education. The concluding chapter, for college students, focuses on economic concepts and issues analysis through studies of the market system. An appendix at the end of each chapter provides brief overviews of additional courses and programs in economic education. For each case study, information is presented on grade level, project background, time allotment, objectives, activities, and evaluation. (CK)",

It uses a content-cognitive schema which covers seven content categories (basic economic problems, economic systems, microeconomics, macroeconomics, world economy, economic institutions, and evaluation concepts), and two cognitive-level categorizations: one measuring student learning levels in terms of knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, and evaluation; the other in terms of recognition-understanding, simple application, and  complex application. The booklet presents five suggestions for use of the test, instructions for how to administer and score it, and details technical data such as standardization and norms, norm tables, item analysis, reliability, validity, correlation with general ability, and additional descriptive statistics. Part II consists of an explanation of the 72 questions in Form A and Form B. Each question and its four possible answers are reproduced, with the correct answer appearing in bold type. Other items include a rationale for each answer, and numbers recording the percentage of the norm with the correct answer (with and without economics background) and the discrimination coefficient.

This study was designed to compare participant and nonparticipant observers' perception of teacher nonverbal behavior as having encouraging or discouraging affect qualities during a teacher-learning process. Five ninth-grade teachers volunteered to participate in the study. Seven students were randomly selected from the stimulus teacher's class, and seven former teachers were chosen as the nonparticipant observers. Video tapes of regular classroom behaviors of teachers and their interaction were made. After editing, the tapes were viewed by the students of the class (participants) and the nonparticipating observers.  Questionnaires designed to reveal how the nonverbal behaviors of the teacher were interpreted by the students and observers were filled out following the viewing. The findings suggest that participants and nonparticipants do not perceive the nonverbal behavior of the teacher similarly. The findings of the study also show that it is possible to define and demonstrate the relevance of a number of nonverbal cues that each group of raters used as predictors or reasons for their assessment of the teachers' behavior. Appendix A presents the table used for rating teacher behavior and the cues responsible for ratings. Appendix B contains a presentation of the responses of the students to the questionnaire. (JD)",

The teacher was observed over a full school year. This teacher perceived his class as a cohesive, interacting group and he, as its leader, demonstrated the behaviors he wished his students to model. The result of this teacher's perspective was a class with a strong sense of unity. The classroom curriculum was group-centered and carried out by the group, with the teacher as leader. Outside intervention by the principal or other staff members and directives from parents had little or no effect on the classroom curriculum. The reported observation of this teacher lends support to the notion that teaching remains  an individual enterprise dealing with present-oriented situations in the classroom. In this case, the teacher's classroom perspective was, essentially, the curriculum of the classroom. (JD)",

Results suggest that not only will teachers' conceptual systems influence what they learn from inservice efforts, but also how much they want to try to use what they have learned. (JD)",

Since the study focused on determining the effect of Title I programs beyond one school year, the sample included students who did and did not continue to receive Title I services. It was not possible to determine whether each student had received these services prior to the study. Findings were based on the assumption that without Title I intervention, standard scores on the California Achievement Tests would remain at the same percentile from one testing period to the next. After the first year, students who left the program scored significantly higher than their counterparts; both groups exceeded scores expected without Title I intervention, using pretest  scores as a basis of comparison. After the second year, using first year posttest scores for comparison, students were either at or below the level expected without treatment. Use of the original pretest score as the comparison criterion may be the most reasonable approach, since it is unlikely that disadvantaged students can maintain rapid rate of achievement gained during intensive remedial instruction.

Subjects performed similarly on the three formats across the six grades tested. No one test format was better than either of the others within or across grades. But there were significant mean differences in scores obtained under the three formats overall. These differences ranked synonym, synonym in context, and cloze in order of difficulty from easiest to most difficult. When subjects were stratified by reading comprehension ability, scores on any one format were not significantly  higher overall, than scores on either of the other two formats. Some differences did appear for the stratified groups. Low comprehenders scored higher on synonym than on synonym in context, and intermediate comprehenders scored somewhat higher on cloze than on synonym in context. It is possible that further differences in vocabulary performance might appear if children are grouped into finer categories of comprehension level. (Author/RD)",

On the basis of teacher evaluations with respect to each item's clarity, relevance to classroom learning, and ability to be accurately rated, a 72-item scale was developed. After field testing and item analysis, a 40-item scale remained with an internal consistency reliability of .98. The 40-item CBRS was then given to 158 students, with  similar reliability estimates.

Twenty-seven commercially available standardized tests, none norm-referenced, were identified for testing mathematics or French as a native language; only two were published in Ontario. No French-language tests were available for other subjects. Although a large number of  English as a second-language tests were examined, none were considered worthy of analysis. Analysis with respect to the secondary school curriculum in Ontario indicated that no test covered more than 20% of the curricular objectives. Very few norm-referenced tests were available; objective tests developed by a single teacher were used by 75% of the departments surveyed.

It was argued that since California used intelligence tests to ascertain who should be placed in programs for the educable mentally retarded (EMR), and since blacks performed less well on the tests than whites, it was the tests which caused too many blacks to be assigned to EMR classes. Blacks' poor performance on intelligence tests--particularly the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale--was claimed to be due to test bias. The criteria for test bias included the following: items were drawn from the white middle class culture; whites had much more prior experience playing with toys; the language of black children may not  have been compatible with that of the test; the race of the examiner may have motivation and affected performance; and the test's standardization sample was basically white. The final objection to the continued use of intelligence tests was that such tests keep the schools from educating black children. (An overview of the evidence presented by the defense is provided).

        "description":"The first paper presented at this conference on the evaluation and effective teaching of nursing students discusses the theoretical perspective on evaluation--that is, steps in writing and validating tests. A worksheet on multiple choice item types, with examples appropriate for nursing education, is included. The second paper discusses the clincial perspective on evaluation and offers a model for relating curriculum objectives to behavioral and communication skills observed in clinical settings. It emphasized that clinical evaluation is a highly value-laden entity requiring careful planning, systematic ongoing evaluation, and a commitment to specific beliefs about performance evaluation. A third paper defines cognitive style mapping and discusses the impact of training nursing  educators in this technique. A fourth paper describes replicable teaching strategies which conference participants had successfully used to involve students in their own learning. Implications of cultural diversity for teaching and learning is explored in another paper. Finally, a remedial program which provided counseling and developmental courses in reading, science, and mathematics is described. The program, designed for culturally diverse students, has specified cognitive and affective skills necessary for beginning nursing students. Two textbook readability measures, the Fry Readability Scale and the Cloze Procedure Test, are briefly described. (CP)",

Six interrelated content and process skills were identified: (1) functioning within social institutions; (2) using science and technology; (3) using the arts; (4) communicating; (5) solving problems; and (6) clarifying social values. Major research projects were conducted on the three COMP instruments (the open-ended Measurement Battery, the Objective Test, and the Activity Inventory) with college freshmen, college  seniors, postsecondary vocational-technical students, and mature adults. An advisory panel report evaluated the results of these projects, concluding that the COMP instruments have achieved reasonable validity, reliability, and cost effectiveness. Furthermore, these field tests indicated that the six skills are affected by college education, and do correlate significantly with effectively functioning adults. (GDC/CP)",

The attitudes of students from high attrition courses were compared to the attitudes of students from low attrition courses to identify those attitudes related to course attrition rate and to compare attitudes related to student performance at different levels of student attrition. Many similarities were found, but differences suggested the importance of motivational factors. Male and female attitudes towards the training experience were found to differ in several areas. While some differences  referred to specific aspects of training, most appeared to be reflecting the differences in attitudes between a group with experience in a particular environment (men) versus those of a group entering a relatively new experience (women). The attitudes related to performance for men and women were found to be very similar with some indications that women were having greater difficulty with some aspects of the academic work. These findings and the application of this methodology to other subsets of the existing data base are discussed. The TTSS is appended. (Author/MH)",

Proper interpretation of the CTBS, or any school district testing program, requires a sound understanding of its validity and reliability, and of the composition of the national sample relative to the students tested. It is easier to interpret test results by displaying percentile ranks, standard error of measurement, and frequency distributions in graphic form. As for releasing test data to parents and the news media, a formal report should be released at the district level, after first informing school district staff. The report should  relate the purpose and results of the tests to school/district objectives, describe the students tested relative to the national sample, and compare results by year and by school. At the beginning of the school year, parents should be informed of the testing program, and results should be explained to individual parents in a parent-teacher conference. Followup meetings and press conferences are recommended for discussing programs to improve achievement. (CP)",

Robert L. Thorndike commented on proposals, practices, and procedures for estimating reliability. Anne Anastasi reviewed recent approaches to the study of validity. During the session devoted to test use in medicine, John P. Hubbard described a method used to test the diagnostic competence of interns. E. Lowell Kelly reported on an extensive investigation of predictor and criterion variables of  concern to medical schools. Jerome S. Bruner presented the luncheon address on human development. Warren G. Findley discussed current theory and applications in the appraisal of cognitive ability. Non-cognitive aspects of student performance were treated by Samuel Messick, who considered the portential contribution of personality assessment techniques to the prediction of college success. The final speaker was Robert L. Ebel, who spoke on the social consequences of educational testing. (BH)",

This conclusion was reached after a content analysis of teacher evaluation instruments used in New Mexico schools. Items focusing on the instructional role constituted only 28% of the items in the rating scale instruments. Other factors used in teacher evaluations included personal characteristics (30%); administrator/manager role (14%); social role (12%); professional role (7%); organizational membership role (7%); and student achievement (1%). The results also suggested that organizational conservatism and stability, rather than change, appear to be highly valued. From a supplementary analysis of teacher evaluation  instruments dating from the turn of the centruy to the present, it was concluded that the secondary emphasis on instructional role has been a persistent characteristic of teacher evaluation over the years.

Other problem areas discussed include the &quot;teacher drop-out&quot; syndrome, the diversity of present day classrooms, special education needs, and external demands such as accountability movements and legislative requirements. Four projects which relate to urban settings and reflect the philosophy of action-oriented research are described.

However, a long-range security program requires more than enforcing regulations. The role of school security is to influence the development of an educational climate where the classroom atmosphere is peaceful. The responsibilities of security officers should emphasize the importance of preventive security measures. For this purpose, a teamwork approach is necessary. Also, security officers should strengthen ties with students, administrators, school staff, and the community. In dealing with students, school security officers have to understand the students' point of view. In order for security measures to be effective, the security force and the administration need to agree  on job descriptions and policy goals for the security program. Parents and community representatives must be convinced of the need for school security. In addition to daily actions for school security, a contingency plan for disruption is needed. This plan should include provisions for building safety and security; personal safety and security; administrative control of operations; emergency communications systems; and police involvement.

Strategies developed by the program to promote a particular  kind and amount of verbal interaction between teacher and day care pupil are listed. Objectives of this language intervention approach and methods employed for achieving these objectives are outlined. Two examples of results from this program show that the program is accomplishing its goal of preventing retarded intellectual development and improving linguistic performance.

For example, there have been three time periods with different educational purposes during the last forty years. For each of these periods, there were implicit assumptions made about why we educate, how we educate and where we educate. The first period devoted to \"democracy in education,\" was replaced by \"equality of educational opportunity,\" and was followed by the goal of \"equity in education.\" Each of these assumptions has been influenced by changes in social goals, leaders, politics, scholarly research, and human and financial resources. Also, each has had its own policies and practices. If the current educational goal of \"equity in education,\" is to be achieved, society  must express its commitment to this educational purpose. The place where such a purpose can be fulfilled is the school. (Author/EB)",

At least three distinct theories have been presented to explain this racial segregation. The \"class\" theory claims that, due to disproportionate overrepresentation of blacks in lower income classes, they will be overrepresented in lower quality housing markets. The \"discrimination\" theory posits that blacks are excluded from white neighborhoods by such practices as whites refusing to sell to blacks, mortgage discrimination, etc. The \"voluntary\" theory claims that both blacks and whites prefer to live amid neighbors of the same race and thus \"self-segregate\" themselves into racially homogeneous neighborhoods. In order to test the third theory, research was conducted in two mid-Western  cities on segregation preferences. The findings support the hypothesis that blacks prefer racially balanced integrated areas, while whites prefer all white areas. (Author/RLV)",

        "description":"Although classrooms vary in design and populations, there are certain features that are common to virtually all classrooms. These include the crowding of pupils, the compulsion of school attendance, and the expectation that teachers will foster literacy. The manner in which these features are dealt with in a classroom constitutes the core problem of control in schooling. The most common solution to the problem of control is the standard classroom. Alternative classroom settings that appear to be associated with differences among children can best be understood as variations on the standard classroom. In some of these alternatives, higher support conditions and the positive cast of classroom activities seem to reduce the disorder and alienation found in classrooms, particularly  with regard to disadvantaged and ethnic minority children. However, as a number of studies suggest, differences stemming from the students' and teachers' styles within a classroom are more prominent than differences between standard and alternative educational settings. These findings indicate that the most significant changes in classrooms would only be possible if the basic conditions of schooling were so altered that the standard classroom simply would not work.

However, the Federal government has not established sufficiently rigorous compliance and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that its programs do not contribute to racial discrimination. In order to enforce Title VI effectively, agencies must have not only acceptable monitoring and enforcement procedures but a commitment to remedying the effects of past racial discrimination and making sure no one is improperly excluded on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Within the context of urban mass transportation, the principles of Title VI are particularly applicable. Minorities in the cities have suffered the consequences of isolation,  increased travel costs, and displacement brought on by the expenditure of billions of Federal dollars on highway construction. As a Federal agency, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) has an important role to play in dealing with the problems of minority groups in America's cities in meeting and going beyond the requirements of Title VI.

The career education linkage project consisted of six stages: (1) research and analysis on the problem area of formal/nonformal educational agency linkages; (2) design of a project model; (3) development of a pilot program for middle school and high school age groups; (4) implementation over a six-week period; (5) evaluation of project outcomes; and (6) forward planning and reporting. During the design, development, and  implementation stages, project staff produced three documents (all of which are published in this document): two study reports analyzing the career education content of Scouting programs and offering recommendations, and a procedural guide (entitled Career Seminar Resource Packet) for organizing and conducting career seminar programs in high schools. In general, project findings indicated that benefits can be obtained through linkage arrangements between schools and Scouting. The schools dicovered that a wealth of career-relevant information can be obtained from Scouting literature. Areas were recommended for future Scouting linkage and/or career education efforts.

First, the origin of the least restrictive environment concept is traced, including the philosophy behind it, the role of the courts and legislation, and the influences of research, and of the search for racial equality. Next, vocational programs and materials are summarized that have attempted to provide least restrictive alternatives for the handicapped. Included are descriptions of the current research literature; textbooks and handbooks; professional development programs; workshops; the role of the paraprofessional;  competency-based programs; models for delivery of services; techniques for teaching the trainable mentally retarded; work experience programs; two projects, one in Minnesota and one in Wisconsin; barriers to the successful completion of vocational programs by the handicapped; and the right of the handicapped to employment. Based on the author's experience, three areas are identified as basic to developing least restrictive vocational services: (1) preservice and inservice training; (2) development of a prescription foundation; and (3) teacher preparation for work with handicapped students. Recommendations are offered in the areas of planning, staff development, curriculum, and instructional materials. An extensive list of references is provided at the end. (ELG)",

Steps are listed for vocational educators to follow in IEP preparation as well as specifications for its implementation. Then, critical issues and problems are  identified, such as lack of teacher preparation, insufficient funding, and nonsupportive attitudes. Areas requiring change to accommodate IEP in the vocational education delivery system are delineated, including flexible student scheduling, release time for teachers, and preservice and inservice teacher education. Various research and development projects related to IEP are described. To eliminate duplication and problems, it is recommended that information on both effective and ineffective development and implementation be disseminated. At the end, guidelines are provided for the successful development of an IEP by vocational educators. The three appendixes contain samples of an individualized education plan and chart and IEP forms.

Presently these students are inhibited in their vocational development by cultural differences, values, language differences, limited academic achievement, and vocational motivation. Counselors can take various steps to help their special population clients overcome these problems. Three methods of alternative counseling have been developed which stress an understanding of the students' cultural differences; (1) systemic counseling for the culturally different; (2) transcendent counseling which tries to persuade the disadvantaged to alter their life style; and (3) stylistic counseling which takes into account the  cultural-historical dimension. Recognizing the strengths of special populations can help counselors integrate these groups into the educational system and ultimately the work force. It is also necessary for educators to examine their own attitudes and behavior so that they do not allow themselves to limit the educational and vocational opportunities for all students. Specific recommendations are made for meeting the guidance needs of special population students, including the following: familiarization with relevant legislation; special program design; use of community resources; evaluation of vocational guidance programs; professional training for counselors within a multi-cultural context; and job placement and followup.

        "description":"One of a series of sixteen knowledge transformation papers, this paper gives an overview of sex equity issues and suggests alternative strategies for administrators in vocational education to use in reducing sex segregation and fostering sex fairness. In the first section the nature of the problem is discussed; occupational sex stereotyping and segregation are recognized as major factors. Next, the relevant federal laws are summarized, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title II of the Education Amendments of 1976, and Executive Order 11246 (1965). The third section deals with a variety of strategies aimed at different aspects of the problem. For students, three areas are identified as targets:  (1) recruitment measures to increase nontraditional enrollment, emphasizing career education programs, prevocational programs, and introductory vocational classes; (2) guidance and counseling to improve the retention rate of nontraditional students; and (3) placement programs to overcome occupational sex bias focusing on cooperative education programs. Sex stereotyping is also recognized as affecting special population students (displaced homemakers, minorities, the handicapped, and the disadvantaged), and strategies for change are offered in each case. On the staff level, two types of activities are discussed: inservice training and affirmative action programs. Additional communication efforts are recommended at the community and parent levels.

        "description":"One of a series of sixteen knowledge transformation papers, this paper reviews that state-of-the-art of professional development as it relates to sex equity in vocational education. First, the problem of sex discrimination is presented with statistics showing the number of women currently working and the number who are heads of their households. Next, the extent of bias among counselors and teachers is discussed since various studies have shown that most counselors have conservative attitudes towards the idea of the working mother and are not informed about the roles of women in the work force; that schools generally use biased guidance materials; and that most women pursuing nontraditional vocational education are faced with problems such as harassment that teachers do not know  how to control. Methods for implementing change among vocational education teachers, counselors, and administrators are summarized for both preservice and inservice. Also covered are suggestions for helping students ovecome sex stereotyping in their occupational choices. At the end, the results of a survey of sex equity coordinators are given. Based on the responses of coordinators in twenty-one states, it is concluded that the focus of the coordinators' efforts in professional training varies from state to state and that planning for the training is as important as the training itself.

        "description":"Both internal and external barriers prevent women from utilizing equal opportunity. Counselors, teachers, administrators, and researchers must understand the guidance needs of women so that they can help them overcome these barriers. Career and cognitive development theories require individuals to pass through several stages, and according to Maslow's theory, all individuals are subject to the same hierarchy of needs. When counselors are aware of these stages and needs, they can help their female clients first by assessing the status of their development, and then by helping them develop their vocational self-concept. After achieving this goal, counselors can then assess their clients' interests, values, and skills and develop individualized plans for them. The most subtle  problem that counselors face is how to present the real barriers that exist in the world of work and in the wife/mother role without discouraging female clients from trying new job roles. Specific recommendations to aid counselors, teachers, administrators, and researchers in comprehending and meeting the guidance needs of women include (1) being aware of the facts of female employment, of the special skill needs of women and of their need for reinforcement; (2) challenging developers of counseling and curricular materials to eliminate sex stereotyping; and (3) developing support groups and programs to develop specific personal skills.

        "description":"Vocational education plays a significant role in the nation's economic development in terms of its capacity to make individuals more employable. It can respond to specific regional needs by producing the skilled workers for a rapidly growing industry. If, however, the industries of a region do not utilize the skills of the existing labor force, it is possible for the region to try and attract the appropriate industries, rather than retrain the workers. While vocational education alone will not result in the economic development of a state, it has been shown that programs such as CETA do increase a state's capacity for economic growth. Because of the importance of vocational education's role, an effort should be made to coordinate it with national manpower policy, and to provide  closer links with private employers and labor unions. Occupational projections are critical factors in determining needs for vocational education programs, and a number of models have been developed to determine and project manpower supply and demand. Since a well-trained work force can draw industries to a region, vocational education must develop more programs like RETONE (Relating Training to Occupational Needs) which not only assess employer needs but identify employment barriers. Vocational education, by improving training programs and by providing training to marginally productive workers, can affect the productivity level of the work force. (ELG)",

Besides citing major research and legislation affecting vocational education and federal involvement in employment and training, comparisons are drawn between vocational education and CETA in the following areas: allocation of  federal funds, target groups, delivery systems, and interaction. Then, the eight titles of the CETA Amendments of 1978 are summarized. Next, examples are given of recent institutional change produced by YEDPA (Youth Employment Demonstration Programs Act). After describing these present organizational possibilities, their translation into probability statements is considered.

In the first section techniques are discussed for encouraging community participation, such as general advisory committees, craft committees, joint apprenticeship committees, public meetings, official hearings, and interaction. Then a comprehensive, generalized model is given for educational planning, stressing the following areas: (1) the relationship of participation to the success of the planning; (2) plotting of alternative strategies; and (3) planning outcomes by producing a number of Human/Technical Resources Impact Packages. The actual  model is described as providing an overview of activities, changes occurring from decisions, and costs. Three basic phases are identified for a systems approach to planning: analysis of needs, situations, and trends; design; and implementation and evaluation. The last section applies the model to vocational education. Data needs are discussed for the following areas of vocational education: basic information, programs of instruction, student counseling, instruction, and educational accountability (evaluation). Also outlined are reasons why state and local agencies may have failed to plan adequately in the past.

First, longitudinal methods are defined for the differences between them and cross-sectional studies are established.

Then, the importance of longitudinal data is emphasized because of its role in studying the relationships between vocational program practices and student development. In the next section, ways to implement longitudinal studies are discussed. The data requirements are found to include input information on biography  and enrollment; process data, such as student progress and program characteristics; and output information on termination, initial placement, and follow-up. The conclusion acknowledges the problems associated with such studies to be the complicated process of data collection, the length of time involved, and the lack of prototypes for vocational educators to follow.

Since the legitimacy of most actions supported by evaluative data is obvious, it is not discussed, but one less well recognized use, public relations, is acknowledged. Also explained is the role of evaluative data in state planning. While it is difficult to determine the actual extent to which vocational educators use evaluative data, it is stated that sources do exist for this type of information, such as systematic analyses of state plans and surveys of state  planners and administrators. Other evidence of the data's use is found in the possibility to derive by inference. Research is reported as currently underway on both the use and effectiveness of evaluative data. The state and local management information systems are described since they are the most extensively used data bases. Other potential sources are mentioned on the state and national level, particularly the new national Vocational Education Data System and the National and State Occupational Information Coordinating Committees.

        "description":"It appears that there is nothing inherently associated with femaleness which should preclude the ascendence of women into management positions. However, barriers do exist and they stem from such factors as societal sex-role stereotypes, attitudes toward women in management, attitudes toward female competence, and the prevalence of the male managerial model. These factors are external to the woman herself but may create barriers to her job-related aspirations. Internal factors which may serve to inhibit the expression of upwardly mobile occupational aspirations include low self-esteem and fear of failure, as well as the perceived consequences of occupational advancement and the incentive value associated with such expectations. Increasing employment opportunities for women  represent a small first step toward equalizing the distribution of men and women in the labor force. However, it appears that a concerted effort to modify existing societal attitudes, to provide environmental support for dealing with the real pressures arising from role conflicts, and to redefine the exclusively male managerial model will be required to diminish the impact of the pervasive stereotypes which seem to be remarkably effective in keeping women out of managerial positions.

The research was divided into two parts. First, through two rounds of questionnaires (modified Delphi Technique) mailed to a panel of twelve auto mechanics teachers in Texas, 48 of 76 competencies listed on the questionnaires were rated as those needed by students entering auto mechanics programs in secondary schools. Second, a panel of special education experts were provided with the list of 48 competencies and were asked to consider each in the light of six handicapping conditions. This information was designed to identify handicapping conditions which would usually prevent  a student from possessing entry-level auto mechanics skills and to determine what special assistance could be given to handicapped students to enable them to meet the competencies. Some of the findings include the following: (1) the most needed competencies were social maturity skills; (2) special needs students already possessed most of the competencies needed for auto mechanics; (3) a classroom aide was the most commonly suggested assistance source; and (4) the competency considered most likely to remain out of reach of some of the handicapped students was the ability to drive a car.

Each vignette answers the following questions about the particular program: How was the program developed? Who are the  participating students? What are its goals? What are its key elements? How was the evaluation done and where is it reported? What are the evaluation findings and what are the evaluation problems? Section III, which presents conclusions about assessing experiential education, discusses the synthesis of evaluation findings, problems in evaluating experiential education programs, and alternatives to current practices. A selected bibliography is appended. (LMS)",

The perspectives are represented in papers by Samuel H. Osipow, Psychology, Ohio State University; Nicholas M. Kiefer, Economics, University of Chicago; Sheila S. Walker, Anthropology, University of California; and Frank J. Weed and Charles E. Ramsey, Sociology, University of Texas. The keynote address, by Richard Graham of Youthwork, Inc., is followed by a section for each perspective. Each section begins with the major presentation and includes a summary of the commentary by participants on the advantages and limitations of the particular perspective in  evaluating experiential education programs. Following the commentary is a summary of the perspective by an individual who represents that perspective and is an experiential education practitioner. The last section offers reflections on the symposium by Thomas R. Owens, Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory; and Dan Conrad, University of Minnesota. The symposium agenda, a list of participants, and biographical sketches of the authors are appended. (LMS)",

        "description":"Using data from the fifteen-year National Longitudinal Study (NLS), a special study examined the interaction of work-related attitudes and subsequent behavior for eight age-sex-race groups. It was found that attitudes do influence subsequent work behavior. Specifically, it was established that individuals who felt they could influence their future through their own efforts later experienced greater success in the labor market than those who were less optimistic. Similarly, the relationship between job dissatisfaction and turnover was clearly marked. The evidence also indicated that dissatisfaction results in extensive costs to workers in terms of increased unemployment, decreased labor force participation, below-average growth in annual earnings, and a lower rate of promotion.  For women in particular, their degree of commitment to work, their attitudes toward the propriety of mothers' working, and their husbands' attitudes toward wives' labor force participation all bore a measureable relationship to subsequent work experiences. The findings pointed to the potential significance of instilling &quot;success-prone&quot; attitudes in youth as they proceed from school to their initial work experiences.

It was hypothesized that children who play with toys and games that suggest &quot;non-sex-biased&quot; career options would be less likely to hold to traditional occupational expectations. Children in twenty-three classrooms were exposed to the toys and games for four months. After this exposure, children in these classes were compared with children in eighteen control classrooms. Analysis of the kindergarten data indicated that the effects of region (urban or rural) and group (experimental or control) on the occupational choices were relatively slight. However, the sex differences were highly significant. When asked to draw a picture of what  they could be when they grew up, boys selected male sex-typed occupations and girls selected female sex-typed occupations. As with the kindergarten children, but to a lesser extent, fourth-grade males and females seemed to be well aware of sex role expectations. While the data suggested that the toys and games had only a limited impact, various factors may have influenced the impact of the toys, and competing forms of sex-role socialization.

She alleged that this denial constituted a violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which prohibits discrimination against an \"otherwise qualified handicapped individual\" in federally funded programs \"solely by reason of his handicap.\" In the original decision, the Federal District Court found that no such discrimination existed in this case, but its decision was reversed by the Court of Appeals. The suit was then brought to the U.S. Supreme Court which held: there was no violation  of section 504 since nothing in that section prohibits educational institutions from requiring reasonable physical qualifications for admission to a clinical training program. In its unanimous decision, the Court stated that Southeastern would be required to lower the standards of its nursing program to accomodate Davis' handicap and that the law did not require such a substantial modification in educational programs.

Detailed questionnaires requesting information on the management, conduct, and costs of twelve high-priority job training courses having military and civilian counterparts, were sent to the training managers/directors of thirty-three T/TS, twenty-nine B/I/I, and twenty DOD schools. Of a total of 134 questionnaires mailed, 84 were returned; 41 with usable data (24 from DOD and 17 from T/TS). All B/I/I reporting indicated that they no longer train in the course selected for study. Simple means and percentages comparing DOD and T/TS courses were  calculated on the data provided in the 41 questionnaires. Based upon the findings detailed in this report, it was concluded that (1) job training, as conducted in DOD schools, is more job-performance oriented, and evaluation is more objective; (2) student/instructor ratios are similar; and (3) considering that the average DOD course employs approximately four times as many instructors to graduate eleven times as many graduates, DOD school productivity exceeds that of T/TS.

        "description":"A study was conducted to develop a cost management control procedure to assist Navy managers in making decisions about initial training development and implementation in surface ship acquisition programs. Objectives were (1) develop and illustrate a cost management control procedure for centralized collection, storage, and control of cost data for commercially developed initial training programs; (2) develop an instrument for cost data collection compatible with existing training requirements directives and proposed cost management control procedures; and (3) identify and examine noncost management considerations affecting procedures for selecting training alternatives. A subjective rational approach, based on case history analysis, was used. Data bases were established from cost  data derived from training device acquisition programs and noncost management data derived from major system equipment acquisition programs. Nine training device course cost proposals were selected for in-depth analysis. A computer-based cost management control procedure was developed to assist in selecting the most efficient initial training alternative, preparing initial budgetary estimates, and performing contractor cost proposal evaluations. (Appendixes include illustration of a cost estimation procedure for Navy developed initial training, summary of cases studied, data collection instrument for contractor developed training course, cost management control procedure data summary, and cost data for various initial training courses.)

First, Sanford's definition of public relations is outlined, followed by an explanation of why vocational education needs public relations. The next chapter emphasizes the importance of planning in developing and implementing an effective public relations program. Eight steps are identified in the planning process: (1) establishing the position of public relations coordinator; (2) identifying the audiences both internal and external; (3) assessing audience needs; (4) establishing goals and objectives for the public program; (5) designing program strategies and techniques; (6)  scheduling the program; (7) implementing the program; and (8) evaluating the program. The second step, identifying target audiences, is dealt with in more depth in the next section. In the discussion of external audiences, the following sectors are singled out: business, industry, and labor; parents; and political and quasi-political groups. The two internal audiences of students and nonvocational educators are also examined. The appendixes provide abstracts of effective public relations techniques, rules for preparation of a news relaease, and how to reach television audiences. Various exhibits and tables are included to illustrate or summarize the text of the handbook. (ELG)",

        "description":"The Mayor of Columbus, Tom Moody, spoke on his views of CETA, unemployment, and vocational education. In his opinion, all required and most optional education should be vocational education; that is, it should equip people to be able to support themselves, to earn a living, and to be productive in our society. He pointed out several &quot;fallacies&quot; that related to the policy of full employment, such as the assumptions that all people want to work and that all jobs must offer upward mobility. In his discussion of the CETA programs in Columbus he described the operations of the various programs, such as SPEDY (Summer Program for Economically Disadvantaged Youth), the Job Corps, and the Young Adult Conservation Corps. While he recognized the need for training the disadvantaged, he felt  that the programs often overlap and are not set up to use their funding in the most effective manner. These problems, he thought, may result from the motivation of politicians to acquire as much federal aid as possible for their constituency. After his speech, he answered questions on the issues he had raised. (ELG)",

        "description":"In anticipation of the projected decline in the national population of young men and of expanding the role of women in the military, the Navy conducted a national telephone survey to gauge the interest of women and men in joining the military under present conditions and under three alternative options. The options related to expanding the role of women in terms of the physical location (ships, aricraft, combat zones) and nontraditional job classifications (mechanics, electronics) where they are likely to serve. Of those surveyed, 14 percent of the women and 16 percent of the men responded that they were &quot;extremely,&quot;&quot;very,&quot; or &quot;quite&quot; interested under current conditions. The Air Force was the military branch most preferred by both men and women, followed by the Navy, Army, and  Marine Corps. The interest level of women in joining the military increased when an option involving training and service in nontraditional jobs for women was presented. When a similar option involving service on some ships, aircraft, or combat support areas was offered, interest declined but did not fall below interest levels under current conditions. A third option involving equal treatment to that received by men resulted in responses similar to those of the second option. The survey of men indicated increased interest in joining the military when the likelihood of serving with women was presented. (Author/LMS)",

The objectives were to determine the potential of the simulator as a substitute environment for learning aircraft tasks and to effectively utilize the simulator in pilot training. The students involved in the study were recent graduates of the Navy undergraduate pilot training program. Training was accomplished in the flight replacement squadron setting using squadron resources, simulator, and flight syllabi. Conclusions of the study include the following: the 2F87F simulator was an effective substitute for the P-3 aircraft in the transition training of pilots; performance in the 2F87F simulator was predictive of later performance in the  aircraft, and training tasks to proficiency in the simulator prior to aircraft training significantly reduced the time required for students to become proficient in the aircraft.

Chapter 3 discusses evaluation design. Presented is information on different designs, the choice of an experimental group, the timing of impact measurement, collecting data on impacts, sample size, and the choice of independent variables.  Chapter 4 examines the costs of social programs. Topics include estimating opportunity-costs, measuring the increment in costs, calculating marginal costs, and examining the costs of the first program participants. Finally, chapter 5 presents a suggested schema for comparing program benefits and costs. Discussion includes assigning value to future impacts and costs, accounting for externalities, and making program decisions.

The sample consisted of 502 diagnosed adult essential hypertensive army patients derived from the active duty, retired, and dependent population  of two army outpatient clinics. A two-group experimental design was used. Personal characteristics, measures of comprehension and retention, measures of compliance behavior, locus of control, and reading level were the main categories of patient variables.

In the area of user services, training sessions were held at secondary and postsecondary institutions, and various products to aid users were developed such as a counselor's handbook (CE 022 142), audiovisual presentations, and a wall chart. In order to publicize the system, newsletters were distributed as  well as a press kit, and demonstration-workshops were conducted.

Further evidence of its positive value has been its adoption by California schools and agencies. In the future it is projected that EUREKA will continue to expand its information files and become a well-developed, self-sufficient statewide career information system. (The appendixes include samples of information files, a report on EUREKA's use by disadvantaged students, copies of the project's newsletters, a statistical data summary, and copies of evaluation forms.)

Personal visits were made to sixteen EUREKA sites throughout the state, accounting for over 75% of the high schools and agencies with active programs. Both the directors of the programs and counselors were interviewed for their reactions. It was found that (1) the information on vocational programs is considered accurate, complete, and up-to-date; (2) physically handicapped students are able to use the system; (3) no evidence of sexism or minority prejudice exists in the information files; (4) staff training by audiovisual presentations is extremely well-received; and (5) the user evaluation form provides sufficient feedback. It was not possible to evaluate either the employer  information files since they were not being used at these sites or publicity regarding EUREKA since the program was already in operation at these locations. (Reports on each of the sixteen sites are provided giving the comments of the interviewees on technical aspects, student users, the occupational information files, Quest, and other topics such as funding and publicity efforts.

A general description of CETA is provided explaining the shift in program emphasis from subsidized public employment to employment in the private sector. Following a general description of apprenticeship and the role of the Bureau of Apprentice and Training (BAT), two special emphasis areas are discussed in which BAT has developed programs: new trades or industries which have not previously used apprenticeships, and women in apprenticeship. The second section of this guide shows the relation of the  CETA provisions to apprenticeship programs and how the two can coordinate their activities. Program funding is also discussed. In section III, models of specific programs that link the two together are provided as suggestions of the types of programs possible. They include women's building trades, concentrated employment training, building trades, multi-trades, preparatory diesel mechanic, and orientation to nontraditional careers for women. For each, details are listed, such as number of people served, length of training, funding source, and elements of the project design. (ELG)",

The consultation stages, which may occur simultaneously, include entry into the system, problem identification, problem definition, intervention planning, consultation assessment, and the conclusion of the relationship. The various levels of functioning and their primary goals sequentially are: direct service to the child, focussing on the child; indirect service to the child, focussing on changing classroom  behavior through extrapersonal factors; direct service to the teacher, focussing on teacher improvement; and service to the school system, focussing on behavior change while improving the school's general functioning and communication patterns.

Critical issues in halfway house operations, a model for evaluation, and innovative variations are discussed. The facilities discussed include public and private halfway houses that provide residential services to adult offenders as a transitional step between their release from an institution and their return to independent living within the community. The study defined halfway houses as facilities which accept ex-offenders released from prison, provide the basic necessities of room and board, attempt to determine each individual's problems with reintegration, plan a program to remedy these problems, and provide supportive staff to assist the resident is resolving problems and returning to society as a  law-abiding citizen. This study encompassed a review of the literature dealing with adult residential inmate aftercare, a review of available evaluation of halfway house facilities, and a nationwide survey of halfway houses. The study examines critical issues in halfway house establishment and operations, including needs assessment, goal-setting, funding, location, programming, administration, evaluation, and accreditation. Critical issues as expressed by halfway house administrators are combined with the information available from the surveys and site visits to develop generalized prescriptive statements regarding each of these problem areas. The need for evaluative research is discussed, accepted evaluative techniques are examined, a model research design which can be implemented by a  single halfway house in order to evaluate its operation is presented, and suggestions for utilizing evaluation results are offered. The study discusses innovative programs and planned variations which have been used successfully by experienced halfway house administrators and explores areas in which flexibility and imagination have enhanced the administrator's ability to provide the type of treatment and services required by ex-offenders in returning to community living.

Results indicated that parents become more relaxed and self-confident as their babies become livelier and more responsive, and the marital relationship shows increasing strain. Trends which reflect the changing demands in the ongoing process of adjustment for new parents are discussed. (Author)",

The investigator's person-environment incongruence model of depression, applied to a study of 50 depressed and 50 non-depressed white women for the purpose of exploring possible psychosocial determinants of depression, provided support for the hypothesis that incongruence between a person's dependence or independence predispositions and family and work environments makes one vulnerable to depression. Research results indicated that there were no differences in the findings for those women (70%) who were between 55 and 67 and the younger 21-55 year-old subjects. Additionally, while most depressed women were  dependent, independent women in environments incongruent with their needs were also depressed. Conceptualization of institutional care as integrating aspects of both family (the home) and work (management of residents) environments suggests a need to apply significant findings in order to increase congruence between the needs of the women and their institutional environments.

It was expected that children receiving experience with both components would show more empathy than those receiving experience with only one or neither of these components. Six- to eight-year-olds participated in two phases, Training and Assessment. In Training, a child either received experience with (a) recalling situations they had experienced, (b) demonstrating emotions of story characters, (c) both components, or (d) neither component. In Assessment, children listened to stories and subsequently responded to three sets of drawings, which assessed (a) their understanding of each story situation, (b) their understanding of each character's emotional reactions, and (c) their own  emotional reactions to the situations and characters' emotions. The results suggested that experience with either the cognitive or affective component deleteriously affected empathy in children; but having experience with both components maintained their previous levels of empathy.

The model relies primarily on two sets of empirical observations -- the time it takes people to read texts and what they can later recall, and attempts to accurately predict reading time and recall data. The reader's goals are represented as schemata, and statistically significant correlations have been found between the following six predictor variables of the model and reading difficulty: the number of reinstatements,  word frequency, proposition density, inferences, number of processing cycles, and the number of different arguments. Of these factors, reinstatements, inferences, and the number of processing cycles are deemed most important and worthy of future research.

A group of 38 students were enrolled in three separate classes in English, oral communications, and mathematics for a total of 20 hours per week for 18 weeks. The classes were actively integrated so that a maximum of transfer occurred both between the classes and between school and daily life activities. This integration was achieved through the application of skills learned in one class to material being taught in the other classes. Preliminary results indicated that an integrated basic skills course was superior to  separate, nonintegrated courses in teaching basic skills to low achievers. Of the 32 students completing the first semester, 30 received passing grades and 26 were still enrolled in classes at midterm of the following semester. (Author/DF)",

These models hypothesized ways in which political learning from mass media is affected by such factors as strength of information flow, political system level, individual media exposure, interpersonal discussion, membership in political groups, and education. Personal interviews were conducted with 373 voting-age subjects in which each respondent was asked to nominate a personally important political problem. Each subject was also characterized by the above factors. Content analysis of mass media coverage of nominated problems at the national and local levels was conducted during the two weeks before the interviewing. This analysis was used to divide  both the local and national issue-focused samples into high- and low-coverage treatment groups. Results indicated that the processes that govern political learning differ greatly according to both the political system level and the level of mass media coverage. In the high coverage/national issues treatment, only education among the model's background variables retained a significant association with information holding. In the low coverage/national issues treatment, the previous patterns did not carry over; indicators of recent exposure to information and other indicators of generalized interest failed to show evidence of direct effects on information holding. In the high coverage/local issues treatment, interpersonal discussion emerged as the primary source of information holding. In  the low coverage/local issues treatment, the model was less successful in explaining variation in information holding than it was for the other three treatments. (DF)",

These five components of expositional discourse form a set of investigative/communicative tools for use in all disciplines, each of which has its own way to systematically examine phenomena, evaluate evidence, and present results. Since undergraduates are required to write in certain forms, the freshman composition course must bridge faculty expectations and student skill. Composition curricula need to reflect a careful sequence, taking full advantage of the human affinity for the sequential and hierarchical,  while introducing students to the various styles of academic prose.

The results showed that family interaction appeared to influence the development of various consumer skills via different learning mechanisms, while media and peers seemed to influence the development of &quot;expressive&quot; aspects of  consumption. In addition, the adolescents' cognitive development, indexed by age, predicted the development of most consumer skills examined.

Significant problems inherent in such use of these indices arise for their validity at and beyond the college level and center on the terms \"maturity,\"\"complexity,\" and \"growth.\"\"Maturity\" has not been satisfactorily defined, nor has the level of competence been specified at which college students can reasonably be expected to perform. Psycholinguists are replacing \"complexity\" in the understanding of the process of discourse comprehension by an interest in the meaning, function, and content of texts, and research in discourse production is following suit. Regarding \"growth,\" although writers do use increasing numbers of transformations as they become more proficient in composition, many more  semantic propositions underlie the sentences as well; skilled adults also depend on several transformations seldom found in children's prose. It is probable that the preoccupation with syntactic growth has led to a general misunderstanding of syntactic approaches to composition. (DF)",

The model views discourse production as a series of three interactive decision levels in which (1) predicting/perceiving, (2) ideating/confirming; and (3) presenting/confirming strategies reduce the semantic knowledge to be presented and encode it into a surface-level linguistic representation. Each decision level produces a pretext structure (message base, text base) that is successively more textually and semantically organized than the previous one, and on which the next decision can operate. While all strategies are used and judged in terms of  previously made decisions on other levels, implying a sequence of production, the process is interactive in nature and it is possible that all or various levels might be active simultaneously.

While the networks seemed to stand crippled and paralyzed by television's impact, local stations experimented in programing, promotion, and news coverage. The foremost innovators in this area were Gordon McLendon of Texas and Todd Storz of Nebraska. Most of the now-familiar formats--including all-news, &quot;top 40,&quot; and &quot;beautiful music&quot;--were introduced by either McLendon or Storz. Their stations also pioneered in aggressive radio promotion, such as cash giveaways, and in ambitious local news coverage. However, while the techniques of McLendon and Storz were widely copied in the Midwest and the South, their  influence was slow to reach the major markets of the East Coast. Despite their seminal role in modern radio, McLendon and Storz have received little recognition in the leading broadcast histories. (Author/FL)",

The study also tested the transactional model of advertising effects, which combines exposure, motivations, and gratifications for viewing. A sample of 350 adults was randomly selected and interviewed by telephone. Television exposure and attention variables were considered, along with four independent factors: information seeking (gratification), social utility (gratification), alienation (avoidance), and anxiety (avoidance). Results indicated that gratification/avoidance measures were more important and had a higher impact in the cognitive stage of attitude formation than did exposure variables, which were more important in  the affective stage of attitude formation. The findings suggest that a well-designed mass media charity advertising campaign can increase consumers' levels of awareness, levels of liking, and degrees of action through gratification/avoidance; that gratification/avoidance measures can serve as guidelines for message positioning; and that the use of short messages with high repetition may be appropriate for charity promotion.

The results revealed that although men and women alike held jobs in mid-management that were demanding in terms of time and responsiblity, men still made more money than women for comparable effort. This difference held even when controlling for a respondent's experience, age, educational level, number of employees supervised, and degree of budget control, and for the circulation of the respondent's newspaper. In addition, it was shown that  women were as willing as men to accept job transfers and were equally as ambitious. Finally, women's lack of \"team-play\" experience seemed not to affect their attitudes about their jobs. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"The study of the history of ideas in newspapers has not been separated from traditional journalism history nor from the broad cultural studies of the mass media, and may also differ from the behavioral or statistical study of the effects of the mass media. Because the levels of high culture and popular culture are seen as separate and distinct, the role of the press as conduit between the two has largely been ignored. However, newspapers may be studied to determine whether ideas are defined, transmitted to the popular level, and possibly altered in the transmission process. An awareness of the role of the press in covering ideas in the past prompts consideration of the degree to which the press today transmits ideas to society. The experience of the press in the United States  points to its continued role in interpreting those idea-complexes for the public which motivate large segments of society. In both the methodologies of history and of current news gathering, the autonomy of ideas in journalism calls for recognition of a rather well-defined body of material previously neglected, rather than for another system or model.

        "description":"A mail survey of 91 past and present users of the community programing (public access) channels in the Toronto, Canada, area revealed that personal contact is most important in the diffusion of knowledge about access opportunities. Friends and colleagues were the most often cited initial source of information; but contact by the cable company itself most often proved critical for actual user development. This latter point suggests that only when knowledgeable persons make contact and explain matters are such inhibiting factors as lack of understanding of the telecommunication process countered, enabling community groups to effectively use and develop cable television as a medium of public communications. The results of this study strongly point to the necessity of some kind of  promotional and facilitating action by expert or professional groups in the development of public access cable television channels.

A factor analysis of how these Latinos perceived the treatment they got from 19 private and public social organizations (such as churches, libraries, and landlords) produced four dimensions of discrimination: regulatory organizations, consumer organizations, socialization organizations, and employment opportunity organizations. Age, years of residency in the United States, education, family income, and four media exposure variables (television, radio, Spanish-language press, and English-language press) were tested with hierarchical regression analysis on each discrimination factor. After controlling for the background  variables, exposure to television was found to be a negative predictor of the discrimination perceived from the consumer and socialization factors. Exposure to the other types of media was not a significant predictor of any factor with such controls; but exposure to English-language press was positively associated with discrimination perceived from the regulatory and socialization factors. Age was the strongest negative predictor of the regulatory, consumer, and employment opportunity factors, while education was the only positive predictor (for the regulatory factor). (Author/RL)",

Selection of the compositions was made in pairs--one of high syntactic complexity and one of low syntactic complexity--each written by the same student. The compositions at each grade level were rated by four teachers who taught at that grade level. The holistic score, the composition quality scale, and the sentence structure score were used as the measures of quality. Analyses indicated that arguments of high syntactic complexity rated significantly higher than did arguments of low syntactic complexity for grades ten and twelve; there was no significant  difference at grade six. Narrations of high syntactic complexity did not rate higher than narrations of low syntactic complexity at any grade level. In fact, twelfth grade students' narrations of low syntactic complexity rated significantly higher than did their narrations of high syntactic complexity. Overall, it appears that syntactic complexity influenced ratings of arguments but not of narrations. (Author/RL)",

Data indicated that organizational constraints were the major factors determining news selection strategies, but that individual-level variables come into play at both the information gathering and the writing stages. Greater numbers of organizational constraints seemed to reduce the roles that individual-level variables have in the news making process for a given reporter. Additionally, organizational variables seemed to promote competitive behavior, while individual-level variables  encouraged cooperative behavior among the science writers in the study. (Author/RL)",

These studies also reflect four communication topic areas, including network and channel communication, control of information, perception of messages, and communication strategies. The studies all integrate conflict communication with cooperation and conflict, such that some communication patterns emerge. Communication that promotes cooperation is face to face and free of distortion, shows increased availablity and information disclosure, provides more concessions and proposals, and contains promises,  recommendations, positive language, and open-ended questions. Communication that leads to competition contains inadequate conflict management practices, insufficient exchange of information, threats from low- to high-power participants, incompatible personal styles and power levels, irrelevant arguments, forcing, withholding, compromising, facial gaze, and close proximity. Since methodological and theoretical deficiencies have hindered meaningful growth in this subject area, a multidimensional approach may be warranted in future research. Such an approach would test for interaction effects among such variables as position power, message strategies, and type of conflict situation. (RL)",

Consequently, business communicators need to have a general understanding of nonverbal communication and to recognize how such behaviors as body posture and movement, eye contact, facial expression, seating arrangement, vocal cues, spatial relationships, and personal appearance affect the ways their verbal messages are received by others. Quite often nonverbal communication provides \"metacommunication,\" or communication about communication, serving to repeat, contradict, substitute, complement, accent, and regulate verbal communication. If business communicators want to ascribe meaning to others' nonverbal behaviors, they should take care to interpret the  nonverbal message in its proper context, realizing that people respond differently to different stimuli and that some nonverbal behaviors vary in meaning across cultures. Businessmen can apply their understanding of nonverbal communication to personal interviews to show their true feelings of immediacy, potency, and responsiveness, to relax others, and to achieve maximum effect from the interview situation. They can also observe and adjust seating arrangement, room decor, and eye contact between group members to increase productivity at conferences and in small group discussions. (RL)",

Results showed that reading general news magazines had the strongest interaction with the three political involvement variables, reaching statistical significance in every equation. Another consistent predictor was the reading of black-oriented news magazines. Viewing black-oriented public affairs television programs was specifically associated with campaign participation. Exposure to general public affairs on television was notable for its consistent lack of association with any of the political participation variables. The only  noteworthy predictors of media use were age and education, while news magazine and newspaper use are associated with higher income, but not significantly so. Psychological measures in the study made minimal contributions to the understanding of blacks' political participation.

Analysis of the data indicated that sustained resident/resident and resident/staff conversations were rare, that male/female resident contact was discouraged by staff members and feared by female residents, and that staff/patient conversational relationships centered around three broad nursing home-related topic categories. In addition, patients' discussion of personal topics was legitimated in only a few types of situations, discussion of personal lives by both residents and staff appeared to be  appropriate only in the beauty parlor or physical therapy rooms, and in most situations there appeared to be normative sanctions against residents asking &quot;personal&quot; questions of staff or visitors. Staff members overtly excluded patients from their own conversations, citing residents' lack of interest in the types of topics staff members discussed--an observation contradicted by the researcher's own observations of residents' interests.

        "description":"This review of research and other literature on educational vouchers provides an overview and history of the voucher concept and voucher programs. The author first looks at several existing versions of the voucher idea, such as the G.I. Bill and Denmark's free schools. California's Alum Rock voucher experiment is evaluated, with suggestions about the obstacles preventing the program from becoming a real voucher system. Comments from an interview with voucher expert Christopher Jencks elucidate the report. Emphasizing that voucher models differ in more ways than they agree, the author explains and compares six proposed voucher program models. Particular attention is given to the &quot;Family Choice&quot; model that proponents hope to see on the June 1980 California Ballot. Included are  quotes from a telephone interview from John Coons, father of the model. Issues discussed include the question of whether a voucher system would violate the separation of church and state, promote segregation, raise the cost of education, or encourage unethical speculators to open schools. The author concludes that the voucher concept is still vigorous and has not yet had a fair trial. (Author/JM)",

The term &quot;research development and innovation&quot; (RD &amp; I) is used to describe the total process of innovation of which R &amp; D is only a part. Chapter 1 discusses the nature of and bases for a contextual analytical approach to RD &amp; I and describes the comparative contextual analysis framework developed here. The contextual analysis is intended to be a framework for comparison that reveals differences or commonalities in RD &amp; I systems across sectors. A sector is defined as a field of interrelated activities such as the fields of industry, aerospace, or education.  The context of RD &amp; I is defined as the totality of features (or significant aspects) of RD &amp; I. A contextual analysis rests on the assumption that each feature affects and is affected by all other features. Chapter 2 analyzes the features that make up the total context of RD &amp; I. These features are environmental influences; historical development; institutional base; goals, policies, and strategies; administrative processes; personnel base; funding; information flow; innovations; and functions. Identified as functions of RD &amp; I are need identification, generation or research, development, production, marketing or dissemination, acquisition, implementation or utilization, support services, and evaluation research.

The two behavior modification studies discussed showed strong positive results. Questions remain, however, concerning the permanence of behavior changes that are dependent on reward systems and concerning the wisdom of associating appropriate behavior with rewards not intrinsic to the behavior itself. The two humanistic studies in class management concentrated on the rapport created between students and teachers. The first involved teaching communication techniques to teachers, while the second revealed that alternative schools suffer from far fewer disciplinary problems than do traditional schools. The fifth study combined  elements of both types of approach. A high level of interaction between teacher and student, derived from humanist thinking, was used as the reward in a system derived from behavior modification. (Author/PGD)",

We should look for opportunities to encourage practices like core teaching and cohort teaching, for providing smaller school and classroom settings, and for training teachers and administrators to take advantage of these settings for personalizing and individualizing instruction. Local, state, and national policies should be sought that can provide young people the opportunities, including access to employment, that will allow them a successful transition  into society. It is critical to remember that the goal of education is to humanize our schools and our society, to rid them of fear, and to encourage positive and constructive interaction between and among young people and adults. If our methods betray our purpose, we will have gained little in the long run, and we will have set the stage for a still more violent future for America's next generation. (Author/PGD)",

This paper discusses a survey that was made to determine whether a school district can realize significant savings by participating in a system of cooperative purchasing with other school districts. High school districts in North Dakota were surveyed, and price information was sought on 14 selected items. Prices paid by districts of varying size and geographic location were then analyzed to determine what differences might influence a district toward or away from cooperative purchasing. Results indicated a significant savings occurs when group bidding practices are employed by groups of districts. Some recommendations made were that price  information be accumulated at the state level and be disseminated to districts that request it, that an investigation be made of the legality and practicality of group bidding, and that mechanisms be developed through which districts can become informed about and participate in group bidding practices.

THE STUDENT'S VIEWPOINT, OFTEN OVERLOOKED, IS OFFERED IN CHAPTER TWO WITH THE FREQUENTLY STATED PROBLEMS OF ADAPTING TO TEACHER DIFFERENCES FROM YEAR TO YEAR, ADJUSTING TO THE GRADING POLICY OF EACH TEACHER, AND WANTING THE MOTIVATION THAT CAN BE DERIVED FROM THE PLEASURE OF  SPEAKING THE TARGET LANGUAGE. MOTIVATION, AUDITORY ABILITY, PERSONALITY, AND OTHER INDIVIDUAL ATTITUDES ARE DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER THREE AS FURTHER FACTORS RESULTING IN UNDERACHIEVEMENT. THE CONCLUDING CHAPTER IDENTIFIES STUDENT AUDITORY ABILITY (BEING EAR-MINDED AS OPPOSED TO EYE-MINDED) AND PROGRAM ARTICULATION AS TWO PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF UNDERACHIEVEMENT. SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE FOR DEVELOPING TECHNIQUES SUITABLE FOR STUDENTS OF VARIOUS LEVELS OF ABILITY, INCLUDING THOSE OF LOW AUDITORY ABILITY. APPENDIXES INCLUDE VARIOUS TESTS ON APTITUDE, MOTIVATION, ATTITUDE, AND PERSONALITY, TABLES OF DATA BASED ON THESE TESTS, AND CLINICAL INTERVIEWS. (SS)",

THIS KIND OF PREPARATION REQUIRES THE COOPERATION OF UNIVERSITIES AS ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH CENTERS, WITH THE JUNIOR COLLEGES THEMSELVES AS THE LABORATORIES. SINCE CLASSROOM TEACHING, RATHER THAN RESEARCH, IS THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE INSTRUCTOR, THE  SPECIALIZATION OF THE PH.D. IS NOT NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE.

ITS ADMINISTRATION IS LIKE ANY OTHER TYPE OF COLLEGE, BUT IT SERVES THE SAME AREA AS THE COUNTY SCHOOLS AND IS RUN BY THE SAME BOARD OF TRUSTEES. IN CASES WHERE IT SERVES MORE THAN ONE COUNTY, IT IS RUN BY THE ONE WHERE IT IS SITUATED, WITH THE HELP OF COMMITTEES FROM THE ADJACENT COUNTIES. THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS COORDINATED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION, WITH A JUNIOR COLLEGE ADVISORY BOARD TO STANDARDIZE CAMPUS PLANNING AND BUILDING. TEXAS USES A DISTRICT PATTERN, COMBINING CITY AND COUNTY. THE COLLEGE HAS ITS OWN TRUSTEES, AND ITS PRESIDENT (NOT THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT) IS THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR. IT  RECEIVES STATE FUNDS, BUT IS NOT STATE-CONTROLLED. ALABAMA FOLLOWS THE STATE-CONTROL SYSTEM. THE COLLEGES ARE ESTABLISHED, ORGANIZED, AND RUN BY THE STATE, WITH CHIEF ADMINISTRATORS AND LOCAL BOARDS FOR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATION. MASSACHUSETTS ALSO HAS A STATE SYSTEM WITH A REGIONAL BOARD TO DETERMINE SITES, FUNDING, ETC. CALIFORNIA, THOUGH NOW USING TWO OF THE SYSTEMS, IS SHIFTING FROM THE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO THE COLLEGE DISTRICT PLAN. IN KENTUCKY, RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 2-YEAR COLLEGES IS ON THE STATE UNIVERSITY. THE STEPS ARE LISTED FOR ESTABLISHING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM UNDER ONE OR A COMBINATION OF THESE PATTERNS.

THIS QUESTION RELATES TO MATTERS OF PRIVACY AND THE NATURE OF NECESSARY INFORMATION. THE SECOND ISSUE CONCERNS THE RIGHT OF THE SUBJECT (OR HIS PARENT) TO KNOW WHAT INFORMATION THE SCHOOL HAS ABOUT HIM, AS WELL AS THE OBLIGATION OF THE SCHOOL TO FURNISH SUCH INFORMATION, EVEN WHEN IT HAS NOT BEEN REQUESTED. THE THIRD ISSUE IS THE RELATIONSHIP OF PREDICTIVE  TESTING TO THE RISE OF A MERITOCRACY OR TO A POSSIBLE GRADUAL SORTING OUT OF A POPULATION ON THE BASIS OF INTELLIGENCE AND THE RESULTANT ESTABLISHMENT OF A RIGID CLASS SYSTEM.

IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE RESPONSES IN THIS PROJECT INDICATED A DEFINITE INTEREST IN RESEARCH AND RESEARCH NEEDS FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIANSHIP ON THE PART OF LIBRARIANS, AND IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT RESEARCH AND RESEARCH TECHNIQUES SHOULD BECOME A DEFINITE PART OF THE CURRICULUM FOR SCHOOL LIBRARIANS AND THAT INCREASED OPPORTUNITY TO INITIATE AND PARTICIPATE IN LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RESEARCH PROJECTS SHOULD BE AFFORDED SCHOOL LIBRARIANS. APPENDIXES INCLUDE A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF 252 ITEMS, THE INSTRUMENT USED FOR THIS STUDY, AND SIMPLE FREQUENCY TABLES INDICATING RESPONSES TO THE AREAS OF NEEDED RESEARCH. (AUTHOR/JB)",

SECTION 1 REPLICATES AND ELABORATES A STUDY ON THE EXISTENCE OF CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT BELIEF SYSTEMS IN TEACHERS AND ON HOW SUCH BELIEF SYSTEMS EFFECT CLASSROOM ATMOSPHERE. THE SAME ELEMENTS WERE INVESTIGATED IN THIS STUDY IN ADDITION TO THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OBSERVING THE EFFECT OF THE 2 BELIEF SYSTEMS ON STUDENT PERFORMANCE. THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE GREATER THE ABSTRACTNESS OF THE TEACHER'S BELIEF SYSTEM, THE GREATER WOULD BE HER RESOURCEFULNESS, THE LESS HER DICTATORIALNESS AND PUNITIVENESS, AND THE BETTER THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE  OF THE PUPILS WAS DEMONSTRATED. SECTION 2 IS A FAMILY SURVEY USED TO DETERMINE FAMILY ATTITUDES AND VALUES WHICH WERE THEN ANALYZED TO SEE IF AND HOW SUCH ATTITUDES RELATED TO THE CHILD'S PERFORMANCE IN HEAD START AND IN PUBLIC SCHOOL. SECTION 3 PRESENTS THE CHILDREN'S PERFORMANCE SCORES OBTAINED DURING THEIR ATTENDANCE IN PUBLIC SCHOOL AT THE PRIMARY LEVEL. THE TEST MATERIALS WERE MOVIE FILMS OF 13 BRIEF SITUATIONS RELEVANT TO SOME ASPECT OF THE CHILD'S BEHAVIOR AND ON WHICH HE WAS ASKED TO COMMENT. THE SCORES OF THESE TESTS WERE THEN COMBINED WITH THE INFORMATION FROM SECTIONS 1 AND 2 TO SHOW THE RESULTS OF THE INTERACTION OF THE 3 VARIABLES OF TEACHER, PUPIL, AND PARENT ON PUPIL PERFORMANCE.

THE SAMPLE FOR THE STUDY CONSISTED OF 163 NEGRO MOTHER-CHILD PAIRS SELECTED FROM 3 SOCIOECONOMIC CLASSES BASED ON THE FATHER'S OCCUPATION AND THE PARENTS' EDUCATION. A FOURTH GROUP INCLUDED FATHER-ABSENT FAMILIES. THE MOTHERS WERE INTERVIEWED AT HOME AND THE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN WERE TESTED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO WHEN THE CHILDREN WERE 4 YEARS OLD. FOLLOW-UP DATA WERE OBTAINED WHEN THE CHILDREN WERE 6 AND AGAIN WHEN THEY WERE 7. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE MATERNAL LANGUAGE STYLES, LANGUAGE SAMPLES WERE OBTAINED FROM VERBATIM TRANSCRIPTS OF TAPE-RECORDED RESPONSES TO (1) THE TYPICAL-DAY QUESTION (DESCRIBED IN PS 000 482), (2) THE MOTHER-TEACHER  PICTURE (DESCRIBED IN PS 000 481), AND (3) THE CHILDREN'S APPERCEPTION TEST CARD NO. 3. LANGUAGE SAMPLES WERE ANALYZED AND SCORED, USING THE CRITERIA DESCRIBED IN THE MANUAL, FOR (1) MEAN SENTENCE LENGTH, (2) MEAN PRE-VERB LENGTH, (3) UNCOMMON ADJECTIVES, (4) UNCOMMON ADVERBS, (5) VERB ELABORATION, (6) ABSTRACTION, (7) STRUCTURE ELABORATION, AND (8) CONTENT ELABORATION. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT FACTOR ANALYSIS DISCLOSED A SINGLE FACTOR INVOLVING (1), (2), (5), AND (7) ABOVE. SCORES ON THESE FACTORS WERE CONVERTED TO Z-SCORES, AND A MEAN Z-SCORE WAS COMPUTED FOR EACH LANGUAGE SAMPLE.

        "description":"THE AUTHOR CHARACTERIZES THIS BULLETIN AS A MESSAGE ON LANGUAGE. THE MESSAGE IS FACILITATED BY (1) A FLUID AND IMAGINATIVE USE OF TYPESETTING, (2) A NARRATIVE-FORM STORY, AND (3) A STORY-PLOT THAT INVOLVES SEVERAL LANGUAGE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE STORY COMPRISES THE ENTIRE BULLETIN, THE PURPOSE OF THE BULLETIN IS NOT JUST TO TELL A STORY. ITS PURPOSE, IN PART, IS TO ILLUSTRATE THE DIFFICULTIES LANGUAGE CAN CREATE AND THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF YOURSELF AND OTHERS THAT THE PROPER USE OF LANGUAGE CAN PROVIDE. LANGUAGE, AS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PEOPLE, CAN BE EITHER A SOURCE OF UNDERSTANDING OR OF ALIENATION. THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHER IN THE STORY STRUGGLES WITH TURNING HER INITIAL ALIENATION FROM A STRONG-WILLED LITTLE BOY INTO UNDERSTANDING OF HIS INDIVIDUAL  PERSONALITY. BY DISCUSSING THE PROBLEM WITH THE PRINCIPAL, WITH OTHER TEACHERS AT A TEACHERS' MEETING, AND WITH HERSELF, SHE COMES TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE BOY'S ABILITIES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, HER OWN LACK OF INSIGHT. SOON SHE IS ABLE TO CHANNEL THE BOY'S INDIVIDUAL STRENGTHS TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL. THE STORY POINTS OUT THAT LANGUAGE AS A MEDIUM OF COMMUNICATION IS ONLY EFFECTIVE WHEN THE LISTENER LISTENS CAREFULLY. THE IMPORT OF THE COMMUNICATION OFTEN GOES BEYOND THE SPOKEN WORD. ANOTHER LESSON THE STORY INTRODUCES IS THE GREAT NEED FOR FLEXIBLE, CREATIVE, AND IMAGINATIVE INSTRUCTION IN GUIDING CHILDREN'S LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. THE VERBAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILDREN ARE AS DIFFERENT AS THEIR SOCIAL PERSONALITIES. INTERACTION BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND EXPERIENCE IS AN AREA OF LANGUAGE  INSTRUCTION THAT NEEDS MORE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION IN ALL ASPECTS OF TEACHING.

THE MOST NOTABLE OF THESE OCCURS AT ABOUT THE FOURTH GRADE AND IS THE OBJECT OF THIS STUDY. THREE SETS OF INVESTIGATIONS WERE UNDERTAKEN--(1) A STUDY OF CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT IN 7 CULTURES, (2) A STUDY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONFORMITY TENDENCIES, AND (3) LONGITUDINAL STUDIES OF CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT. THE 7 CULTURES SELECTED WERE (1) UNITED STATES, DOMINANT, ADVANTAGED, (2) UNITED STATES, SEGREGATED, NEGRO, (3) WESTERN AUSTRALIA, (4) WESTERN SAMOA, (5) WEST GERMANY, (6) NORWAY, AND (7) INDIA. THE BASIC DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM A BATTERY OF VERBAL AND NONVERBAL TESTS GIVEN TO THE CHILDREN AND WERE SUPPLEMENTED  WITH INFORMATION FROM TEACHERS ABOUT THEIR TEACHING PRACTICES AND THEIR CONCEPTS OF AN &quot;IDEAL PUPIL.&quot; SAMPLE SIZES FOR EACH CULTURE RANGED FROM 500 TO 1000 CHILDREN COVERING GRADES 1 THROUGH 6. THE CONFORMITY TENDENCIES WERE EXPLORED IN A SERIES OF 6 STUDIES, EACH INVOLVING FROM 150 TO 500 U.S. ADVANTAGED-CULTURE CHILDREN IN GRADES 2 THROUGH 6. THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY WAS BASED ON A SAMPLE OF 100 U.S. ADVANTAGED-CULTURE CHILDREN WHOSE PERFORMANCES IN THE THIRD, FOURTH, AND FIFTH GRADES WERE COMPARED. THE INTERCULTURAL STUDY FOUND THAT DISCONTINUITIES IN DEVELOPMENT OCCUR IN MOST CULTURES AND CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL SOCIAL DEMANDS. THE TEACHERS' RESPONSES ON AN IDEAL PUPIL CHECKLIST PROVED ABLE, WHEN COMPARED  WITH THOSE OF AN EXPERT PANEL ASKED TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A CREATIVE CHILD, TO PREDICT THE RELATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE DIFFERENT CULTURES' CHILDREN IN CREATIVITY. THE CONFORMITY STUDIES REVEALED AN INCREASED TENDENCY FOR CHILDREN TO CONSULT WITH THEIR PEERS AT ABOUT THE FOURTH GRADE, AND THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF THE SLUMP IN INDIVIDUALS.

        "description":"EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOW BECAUSE THE ENORMOUS INCREASE IN THE RATE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WHICH TOOK PLACE DURING THE 1940'S HAS ALTERED OUR SOCIETY FROM A PERFORMANCE TO A LEARNING SOCIETY. IN A PERFORMANCE SOCIETY, LEARNING IS A PRELUDE TO THE PRACTICE OF A FIXED SET OF SKILLS. HOWEVER, IN A LEARNING SOCIETY THE REQUIRED SKILLS CHANGE TOO RAPIDLY FOR THIS TO BE POSSIBLE. LEARNING MUST CONTINUE INTO ADULTHOOD, AND MAKING THIS POSSIBLE REQUIRES A THOROUGHGOING REFORM OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE MUST NOW INCULCATE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS AND ABSTRACT SYMBOLIC SKILLS RATHER THAN TECHNICAL VIRTUOSITY. THROUGH THE USE OF COMPUTERS AS TEACHING MACHINES, TECHNOLOGY CAN BE TURNED BACK ON ITSELF TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS IT POSES. THIS USAGE IS NOW BEGINNING TO  BE REALIZED THROUGH THE INTERVENTION OF &quot;BIG BUSINESS&quot; AND GOVERNMENT. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS USAGE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EDISON RESPONSIVE ENVIRONMENT MACHINE OR &quot;TALKING TYPEWRITER.&quot; HERETOFORE, THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES HAVE NOT CONTRIBUTED TO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, BUT THIS MACHINE IS BASED ON A SOCIOLOGICAL CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE LEARNER AND HIS ENVIRONMENT. THIS HAS LED TO STARTLING RESULTS. IT ALSO HAS OFFERED A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF MATCHING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITIES BY USING THE LEARNER AS A SOURCE OF MATERIAL FOR HIS OWN EDUCATION. SOME EXAMPLES OF THE CAPABILITIES OF LEARNERS, IN THIS CASE CHILDREN FROM 3 TO 6 YEARS OF AGE, ARE ILLUSTRATED BY 5 FILM CLIPS (REFERRED TO AND DESCRIBED BUT NOT INCLUDED IN THE DOCUMENT).

        "description":"SPEAKING AN ORAL LANGUAGE AND SPEAKING A WRITTEN LANGUAGE INVOLVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF LANGUAGE USE WHICH ARE IN TURN RELATED TO DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL METHODS AND DIFFERENT COURSES OF COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT. BECAUSE ORAL SPEECH RELIES ON CONTEXT FOR COMMUNICATION, A COMMON CONTEXT AND POINT OF VIEW IS ASSUMED BY THE SPEAKER TO EXIST BETWEEN THE LISTENER AND HIMSELF, AND HIS SPEECH IS ATTACHED TO CONTEXT-DEPENDENT THOUGHT. IN ORAL CULTURES, EDUCATION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE CHILD'S LEARNING TO IMITATE, USING CONCRETE OBJECTS IN CONCRETE ACTIVITIES. IN A WRITTEN LANGUAGE CULTURE, WHERE KNOWLEDGE EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT WHICH ANY 1 INDIVIDUAL CAN KNOW, ABSTRACT THINKING IS ENCOURAGED, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE ABILITY TO GENERALIZE AND TO MANIPULATE SYMBOLS. IN EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED WITH THE  WOLOF CHILDREN IN SENEGAL IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT LANGUAGE USE RATHER THAN LANGUAGE STRUCTURE DETERMINES COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT. IT WAS FOUND THAT WOLOF SCHOOL CHILDREN TAUGHT IN FRENCH NONETHELESS CHANGED THEIR USE OF WOLOF IN A CONCEPT-FORMATION SITUATION SO THAT IN FUNCTIONAL TERMS WOLOF BECAME MORE &quot;WRITTEN.&quot; UNITED STATES NEGRO LOWER CLASS CHILDREN HAVE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE THE SAME OBJECT-CONTEXT ORIENTATION FOUND IN ORAL CULTURES AND HAVE SIMILARLY IMPROVED IN ABSTRACT THINKING ABILITY WHEN GIVEN TRAINING.

THE BI-CULTURAL CURRICULUM PROPOSED IS A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN TWO EXTREMES--IMPOSING THE MAJORITY'S LIFE STYLE AND ALLOWING THE COMPLETE SUBSTITUTION OF ANOTHER. THUS, THE BEST FEATURES OF EACH CULTURE WOULD PREVAIL, POSSIBLY LEADING TO THE EVENTUAL CONVERGENCE OF THE TWO. THIS BI-CULTURAL CURRICULUM WOULD PROVIDE THE BEST CHANCE OF ACCOMPLISHING TWO OBJECTIVES--(1) THE MINORITY STUDENTS WOULD HAVE THE SELF-CONFIDENCE OF A SECURE HOME CULTURE, AND (2) THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS WOULD BE RELIEVED OF  THEIR SUPERIORITY COMPLEX. THE PLAN FOR DEVELOPING THIS SORT OF BI-CULTURAL CURRICULUM WOULD REQUIRE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DESCRIPTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF CULTURES, AND THE APPLICATION OF THAT KNOWLEDGE IN THE CURRICULUM. ONCE THIS DESCRIPTIVE KNOWLEDGE IS ACCUMULATED THROUGH RESEARCH, IT THEN BECOMES THE TASK OF EDUCATORS TO PROPERLY SEQUENCE EXPERIENCES WHICH WILL PERMIT STUDENTS TO ASSIMILATE THAT KNOWLEDGE.

THE BILINGUAL SCHOOLS AT LAREDO, TEXAS, HAVE SUCCEEDED IN CREATING AN EFFECTIVE, \"TWO-WAY,\" MIXED BILINGUAL SCHOOL SYSTEM, GIVING EQUAL TIME TO SPANISH AND ENGLISH. THE CORAL WAY SCHOOL, ANOTHER BILINGUAL SCHOOL LOCATED IN MIAMI, FLORIDA, IS ALSO \"TWO-WAY,\" PROVIDING ABOUT EQUAL TIME FOR THE 2 LANGUAGES. HOWEVER, FROM GRADE 1 THROUGH GRADE 3, THERE IS CONSIDERABLY LESS MIXING OF THE 2 CULTURAL GROUPS. THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEM IN BILINGUALISM IS THAT OF GAINING FAVORABLE ADMINISTRATIVE ATTITUDE AND POLICY. BILINGUAL SCHOOLING IS PROFITABLE  BECAUSE IT MAKES FOR SUPERIOR EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT AND STUDENTS CAN BEST LEARN THROUGH THEIR MOTHER TONGUE. THROUGH THIS APPROACH, BICULTURALISM CAN BE ACHIEVED, RATHER THAN THE CUTTING OF TIES FROM THE ORIGINAL CULTURE.

AS A RESULT OF THIS HYPOTHESIS, A THREE-PART CURRICULUM WAS DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED FOR THEIR TRAINING, CONSISTING OF SPANISH LANGUAGE SKILLS, COMMUNICATION SKILLS, AND ATTITUDINAL TRAINING.

THESE INCLUDE PSYCHOLINGUISTICS, SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIOLINGUISTICS, AND DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLINGUISTICS. PSYCHOLINGUISTICS HAS ESTABLISHED TWO TYPES OF BILINGUALS--COMPOUND AND COORDINATE. THE COMPOUND BILINGUAL MIXES BOTH LANGUAGES WITHOUT ALWAYS BEING AWARE THAT HE DOES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE COORDINATE BILINGUAL SEEMS TO OPERATE ON TWO SEPARATE CHANNELS, KEEPING HIS LANGUAGES SEPARATE. THIS SUGGESTS THAT POSITIVE ATTITUDES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AT EARLIER AGES. PSYCHOLINGUISTS SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT A BILINGUAL BE PROVIDED WITH A RICH REPERTOIRE OF LINGUISTIC ALTERNATIVES FROM WHICH HE CAN CONSCIOUSLY SELECT THE MOST APPROPRIATE LINGUISTIC BEHAVIOR.

RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WILL HELP TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY INCLUDE--(1) INDIANS SHOULD  HAVE LOCAL CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN SCHOOLS, (2) INDIANS EMPLOYED WITH FEDERAL FUNDS FOR WORK WITH OTHER INDIANS SHOULD BE FROM THE SAME TRIBE, (3) INDIAN SCHOOLS SHOULD IMPLEMENT BILINGUAL INSTRUCTION, (4) A STRONG, MUTUALLY-REINFORCING RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE DEVELOPED BETWEEN INDIAN PUPILS' PARENTS AND THE SCHOOL, AND (5) THERE SHOULD BE FURTHER GRADUATE STUDY AND A RESEARCH CENTER FOCUSED ON THE HISTORY, LANGUAGES, AND CULTURE OF AMERICAN INDIANS.

EARLY TRAINING IN LANGUAGE STUDY CAN ENHANCE AND REINFORCE THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED IN AREAS SUCH AS SCIENCE, SOCIAL STUDIES, OR READING.

THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT BY ACHIEVING COMPETENCY, MATURITY, AND ORAL AND WRITTEN FLUENCY IN SPANISH, THE LEARNINGS ACQUIRED FOR SPANISH CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO THE TASK OF LEARNING ENGLISH, AND SUCCESS IN SPANISH MAY ALSO PROVIDE A STRONG MOTIVATING FORCE TO DO WELL IN OTHER AREAS OF LEARNING. WITH THIS PREMISE IN MIND, THE TEXAS UNIVERSITY SAN ANTONIO LANGUAGE RESEARCH PROJECT WAS  INITIATED TO DEVELOP ORAL LANGUAGE, BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH, THROUGH AN INTENSIVE AUDIO-LINGUAL APPROACH. A SERIES OF LESSON PLANS WAS THEN DEVISED. IT IS HOPED THAT THE RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY CAN PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INSTRUCTION IN THE NATIVE LANGUAGE OF THE LEARNER THROUGH THE USE OF AUDIO-LINGUAL TECHNIQUES AND CAREFULLY SEQUENCED PLANS FOR DEVELOPING COGNITIVE ABILITIES PRODUCES MEASURABLE ACADEMIC SUCCESS.

BECAUSE OF THIS HIGH DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE ON LOCAL EFFORT, EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY VARIES WITH PREVAILING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AMONG THE 154 SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHICH HAVE A PUPIL ENROLLMENT OF LESS THAN 2,500. COSTS PER PUPIL IN THESE DISTRICTS DECLINE AS THE PUPIL POPULATION INCREASES. A PATTERN OF LESS TAXABLE WEALTH PER PUPIL AND LOW PER PUPIL EXPENDITURES IS NOTICEABLE IN THE RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE. USUALLY, THE SMALL RURAL DISTRICTS ARE LESS ABLE TO AFFORD EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. IMPROVEMENT OF THIS SITUATION WILL COME THROUGH STATE AID OR SOME REORGANIZATION OF DISTRICTS. THE STATE PROVIDES MONEY OVER AND ABOVE THE PROCEEDS OF THE TAX OF $14 PER THOUSAND DOLLARS OF  EQUALIZED VALUATION FOR EACH DISTRICT. HOWEVER, THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT APPROVED ADEQUATE FUNDS TO MEET FULLY THE INTENT OF THIS FOUNDATION AID PROGRAM PROVIDED BY LAW. CONSEQUENTLY, SMALL RURAL DISTRICTS SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF THE ORGANIZATION OF A COOPERATIVE SCHOOL DISTRICT, OR A REGIONAL ENROLLMENT AREA. (ES)",

THE FIRST PHASE OF THE STUDY WAS AN HISTORICAL RESEARCH INTO AMISH CONFLICT WITH PUBLIC SCHOOLING, AND THE SECOND PHASE INVOLVED DATA COLLECTION THROUGH A 60-ITEM INTERVIEW SCHEDULE. THE ROOT OF AMISH RESISTANCE TO PUBLIC SCHOOLING IS THEIR BELIEF THAT AS A COMMUNITY OF CHRISTIANS, THEY SHOULD MAINTAIN A BOUNDARY BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE SECULAR WORLD. THEY FEAR THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLING WILL DISSOLVE THIS BOUNDARY AND ULTIMATELY DESTROY THE AMISH COMMUNITY. AS  A RESULT OF PRESSURE, THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR OWN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS USING UNCERTIFIED AMISH TEACHERS. THE AMISH VIEW PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE AS MORE IMPORTANT THAN \"BOOK LEARNING,\" AND THEIR SCHOOLS TEACH ONLY THE BASIC SKILLS THROUGH THE EIGHTH GRADE.

INDIVIDUALS WHO SPEAK ADEQUATELY BUT WHO READ INADEQUATELY SUFFER INTERFERENCE FROM THE VISUAL INPUT SYSTEM IN THE LEARNING OF READING. IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS TO LEARN TO READ, VISUAL INPUT MUST BE BLOCKED. THE NONVISUAL ATK METHOD BLOCKS THE CONFLICTING MODALITY WITH CONSTRUCTIVE RESULTS AT STRATEGIC STAGES IN THE LEARNING PROCESS. USUALLY, THE CHILD IS BLINDFOLDED OR CLOSES HIS EYES, AND THE WORD TO BE LEARNED IS TRACED ON HIS BACK. AS THE TEACHER TRACES THE WORD, SHE SPELLS IT ALOUD. OFTEN, AFTER TWO OR THREE TRACINGS, THE CHILD CAN IDENTIFY THE LETTERS BEING TRACED, AND HE  SPEELS OUT THE WORD. IN GENERAL, ONCE A WORD HAS BEEN MASTERED BY THE NONVISUAL METHOD, IT SEEMS TO BE HANDLED BY THE CHILD WITH COMPLETE NORMALCY. A LEARNING FACTOR SEEMS TO MATURE, AND WORD RECOGNITION, SPELLING, AND READING COMPREHENSION IMPROVE AT A CONSIDERABLY FASTER RATE THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED FROM THE LIMITED NUMBER OF WORDS TAUGHT.

CHALL CONTRASTED THE WHOLE-WORD APPROACH WITH THE CODE-EMPHASIS APPROACH IN WHICH A CHILD BREAKS THE CODE THROUGH LETTER-SOUND ASSOCIATIONS. IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT CHILDREN FIND MORE DIFFICULTY IN DECODING THE PRINTED WORD THAN IN COMPREHENDING THE STORY, THAT PHONICS DOES NOT NECESSARILY RESULT IN MECHANICAL READING, AND THAT PHONETIC KNOWLEDGE ALLOWS THE CHILD TO READ INDEPENDENTLY AND IMPROVES HIS SPELLING AND WRITING ABILITIES. TEACHING PERCEPTUALLY HANDICAPPED CHILDREN TO READ REQUIRES SYSTEMATIC PHONICS INSTRUCTION ENRICHED BY KINESTHETIC TRAINING, LESSONS PROGRAMED IN SMALL SEGMENTS, AND CONSTANT REVIEW AND REINFORCEMENT.

IN ADDITION, POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PROJECT AND THE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES INFORMATION CENTER (ERIC) AND THE ERIC/CRIER CLEARINGHOUSE ON READING WERE EXPLORED. THE  5,380 CITATIONS IN THE GRAY SUMMARIES ON READING RESEARCH WERE PUT ON A MAGNETIC TAPE MASTER FILE AND WERE USED AS THE DATA BASE FROM WHICH TO DEFINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMMUNICATION NETWORK IN READING. ONE OF THE TRENDS IDENTIFIED WAS THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL READING ASSOCIATION IN THE GENERATION OF RESEARCH LITERATURE ON READING. AN ANALYSIS OF THE DATA INDICATED A GRADUAL INCREASE IN INFORMATION ON READING RESEARCH OVER THE PAST FOUR DECADES, WITH MUCH MORE RAPID GROWTH SINCE THE LATE 1950'S. THERE ARE NOW FOUR TIMES AS MANY JOURNALS REPORTING SEVEN TIMES AS MANY ARTICLES ON READING RESEARCH AS THERE WERE DURING THE EARLIER YEARS OF THE GRAY SUMMARIES.

A SHORT QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SENT TO ABOUT 70 CHEMISTS REPRESENTING A WIDE RANGE OF ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL ENDEAVOR. RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED TO INDICATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF A WIDE RANGE OF MATHEMATICS COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS, RELEVANT TO THREE TYPES OF CHEMISTRY CURRICULA--(1) TERMINAL PROGRAMS, (2) PROGRAMS LEADING TO CONTINUED STUDY IN CHEMISTRY OR OTHER FIELDS, NOT ORIENTED TOWARD  PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY, AND (3) PROGRAMS APPROPRIATE TO CONTINUED STUDY IN CHEMISTRY OR RELATED FIELDS OF A PHYSICAL NATURE (PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY, CHEMICAL PHYSICS).

ITS OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE A PROGRAM THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVELY USED IN SCIENCE CLASSES TO PROVIDE AN UNDERSTANDING OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ITS IMPACT ON SOCIETY. THOUGH TEACHER INSTITUTES HAD BEEN CONDUCTED TO PROVIDE NEW MATERIALS AND INSIGHTS, A LACK OF AN INCLUSIVE SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON CONCEPTS AND MATERIALS SEEMED TO HINDER IMPLEMENTATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS. THIS PROJECT WAS ORGANIZED TO DEVELOP A SET OF INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES, EXPRESSED IN BEHAVIORAL TERMS, REGARDING NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ITS IMPACT ON SOCIETY. THESE OBJECTIVES WERE DESIGNED AS MODULES THAT COULD BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF  EXISTING SCIENCE AND SOCIAL SCIENCE COURSES. &quot;NEED-TO-KNOW&quot; ITEMS WERE DETERMINED FOR THE AVERAGE NON-SCIENCE ORIENTED HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE, IN ORDER FOR HIM TO PERFORM AS A RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN. TWO TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED TO ACHIEVE PROJECT OBJECTIVES WERE (1) THE USE OF SYSTEMS TECHNIQUES FOR MISSION ANALYSIS AND DEFINITIONS, AND (2) THE USE OF BEHAVIORAL TERMS FOR INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES. THE DOCUMENT IS ORGANIZED INTO SECTIONS AS FOLLOWS--(1) FRAMEWORK, IDENTIFYING THE HIGHER ORDER BEHAVIORS AND PROVIDING AN OVER-ALL MATRIX WITHIN WHICH KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, AND SKILLS CAN BE ORDERED, (2) SOCIAL ISSUES RELEVANT TO NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY, ILLUSTRATING THE WAY EACH TERMINAL BEHAVIOR FROM THE FRAMEWORK COULD BE DEVELOPED, (3) MODULES OF INSTRUCTION, SHOWING HOW SCIENCE AND SOCIAL SCIENCE  CONTENT AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES CAN BE STRUCTURED INTO LEARNING UNITS, (4) BEHAVIORALIZED SCIENCE DATA, GIVING A BREAKDOWN OF THE BASIC SCIENCE DATA INTO BEHAVIORAL TERMS--BEHAVIORAL OBJECTIVES, STIMULUS CUES, AND CRITERION TEST MEASURES, AND (5) BACKGROUND CONTENT, A COMPILATION OF THE &quot;NEED TO KNOW&quot; CONTENT IDENTIFIED BY THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AS NECESSARY TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOCIO-SCIENTIFIC IMPLICATIONS OF TECHNICAL DISCOVERIES.

AN EXTENSIVE APPLICATION OF THIS METHOD TO THE DESIGN OF AN EARLY LEARNING CURRICULUM WILL BE UNDERTAKEN OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS BY THE PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT. THE PROJECT AIMS TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT AN INDIVIDUALIZED CURRICULUM AND SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT FOR A HETEROGENEOUS URBAN POPULATION. THE PROGRAM WILL BEGIN AT THE PRE-SCHOOL LEVEL, WITH THREE-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN, AND WILL EVENTUALLY BE DEVELOPED THROUGH THE THIRD GRADE. THE EXPERIMENTAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL WORK FOR THIS PROGRAM WILL TAKE PLACE IN A SINGLE PITTSBURGH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CHOSEN FOR ITS UNUSUAL DEGREE OF ECONOMIC AND RACIAL HETEROGENEITY. ULTIMATELY, THE PROJECT'S GOAL  IS TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED ELSEWHERE AT A REASONABLE COST AND WITHOUT THE CONTINUED SUPPORT OF AN OUTSIDE RESEARCH TEAM. DEVELOPED IN THE MAIN BODY OF THIS PAPER ARE (1) NEED FOR AN EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM, (2) CONTENT OF AN EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM, (3) ANALYSIS AND SEQUENCING OF OBJECTIVES, (4) CURRICULUM SEQUENCES AND THEIR USE IN THE CLASSROOM, AND (5) VALIDATION OF CURRICULUM SEQUENCES.

THE SURVEY WAS DESIGNED TO ANSWER SEVERAL QUESTIONS. AT THE ELEMENTARY LEVEL, IT WAS DESIRABLE TO FIND OUT WHETHER IN-SERVICE CLASSES WERE HAVING ANY EFFECT UPON THE PROGRAM OF MATHEMATICS. THIS WAS TO BE DETERMINED BY (1) OBSERVATION OF THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE OF TEACHERS IN IN-SERVICE CLASSES, (2) PARTICULAR TEXTBOOKS IN USE IN MATHEMATICS CLASSES, AND (3) AVAILABILITY AND USE OF OVERHEAD PROJECTORS BY TEACHERS. AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL, THE SURVEY WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION RELATIVE TO SEVERAL TOPICS--(1) THE NUMBER OF PUPILS ENROLLED IN THE MATHEMATICS COURSES, (2) THE PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION AND CONTINUING EDUCATION OF THE TEACHERS,  AND (3) INFORMATION CONCERNING THE EXTENT OF MATHEMATICS CLUBS FOR STUDENTS AND AVAILABILITY OF OVERHEAD PROJECTORS FOR TEACHERS. THE RESULTS OF THE TWO SURVEYS GENERALLY INDICATED THAT THE SCHOOLS OF MINNESOTA ARE PROGRESSING IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION.

THE PROGRAM SUPPORTS PROJECTS WHICH DEAL WITH PROBLEMS OF A NATURE AND COMPLEXITY THAT WARRANT THE COOPERATIVE EFFORTS OF A SCHOOL SYSTEM AND AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION. TWO EXAMPLES OF THE PROJECTS SUPPORTED BY CCSS ARE THE FOLLOWING--(1) A SCHOOL SYSTEM IN NEED OF EXPERT ADVICE ON THE KINDS OF CHANGES THAT SHOULD BE MADE IN ITS MATHEMATICS OR SCIENCE PROGRAM REQUIRES ASSISTANCE IN TRAINING TEACHERS AND IN INTRODUCING NEW PROGRAM MATERIALS  TO STUDENTS - A GRANT FROM THE CCSS PROGRAM ENABLES A NEAR-BY COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY TO PROVIDE THE EXPERT ASSISTANCE WHICH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM NEEDS, AND (2) A SCHOOL SYSTEM DECIDES TO IMPROVE ITS SCIENCE OR MATHEMATICS PROGRAM NOT BY INTRODUCING A NEW CURRICULUM, BUT BY TAKING REMEDIAL MEASURES TO MODERNIZE AND IMPROVE THE EXISTING COURSES - A COLLEGE COLLABORATING WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM PROVIDES THE INSERVICE INSTRUCTION NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE TEACHERS TO CARRY OUT SUCH REFORMS. AS SHOWN IN THE EXAMPLES, THE PROJECTS INVOLVE A DOUBLE COMMITMENT.

MOREOVER, THE DRAMATIZATION OF WORTHWHILE MATERIAL THROUGH PANTOMIME OR PLAY-ACTING PROVIDES THE CHILD WITH THE HUMAN EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS AND PROMOTES THE CAPACITY FOR COPING WITH PROBLEMS AND FEELINGS. THIS ACTIVITY IS PARTICULARLY HELPFUL WITH SLOW READERS BECAUSE, IN DRAMATIZING THE WRITTEN WORD, THEY ARE LED TO A GREATER INTEREST IN READING ITSELF. NECESSARY,  HOWEVER, IS A CLASSROOM ATMOSPHERE WHICH ALLOWS FOR CREATIVE EXPRESSION AND SPONTANEOUS DRAMATIZATION.

THE SUBJECT SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS WAS &quot;THE O'RUDDY,&quot; BEGUN BY STEPHEN CRANE AND COMPLETED BY ROBERT BARR. SINCE THERE WAS NO RECORD OF THE POINT OF TRANSITION, THE AUTHORSHIP OF VARIOUS CHAPTERS WAS IN DOUBT. THE RESULTS OF A PILOT STUDY, DESIGNED TO GENERATE TECHNIQUES FOR SUCH WORK, INDICATED THAT NOT ONLY SINGLE ITEMS, BUT ALSO PATTERNS OF INTERRELATIONSHIPS WOULD DISCRIMINATE. AFTER PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS TO GENERATE 18 WEIGHTED VARIABLES, AND A SUBSEQUENT CHECK ON THE VALIDITY OF THOSE VARIABLES AND THEIR WEIGHTING, THE NEW TECHNIQUE WAS APPLIED TO PARAGRAPHS, BLOCKS  OF 1,000 WORDS, AND WHOLE CHAPTERS OF &quot;THE O'RUDDY,&quot; RESULTING IN THE ASSIGNMENT OF CHAPTERS 1-24 TO CRANE, CHAPTER 25 AS TRANSITIONAL, AND CHAPTERS 26-33 TO BARR. THIS RESEARCH METHOD OFFERS A WAY OF ANALYZING NOT ONLY THE PATTERN OF STUDENT COMPOSITION, BUT ALSO THE PATTERN AND SPECIFIC STYLISTIC DEVICES OF ACCEPTED AUTHORS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIABLES IN THE COMPOSING PROCESS.

FIFTH- AND SIXTH-GRADE CHILDREN FROM ALL OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND FROM DEPRIVED, AVERAGE, AND MIDDLE CLASS AREAS OF NIAGRA FALLS, NEW YORK, AND THEIR 100 TEACHERS PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY.

INDIVIDUALIZED READING IS A TEACHER-GUIDED PROGRAM IN THE READING OF FICTION WHICH ALLOWS THE STUDENT TO CHOOSE WHAT HE READS OVER A CONTINUOUS PERIOD OF TIME. INDIVIDUAL CONFERENCES ARE HELD PERIODICALLY TO DISCUSS THE BOOKS THE STUDENT HAS READ AND TO CHECK HIS PROGRESS. AFTER ONLY ONE YEAR OF SUCH A COURSE AT THE KEOKUK, IOWA, SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL, 85 PERCENT OF THE INCOMING SENIORS REQUESTED TO TAKE IT. WITH THIS IMPETUS, A STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO DETERMINE WHAT DIFFERENCES EXIST BETWEEN STUDENTS WHO TAKE INDIVIDUALIZED READING AND THOSE WHO DO NOT. TEST 7 OF THE IOWA TESTS OF EDUCATIONAL  DEVELOPMENT (ITED) AND THE \"INVENTORY OF SATISFACTIONS FOUND IN READING FICTION\" WERE ADMINISTERED TO STUDENTS IN AN INDIVIDUALIZED READING PROGRAM, TO STUDENTS WHO WANTED THE PROGRAM BUT WEREN'T TAKING IT, AND TO STUDENTS IN A REQUIRED LITERATURE COURSE. EACH GROUP CONTAINED 65 STUDENTS AT FOUR DIFFERENT ABILITY LEVELS. IN THE INVENTORY CATEGORIES OF RELAXATION, ESCAPE, AND ASSOCIATIONAL VALUES, THE INDIVIDUALIZED READING GROUP WAS FAVORED, BUT THE DIFFERENCES WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. IN THE CATEGORY OF INFORMATION GAINED FROM FICTION, THE DIFFERENCE FAVORED THE INDIVIDUALIZED READING GROUP AND WAS SIGNIFICANT AT THE .01 LEVEL. RESULTS FAVORABLE TO INDIVIDUALIZED READING WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT IN THE AREA OF SELF-DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS FROM THE ITED. WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION  WITH OTHER METHODS OF TEACHING LITERATURE, INDIVIDUALIZED READING APPEARS TO INCREASE STUDENTS' ENJOYMENT OF, FEELING FOR, AND UNDERSTANDING OF LITERATURE.

THE BOYS' RESCUE BY THE UNCOMPREHENDING OFFICER IN \"LORD OF THE FLIES,\" REFOCUSES AND REINFORCES ALL THAT PRECEDES IT, AND THE FABLE, SUPERIMPOSED UPON REAL LIFE, BECOMES EVEN MORE FRIGHTENING UPON REFLECTION. THE SHIFT IN THE LAST CHAPTER OF \"THE INHERITORS\" FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE NEANDERTHAL MEN TO THAT OF THE CRO-MAGNON MEN BRINGS THE READER SUDDEN RECOGNITION THAT HIS IDENTIFICATION WITH THE NEANDERTHALS ALLOWED HIM TO VIEW THE CRO-MAGNONS AS OTHERS MIGHT VIEW HIM. THE REVELATION AT THE CLOSE OF \"PINCHER MARTIN\" THAT MARTIN'S BOOK-LONG STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL ACTUALLY OCCURS WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS  FORCES A REVIEW OF THE NOVEL AND PREVENTS AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF INTERPRETATION. ALTHOUGH SAMMY'S TORTURE CHAMBER IN \"FREE FALL\" IS FINALLY REVEALED AS A BROOM CLOSET, THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SAMMY WAS THROWN INTO THE CLOSET BY ACCIDENT EMPHASIZES THE IRONY EITHER OF SAMMY'S EXTREME SELF-TORTURE OR OF HALDE'S UNDERSTANDING OF SAMMY'S MIND. WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF EACH \"SURPRISE ENDING,\" THE READER IS FORCED TO TAKE A BACKWARD LOOK FROM A SUDDEN NEW PERSPECTIVE.

        "description":"AN EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED, OVER A 2-YEAR PERIOD, AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL TO TEST THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF A STUDY OF A GENERATIVE GRAMMAR ON STUDENT COMPOSITIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR CURRICULUM, AN EXPERIMENTAL CLASS OF 50 NINTH-GRADERS (AND 10TH-GRADERS THE FOLLOWING YEAR) WAS REQUIRED TO LEARN TRANSFORMATIONAL-GENERATIVE GRAMMATICAL MATERIALS PREPARED BY THE INVESTIGATORS. SAMPLES OF WRITING BY BOTH THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL CLASSES WERE COLLECTED DURING THE FIRST 3 MONTHS OF THE PROJECT, AND IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS OF THE 2-YEAR PERIOD. THESE WERE ANALYZED FOR (1) STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY, (2) THE PROPORTION OF WELL-FORMED TO MALFORMED SENTENCES, AND (3) THE TREND IN THE FREQUENCY AND KINDS OF MISOPERATIONS THAT OCCURRED. RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT  KNOWLEDGE OF GENERATIVE GRAMMAR (1) ENABLES STUDENTS TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THE PROPORTION OF WELL-FORMED SENTENCES IN THEIR WRITING, (2) SEEMS TO ENABLE STUDENTS TO INCREASE THE COMPLEXITY WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE GRAMMATICALITY OF THEIR SENTENCES, AND (3) CAN ENABLE STUDENTS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ERRORS IN THEIR WRITING. BECAUSE THE LOGIC OF GENERATIVE GRAMMAR SEEMS TO REPRESENT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS OF SENTENCE FORMATION, ITS STUDY HELPS THE STUDENT OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES OF WRITING WITH GRAMMATICAL EFFECTIVENESS.

SUCH A COURSE SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO AVOID THE CRITICISM THAT CREATIVE WRITING FOSTERS \"EASY-GOING IMPRESSIONISM ABOUT ALL WRITING\" AND A RESISTANCE TO THE DISCIPLINE OF EXPOSITORY WRITING. THE AUTHOR'S CREATIVE WRITING COURSE FOR SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IS CONCEIVED AS A COLLEGE-PREPARATORY COURSE IN PRIMARILY EXPOSITORY WRITING. THE CLASS IS CONDUCTED AS A WORKSHOP IN WHICH EACH STUDENT JUDGES HIS OWN WRITING AGAINST THAT OF HIS PEERS AND OF PROFESSIONAL WRITERS. INSTRUCTION IS INDUCTIVE, CONSISTENTLY MOVING FROM THE STUDENT'S  WRITING TO WRITING PRINCIPLES. AIMS OF THE COURSE ARE (1) TO FAMILIARIZE THE STUDENT WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF WRITING, (2) TO STRENGTHEN HIS ABILITY TO USE STANDARD, ACADEMIC ENGLISH, (3) TO ENCOURAGE HIM THROUGH PRACTICE TO DEVELOP SOME EASE AND PROFICIENCY IN WRITING PROSE, AND (4) TO INVOLVE HIM IN THE WRITING PROCESS, INTERPRETING HIMSELF AND THE WORLD ABOUT HIM IN STORY, ESSAY, AND VERSE. THIS INVOLVEMENT SHARPENS THE STUDENT'S CONSCIOUSNESS OF LITERARY TECHNIQUES AND OFTEN HAS THE FURTHER EFFECT OF MAKING HIM A MORE APPRECIATIVE READER OF LITERATURE.

THESE APPROACHES TO SPELLING WERE (1) A PHONIC-STRUCTURAL APPROACH UTILIZING SKILL AND WORD MAINTENANCE AND INTEGRATION OF LANGUAGE SKILLS, (2) A WHOLE-WORD APPROACH EMPHASIZING MEANING AND CONTEXT, AND UTILIZING THE ANALYSIS OF WORDS AND DEVELOPMENT OF MEANING, AND (3) A TEACHER-DIRECTED APPROACH UTILIZING SKILLS TAUGHT IN THE READING PROGRAM TO DEVELOP SPELLING SKILLS. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE THREE  APPROACHES OCCURRED IN SPELLING ACHIEVEMENT WITHIN THE STUDY'S TOTAL POPULATION OR WITHIN THE 111-140 I.Q. RANGE. THE PHONIC-STRUCTURAL APPROACH PRODUCED A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER GAIN IN SPELLING OVER THE OTHER APPROACHES WITHIN THE 90-110 I.Q. RANGE. SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN GROWTH OF WORD DISCRIMINATION OCCURRED FOR THE TEACHER-DIRECTED APPROACH WHEN CONSIDERING TOTAL POPULATION AND BOTH I.Q. RANGES. INTERPRETED GENERALLY, RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE PHONIC-STRUCTURAL AND TEACHER-DIRECTED APPROACHES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE WHOLE-WORD APPROACH IN DEVELOPING SPELLING ABILITY AND WORD DISCRIMINATION. HOWEVER, THE STUDY WAS BIASED TOWARD THE ABOVE-AVERAGE POPULATION, AND THE YEAR-END TEST DID NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH CEILING TO DISCRIMINATE AMONG THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE HIGH I.Q.  STUDENTS.

THUS, NEGRO STUDENTS ARE CAPABLE OF MUCH GREATER SUBTLETY OF EXPRESSION THAN THEIR RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF VOCABULARY WORDS IMPLIES.

HAVING LEARNED, ALSO, TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN REALITY AND WHAT IS SAID ABOUT DEMOCRACY, THE NEGRO DEVELOPS A FINE SENSE OF  IRONY AND A DEEP SKEPTICISM WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED AS INVALUABLE CRITICAL TOOLS. EXPECTING NEGRO STUDENTS TO HAVE HAD SOCIAL EXPERIENCES ESSENTIAL TO INTERPRETING GIVEN LITERARY WORKS, TEACHERS TEND TO ASSUME POVERTY OF INTELLIGENCE IF THESE EXPERIENCES ARE LACKING, INSTEAD OF SUBSTITUTING BOOKS WHICH REQUIRE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES. BECAUSE MOST NEGRO STUDENTS VIEW EDUCATION AS A MEANS OF ENTERING THE MAINSTREAM OF AMERICAN LIFE, THEY EAGERLY READ NOVELS AND PLAYS WHICH PRESENT THE AMERICAN SCENE FAIRLY AND CLEARLY.

LEVINE POINTS OUT THAT AN INDUCTIVE APPROACH THROUGH WHICH STUDENTS CONSIDER THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF THE NOVEL TENDS TO SUSTAIN STUDENT INTEREST BY GENERATING THE  SATISFACTION OF PERSONAL DISCOVERY, AND QUESTIONS REGARDING THEME ARE APPROACHED MOST APPROPRIATELY IN RELATION TO FORM. NOT ALL NOVELS REPRESENTATIVE OF LITERARY EXCELLENCE ARE SUITABLE FOR ALL STUDENTS. THEREFORE, THE TEACHER MUST EXERCISE INFORMED PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT BOTH IN SELECTING AND IN ADAPTING READING MATERIALS FOR CLASSES AND INDIVIDUALS. UTILIZING NOVELS WITH A BASEBALL THEME CAN BE ONE MEANS OF INTERESTING BOYS IN FULL-LENGTH WORKS. RECENT SURVEYS OF TEACHER ATTITUDES AND RESEARCH BY TEACHERS INDICATE MARKED AGREEMENT THAT SLOW LEARNERS NEED NOT READ ONLY HIGH-INTEREST, LOW-VOCABULARY MATERIALS, BUT CAN READ AND DISCUSS MOST NOVELS RECOMMENDED FOR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS.

IT WAS FOUND THAT DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS WERE CAUSED BY THE STUDENT'S INSECURITY AND RESENTMENT AT BEING WHAT THEY CONSIDERED \"PAWNS\" IN THE RESOLUTION OF A SOCIAL PROBLEM. HOME TRANSFER STUDENTS HAD A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD THEIR NEW SCHOOL BECAUSE THEIR TEACHERS, WHOSE STATUS IS DEPENDENT ON THE STATUS OF THEIR STUDENTS, WERE HOSTILE TO THEM. NEGATIVE ATTITUDES COULD ALSO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE STUDENT'S HOME ENVIRONMENT, PARTICULARLY ONE IN WHICH THERE WAS A DOMINANT MOTHER, WHO IN 80 PERCENT OF OPEN ENROLLMENT TRANSFERS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STUDENT'S ENROLLING IN A NEW  SCHOOL. IN SOME CASES, HOWEVER, STUDENTS HAD A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD THE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY REGARDED IT AS AN ESCAPE FROM THE INSECURITY OF THE HOME ENVIRONMENT. PATTERNS OF GOOD SCHOOL BEHAVIOR COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE EXISTENCE OF A COMPETENT TEACHING AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF, WHO TENDED TO BE FAR MORE IMPORTANT FOR DISCIPLINE THAN THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE SCHOOL OR THE AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLIES.

IT IS REPORTED THAT VIRGINIA, ALABAMA, LOUISIANA, AND MISSISSIPPI PROVIDE TUITION GRANTS, RANGING FROM $185 TO $360 A YEAR, TO WHITE STUDENTS WHO WISH TO ATTEND THESE SCHOOLS. HOWEVER, FEDERAL COURTS HAVE RULED THAT GRANTS FROM THE STATE CANNOT BE THE MAJOR SOURCE OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR PRIVATE SEGREGATED SCHOOLS. ALTHOUGH INTEGRATION AND INCREASED FEDERAL CONTROL OVER THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAS SPURRED THE GROWTH OF THESE SCHOOLS, NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN FORMED TO COUNTER DESEGREGATION, AND SOME OF OLDER ONES HAVE RECENTLY ADMITTED NEGRO STUDENTS. THE ENROLLMENT AND THE EDUCATIONAL QUALITY IN THE SEGREGATED SCHOOLS VARY  CONSIDERABLY. THIS ARTICLE IS PUBLISHED IN &quot;SOUTHERN EDUCATION REPORT,&quot; VOLUME 2, NUMBER 4, NOVEMBER 1966. (LB)",

AND (2) SCHOOL CONDITIONS AND PRACTICES. PERFORMANCE AND MALPERFORMANCE PATTERNS WERE FELT TO BE A RESULT OF THE INTERACTION OF BOTH STUDENT CHARACTERISTICS AND SCHOOL CONDITIONS. RECORDS OF PAST PERFORMANCE AND TEST SCORES WERE USED TO EVALUATE STUDENT CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIORS, AND EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWING DETERMINED SCHOOL CONDITIONS AND PRACTICES. RESULTS SHOW THAT STUDENTS WITH A MIDDLE CLASS BACKGROUND HAVE A SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER CHANCE OF BEING PLACED IN A COLLEGE PREPARATORY CURRICULUM IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND THAT THIS ASSIGNMENT POSITIVELY AFFECTS STUDENT  PERFORMANCE. THE FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE THAT PUPIL CAREERS ARE SHAPED IN PART BY MOTIVATIONS, CAPABILITIES, AND SKILLS WHICH ARE LINKED TO SOCIAL CLASS. IN GENERAL, WHEN THE SCHOOL PREJUDGES THE STUDENT, IT MAY GENERATE THE VERY MALPERFORMANCE IT SEEKS TO ELIMINATE.

THE INDEX IS CONSTRUCTED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES AS NUMBER AND AGE OF PERSONS AND GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION. THE INDEX CAN BE USED TO DEFLATE FAMILY INCOME SO THAT IT IS COMPARABLE FOR ALL FAMILIES AND ALSO TO ADJUST THE OFTEN CITED $3,000 PER FAMILY POVERTY LINE TO LOCAL AND FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES. THE INDEX USES AS ITS MEASURE OF EQUIVALENCE THE SHARE OF FAMILY INCOME DEVOTED TO PARTICULAR CATEGORIES OF CONSUMPTION. THUS, FAMILIES THAT SPEND AN EQUAL FRACTION ON NECESSITIES ARE TAKEN TO BE EQUALLY POOR. BASED ON THIS ASSUMPTION, DIFFERENT FORMS OF THE ENGEL CURVES ARE INVESTIGATED, AND THE METHOD IS APPLIED  TO DATA FROM THE 1960 SURVEY OF CONSUMER EXPENDITURES.
