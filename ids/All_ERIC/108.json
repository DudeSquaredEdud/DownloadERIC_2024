        "author":["Bradley, Vaughn M."],
        "description":"Middle school is a critical time in students' learning of mathematics, something a Learning Management System (LMS) is designed to help parents support. What remains unknown is how parents use an LMS to monitor their children's progress in mathematics. This qualitative case study explored how parents from one midAtlantic middle school with 543 students used an LMS, EdLine, to support their children's autonomous achievement in mathematics. Expectancy-value theory and social cognitive theory made up the conceptual framework used to evaluate study findings. A criterion-based process was used to select nine middle school parents from grades 6, 7, and 8 as participants. Data sources included structured interviews and follow-up questions, EdLine spreadsheets, and parent reflective journals. Data were analyzed through a priori codes based on the literature review. Themes that emerged from the analysis included reoccurring learner autonomy and parents benefiting from their ability to use EdLine to monitor grades, check progress, and provide strategies to support mathematical achievement. Parents indicated they could encourage their children, teach them, and expect them to use EdLine to monitor and manage their grades and achievement in mathematics. This research contributes to positive social change by explaining how administrators can help middle school parents use an LMS to become engaged with their children's mathematics studies and set expectations for their mathematics task completion and achievement.

        "title":"Teacher Professional Development Challenges Faced by Rural Superintendents",
        "author":["Cadero-Smith, Lisa A."],
        "description":"Effective teacher professional development is defined as structured professional learning activities which result in changes in teacher practice and improvements in student learning outcomes. Superintendents face common challenges unique to the rural environment which hinder the delivery of effective teacher professional development in rural school districts. These barriers must be addressed to ensure a high-quality education for all rural students. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the common experiences and perceptions of superintendents responsible for providing teacher professional development in rural school districts. Social constructivism, interpreted through a transcendental phenomenological lens, was the theoretical framework guiding the research. The investigator interviewed 4 purposefully selected superintendents from rural, remote school districts in Western Washington state. A semi-structured interview protocol consisting of open-ended questions aligned to the study's purpose was utilized to gather data. Results showed superintendents faced inadequate fiscal resources, limited human capital, geographic isolation, and difficulties implementing effective teacher professional development in rural environments. Superintendents overcame challenges by establishing a vision and systems within existing resources and employing aligned professional development practices. Superintendents desired supports which were responsive to the unique needs of rural school districts. The findings may inform the work of rural administrators, professional development consultants, policymakers, regulatory agencies, and rural organizations. The findings may also lead to policy changes, shifts in rural school district resource allocation, and changes in rural teacher professional development delivery to ensure the educational equity of all rural students.

        "description":"The COVID-19 Pandemic impacted world society in many ways. The virus rode our interconnected transit systems and exploited a globally connected world where a person can traverse the planet within a day; far shorter a time than the incubation period. The virus challenged our assumptions on communicability of disease and transmission vectors. It challenged our medical systems; in the treatment of the infected, and an evolving understanding of the protocols needed for preserving the health of the vulnerable, and defining who is most vulnerable. COVID-19 challenged our social behaviors, our trust of one another, and the belief we had in our scientific systems to combat such a pandemic. Further, it stalled our educational systems. Unable to hold in-person classes, all levels of education were forced to utilize online platforms. Educators worldwide in disparate disciplines from elementary education through post-graduate study, in every field imaginable were forced to redefine their approaches and learn to adapt the technology we possess to the demands of maintaining progress in education. This pandemic has been no easy challenge. There is an old Chinese saying, &quot;In the midst of adversity is opportunity.&quot; So it has been in this pandemic. Scientists and medical providers around the globe have fought the virus and in record time produced protocols and vaccinations against it. Governments have shared information and pooled resources. Educators have developed new and impressive methods to not only maintain the education of students, but to ignite potentials and inspire the minds of learners despite having a &quot;new normal.&quot; This volume is a collection from educators around the planet who adapted to the changed landscape of education during COVID-19. Each of the contributors refused to accept that education would be stalled, that students would flounder, and that the virus' impact would dim the lamp of learning. Rather each chapter brings a new and powerful adaption, which was implemented during the pandemic. The authors bring lessons, pitfalls, success, and failure to inform the reader of what worked, what did not, and what holds promise for online education long after the COVID-19 Pandemic is resigned to the history books.",

The absence of this data: (1) Is a barrier to full implementation of nondiscrimination protections; (2) Obscures disparities impacting LGBTQ+ young people in K-12 schools; Prevents educators from accessing the information they need to develop and evaluate the impact of programming on LGBTQ+ students and their non-LGBTQ+ peers; and (3) Limits the ability to assess the impact of laws, policies, and initiatives on the health and wellbeing of LGBTQ+ young people and young people with an LGBTQ+ parent, guardian, or family member. Leading scientists, researchers, and educators agree on the need for LGBTQ+ data inclusion. This brief explains why LGBTQ+ data inclusion is necessary to ensure all students have access to safe and inclusive schools and details policy recommendations for LGBTQ+ data inclusion in different contexts, such as: (1) School climate surveys administered by schools or local education agencies, including as part of statewide accountability system; (2) Surveys of teachers, administrators, and other staff; (3) Surveys of parents and families; (4) Federal surveys of young people in K-12 schools, including the Youth Risk Behavior Survey and the High School and Beyond longitudinal study; and (5) Administrative data collection, including the U.S. Department of Education's Civil Rights Data Collection.",

        "description":"Web 2.0 technologies have led to the development of social media platforms that enable users to produce and share their own content. YouTube is such a platform where people can deliver their video clips as well as watch and interpret what others have developed. This study aimed to reach the opinions of the computer engineering students about their YouTube usage profiles and the educational use of the videos published in YouTube. It was designed as a survey research. The sample included 100 undergraduate students from a state university in Turkey. According to the findings, most of the participants access the internet primarily from smart phone and interact with the internet for an average of 6.4 hours a day. The participants stated that YouTube was the most used social media (72%), they subscribed to channels that produce educational content (84%) and watched educational videos (99%). They use YouTube mostly for entertainment (84%) and academic (67%) purposes. They believe that YouTube videos have educational functions such as repetition, compensation, individual learning opportunities, and preparation for exams. No significant differences were found in students' views according to gender and grade level. [For the full proceedings, see ED623149.]",

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to use the matrix laser teaching aids to teach in the moon observation unit to explore the effectiveness of science learning of elementary school students. The subjects of the study were 367 fourth-grade students in an elementary school in New Taipei City, including 154 students in the experimental group and 213 students in the control group. In this study, we first designed a matrix laser teaching aids to produce parallel light like the sun, so as to provide moon observation unit for teaching, which can show the true changes of moon phase changes in teaching. Students in the experimental group received the instruction with the matrix laser teaching aids on the moon observation unit, while students in the control group received the conventional instruction. The research instrument is the Moon Observation Unit Achievement Test, and the reliability of the test is Cronbach [alpha]=0.72. The analysis of research data adopts covariate analysis. The results of the study found: (1) There is no significant difference between the experimental group and the control group in the learning effects on the concepts of the moon; (2) The experimental group did better than the control group on the understanding of observing the moon (F=10.211, p&lt;0.01); (3) The experimental group did better than the control group on the understanding of moon phase changes (F=10.220, p&lt;0.01).Therefore, it can be concluded that using matrix laser teaching aids is effectiveness for the moon observation unit in this study.

        "description":"In a chemistry course for students not majoring in science, there is more to learn than some memorized facts: the student can find, in most non-major chemistry texts, the definition of atomic number, something about chemical bonding, and names of some classes of chemical compounds. Where facts come from and how accurately they are known are often missing. A book is now available in which a number of experiments are included. The first two &quot;experiments&quot; can be done in class; they help the student to understand what is meant by experimental error, accuracy, and precision. The remaining experiments are real, and require a laboratory. In courses lacking labs, students can be given the results, as done by technicians. This was done when the course was most recently taught. Three repeats of measurements allowed an error estimate, to be included in a student's pseudo-lab report. Most lab reports indicated the students understood the material. The text included a qualitative introduction to thermodynamics and black-body radiation, to present some of the science behind climate change. pH is introduced with application to ocean acidification. A Chemistry and Society book should apply the science to the most pressing societal problem with a scientific basis. Also, the book starts with a much more considered introduction to what is usually passed over as &quot;scientific method&quot;. There is a fairly extended discussion of the distinction between hypothesis and well-established theory. There is a chapter on the history and philosophy of science, not going deeply into either, but setting out much more than is found in many books. The book is Chemistry and Society (M. E Green, 2018, Linus Publishers). Based on the final exam over 2/3 of the students understood the material. Overall, this did as well as standard texts, when used for the same course.

        "author":["Green, Michael E."],
        "description":"The use of approximations in solving problems in sciences can be vital for students. Order of magnitude estimation also helps with physical understanding of the quantities involved in a calculation. For example, in the first exam in a first-year class in chemistry the student must find the mass in grams of an atom; a couple of students will multiply by Avogadro's number instead of dividing; for atomic weight around 100, this gives the order of magnitude of the mass of the moon; the moon is big, atoms are small. If the student considered the physical meaning of the mass, this would not be a possible mistake. Another example: calculate the total energy, and potential energy, of a system, and from these find the kinetic energy. If the kinetic energy comes out negative, something is wrong; the student should realize this. One place a student is taught an approximation in first year chemistry is finding the ionization of a weak acid; ionization is approximated by taking the square root of the dissociation constant times concentration, which only works if the concentration is large compared to the dissociation constant. If the student applies the approximation thoughtlessly, this produces an error. The adequacy of any approximation for accurate use is another concept that must be taught. Part of the use of approximations includes attaching error estimates to answers (sometimes expressed as significant figures). There is a second, related, matter that needs to be taught with the estimates; units must match. A book, &quot;The Use of Estimates in Solving Chemistry Problems&quot; (Green and Garland, 1991, Saunders) went through the quantitative parts of first year chemistry, showing how to estimate answers for all sections. A few examples from more advanced material are included too, as this kind of error persists past the first year. [For the full proceedings, see ED623149.]",

This study uses the method of writing assessment to explore the ideas of elementary school children on the causes of the moon phase changes and analyze the explanations of the causes of the moon phase changes. Students' writing assessment were collected as the major source for the study.

The writing assessment processes and the reliability and validity of the study were confirmed by three science educators and senior teachers. The results of the study found: (1) When students explain the causes of the moon phases of the full moon, waxing moon, last quarter moon, and first quarter moon during the day, the 3th graders mostly consider their own relationship, while the 4th, 5th, and 6th graders hold more views of the sun, moon, and the earth; (2) In terms of the proportion of students that the formation of moon phases is related to the sun, except that the proportion of last quarter moon in the 5th grade is slightly higher than that in the 6th grade, the rest are the highest in the 6th grade, indicating that the higher grade students feel the sun more related to the formation of the moon phases.

Now the big data analysis is mainly oriented to the socioeconomic sphere with a goal to lift the profit. The science and technology to penetrate deeper in the nature of objects and systems under investigation prefer to limit the analysis area, concentrating, for example, only on properties of extra pure materials or isolated systems. In science the analysis should be convergent and the initial data may be and should be regularized to diminish the input data errors. The clusters now are considered as a new or still unknown state of matter. The big thermophysical data analysis appears as the most informative way to discover the properties of clusters in pure real gases, because the continuous spectrum of bound states in clusters prevents from the spectroscopic way for clusters' properties evaluation. The goal of the paper is to teach the main principles of the scientific regular data convergent analysis basing on the author's experience to extract clusters' properties in pure real gases from regularized experimental thermophysical big data.

        "description":"Thermodynamics education is not easy both for students and teachers. But the Entropy, Chemical potential, Real gas structure, Fugacity, Molecular interaction, Supercritical phenomena chapters become more comprehensible, if introduced via the pure real gases' cluster physics chapter. A pure gas consists of the only one type of basic particles, therefore, the molar Gibbs energy G is universal for all basic particles. The monomer fraction Gibbs energy Gm logarithmically depends on the monomer fraction density, Dm, which is a perfect argument for thermophysical properties series expansions, named canonical for their correspondence to the fundamental Mass action law. Unlike virial expansions, the n-th canonical expansion coefficient reflects properties of the n-particle cluster. The canonical expansion of various thermodynamics functions, for which precise experimental data may be taken from the NIST Webbook, opens the clusters vision from different points of view. The potential energy of a gas provides the clusters' bond parameters cognition. The bond energy temperature dependence discovers different cluster isomers and the directional bonding. The near critical cluster fractions structure reflects the gas-to-liquid soft structural transition. For students it is useful to develop the canonical series expansion and the cluster structure analysis skills. [For the full proceedings, see ED623149.]",

In order not to delay the graduation, a new concept had to be developed for projects under lockdown conditions. Therefore, unused rooms at the university should be digitally recorded in order to develop a new usage concept as laboratory rooms. An inventory of the actual state of the rooms was done first by taking photos and listing up all flaws and peculiarities. After that, a digital site measuring was done with a 360° laser scanner and these recorded scans were linked to a coherent point cloud and transferred to a software for planning technical building services and supporting Building Information Modelling (BIM). In order to better illustrate the difference between the actual and target state, two virtual reality models were created for realistic demonstration. During the project, the students had to go through the entire digital planning phases. Technical specifications had to be complied with, as well as documentation, time planning and cost estimate. This project turned out to be an excellent alternative to on-site practical training under lockdown conditions and increased the students' motivation to deal with complex technical questions.

In the study, which was organized as a methodological evaluation study, the data were obtained through document analysis method. The research is limited to 20 studies, published between 2000-2020, of which full texts could be accessed from the Turkish National Thesis Center database. The full texts of the theses and dissertations were accessed by using the keywords &quot;geometry in preschool period&quot;, &quot;early childhood geometry&quot;, &quot;early geometry skills&quot;, and &quot;geometric shape&quot;. The data obtained within the scope of the research were analyzed and discussed according to the publication year of scientific studies, language, university, research design, research method, subject, and sampling type. When the documents were analyzed, it was seen that most of the thesis studies were master's theses, mainly belonging to the year 2010 and after, and all of the doctoral dissertations belonged to 2011 and later. It has been determined that the language of the majority of the theses was Turkish, mostly from Selçuk University and Gazi University and conducted following quantitative methods.

This report focuses solely on the school experiences of MENA LGBTQ students. More specifically, this brief describes the school experiences of MENA LGBTQ students in secondary schools in the U.S. by examining: (1) MENA students' feelings of safety at school based on personal characteristics, hearing biased remarks from other students, experiences with victimization based on personal characteristics, and experiences with school discipline; (2) changes in hearing biased remarks and experiences with victimization over time for MENA students; (3) the impact of experiences with victimization based on personal characteristics on MENA students' school engagement, educational outcomes, and psychological well-being; (4) MENA students' access to school supports; and (5) whether these supports provide benefits to MENA students. Further, this brief explores whether there are differences between MENA LGBTQ students and other LGBTQ students in hostile school climate experiences, school engagement, educational outcomes, psychological well-being, and access to resources at school.",

The study's goals are to determine whether colleges employ anti-plagiarism software, whether they ensure that their student-given assignments are free of copyright infringement, whether tutors teach about academic misconduct, and what people seem to think of anti-plagiarism software. We surveyed for this study and distributed the questionnaires among college administrators, principals, and librarians. The study respondents are 15.9 per cent principals, 64.2 per cent library professionals, and 19.9 per cent college administrators. The survey study report shows that 70.9 per cent of the majority of the colleges did not subscribe. 41.7 per cent gave the reason it is too expensive, and 30.5 per cent of respondents thought that for their college, it is unnecessary to subscribe. However, nobody has confirmed whether or not all colleges possess access to plagiarism detection software. Thus, according to this investigation, further Indian states must be involved in this research to understand the specific context fully. This report advises the UGC to enforce the requirement that colleges have plagiarism detection software; they either provide colleges additional money to subscribe to such software, or the university must grant free access to the affiliated colleges.",

        "description":"Background: A key aspect of STEM learning is the use of visual representations for problem solving. To successfully use visuals, students need to make sense of how they show concepts and to fluently perceive domain-relevant information in them. Adding support for sense making and perceptual fluency to problem-solving activities enhances students' learning of content knowledge. However, students need different types of representational-competency supports, depending on their prior knowledge. This suggests that adaptively assigning students to sense-making and perceptual-fluency support might be more effective than assigning all students to the same sequence of these supports. Method: We tested this hypothesis in an experiment with 44 undergraduate students in a chemistry course. Students were randomly assigned to a ten-week sequence of problem-solving activities that either provided a fixed sequence of sense-making support and perceptual-fluency support or adaptively assigned these supports based on students' problem-solving interactions. Findings: Results show that adaptive representational-competency supports reduced students' confusion and mistakes during problem solving while increasing their learning of content knowledge. Contribution: Our study is the first to show that adaptive support for representational competencies can significantly enhance learning of content knowledge. Given the pervasiveness of visuals, our results may inform general STEM instruction. [This paper was published in the &quot;Journal of the Learning Sciences&quot; v30 n2 2021 (EJ1298823).]",

        "author":["Rau, Martina A.",
          "Herder, Tiffany"],
        "description":"Abundant prior research has compared effects of physical and virtual manipulatives on students' conceptual learning. However, most prior research has been based on conceptual salience theory; that is, it has explained mode effects by the manipulative's capability to draw students' attention to conceptually relevant (visual or haptic) features. Yet, research based on embodied schema theory suggests that other mechanisms, which do not rely on students' explicit attention to specific features, also affect students' learning from manipulatives. This paper presents a study that contrasts predictions by different theoretical perspectives by comparing multiple versions of physical and virtual manipulatives. Specifically, we conducted a lab experiment with 119 undergraduate students who learned about three concepts related to atomic structure using one of four versions of energy diagram manipulatives. The four versions varied the representation mode (i.e., physical vs. virtual) and the actions students used to manipulate the representation (i.e., via actions that draw attention or activate embodied schemas). We assessed students' learning via reproduction and transfer posttests and interviews that measured the quality of students' explanation and the gestures they used while explaining the concepts. Our results suggest that embodied schema theory accounts for effects on the reproduction posttest, whereas conceptual salience theories account for effects on the transfer posttest. Further, when physical manipulatives offered relevant haptic cues, we found an advantage of physical manipulatives on transfer. We interpret these results based on the complexity of embodied schema and conceptual salience learning mechanisms and the complexity of the assessment tasks.

It is a manifestation of quality education offered by that Higher Education Institution (HEI), specifically a Teacher Education Institution (TEI). As a result, the goal of this study is to show a descriptive report of the results of the 2019 Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET) of a certain public Higher Education Institution (HEI) in the Philippines. Results show that the LET performance is generally passing but still quite low (Mean=79.542, SD=5.566). The Math and English majors exhibit high performance in the General and Professional Education subjects compared to the other programs, and the Math majors attained the highest performance in the Major subject among the other programs.",

The purpose of this study was to explore 4th and 5th grade students' progress towards meeting expectations in writing, using a curriculum- based measurement metric. Typed writing samples in narrative, persuasive, and passaged- based informational genres were collected in a one-year longitudinal design with four time points. Multilevel change models revealed evidence of quadratic change across the school year with significant change in the narrative genre but no statistically significant change in the other genres. Type of change (fan-spread growth or mastery learning) and growth based on initial transcription, spelling, and reading abilities were also explored.

The analyses were done quantitatively using t-tests, one-way ANOVA, correlation and linear regression. The findings revealed that gender differences and Turkish students' mathematics performance are statistically significant but practically not significant. Parents' education level had an impact on Turkish students' mathematics achievements. The index of Economic, Social and Cultural Status (ESCS) had a positive effect on mathematics achievements and ESCS was a significant predictor of Turkish students' mathematics performance. The findings seem to suggest that at the school level, the school environment is expected to build students' motivation in learning, and the teachers in the classroom setting are expected to provide extra hours and learning consultation services for students who need it. At the student level, students were expected to have high motivation in learning and are suggested to not rely on learning facilities provided by their parents. However, further research is required prior to making any recommendations on school policy, teaching, and learning practice in the classroom setting.",

        "description":"Many students attend a pre-kindergarten (pre-K) program outside of their neighborhood school, but there is no evidence that making this choice is associated with subsequent student readiness for kindergarten. In the Houston Independent School District (HISD), pre-K is not zoned, which means families can request to enroll their children on any campus with a pre-K program or Early Childhood Center (ECC) that has space available. As a result, many families may opt for programs that are outside of their neighborhoods, and it has been unclear whether students attending non-neighborhood campuses are more likely to be ready for kindergarten at the end of pre-K. School choice in pre-K was not associated with school readiness unless students attended a higher-performing pre-K program. Findings from this study suggest that children who exercised school choice and attended a higher-performing pre-K program were more likely to be kindergarten-ready than those who exercised school choice and attended a lower-performing pre-K program. This brief serves as the fourth, and final, study in a series examining pre-K access for students in HISD.

ELs are a diverse population of students with varying levels of English proficiency. Many students who begin school as an EL reclassify as English proficient in a timely manner and go on to achieve academic success. Students who remain EL after five years in school are considered &quot;long-term English learners&quot; (LTELs) and are at risk for negative academic outcomes, such as lower test scores, higher risk of drop out, and lower on-time high school graduation rates. The purpose of this brief is to examine student-, campus-, and neighborhood characteristics that can be considered risk or protective factors for the likelihood of an EL becoming LTEL, with the goal of helping school districts identify which students may be at-risk of becoming LTEL. This brief is part of a larger research project examining characteristics of LTELs, patterns of reclassification, predictors of LTEL status, and outcomes of LTELs within the state of Texas, with particular attention to 10 Houston-area public school districts.

Over two afternoons, the summit elevated key issues of environment, health, and education justice that have come into sharper focus during the COVID and climate crises. Nearly three hundred people joined the summit. This growing base of informed advocates from forty-five states included seventy-three representatives of local schools, seventy-five representatives of public agencies, and eighty-seven representatives of NGOs as well as attendees from several countries in the EU, plus India and Nigeria. The stellar line-up of keynoters, moderators, and panelists included the vice presidents of the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, the co-chair of ASHRAE's climate task force (the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers is the international standard-setting body on indoor air), and the Academy of Pediatrics' designee Lisa Patel, MD, discussing climate impacts on children. The national panel of environmental justice activists included several from the Navajo Nation. In all, a diverse array of thirty speakers participated in the summit, more than half of whom were people of color. [Additional sponsors of the summit include: Children's Environmental Health Network, Sierra Club, and New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). Summit Contributors included ASHRAE and the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals.]",

        "description":"Community colleges report general opening spring term enrollment figures to the Illinois Community College Board using a brief web-based survey. These figures reflect student enrollments as of the end of registration for the Spring 2022 semester--usually the 10th day of the term. Community colleges in Illinois serve a racially and ethnically diverse student population ranging in age and from varying economic conditions. Safe, innovative, and flexible course offerings and formats to meet student needs in the variety of programs offered at community colleges continued in the Spring 2022 term. Still, with community colleges serving a substantial number of at-risk students, the pandemic has heightened issues for that population ranging from fiscal to technological to emotional, and impacted enrollment statewide. Overall, compared to the same term one year ago, statewide Spring 2022 headcount enrollments and full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollments continue to be affected by COVID-19. Table 1 contains comparative statewide spring tenth-day enrollments for the last five years. Table 2 provides a comparison of fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2022 spring headcount enrollments for each community college. Table 3 contains a comparison of full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollments for the same five-year period. Table 4 provides fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2022 spring opening course enrollments (duplicated) in internet-based courses at each community college. Table 5 provides fiscal year 2022 spring opening enrollments by instructional program area. Table 6 provides opening headcount enrollments of dual credit students in Spring 2022.

What role do states play in supporting strategic use of salaries? This report examines the state teacher compensation policies that influence districts' potential strategic use of teacher pay. It analyzes three types of state policies that aim to attain three purposes: (1) Differentiated pay: To attract teachers to traditionally hard-to-staff subjects or schools; (2) Performance pay: To reward high-performing teachers; and (3) Pay for prior work: To compensate teacher candidates for prior experience relevant to teaching. With the influx of federal Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds, some states have designed new or expanded already existing initiatives aimed to attract or retain teachers to hard-to-staff positions. The analysis in this report includes these state strategies, while acknowledging that they might only remain in place temporarily while ESSER funds remain available.

        "description":"There are many continuous quantitative dimensions in the physical world. Philosophical, psychological and neural work has focused mostly on space and number. However, there are other important continuous dimensions (e.g., time, mass). Moreover, space can be broken down into more specific dimensions (e.g., length, area, density) and number can be conceptualized discretely or continuously (i.e., natural versus real numbers). Variation on these quantitative dimensions is typically correlated, e.g., larger objects often weigh more than smaller ones. Number is a distinctive continuous dimension, because the natural numbers (i.e., positive integers) are used to quantify collections of discrete objects. This aspect of number is emphasized by teaching of the count word sequence and arithmetic during the early school years. We review research on spatial and numerical estimation, and argue that a generalized magnitude system is the starting point for development in both domains. Development occurs along several lines: (1) changes in capacity, durability and precision, (2) differentiation of the generalized magnitude system into separable dimensions, (3) formation of a discrete number system, i.e., the positive integers, (4) mapping the positive integers onto the continuous number line, and (5) acquiring abstract knowledge of the relations between pairs of systems. We discuss implications of this approach for teaching various topics in mathematics, including scaling, measurement, proportional reasoning, and fractions.

Multilevel analyses examined the impact of SNUDLE for all students and important student subgroups. Overall, students who received the SNUDLE intervention had similar motivation and academic achievement in science to their peers who did not receive the SNUDLE intervention. However, relative to students with disabilities in the comparison group, students with disabilities who used SNUDLE scored significantly higher on motivation in science and science academic achievement, with effect sizes (ES) ranging from 0.82 to 1.01. Furthermore, SNUDLE appeared to have a small but statistically significant positive impact on science academic performance among students whose home language is other than English or Spanish with an ES of 0.35. Fidelity of implementation analysis shows sufficient teacher training but fidelity of teacher and student usage of SNUDLE needs to be improved. The qualitative analysis of teacher interviews suggests that teachers perceived benefits of SNUDLE in support language acquisition and science writing skills. Both quantitative and qualitative findings suggest that SNUDLE holds promise for improving academic performance in science and confidence and motivation among some of the most vulnerable student populations.",

Since it is still relatively uncommon for teachers to conduct action research studies in their own teaching, we aim at familiarizing our English Language Teaching (ELT) teacher trainees with the major characteristics and procedures of action research by also giving them opportunities to conduct their first collaborative action research studies. The present study discusses ELT trainees' first implementations of collaborative action research studies in the teacher training programme. Four collaborative action research cases conducted by ELT teacher trainees focusing on their own solutions and conclusions to their unique problems related to classroom silence, motivation, and vocabulary learning are discussed.

In addition to providing a definite and flexible method for teaching beginners to read, effort has been made to include only material that may justly be called classic and that have held up under repeated school use. Care has also been taken to present a variety of appeal through the heroic, the imaginative, the humorous, the ethical and the realistic. Special attention has been given to the biographies of authors in the desire to make them interesting as well as instructive. Lists of books for home reading are included in the Third, Fourth and Fifth Readers, not only for the direction of the child and the guidance of the teacher, but also to obtain the cooperation of parents in fixing in habit the taste for good literature created by the text books themselves. The notes appended for study have been prepared, not only to explain the text, but to further the child's interest in the author and the selection. At the end of each book will be found suggestions to teachers.",

The situations include child life and the heroic aspects of mature life, fairies and fairyland, and the outer world, particularly animal life. Then, each situation is considerably extended, not only that interest may be conserved but also that it may be cumulative. This textbook offers an interwoven unity of nearly a dozen inclusive groups of interrelated lessons, exercises, drills, and games. Among these groups are the fairy group, the Indian group, the fable group, the valentine group, and the circus group. These groups or situations call for much physical activity, pantomime, and dramatization. They provide for story-telling of great variety; for instruction and practice in punctuation, capitalization, and other points of form; for habit-creating drills in good English; for correct-usage games; for simple letter writing; for novel exercises in book making; and for the improvement by the pupils themselves of their oral and written composition.",

        "description":"TICAS, in partnership with MDRC and LEO, has worked for more than a year and a half with a community of seven evidence-based college completion programs. These programs, which span the country geographically, all employ a similar model that uses counselors, coaches, or case managers to connect students with a range of support -- personal, financial, and academic -- to help them complete college. All have also undergone rigorous evaluations that have shown statistically significant impacts on college persistence, completion, and student earnings after graduation. We met with them in February and again in May to discuss their experience over the last two years and to learn how they have adapted to keep as many students on track to graduate as possible. This paper summarizes those lessons learned and offers some insights for the field on innovative approaches to recruiting and retaining students during a time of enormous pressure and upheaval.

        "description":"Despite the availability of income-driven repayment (IDR) plans--and significant improvements to program design and generosity over time--too many federal student loan borrowers?continue to struggle with repayment. Many struggling borrowers never enroll in an IDR plan; even for some who do,?income-based monthly payments can?still be too high. Borrowers also struggle to navigate the bureaucratic hurdles of enrolling in and staying enrolled in?IDR plans. For IDR?to better?protect borrowers from unaffordable payments, keep borrowers out of default, and provide a reliable light at the end of the tunnel, policymakers must make significant reforms to IDR design and implementation. These forward-looking design changes must be made alongside ongoing efforts to address historic shortcomings of the IDR system. &quot;How Reforming Income-Driven Repayment Can Reduce the Burden of Student Debt&quot; focuses on two key design changes that will help reduce the burden of debt for millions of borrowers: (1) increasing the amount of a borrower's income that is &quot;protected&quot; from the IDR payment formula and (2) shortening the maximum repayment period.

This text offers a &quot;general&quot; course intended for those who continue studies in the senior high school as well as for those who do not continue.

Since this is a first course in secondary school mathematics, it presupposes knowledge of the fundamental operations with whole numbers, with common fractions, and with decimals. As soon as proficiency in these operations has been attained, the pupil is prepared to take up the study of this course. The following aims have been set up in the selection and organization of material: (1) The material used must fill a real need in the life of the pupil. It must be useful to him in his present school studies as well as in preparing him to perform activities in later life. It must have social value; (2) The material must be adapted to the abilities of pupils of the early adolescent period and he within their experience; (3) It is not sufficient to teach mathematics merely as a body of principles. There ought also to result training in mathematical methods of thought, effective habits of study as applied to mathematical situations, a conviction of the universal applicability of powers of concentration, and insight into the method of sound generalization in any field; (4) Quantitative relations are to be studied in three ways: geometrically, as in length, area, and graphs; algebraically, as in formulas, equations, and functions; and arithmetically, as in tables and evaluation. An abundance of work in arithmetic has been provided. The arithmetic aims to secure proficiency in the fundamental manipulative processes needed in the course of ordinary life and in the acquisition of further mathematical knowledge. Arithmetic is reviewed mainly through applications found within the domain of child life, through wide experiences in many situations. Thus, the arithmetic has changed from the formal drill process used in the lower grades, to a process of assimilation through application. The method of approach is inductive.

By actual measurement formulas are developed for finding the areas of triangles, quadrilaterals, and the circle. In these formulas quadratic terms and polynomials make their appearance and some of the fundamental operations with integral numbers are taught. Then follows a study of the common solids which leads to algebraic terms and polynomials of the third degree. Algebra in the first half of this course is a tool subject. Algebraic notation is used because it is helpful and because it simplifies discussions of geometry. In the second half of Book Two emphasis is transferred from geometry to algebra. Positive and negative numbers are introduced. Geometry is now used to illustrate and to make concrete the meaning of abstract algebraic concepts and operations. Opportunities for arithmetical computation and for problem solving are offered everywhere to help the pupil attain a high degree of accuracy in arithmetical work. [For Book One (1924), see ED623271.

In the lessons in grammar as much use as possible of the text of the book is suggested as a practical means of showing this relation. In the treatment of written composition, the effort has been made to show' that it is possible to bring about a good degree of interest and efficiency without reliance upon &quot;models'' drawn from literature.

The researcher-made test which underwent series of validation was given before and after the intervention period to determine the level of English proficiency and level of effectiveness of the games. Statistical treatment was done employing frequency count, T-test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The findings revealed that there was significant difference between the pretest and posttest of the respondents using gamification. Thus, it can be inferred that the games helped in improving the level of English proficiency of the Grade 8 students. The statistical test results disclosed further that the effectiveness of the three games introduced to the students were significantly high. With these findings, it was recommended that language teachers should use gamification as supplementary instructional material in improving the English proficiency of the students.",

        "description":"Self-regulation has been established as a key mechanism associated with a variety of outcomes, including school readiness (Blair &amp; Razza, 2007; McClelland, Cameron, Connor, et al., 2007; Morrison, Ponitz, &amp; McClelland, 2010), academic achievement (Cameron Ponitz, McClelland, Matthews, &amp; Morrison, 2009; Duckworth, Tsukayama, &amp; May, 2010; Li-Grining, Votruba-Drzal, Maldonado-Carren~o, &amp; Haas, 2010; McClelland, Acock, &amp; Morrison, 2006), and long-term health and educational outcomes (McClelland, Acock, Piccinin, Rhea, &amp; Stallings, 2013; Moffitt et al., 2011). Researchers have described self-regulation from a diverse set of perspectives and experts agree that self-regulation has important implications for individual health and well-being starting early in life (Geldhof, Little, &amp; Colombo, 2010; McClelland, Cameron Ponitz, Messersmith, &amp; Tominey, 2010). In this chapter, we describe the development of self-regulation in young children. We begin by defining self-regulation and related constructs, and then discuss how self-regulation develops over time and how socio-demographic risk plays a role in this development. We then focus on the importance of self-regulation for school success and as a protective factor. Although we highlight children living in a North American context, we also connect findings and research to children in other countries. We discuss how to best measure these skills in young children and advances in interventions to promote self-regulation. Finally, we discuss implications for research and practice.

Whitebread, et al., SAGE Publications, Limited, 2019, pp. 471-486.]",

        "description":"Policymakers in Texas want to understand the funding levels necessary for community colleges to meet their promise of providing an affordable and accessible pathway to a postsecondary certificate or degree. Regional Educational Laboratory Southwest conducted this study to help leaders at the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board better understand the extent to which Texas community colleges have adequate funding for reaching the desired levels of student success, as measured by success points milestones used in the state's performance-based funding system. The study involved three types of analyses: a needs analysis, an equity analysis, and a cost function analysis. The needs analysis found that community colleges with higher percentages of first-generation college students, students who are economically disadvantaged, students who are academically disadvantaged, students older than 24 years, and English learner students earn fewer success points milestones per full-time equivalent student. The equity analysis found that community colleges with higher percentages of students who are academically disadvantaged spent less per full-time equivalent student, suggesting that there may be resource inequities for these students. The cost function analysis found that spending was not high enough to cover the cost of providing an equal opportunity for first-generation college students, students who are economically disadvantaged, students older than 24 years, and English learner students to achieve the same level of outcomes as students without these needs. The findings from this study can inform Texas policymakers' efforts to distribute funding for community colleges to support equitable opportunities for all students to succeed in college.

Starting with this knowledge, which is usually given in all Kindergartens, the work in this grade advances logically, as the mind of the child expands. One or more lessons are given to the developing of a new topic; then the following lessons are so arranged as to give the pupils practice in applying the new topic in connection with all the other topics previously learned. This constant review will be found very beneficial.",

To quicken the thought power they have found it useful frequently to give only statements of certain problems, leaving the pupils to determine first, what can be found, and then how to find it.",

The work in measurements, believed to be a valuable feature of the previous grades, is here extended to area of circles, cylinders, and cones.

The form lessons, which have been an important part of the previous books, are here continued, and their scope broadened to include the simple principles of concrete geometry, the mastery of which renders the transition to theoretical geometry devoid of the usual difficulties. The first principles of Algebra are also introduced. There are, throughout the arithmetical portion of the book, many examples that should be solved by letting x stand for the unknown term. Wherever this method of solution is the simpler, teachers should encourage children to make use of it. Putting into algebraic language the conditions of an arithmetical problem forms an easy transition from the concrete language of arithmetic to the abstract and general language of algebra.",

There are fewer quantitative conceptions, many mathematical problems have been eliminated, and, where it has been possible without sacrificing clearness, much detail has been omitted. It discusses, in terms that the youthful mind can understand, phenomena of science constantly met in the home, the school, and the community. Each topic is pursued far enough to avoid superficiality and to give continuity to the course. The course is progressive; the earlier chapters are relatively easy; as the ability of the pupil grows, the course becomes correspondingly difficult. Numerous cross references are given to stimulate frequent reviews. Topics not essentially important in the environment of any class, or in the environment of the community, may easily be omitted without seriously breaking the continuity of the course.",

The student will not look upon civil government as an indistinct and lifeless structure, because the student is being led to see the true relation which exists between history and civics. The student is led to see that government is the enactment of the experience of society into law, and that history is the record of that experience. The student will see that all the more important parts of governmental machinery, such as the division of government into the three departments and the division of the legislative department into two houses, are merely the crystallization of ideas which society has gradually developed. The treatment in this volume makes government so completely an integral part of the history of the nation that the pupil will readily see and understand this vital relationship. This will give the student a much better and more valuable knowledge of government and of the relation to the same than the student would receive from a separate study of this subject.",

This work presents at first the idea of numbers connected with visual representations of objects; afterward, when the pupils become familiar with the objects, concrete examples are given without illustration, and these are immediately followed by exercises upon abstract numbers, so that the pupil may become familiar with the various combinations that may be formed. The first lessons are devoted to instruction in counting, reading, and writing numbers up to twenty. Immediately following these, are lessons upon Addition, in which abundant practice is given in combining numbers. The fundamental processes of Subtraction, Multiplication and Division, are treated upon a plan similar to that exemplified in Addition, including besides, numerous examples combining two or more of the previous processes. The lessons on Fractions are so simple and yet so thorough, that the pupil is enabled to read, write, add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions when the processes are not very complex. The work on Written Arithmetic, which follows, is believed to be simple, thorough, and practical; and the brief and practical treatment of the various classes of denominate numbers in common use, makes the work quite comprehensive within its scope.",

We draw on a national sample of students and their teachers in Belize to examine relations between mathematics anxiety and achievement. The data replicated the negative relationships between students' math anxiety and achievement observed in many higher achieving, higher resourced regions, and importantly also revealed that teachers' mathematics anxiety predicted their students' mathematics attitudes and sometimes achievement. The effects were small overall so the robustness of this relationship is not clear, but they provide novel data toward building a comprehensive theory of mathematics anxiety's relationship to achievement across cultural, gender and age contexts, and offer insight into how addressing mathematics anxiety might improve mathematics teaching and achievement in low resourced countries.

        "description":"Risk behaviors like substance use and binge eating are often used to cope with negative emotions. Engagement in these behaviors has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Past research suggests that complex emotion conceptualizations captured as emotion differentiation (ability to discriminate between emotional states) and polarity (ability to integrate positive and negative features of emotional experience) may be protective. We examined associations of mean affect intensity, emotion differentiation, and emotion polarity with frequency of daily substance use and binge eating across 10 days in a demographically diverse sample of U.S. adults (N = 353) recruited between March 24 and April 9, 2020, when stay-at-home orders were initiated. Owing to the nested data structure and excessive zero values, analyses were conducted using multilevel zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Consistent with past research, negative affect was positively associated with frequency of substance use and binge eating. Importantly, results indicated that negative emotion differentiation was protective, predicting greater likelihood of not using substances and binge eating at all across the sampling period. These effects remained even after controlling for mean affect intensity, emotion polarity, and positive emotion differentiation. Neither positive emotion differentiation nor emotion polarity were significantly associated with either behavior. Our results suggest that greater complexity in conceptualization of negative emotions facilitates some protection against risk behaviors such as substance use and binge eating, even during periods of high environmental stress. These findings have important implications for optimizing interventions to reduce engagement in risk behaviors.

Both parents and teachers reported that parents play several academic roles in online classes for elementary school children which include organizing, facilitating, monitoring children's attention in classes, motivating, nurturing, and supporting online learning. Those who do not prefer parental attendance indicated that traditionally, parents do not attend face-to-face classes and rules for online class attendance should be the same as face-to-face class attendance by parents. Children should be given the opportunity to adjust to online learning, face challenges, develop self-discipline, a sense of responsibility and autonomy. Both teachers and parents declared that parents should interfere if the child is having an internet connectivity, platform problem, difficulty submitting an assignment, is new to the platform or has a learning disability.

Results of surveys with a sample of instructors from Languages, Translation, Literature, Linguistics, Education and Computer Science Departments at a sample of universities in Saudi Arabia showed that most universities shifted to online (virtual) practicum such as online micro-teaching, online simulated teaching, remote hands-on teaching using the Saudi Ministry of Education's Platform &quot;Madrasati&quot; that is used for Grades k-12; reduced hours and days of face-to-face teaching practicum and training; a Teacher Mentoring Program for EFL majors and a Cooperative Training Program for linguistics and translation students. Translation students also had the option to translate 14,000 words remotely (at home), discuss and receive feedback online instead of field training in translation. In computer science, the students could complete their face-to-face practicum in small groups during the summer to maintain social distancing or attend 135 hours of online training courses in a variety of computer fields. Recommendations for further emergency practicum solutions are given such as student-created videos and podcasts, delivering lessons via a variety of live-streaming software such as Elluminate, Periscope and Facebook Watch Party, joining professional teachers and translators' forums and pages on social media, developing Apps, robots, and conducting some learning analytics of students' data in distance learning contexts in Saudi Arabian schools and universities; offering courses that prepare students for remote (online) jobs during the Pandemic and beyond.",

However, despite the importance of writing, English Learner students continue to perform at or below basic levels which warrants additional efforts to identify specific areas of weakness that impact writing quality. To that end, this study aims to describe the effect of verb accuracy on writing quality ratings of 5th-grade written expository samples. This study examines the responses of 243 students in the 5th grade who differed in English proficiency. The sample included 112 English Learners and 131 English-proficient students. Verb error patterns in written samples by English Learner students are described and compared to the patterns of their monolingual English-proficient peers. Group differences were examined in verb accuracy, types of verb errors, and overall grammaticality. A regression analysis was used to examine verb accuracy as a predictor of writing quality. Findings showed that English Learner students demonstrated more verb errors than their English-speaking peers and the total number of verb errors was a significant predictor of writing quality ratings.",

        "description":"The quantity and quality of talented individuals in STEM (science/S, technology/T, engineering/E and mathematics/M) fields contribute to a nation's overall competitiveness. Taiwan and many countries around the world are vigorously promoting the training of STEM professionals and the enhancement of STEM literacy for all as one of the key education objectives. Aiming to achieve the following two goals, this book is compiled and published: (1) to strengthen mutual understanding and connections between Taiwan and other highly competitive countries in the area of STEM education; and (2) to give highly competitive countries the opportunity to share their experiences in STEM education. Two editors-in-chief formulated manuscript guidelines including cross-country comparison components. Then, they invited STEM educators from 10 countries in the top 15 countries/economies in the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) World Competitiveness Ranking 2021 to follow the guidelines to write up country-specific chapters. After that, they conducted a peer review of all manuscripts and requested authors to make necessary revisions, and made a cross-country comparison which was presented as the 11th chapter. In addition to the 11th chapter, this book compiles country-specific articles about the STEM education background, the status of STEM education, and trends and issues in STEM education from 10 countries, namely Canada, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Ireland, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States of America. Twenty authors of the 11 chapters are listed in this book.

The revised edition of &quot;McGuffey's High School Reader&quot; has been prepared with special reference to the formation of a healthy and discriminating literary taste. The plan of the revision has been to present, in chronological succession, specimens of the best literary style of the several generations of British and American authors between Shakespeare's time and the present, thus affording an outline of the development of Modern English Literature.

Aim: To assess the logistical aspects, merit and demerits of different online teaching-learning methods among phase-1 medical student in a tertiary care teaching hospital during COVID-19 lockdown Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2020 to September 2020, among phase-1 MBBS students of Government Medical College, Thrissur, Kerala, India. Data was collected from 161 students through a questionnaire consisting of two parts. The first part dealt with logistical aspects, like net connectivity, gadget, expenditure, financial burden, residence and eye strain with online teaching learning methods. The second part dealt with the merits and demerits of each type of teaching learning methods, according to the students. All statistical data was analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 16. Qualitative data was expressed as a percentage. Results: A total of 97.5% population of students was able to frequently access the online classes. Online learning strained the eyes of 47.8% of students.

In a large-scale experiment we test an early commitment of free tuition at a flagship university. The intervention did not increase aid: rather, students were guaranteed before application the same grant aid that they would qualify for in expectation if admitted. The offer substantially increased application (68 percent versus 26 percent) and enrollment rates (27 percent versus 12 percent).

        "description":"Background: To advance early identification efforts, we must detect and characterize neurodevelopmental sequelae of risk among population-based samples early in development. However, variability across the typical-to-atypical continuum and heterogeneity within and across early emerging psychiatric/neurodevelopmental disorders represent fundamental challenges to overcome. Identifying multidimensionally determined profiles of risk, agnostic to DSM categories, via data-driven computational approaches represents an avenue to improve early identification of risk. Methods: Factor mixture modeling (FMM) was used to identify subgroups and characterize phenotypic risk profiles, derived from multiple parent-report measures of typical and atypical behaviors common to autism spectrum disorder, in a community-based sample of 17- to 25-month-old toddlers (n = 1,570). To examine the utility of risk profile classification, a subsample of toddlers (n = 107) was assessed on a distal, independent outcome examining internalizing, externalizing, and dysregulation at approximately 30 months. Results: FMM results identified five asymmetrically sized subgroups. The putative high- and moderate-risk groups comprised 6% of the sample. Followup analyses corroborated the utility of the risk profile classification; the high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups were differentially stratified (i.e., HR &gt; moderate-risk &gt; LR) on outcome measures and comparison of high- and low-risk groups revealed large effect sizes for internalizing (d = 0.83), externalizing (d = 1.39), and dysregulation (d = 1.19). Conclusions: This data-driven approach yielded five subgroups of toddlers, the utility of which was corroborated by later outcomes. Data-driven approaches, leveraging multiple developmentally appropriate dimensional RDoC constructs, hold promise for future efforts aimed toward early identification of at-risk-phenotypes for a variety of early emerging neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Dynamic borrowing via Bayesian hierarchical models is a special case of a general framework of historical borrowing where the degree of borrowing depends on the heterogeneity among historical data and current data. A joint prior distribution over the historical and current data sets is specified with the degree of heterogeneity across the data sets controlled by the variance of the joint distribution. We apply Bayesian dynamic borrowing to both single-level and multilevel models and compare this approach to other historical borrowing methods such as complete pooling, Bayesian synthesis, and power priors. Two case studies using data from the Program for International Student Assessment reveal the utility of Bayesian dynamic borrowing in terms of predictive accuracy. This is followed by two simulation studies that reveal the utility of Bayesian dynamic borrowing over simple pooling and power priors in cases where the historical data is heterogeneous compared to the current data based on bias, mean squared error, and predictive accuracy. In cases of homogeneous historical data, Bayesian dynamic borrowing performs similarly to data pooling, Bayesian synthesis, and power priors. In contrast, for heterogeneous historical data, Bayesian dynamic borrowing performed at least as well, if not better, than other methods of borrowing with respect to mean squared error, percent bias, and leave-one-out cross-validation.

Using accelerometry, we measured whether people spontaneously use their artificial limbs (prostheses) to gesture, and whether this behavior relates to everyday prosthesis use and perceived embodiment. Perhaps surprisingly, one- and two-handed participants did not differ in the number of gestures they produced in gesture-facilitating tasks. However, they did differ in their gesture profile. One-handers performed-more, and bigger, gesture movements with their intact hand relative to their prosthesis. Importantly, one-handers who gestured more similarly to their two-handed counterparts also used their prosthesis more in everyday life. Although collectively one-handers only marginally agreed that their prosthesis feels like a body part, one-handers who reported they embody their prosthesis also showed greater prosthesis use for communication and daily function. Our findings provide the first empirical link between everyday prosthesis use habits and perceived embodiment and a novel means for implicitly indexing embodiment.",

Here, we consider one of the properties that may make gesture a powerful teaching tool: its temporal alignment with spoken language. Previous work shows that the simultaneity of speech and gesture matters when children receive instruction from a teacher (Congdon et al., 2017). In Study 1, we ask whether simultaneity also matters when children themselves are the ones who produce speech and gesture strategies. Third-graders (N = 75) were taught to produce one strategy in speech and one strategy in gesture for correctly solving mathematical equivalence problems; they were told to produce these strategies either simultaneously (S + G) or sequentially (S[right arrow]G; G[right arrow]S) during a training session. Learning was assessed immediately after training, at a 24-h follow-up, and at a 4-week follow-up. Children showed evidence of learning and retention across all three conditions. Study 2 was conducted to explore whether it was the special relationship between speech and gesture that helped children learn. Third-graders (N = 87) were taught an action strategy instead of a gesture strategy; all other aspects of the design were the same. Children again learned across all three conditions. But only children who produced &quot;simultaneous&quot; speech and action retained what they had learned at the follow-up sessions. Results have implications for why gesture is beneficial to learners and, taken in relation to previous literature, reveal differences in the mechanisms by which doing versus seeing gesture facilitates learning.",

Costs vary widely across fields, ranging from electrical engineering (90% higher than English) to math (25% lower). This pattern is largely explained by differences in class size and faculty pay. Some STEM fields experienced steep declines in expenditures over the past 17 years, while others saw increases. Changes in class size and teaching loads alongside a shift toward contingent faculty explain these trends. Finally, the association between online instruction and instructional costs is statistically indistinguishable from zero.",

        "description":"The Texas Education Agency launched the Grow Your Own (GYO) grant program in 2018 to encourage districts to develop or expand existing high-quality education and training courses for high school students and to support district-employed paraprofessionals (including instructional aides and long-term substitute teachers) to pursue certifications that would allow them to enter full-time teaching roles. This study aimed to help state education leaders in Texas understand the progress of districts in implementing the GYO program and the early outcomes of participants. This study analyzed data from 2015/16 through 2020/21 for districts that received GYO funding in the first two grant cycles and districts in the same geographic locales within the same regions that did not receive GYO funding (comparison districts). The study found that the majority of districts awarded a GYO grant were in rural areas and small towns. GYO districts were more likely to have a smaller enrollment and had a higher average percentage of Hispanic students than comparison districts. The findings suggest that the program appeared to meet the Texas Education Agency's goal of providing opportunities to students and paraprofessionals in rural and small school settings and students of color to participate in GYO activities. The study also found that the percentage of students completing education and training courses in GYO districts was low (about 10 percent) during the grant years, and the percentage was similar in comparison districts before and after the grant awards. A disproportionate share of students who completed education and training courses in GYO districts were female. Although it is too soon to tell whether the GYO program will, over time, increase the size and diversity of the state's teacher pool, leaders at the Texas Education Agency can use these early findings to both understand the progress of districts in achieving the GYO grant program aims and help identify aspects of the program that might need further investigation.

        "description":"This research explores how COVID has impacted technology internships, including student and employer participation, satisfaction, and challenges; changes in the structure of internships; and impact on student employment outcomes. The roots of this study emerged in summer of 2021, as the authors were completing a three-year study funded by the National Science Foundation to examine how community colleges can create effective technology internships as a bridge to employment for community college technology graduates. The COVID pandemic began in the United States just as the initial study was drawing to a close, and the effect of COVID on internships was just starting to emerge. Recent national surveys have documented significant changes in student access to internships and changes in internship structure as a result of the pandemic. Questions remained regarding how the pandemic has altered technology students' access to internships, the structure of internships, and whether the benefits of internships for technology employment and for broadening participation in technology careers have been sustained during the pandemic. This study specifically addresses four broad research questions: (1) How has COVID affected student and employer internship plans and opportunities?; (2) What have been the challenges and opportunities in translating internships to a virtual environment?; (3) How did internships mediate graduates' transitions to employment during COVID?; and (4) How has COVID affected the potential for internships to broaden participation in technology careers?

        "description":"One frequently cited yet understudied channel through which funding levels impact college students is course availability--colleges are often forced to respond to budgetary pressure by reducing course offerings. We provide the first causal evidence on this mechanism at a community college, using administrative course registration data and a novel research design that exploits discontinuities in course admissions created by waitlists. Community colleges enroll about half of U.S. undergraduates and over half of minority students in public colleges. The impacts of course availability in this setting may be especially salient relative to four-year colleges due to open admissions policies, binding class size constraints, and a heavy reliance on state funding. Across a range of bandwidths, we find that students stuck on a waitlist and shut out of a course section were 22-28 percent more likely to take zero courses that term relative to a baseline of about 10 percent. Shutouts also increased transfer rates to nearby, but potentially less-desirable two-year colleges. These results offer some evidence that course availability can disrupt community college students' educational trajectories.",

        "description":"In the effort to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers were required to adapt their curricula, pedagogy, and relationships with their students to remote learning structures. In the traditional classroom context, teachers have a number of ways to check in on and connect with their students that do not translate to the virtual classroom. Using data gathered through an online qualitative survey of over 800 Chicago teachers in July 2020, this article will examine the ways that the shift to remote learning challenged teachers' relationships with their students during the spring of 2020. By utilizing social presence theory and considering the significance of emotional connection in teacher-student relationships, the study captures some of the relational challenges that teachers experienced during the initial months of remote instruction. The study identifies increased individualization, deeper holistic understandings of students, and a diversity of mechanisms of engagement as pedagogical techniques that allowed teachers to maintain and even improve their relationships with students.",

        "description":"Statement of the Problem and Purpose: Romantic relationships may be a source of behavioral and psychological strain, while the use of Instagram may also have positive and negative influences on university students' relationships. However, whether there is a relationship between university students' romantic relationship statuses and behaviors on Instagram remains an unanswered question. The current study explores whether there is a relationship between romantic relationship status and behaviors on Instagram among university students. Method: A descriptive and correlational research design was used in the study. The sample group consisted of 603 students enrolling in the BA programs of a state university in Turkey. A questionnaire was used to gather data on the numbers of posts, followers, followings, time spent on Instagram, and the active and passive behaviors exhibited. Kruskal-Wallis Test was preferred to see the possible relationship between the variables. Findings: The study concludes that romantic relationship status and Instagram usage are statistically significantly related. Within this scope, university students who do not have romantic relationships prefer showing less active behaviors. Implications for Research and Practice: It was recommended that university students should raise their awareness of the relationship between romantic relationship status and Instagram use and behaviors exhibited. Qualitative and experimental studies should be carried out to better understand the relationship between romantic relationships and behaviors exhibited on Instagram by university students.

        "description":"The training programs that polytechnic students undertake focus on practical and real-world application skills for their future careers. In the process, students need career counseling that strengthens their career decision-making. Web-based career counseling has a great deal of potential for increasing students' career decision-making capabilities in a significant way. This study's purpose is to investigate the efficacy of web-based career counseling in enhancing prospective polytechnic students' career decision-making. The research used an experimental research design. A simple randomization strategy was used to assign the 37 polytechnic students from a Nigerian polytechnic to either the web-based career counseling group (n=18) or to the control group (n=19). The data was gathered using a career decision-making scale. The duration of the web-based career counseling intervention was 6 weeks; each online session took place two times per week and a two-week follow-up was done after three months. The duration for each web-based career counseling session was 75 minutes. It was found that web-based career counseling intervention significantly enhances students' career decision-making, and as a result, career practitioners and counselors can benefit from similar research endeavor as they continue to support students in their career development journey.",

        "description":"Increasingly, companies are dropping four-year degree requirements in job postings, favoring skill-based requirements--such as communication and writing--instead. These types of nonacademic &quot;soft skills&quot; are viewed as essential for employment--employers consistently cite these abilities as among the most valuable in job applicants, yet also the most difficult to assess. In response to this growing emphasis on soft skills, postsecondary educators are looking for ways to teach the skills explicitly. The aim is to produce graduates with recognizable competency not only in academic and career-technical skills, but also in the soft skills needed to navigate a modern, diverse, and rapidly evolving work environment. This brief outlines practical considerations and recommendations for developing and implementing soft-skills programs, curricula, and instruction in a postsecondary setting. These qualitative lessons are culled from an in-depth examination of a soft-skills training and assessment program called the New World of Work (NWoW). NWoW was selected for this study in part because it combines three components theorized to strengthen soft skills: (1) A classroom curriculum with direct instruction in 10 soft skills; (2) A concurrent, work-based learning experience; and (3) An assessment and credential-granting component (digital badges). The NWoW curriculum was developed in 2012 and supported in its early operations by the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office and the Foundation for California Community colleges. It has been deployed at over 75 community colleges in California, as well as high schools, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies. From 2016 to 2022 the research team conducted four rounds of site visits, and spoke with 16 instructors across five community colleges pilot testing the program, 37 students in focus group settings, and 15 employers. Insights from these conversations and site visits inform this brief. [For the companion report &quot;Using Psychometric Analysis to Improve Soft-Skill Assessments,&quot; see ED624221.]",

        "description":"This brief contains findings from a recent study exploring direct support professionals (DSPs) providing support to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges of finding and keeping quality DSPs in a field that has experienced high turnover for decades. This problem is exacerbated by low starting wages, averaging only $11.56 an hour in 2019, and wage compression, where there is little difference in pay between new and more experienced staff. These have been major contributing factors to the workforce crisis, affecting both DSPs and frontline supervisors (FLSs). While the current average hourly raise per year among all hourly workers in the U.S. is between 3-5%, the Direct Support Workforce and COVID-19 National Report shows that it is nowhere near that for the direct support workforce. Wage and tenure data from three waves of the study reveals a significant gap between what DSPs and FLSs earned and what they would have earned if they saw a 4% increase in wages common in other industries. Providers of services for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities are constrained by low, non-negotiable reimbursement rates set by state Medicaid agencies. In many states, Medicaid rates have been stagnant or have decreased in the past decade. As a result, providers do not have enough funding to recruit new staff or raise wages to keep experienced staff. Both low starting wages and wage compression must be addressed for the DSP workforce crisis to be solved.",

State funding in particular constitutes a large share of revenue and is consequently critical for improving enrollment, completion, and labor market outcomes. However, states differ in how institutions are funded, and some approaches may be more effective than others. This report examines the ways in which 12 Midwestern states provide operating funding for public colleges and universities. An overview of possible tradeoffs and outcomes research on these approaches is provided to help policymakers craft more effective funding formulas. Although the level of state funding is important for improving student outcomes, a summary of research on funding models indicated that there is little research on policies other than performance-based funding. The research on performance funding shows generally no effects, modest positive effects, or modest negative effects on student outcomes.",

        "description":"Two years ago, Community College Research Center (CCRC) published a guide to help college leaders understand the costs involved in implementing guided pathways reforms. The guide was based on research at six community colleges, but only one of these was a smaller college. Small colleges lack economies of scale that can generate revenue to support investments in technology, staff training, and release time for staff to participate in reforms. And implementing guided pathways at small colleges means that many faculty and staff need to take on new roles to plan and manage the process. This report describes how small colleges can fund and sustain guided pathways reforms. It is based on activities at three small Ohio community colleges that have made large-scale changes in practice based on the guided pathways model over the past several years. These colleges--North Central State College, Washington State Community College, and Zane State College--have successfully implemented these reforms despite challenges, including declining enrollments, decreased tuition revenue, and a reliance on performance funding. All three colleges have made changes in practice that have enriched the experience in and out of the classroom for all students, not just targeted groups. College leaders credit these changes for improvements in rates of student progression and completion they have achieved. This report summarizes what changes in practice the colleges implemented at scale and how they are funding and sustaining these reforms. It is accompanied by case studies of each of the featured colleges, which provide more detail about their reforms, the effects of the reforms on student performance, and the strategies they used to fund their efforts: (1) North Central State College: Stabilizing Enrollment Through Strategic Realignment of Resources Struggling with declining enrollments after the Great Recession, North Central State implemented a series of major reforms with the aim of improving retention and completion on a substantial scale. These included embedding certificates in degree programs, redesigning advisor positions as success coaches who help entering students choose a program of study, creating new division liaison positions tasked with advising students in each of the college's three main academic areas, and recasting existing instructional design staff positions to focus on helping faculty teach online and evening classes (ED623434); (2) Washington State Community College: Improving Student Retention and Success Through Organizational Efficiencies and Alignment Since 2017, a new president and leadership team has engaged faculty and staff throughout Washington State in making substantial changes to organizational practice and culture with the goal of improving student recruitment, retention, learning, and success. These changes have been implemented in three phases: first, the college focused on strengthened advising and support for enrolled students; then it improved recruitment and onboarding of new students; in the current phase, the college is converting nearly all of its programs from 16-week terms to 8-week terms to allow students to focus on a smaller number of courses at a time and give students with work and family obligations more flexibility to adapt their schedules (ED623436); and (3) Zane State College: Weaving Projects and Budgets Together to Support Student Success Zane State has used grants and general operating funds for reassigning staff roles to implement a number of large-scale reforms without significant infusions of new money. The college has placed particular emphasis on helping students enter and stay on a program path by connecting them to success coaches from the start; redesigning the first-year experience course to promote student engagement; taking a holistic approach in the provision of academic, career, and financial advising to students; and removing structural barriers in program pathways (ED623438).

        "author":["Steinbach, Sonja"],
        "description":"This review examines research on math achievement in students who are blind or visually impaired (BVI), and seeks to show the opportunities that BVIs have access to in order to demonstrate their knowledge of mathematics as well as the unique challenges they face and the ways in which these barriers have (or have not) been addressed. Math achievement for students who are BVI often lags that of their peers (Bell &amp; Silverman, 2019; Cryer et al., 2013) though there is substantial evidence that vision is not required for the development of number sense or other math skills and concepts, and that students who are BVI can develop these skills using non-visual pathways (Amalric, 2018; Crollen &amp; Collignon, 2020; Ahlberg &amp; Csocsán (1999). However, few studies have explored math education for BVI students, and the limited research that exists on online math access for BVIs focuses on presentation modalities such as auditory methods, haptic feedback, and tactile input for the purpose of describing visual information (Scalise et al., 2018). Nevertheless, research indicates that given proper academic supports within the school setting (Giesen et al., 2012), and access to multi-representational materials (Scalise et al., 2018) that engage multiple senses (Crollen &amp; Collignon, 2020), many of the barriers that prevent BVIs' access to mathematical content can be greatly reduced. With an inclusive assessment showing growth over time (Rottmann et al., 2020), and when given opportunities to engage independently (Beal &amp; Rosenblum, 2018), BVIs can demonstrate their mathematical knowledge, perceive their own growth in mathematics, and gain some much-needed confidence in their ability to succeed in technical fields of education.",

        "description":"North Central State College provides a case study of how a small college can increase revenue by strategically realigning its existing staff resources for improving student retention and success, even in a period of stagnant enrollment. The college implemented a series of major reforms with the aim of improving student retention and completion on a substantial scale. The president and his leadership team recognized that to improve student outcomes without substantial new revenue, the college would have to better align its existing resources, especially its human resources, with a central focus on improving student retention and completion rates. The college expanded the roles of the success coaches, who help new students, and cross-trained them with staff in admissions, financial aid, and other front-end offices to better answer incoming students' questions. The college also redefined a student services position that had been vacated to add a success coach who works with dual enrollment students taking college courses in local high schools.

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of writing for learning and model-based learning activities on academic achievement in the &quot;Simple Electrical Circuits&quot; unit of the fourth-grade science course and the views of students and classroom teachers about these activities. In the quantitative part of the research, which has quantitative and qualitative designs, quasi-experimental design with a pretest-posttest control group and in the qualitative part, student and teacher opinion forms consisting of open-ended questions were used. Three experimental and one control group were selected among the fourth graders according to the simple random sampling method. The achievement test related to the &quot;Simple Electrical Circuits&quot; unit was applied to these groups as a pre-test, post-test and permanence test. In the study, writing for learning purposes in a randomly selected group, model-based learning in the other, and both writing for learning and model-based learning activities were carried out together in the third group. In the control group, the lessons were carried out according to the current method. ANOVA was used in the analysis of quantitative data, and content analysis was used in the analysis of qualitative data. Findings related to the post-test of the experimental groups and the control group showed a significant difference in favor of the experimental group students who performed the model-based learning activities. According to the permanence test, there was no statistically significant difference between the experimental groups and the control group, but the mean of the experimental groups was higher than the mean of the control group. According to the data obtained from the interviews with students and teachers, it can be stated that students and teachers exhibited a positive approach towards writing for learning and model-based learning activities. In addition, the experimental group students stated that they did the activities with fun, while the teachers stated that they believed in the benefits of the activities used, but it was difficult to implement them in the current system. Based on these results, new research can be carried out at the third-grade level, in different lessons or in different units of the same lesson.",

        "description":"Researchers agree that for children who attend early care and education programs, high-quality early learning experiences are critical for promoting academic, social-emotional, and executive function skills, particularly for children of color and children from families with low incomes. Rigorous research testing the effects of interventions to enhance classroom quality has found that providing professional development to teachers, including ongoing training and coaching, can improve classroom quality and teachers' instructional practices as well as children's outcomes. These benefits are particularly noticeable when professional development is focused on a specific curriculum or set of teacher practices. Yet, again, questions remain. When and for which children do quality enhancement efforts have the most impact? When and for which early care and education centers and teachers can quality enhancement efforts be implemented successfully? Answering these questions will help the early care and education field target investments in ways that are more likely to support classroom quality and help all children succeed. The &quot;Variations in Implementation of Quality Interventions (VIQI): Examining the Quality-Child Outcomes Relationship in Child Care and Early Education&quot; project aims to tackle these open questions and build substantial new evidence to inform policies and practices in Head Start and community-based child care centers. The VIQI project is a large-scale, rigorous study that examines the link between classroom quality and preschool children's developmental outcomes. It builds on and extends prior research--including the &quot;Child Care and Early Education Quality Features, Thresholds and Dosage and Child Outcomes (Q-DOT) project.&quot; This prior work suggests that when classroom quality is in the higher portion of the quality range, links between quality and children's outcomes are stronger than when classroom quality is in the lower portion of the quality range. This brief describes the VIQI project, its key research questions, and the conceptual framework underlying it.",

It is planned to meet the needs of young children who are &quot;looking about,&quot; touching, manipulating, experimenting, and asking questions. The stories are for the most part actual records of the experiences of real children. The material represents a wide range of interests, many of which are given further consideration in the later books of this series. In each case the aspect of the experience which is most vital and significant at this stage of the child's development is emphasized. The child's learning, as should always be the case, is the result of &quot;thinking through&quot; a problem with the guidance of a teacher. For the most part the experiences recorded in these stories can be duplicated in any school and special care has been taken to keep the text within the reading ability of first-grade children.",

This first-of-its-kind study takes advantage of federal educational data--including a large, and largely untapped, dataset on nondegree credentials and work experience programs--to find out what it looks like to complete the education required for cosmetology licensing. Key findings include: (1) State-mandated cosmetology school is expensive and time-consuming; (2) Cosmetology programs do a poor job of graduating students on time--or even at all; and (3) Cosmetology school rarely pays off in terms of earnings. We also find that state licensing requirements, and not health and safety, are likely the reason cosmetology school takes so long. These findings suggest the current system of state cosmetology licensing is a failed model of professional development that mainly transfers wealth from students and taxpayers to cosmetology schools.

One regulation that should be on the table is cosmetology licensing. This policy brief draws on a national study to explore the experiences of people pursuing cosmetology careers in Utah. Key findings include: (1) State-mandated cosmetology school is expensive and time-consuming; (2) Utah cosmetology programs do a poor job of graduating students on time--or even at all; (3) Cosmetology school rarely pays off in terms of earnings; and (4) Our data suggest Utah's licensing requirements are the reason cosmetology school takes so long. Together, these findings suggest cosmetology licensing fails aspiring beauty workers in the Beehive State; instead, licensing primarily serves to transfer wealth from students and taxpayers to cosmetology schools.

        "description":"This study examined levels of English proficiency before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among English learner students in grades 3-12 in Texas. In 2020-2021, nearly 750,000 students in grades 3-12--approximately one in five Texas students--were English learner students. In accordance with Texas state law and the Every Student Succeeds Act, English proficiency is measured annually using a statewide assessment, the Texas English Language Proficiency Assessment System (TELPAS), which assesses English learner students' listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills in English. This study focused on TELPAS scores among students who took the test in 2020-2021 and compared those scores with a matched cohort of similar students from 2018-2019. The study found that, despite missing data because of pandemic-related disruptions to testing, students who took the TELPAS were representative of the overall Texas English learner student population in the years prior to and during the pandemic. The study also found that rates of reclassification from an English learner student to an English proficient student declined between 2017-2018 and 2020-2021, and trends in the characteristics of reclassified students changed, with lower percentages of students in major urban areas, students eligible for the National School Lunch Program, students who spoke Spanish at home, and students who identified as Hispanic in 2020-2021 than in 2017-2018. On average, during the pandemic, English learner students in elementary grades earned meaningfully lower scores on the listening, speaking, and reading domains of the TELPAS than similar students earned before the pandemic, particularly in speaking. The findings for secondary grades were mixed; middle school students earned lower scores in listening, and high school students earned higher scores in speaking. Finally, the study did not find evidence that English learner student program models, such as dual-language immersion or content-based English as a second language, were meaningfully associated with English proficiency in 2020-2021. Leaders at the Texas Education Agency and Texas school districts could consider focusing recovery resources on elementary schools and to some degree on middle schools and identifying and supporting evidence-based strategies to cultivate proficiency. The Texas Education Agency may consider studying the effect of program models on language proficiency and the relationship between reclassification, shifting English proficiency levels, and changing reclassification standards.

Or, if this can not be done, pieces of muscle and of cartilage, joints and bones, a heart, the lungs, a liver, an eye, and other organs, can be obtained from the butcher, to serve the same purpose. The apparatus mentioned in illustration of the action of organs--the bellows, the syringe, and others that may occur to the teacher--should be shown. Models and plates are also valuable. A few clear ideas of the structure and functions of the body will be worth much more to the children than many details imperfectly understood. On the subject of stimulants and narcotics, the author has endeavored to make no statements which are not susceptible of positive proof, and to present only facts which children are capable of appreciating.

The method may be taught by the printed letters or by script, with the preference for the former. The design of the Manual is to guide the inexperienced teacher in her daily work. The simplest language has been chosen; such expressions as she would use in explaining to first grade pupils. Includes the explanatory manual; &quot;The Johnny Story,&quot; to be read aloud and associate the sounds of the letters with objects suggested in the story; Songs; and Suggestions for First Grades and for Higher Grades.",

In 2020-2021, nearly 750,000 students in grades 3-12--approximately one in five Texas students--were English learner students. In accordance with Texas state law and the Every Student Succeeds Act, English proficiency is measured annually using a statewide assessment, the Texas English Language Proficiency Assessment System (TELPAS), which assesses English learner students' listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills in English. This study focused on TELPAS scores among students who took the test in 2020-2021 and compared those scores with a matched cohort of similar students from 2018-2019.

Short summaries of the lessons are given at the end of the book, and the whole series is fully illustrated, in order to show everything that has a direct bearing on the matter before the class, and to enable children to recall the teaching and experiments of the object lessons themselves.

Method: The study used mixed-method to determine the considerations needed in developing an application for educational use particularly among laboratory/practical subjects like engine assembly. The study used ISO 25010 quality standards in evaluating the application (n = 153 students and 3 ICT experts). Results: Results showed that the application is moderately acceptable (overall mean = 3.52) under ISO 25010 quality standards. Conclusion: The study created an engine simulation learning assembly in which teachers can use to augment their lesson. The study also highlights the applicability of using 3D-related technologies for practical and laboratory subjects particularly highly technical-related subjects. Recommendations: Future studies may develop a similar application in the same context using mobile and other emerging technology (i.e., Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality) as well as making the content more customizable. Effectivity of the system in an actual setting is also worth pursuing. Research Implications: The study highlighted the potential use of 3D technology in a classroom setting.",

It has dealt in a simple way with the commonest properties of bodies; with the nature, growth, and structure of plants in general; and with some of the leading types of the animal creation. In these early books the subjects have been treated entirely from the children's point of view, couched in children's language, with surroundings which will appeal to children's tastes and sympathies; and thus the way is paved for the more systematic and thorough treatment which follows in the later volumes. The evening chats of the three children necessarily come to an end with Book III. In the next volume the numerous experiments and the more exact teaching imperatively demand the presence of a zealous, sympathetic, and painstaking teacher, such as is presented in the person of Mr. Wilson, who takes the boys through the remainder of the course.

Comprehensive as the whole scheme is, the young reader will scarcely experience a difficulty in grasping any one subject, because the way has been carefully prepared beforehand, step by step. They see at once that the various developments are the natural outcome of what has gone before! Each lesson from the companion book, the teacher's manual, is here reproduced, in an easy, chatty style, from the child's own standpoint. It is felt that these readings, used as a supplementary aid to the oral lessons cannot fail to rivet the teaching on the mind. This volume, like the rest, has been profusely illustrated; but every picture is meant to be a real teaching aid, both in respect to the lessons on animal and plant life, and in the experimental lessons. It should be observed that some of the subjects do not lend themselves to pictorial illustration so readily as others. It is on this account, and to prevent one section of the book from becoming less attractive to the child than another, that the subjects have been intermingled in these reading lessons. Any book with the bulk of its illustrations in one or two sections, would be a fatal mistake, so far as the child was concerned. The teacher, who uses these readers to supplement the oral lessons, will find each subject, and every part of each subject, in its natural order, although the readings are interspersed one with another. This remark applies equally to each book of the series. [Cover title varies: &quot;Murché's Science Readers. Book V.&quot;]",

Of these, over 77,000 students have been formally identified as ELs due to limited proficiency in speaking, listening, reading, and writing academic English. ELs comprise roughly 6% of Indiana's total student population, and they are enrolled in schools and districts in every corner of the state. Some EL students are immigrants and refugees, but the vast majority of Indiana's ELs were born in the United States. ELs have rich potential--culturally, linguistically, and academically. Indiana assessment data shows that students who achieve fluency in English often outperform native-speaking peers on statewide content assessments. Whether a local educational agency (LEA) has one EL or thousands, they are obligated to meet certain federal requirements for their students. This document is designed as a reference for district and school personnel working with ELs as they provide support and guidance throughout their educational journey.

        "description":"The Center for Data Insights at MDRC has partnered with organizations to develop and execute a variety of data projects, some with long-standing partners that have participated in MDRC's long-term evaluations; others with newer partners that are just beginning to use data for program improvement. Important lessons about the essential ingredients for implementing successful data projects have emerged from this collaborative work. This brief discusses these ingredients in the context of the Center's TANF Data Innovation (TDI) project. The initiative helps Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) agencies enhance and build their ability to use their own administrative data to answer policy-relevant questions. As part of this project, the Center partnered closely with eight state TANF agencies to design, launch, and complete data projects to address their analytical questions. The Center also worked with the Administration for Children and Families to design this initiative to address known challenges, and to develop projects that can inform how the federal program can support local TANF agencies. The lessons presented in this brief reflect a three-year collaborative experience, during which all project partners considered not only new data tools and skills, but also new ways of learning together. The Center for Data Insights considers a data project a success when data are used routinely to inform policy and practice with the goal of improving the lives of the families served by programs. The Center has learned from these partnerships that barriers to success are not primarily about technical issues or analytic methods. Rather, data projects need three ingredients to be successful: people, perseverance, and project scoping that includes a clear understanding of a project's needs and goals.",

        "title":"Attention Control and the Effects of Online Training in Improving Connected Speech Perception by Learners of English as a Second Language",
        "author":["Gokgoz-Kurt, Burcu"],
        "description":"One of the aspects of L2 English phonology which poses a challenge for L2 learners is learning how to decode the language, especially as spoken by native speakers. This difficulty may be due to the way the native speakers speak by 'draw[ing] [the sounds] together' (Clarey &amp; Dixson, 1963), which results in realization of consonants and vowels differently than when uttered in isolation. This process is referred to as &quot;connected speech&quot; (e.g., pronouncing 'want to' as [characters omitted], and 'going to' as [characters omitted]). The challenge in teaching and learning these forms is that they lack perceptual saliency, requiring extra attentional resources for learners to be able to recognize these forms in spoken language. Therefore, a better understanding of the role of attention in learning these forms is needed. While some studies find a relationship between attention control as a cognitive ability and L2 phonological processing (Darcy, Mora &amp; Daidone, 2014; Safronova &amp; Mora, 2012a), other studies have failed to confirm the existence of such a relationship (Darcy, Park &amp; Yang, 2015). More importantly, to date, no study has examined attention control as it relates to L2 phonological gains, especially in learning a phonological aspect of L2 English other than individual segments as the target linguistic item. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the effects of training in improving the connected speech perception of L2 learners as well as the relationship between attention control and learners' improvement in connected speech perception. To do this, English as a Second Language learners, who were assigned to an experimental (n = 33) or a control group (n = 25), took a two-option forced-choice, pre and post-test. The experimental group received online training on word-boundary palatalization as a connected speech phenomenon for three weeks while the control group did not. Word-boundary palatalization occurs in the transformation of [characters omitted][approximately][characters omitted] 'told you' or [want ju][approximately][characters omitted] 'want you'. To measure attention control, all students were given a Speech-Based Attention Switching Task (Darcy, Mora &amp; Daidone, 2014; Darcy &amp; Mora, in press; Mora and Darcy, in press) and an Attention Network Test (ANT) (Fan, McCandliss, Sommer, Raz &amp; Posner, 2002). The findings reveal that learners both in the control and experimental groups improved their scores on the post-test; however, the improvement in the scores of the experimental group was significantly higher than those of the control group (p =0.007). Furthermore, correlation analyses showed a significant negative correlation between the post-test scores and attention control, and the gain scores and attention control as measured by the Speech-Based Attention Control Task (p =0.002 and p =0.008, respectively) and the conflict effect of the Attention Network Test (p =0.004 and p =0.032, respectively). Additionally, overlapping results between the two attention control tasks were also found as revealed by the significant correlation between the shift-cost and conflict effect measures (p =0.009). Overall, the results indicated that L2 learners benefit from online training in improving performance scores on a perception test of word-boundary palatalization, which is promising for further studies of connected speech teaching and learning. The findings also reveal a significant relationship between learners' attention control and phonological learning, which shows the crucial role attention control plays in learning connected speech.",

        "description":"In recent years, both policymakers and practitioners working to increase postsecondary attainment rates in the United States have shifted their focus from college access to college success. At the same time, they have recognized that the prevalence of 36 million adults with some college education but no postsecondary credential is an important consequence of the many challenges facing American college students. Adults with some college but no credential face a range of barriers to both re-enrolling in college and completing a credential if they re-enroll. Those who have made several attempts to attend college may be burdened by student loans and other educational debt but cannot reap the social and economic benefits associated with earning a postsecondary credential. Given this reality, policymakers and postsecondary institutions must identify effective ways to support these individuals if and when they do try to return to college. This study offers a unique opportunity to better understand the experiences of adults who stopped out of college, re-enrolled, and either successfully completed a credential or seemed likely to do so. Based on a new survey of these successful returning students, the study investigates the challenges and supports they view as important to their ability to remain enrolled and attain a postsecondary credential, with the goal of identifying factors that facilitated their success.

It also puts them in context by comparing DSP wages to living wages--the cost of living based on typical expenses that meet minimum standards of living. Low wages are a major factor contributing to the DSP workforce crisis. This Brief shows that DSP wages have been consistently below wages of other comparable professions. It also shows that not only has the gap between living wages and DSP wages not gotten smaller in recent years, with the onset of the pandemic, it saw a jump. For a family with one working adult and one child (which makes up a large proportion of DSPs), the median gap went from being &quot;$13.00 per hour below living wage in 2019 to $17.64 per hour below living wage in 2020.&quot; Such gaps between what people need to earn to live and what they actually earn are not sustainable.",

        "description":"For more than a quarter century, Michigan public schools have been financed under a structure commonly known as Proposal A. This funding system's greater dependence on using state revenue to finance an enrollment-based funding formula has led to greater parity among districts over time and fueled more publicly supported schooling options for parents. A student-based funding model rewards school officials and leaders when they pay attention to and serve the particular needs of students because parents can vote with their feet. However COVID-19 has amplified the pressure on rigidly designed school systems to adapt effectively to serve students with increasingly varying and diverse needs. Extended school building closures reshaped the day-to-day and familiar activities of faculty and staff in the short run, while business closures and private sector layoffs threatened key sources of school tax revenue. Looking to the future, Michigan should focus on tying education dollars more directly to student needs and choices and on empowering educator flexibility to meet changing local needs. This report explores these issues and lays out principles for policymakers in empowering more parents with control and choice of their children's educational experience.",

        "description":"It has been shown in multiple studies that expert-created on-demand assistance, such as hint messages, improves student learning in online learning environments. However, there are also evident that certain types of assistance may be detrimental to student learning. In addition, creating and maintaining on-demand assistance are hard and time-consuming. In 2017-2018 academic year, 132,738 distinct problems were assigned inside ASSISTments, but only 38,194 of those problems had on-demand assistance. In order to take on-demand assistance to scale, we needed a system that is able to gather new on-demand assistance and allows us to test and measure its effectiveness. Thus, we designed and deployed TeacherASSIST inside ASSISTments. TeacherASSIST allowed teachers to create on-demand assistance for any problems as they assigned those problems to their students. TeacherASSIST then redistributed on-demand assistance by one teacher to students outside of their classrooms. We found that teachers inside ASSISTments had created 40,292 new instances of assistance for 25,957 different problems in three years. There were 14 teachers who created more than 1,000 instances of on-demand assistance. We also conducted two large-scale randomized controlled experiments to investigate how on-demand assistance created by one teacher affected students outside of their classes. Students who received on-demand assistance for one problem resulted in significant statistical improvement on the next problem performance. The students' improvement in this experiment confirmed our hypothesis that crowd-sourced on-demand assistance was sufficient in quality to improve student learning, allowing us to take on-demand assistance to scale.

        "description":"As more educators integrate their curricula with online learning, it is easier to crowdsource content from them. Crowdsourced tutoring has been proven to reliably increase students' next problem correctness. In this work, we confirmed the findings of a previous study in this area, with stronger confidence margins than previously, and revealed that only a portion of crowdsourced content creators had a reliable benefit to students. Furthermore, this work provides a method to rank content creators relative to each other, which was used to determine which content creators were most effective overall, and which content creators were most effective for specific groups of students. When exploring data from TeacherASSIST, a feature within the ASSISTments learning platform that crowdsources tutoring from teachers, we found that while overall this program provides a benefit to students, some teachers created more effective content than others. Despite this finding, we did not find evidence that the effectiveness of content reliably varied by student knowledge-level, suggesting that the content is unlikely suitable for personalizing instruction based on student knowledge alone. These findings are promising for the future of crowdsourced tutoring as they help provide a foundation for assessing the quality of crowdsourced content and investigating content for opportunities to personalize students' education.

In particular, it is an open challenge to design self- explanation support that simultaneously facilitates performance and learning outcomes. Towards this goal, we designed anticipatory diagrammatic self-explanation, a novel form of self-explanation embedded in an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). In our ITS, anticipatory diagrammatic self-explanation scaffolds learners by providing visual representations to help learners predict an upcoming strategic step in algebra problem solving. A classroom experiment with 108 middle-school students found that anticipatory diagrammatic self-explanation helped students learn formal algebraic strategies and significantly improve their problem-solving performance. This study contributes to understanding of how self-explanation can be scaffolded to support learning and performance.",

In this study, the relations between science teachers' career motivations and demographic variables (gender, school location and professional experience) were examined. A total of 136 science teachers working at state middle schools in Mugla Province participated in the study. FIT-Choice Scale was used as data collection tool. Data were collected in the Spring 2019 semester. In data analysis, descriptive statistics, independent sample t-test and one-way ANOVA tests were used. The results of the analysis showed that the career motivation of science teachers was at moderate level. In terms of gender, differences were found in the sub-dimensions of expertise, difficulty, social impact, and fallback career. In addition, analysis showed that there was a difference in the sub-dimensions of difficulty, social status, social pressure, enhance social equality, social contribution, determining the future of students and previous experiences in terms of school location. In terms of professional experience, in only the sub-dimension of job security, a statistically significant difference was found. The results of the study suggest that teachers should receive more financial and moral support from their environment.",

        "description":"As online learning platforms become more ubiquitous throughout various curricula, there is a growing need to evaluate the effectiveness of these platforms and the different methods used to structure online education and tutoring. Towards this endeavor, some platforms have performed randomized controlled experiments to compare different user experiences, curriculum structures, and tutoring strategies in order to ensure the effectiveness of their platform and personalize the education of the students using it. These experiments are typically analyzed on an individual basis in order to reveal insights on a specific aspect of students' online educational experience. In this work, the data from 50,752 instances of 30,408 students participating in 50 different experiments conducted at scale within the online learning platform ASSISTments were aggregated and analyzed for consistent trends across experiments. By combining common experimental conditions and normalizing the dependent measures between experiments, this work has identified multiple statistically significant insights on the impact of various skill mastery requirements, strategies for personalization, and methods for tutoring in an online setting. This work can help direct further experimentation and inform the design and improvement of new and existing online learning platforms.

Toward this end, we developed &quot;Pedagogical Affordance Analysis (PAA).&quot; PAA involves analyzing teachers' Pedagogical Content Knowledge and/or Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge to elicit pedagogical affordances and constraints that are specific to a given instructional goal. Information obtained through PAA can help in designing, refining, and/or evaluating instructional tools. We present a case study in which we used PAA to successfully design a visual representation for middle-school algebra. To the best of our knowledge, PAA is the only available systematic method that leverages teachers' pedagogical knowledge in identifying pedagogical affordances and constraints. PAA can be used across a wide range of existing tools and prototypes of to-be-designed tools. [This paper was published in: &quot;ICLS 2020 Proceedings,&quot; ISLS, 2020, pp. 1561-64.]",

However, prior research suggests that visual representations alone are not necessarily effective across a broad range of students. To address this problem, we created a novel, scaffolded form of diagrammatic self-explanation in which students &quot;explain&quot; their problem-solving steps in the form of diagrams. We used contrasting cases to support students' sense-making between algebraic equations and diagrams in the self-explanation activity. We conducted a classroom experiment with 41 students in grades 5 and 6 to test the effectiveness of this strategy when embedded in an Intelligent Tutoring System for algebra. We found that scaffolded diagrammatic self-explanation enhanced conceptual knowledge for students who did not have prior knowledge of formal equation-solving strategies. The study is the first experimental study showing that visual representations can enhance conceptual knowledge in early algebra.

The assessment is based on an analysis of state appropriations and the six-year graduation rates of all students as well as the graduation rates of three subgroups, including Black, Latinx, and White students. Using a 12-year panel dataset of entering freshman cohorts at most public four-year institutions in the nation, the analyses show how graduation rates can be expected to change as a function of varying levels of state appropriations revenue both between and within institutions. The first analysis examined the average effect of appropriations on graduation rates within institutions over the 12-year period. The results indicated that a 10% increase in appropriations would yield a modest percentage point increase in graduation rates. While state appropriation levels have a positive effect on graduation rates on average, the second analysis demonstrated that the effect on graduation rates varies by institution. The third analysis estimated the association between appropriations and graduation rates by examining change within and between institutions over time (rather than only within institutions). This analysis provided the expected percentage point difference in graduation rates between institutions if one has 10% greater appropriations.

        "description":"Of the studies of internships at two-year colleges, few have focused specifically on IT and engineering technology (ET) programs and the structures that are essential to building effective technology internships. Case studies at two Florida community colleges enabled the exploration of internship structure, student participation by demographics, and correlations between internship structures and outcomes. The research filled gaps in what is known about how internships should be structured to best support student participation and learning and to broaden student participation and employer engagement. The findings offer details about how internships are structured, who participates in credit-bearing technology internships, and the impact of internships on student learning and career exploration and employer engagement strategies.

The sample included 68 second grade students who were at risk for writing disabilities. Handwritten compositions were collected throughout a written language intervention at baseline, sessions 3, 5, 10, 13, 15, 20, 22, and termination. Specific CBM variables included Total Number of Words Written, Words Spelled Correctly, Correct Word Sequences, and Percentage of Correct Word Sequences. Using latent growth curve analysis, models were estimated for each of the CBMs, but the data showed poor model fit. Latent class groupings using cognitive variables and student subgroups significantly moderated the growth rate for written language assessed by specific CBMs. Although these latter findings reflected potential moderators of change in written language, the lack of model fit raised questions around the use of these CBM variables in monitoring writing progress for second grade students at risk for writing disabilities. Findings from this investigation revealed the measurement complexities that likely remain hidden from teachers and other professionals engaged in routine progress monitoring using CBM variables.

It uses both narrative and expository reading passages and it currently has four forms. Two goals of this research were to compare narrative and expository passages on (a) their difficulty and (b) their ability to discriminate between good and poor readers. An additional goal was to assess whether narrative and expository passages measure the same or different comprehension dimensions. A final goal was to assess the reliability of forms. We randomly assigned students to forms with between 274-279 college students per form. Across the several forms, results suggest that narrative passages are easier and better discriminate between good and poor readers. However, both narrative and expository passages measure a single dimension of ability. MOCCA-C scores are reliable. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

        "description":"The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between authentic leadership behaviors of school administrators and teacher professionalism and motivation. In the quantitative research, the relational survey model was used. The population of the study consists of 1040 teachers working in 44 primary schools in Kayapinar, Diyarbakir during the 2018-2019 academic year. Data collection tools were the &quot;Authentic Leadership Scale&quot;, &quot;Teacher Professionalism Scale&quot;, and &quot;The Work Motivation Scale&quot;. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and path analysis of variables were made. SPSS 21 and AMOS 22 package programs were used in the analysis of the research. As a result of the research, it was determined that the school administrators were moderate according to the perceptions of the teachers who participated in the research on authentic leadership behaviour. In addition, the professionalism and motivation levels of teachers were found to be at good level. As a result of the correlation analysis, a positive and medium level between authentic leadership behaviors of school administrators and teacher motivation and a positive and low-level relationship was found between authentic leadership behaviors of school administrators and teacher professionalism. The relationship between teacher professionalism and teacher motivation was found to be positive and moderate. As a result of the path analysis, as the teachers' perceptions about authentic leadership behaviors of school administrators become positive, both the motivations and professional perceptions of teachers increase. In addition, it was found that teacher professionalism had a stronger predictive effect on teacher motivation than authentic leadership.",

Putnam Vocational Technical Academy in Springfield, that were once known for high dropout rates and low graduation rates. The report shows that these schools now excel due to new leadership, community investment, and committed teachers. The report analyzes how Worcester Tech and Putnam Academy -- schools with high numbers of low-income and special needs students -- leapt from the bottom of Massachusetts voc-tech rankings to become leaders among local schools. The Pioneer paper includes interviews with administrators and presents several recommendations that could help transform struggling voc-tech schools.",

Teachers can create a bookshelf of appropriate books for students to read independently and can create assignments for individuals or groups of students. Additional features include prerecorded lessons and assessments for monitoring progress. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 1st-grade teachers from the Manatee County School District (MCSD) in Florida had received professional development (PD) training on key components of the Digital Reader and its Literacy Footprints lessons: guided reading, phonics/word study, and guided writing. Teachers learned how to introduce new books to students and prompt for strategic processing as they read. Teachers became familiar with the phonics manipulatives and practiced the phonics/word study procedures associated with the accompanying lessons. In 2020, MCSD shifted to operating in a remote-learning format in response to pandemic concerns. Students were given a Digital Reader for home use and teachers began using it for online instruction. To examine the impact of the Digital Reader on student learning, a quasi-experimental analysis comparing outcomes for students who used the Digital Reader and those who did not across 31 elementary schools was conducted. The analysis found that Digital Reader had a small but positive impact on students' English Language Arts (ELA) achievement.",

        "description":"Nutrition insecurity is especially seen among historically underserved populations, such as those with limited financial resources. Funded by the USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and conducted by Cooperative Extension through land-grant institutions in all U.S. states and territories and the District of Columbia, the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) uses education to support program participants' efforts toward self-sufficiency and nutritional health and wellbeing. This report reflects how EFNEP continues to make a difference in the lives of low-income families and youth, even, and especially in times of adversity. Fiscal year 2021 was especially difficult for individuals, families, and communities across the nation as they experienced personal loss, social isolation, employment uncertainty, and lack of access to food and other resources. It was also difficult for community-based programs as they experienced temporary closures and pivoted to develop and adapt social distancing protocols in a changing and challenging COVID-19 pandemic environment. Faced with such difficulties, EFNEP remained resilient and experienced continued programmatic success. New partnerships were formed, resources were adapted, and remote approaches were utilized to expand program reach. Universities gave increased attention to training paraprofessional staff (peer educators) to help them feel less isolated. EFNEP leadership across the country developed and shared program content and teaching methods that allowed them to adapt quickly to a virtual teaching environment that supported participant success. Federal partners increased communications and provided technical assistance to university leadership to recognize and support local efforts.",

        "description":"The pandemic hit the already vulnerable early childhood education (ECE) workforce especially hard, causing almost 40 percent of child care providers to shut their doors and many teachers to lose their jobs. In 2021, enrollment in state-funded preschool also dropped for the first time in 20 years--a nearly 20 percent decline that erased a decade of growth. Because of the workforce's critical role in supporting children, families, businesses, and the economy, when the ECE system struggles, communities feel the effects. Federal relief funds provide an important opportunity to invest in and transform the ECE workforce. Many states developed plans to address the challenges that the workforce faces. However, without sustainable, long-term strategies for increasing compensation, they risk exhausting funding on short-term investments while maintaining a long-term funding gap for educators.",

These jurisdictions were British Columbia, Canada; Estonia; Finland; Hong Kong; and Singapore. The goal of the project was to consider the impact of digitalization and other global trends on the future of work and civil society; explore what this means for what students should learn and how they should learn it; and consider how this might change the role of educators and the design of public education systems. The work was organized around a series of semi-annual policy dialogues among OECD, NCEE and the leaders of the jurisdiction education systems to explore these themes. This paper serves as a report of those discussions.",

Unregulated systems of school choice, however, tend to exacerbate school segregation (Cobb &amp; Glass, 2009). This research brief summarizes research about charter schools and segregation and finds that the evidence shows that if school choice programs cannot or do not pay attention to social class and race, they generally increase segregation among schools.

The purpose of this quantitative action research study was to determine whether there is a relationship between students' sense of belonging in a corequisite mathematics class and academic performance. The study also sought to determine if the teaching and learning strategies positively impacted sense of belonging. Belonging surveys and self-reported grades were used to answer the questions &quot;What is the nature of the relationship between the change in a student's sense of belonging in a corequisite math course and their academic performance in the corequisite and gateway math courses?&quot; and &quot;To what extent will the methods used for fostering a sense of belonging in the treatment group impact students' sense of belonging compared to the control group?&quot; There was no statistically significant relationship between belonging and course grades, yet one group did experience a significant increase in belonging. The researcher concludes that although students' sense of belonging and course grades may not be associated, instructors should foster sense of belonging in the classes they teach.",

        "description":"Research information management (RIM) is a rapidly growing area of investment in US research universities. RIM systems that support the collection and use of research outputs metadata have been in place for many years. Globally, the RIM ecosystem is quite mature in locales where national research assessment exercises like the United Kingdom's Research Excellence Framework (REF) and the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) require institutions to collect and report on the outputs of institutional research. A pan-European community of practice is led by euroCRIS. However, in the absence of national research assessment requirements in the United States, RIM practices at U.S. research universities have taken a different--and characteristically decentralized--course. A complex variety of stakeholders have responded to a similarly complex mix of use cases, with silos and frequent duplication as a result. This report is a two-part series that provides a first-of-its-kind documentation of RIM practices at US research universities, building on previous research conducted by OCLC Research, that offers a thorough examination of RIM practices, goals, stakeholders, and system components. Part One provides summary findings synthesized from in-depth case studies of US RIM practices, which are documented in detail in the Part Two companion report. It furthermore synthesizes these findings into a summary of RIM use cases, a RIM system framework, and concise recommendations for RIM stakeholders. [For Part Two, see ED623603.]",

This growth has been characteristically decentralized, resulting in silos, multiple systems, and frequent duplication of efforts at many institutions. This report is a two-part report series seeks to fill a gap in the literature by documenting RIM activities to provide U.S. research institutions with a more comprehensive and strategic view of RIM practices. Part 2 of this report, provides an in-depth narrative of the RIM practices at five US research institutions: (1) Penn State University; (2) Texas A&amp;M University; (3) Virginia Tech; (4) UCLA; and (5) University of Miami. Each case study includes content about the history and relevant use cases as well as significant documentation about each RIM system and its implementation, including its scope, stakeholders, and administrative leadership. It also provides an extensive description of the RIM systems themselves, detailing the data sources, processing and storage practices, and system goals and uses. The narratives conclude by documenting the metadata and sources populating each RIM system and describing future plans for the institutional RIM system(s). [For Part One, see ED623599.]",

Additionally, there has been a lack of consensus on how to name different variations of online and hybrid learning (e.g., hyflex learning, synchronous online and hybrid elements, and asynchronous online and hybrid elements). To address the ongoing debate about how terms related to online and hybrid learning should be defined, a survey was conducted asking participants to indicate the extent to which they agreed with the following terms and their definitions: (1) Online learning: All instruction and interaction is fully online (synchronous or asynchronous); (2) Hybrid learning: A blend of online and in-person instruction (online instruction is synchronous or asynchronous); (3) Hyflex learning: Students can move between online and in-person instruction as they see fit (also referred to as multi-access or co-modal learning); (4) In-person learning: All instruction takes place in an in-person setting. (5) Synchronous learning: Instruction takes place in real-time and requires student presence (in-person or virtual) at a set time; and (6) Asynchronous learning: Instruction is available for students to access at a time that works best for them. The purpose of this report is to provide a brief overview of the findings from this study.

Schools continued to face a myriad of challenges including severe staff shortages, high rates of absenteeism and sickness, and rolling school closures forced by the pandemic's fallout. This brief continues NWEA's ongoing research agenda examining how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected student achievement in reading and math. The authors build on previous findings to examine students' achievement gains up to the end of the third school year impacted by the pandemic. To understand the cumulative impact of the pandemic on student achievement and look for initial signs of rebounding, this study used test score data from 8.3 million students in grades 3-8 who took MAP® Growth™ assessments in reading and math in approximately 25,000 public schools between 2018-19 and 2021-22. These data were compared to a sample of students of a roughly comparable size who tested between 2015-16 and 2018-19. [For the Technical Appendix, see ED623611.]",

Methods: The validated Gatekeeper Behavior Scale was administered to 33,703 participants at baseline, post-training and follow-up. Helping behaviors were measured at baseline and follow-up. We also assessed preparedness, likelihood, and self-efficacy concerning leading conversations with youth about bullying and suicide. Results: Participants showed positive change from pre-test to 3-month follow-up on variables of interest. Hotelling's T2 test indicated that, as a set, gatekeeper attitudes of preparedness, likelihood, and self-efficacy differed between pre-test and post-test, F (3, 33,512) = 16,283, p &lt; 0.001, [eta][superscript 2] [subscript partial] = 0.59. Number of students about whom gatekeepers were concerned (p &lt; 0.05), number of students approached to discuss concerns (p &lt; 0.001), and number of students referred to support services (p &lt; 0.001) increased significantly with training. Conclusions: The At-Risk simulation shows promise in detecting and referring students in psychological distress, including risk of suicide. Fidelity is maintained because the program cannot be altered. At-Risk can be an effective and affordable way to provide suicide prevention training for those working in schools.",

In the geography curriculum rearranged by the Republic of Turkey Ministry of National Education in 2018, the recommended approach to be followed in gaining the stated goalbehavior is explained with the statement &quot;The main tangible and intangible elements representing Turkish culture are presented in relation to the space through examples. With an approach that takes into account the context-based perspective suggested in the geography curriculum, this paper aims to support the acquisition of knowledge content and cognitive process dimensions and to develop instructional content to transform these dimensions into goal-behaviors of the goal-achievement of &quot;To be able to explain the cultural geographical history of Turkish arts of printmaking and miniature in relation to space&quot;. Based on the stated aims and arguments, firstly, the importance of Uighur painting art, which is known to have reached maturity between the 8 th and 13th centuries with the empowerment of the classical style based on strong pattern drawings, has been evaluated in terms of the intra/intergenerational transmission of &quot;intangible cultural heritage&quot; (ICH) and art history. Later, the Uighur graphic style, which is known to continue the traces of the old Turkish traditions and its origins are based on rock paintings, in other words the Uyghur line element; it is interpreted in the context of the themes used in the dominant compositions in the spaces where the style finds living space. This research is a content analysis research built in qualitative research design. Content analysis is one of the techniques frequently used in research in social sciences. The literature document of the research consists of the geography curriculum and the research works prepared by using Chinese annuals and Western sources. [For the full proceedings, see ED623569.]",

        "description":"Rapid technological advances affected the field of education, as well as other fields. This fact creates the need of utilizing technology in education effectively. Another fact that emerges when the subject of education in technology is considered is Web 2.0 tools. Along with Web 2.0 technology, students get more active in education instead of remaining passive, and become more productive and more willing to share. In this study, MA and PhD theses focusing on Web 2.0 technology which are published on Council of Higher Education National Thesis Center database between the years 2010 and 2020 were investigated according to content analysis method. In this sense, 44 of the theses which were reached as a result of the review of the related database were analyzed under the categories of thesis type, thesis year, the university it was carried out, its language and the subject it reviewed. It was revealed as a result of the investigation of the theses that Turkish language is the most used language in the theses, that the subject drew more attention especially in 2019 as the number of the studies on the subject of Web 2.0 tools increased in the recent years, and that the number of the studies carried out in the state universities is more than the number of the studies carried out in private universities.

        "description":"Student satisfaction is one of the important factors to be considered in the education system. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to make quality education available for a wide range of people, the current higher education system has undergone several changes. The classes and webinars being conducted through video conferencing systems such as zoom have gained unprecedented popularity. So, according to statistics, more than 97% of students switched to online education in the United States as it is a safe and feasible option to continue their education during the pandemic situation. At the same time, only 31% of students consider this format to be of the same quality as full-time, and only 5% of students find online learning to be of higher quality than offline. That is, 63% of students receiving online education are not satisfied with its current quality. According to the many types of research on student-teacher communication, non-verbal communication plays a crucial role in student satisfaction. Therefore, the study is conducted to find the direct correlation between time characteristics such as loudness, silence duration, change in intonations, tempo, and hand gestures of instructors during online classes and student satisfaction levels. As part of the study, recent online classes and webinars from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, IIT's, ITMO, and few prestigious universities are analyzed. The quality of the classes is rated by the students as high or low based on their satisfaction level. Based on the analysis, successful and unsuccessful models are compiled. Based on the obtained models and the time parameters illustrated, assessment and recommendation systems are offered to improve the quality of both individual characteristics and the general concept of classes.

        "description":"Media narratives, frames and the manner of sudden-onset crises events' coverage strongly influence the audience's perception and understanding of situation and their behavior. Nonverbal communication of broadcasters transfers important information related to viewers' formation of impressions. That is why the journalists strive to hide the nonverbal cues. During 2020, Croatia was hit, along with COVID 19 pandemics, with 2 devastating earthquakes. At the same time, formal education of journalists in Croatia does not include syllabi aimed to develop knowledge and skills for disaster journalism. This small explorative study aims to explore nonverbal cues of Croatian journalists during the live TV breaking news on COVID-19 breakthrough and earthquake in Zagreb, in comparison to their non-crisis reporting. A quantitative analysis using software ELAN was conducted on a deliberate sample of video clips. The obtained results show that nonverbal cues were moderately and expectedly frequent. Speech fluency was within the normal rate, with natural breathing pauses included and the use of fillers appropriated to the spontaneous speech. The analyzed nonverbal cues pattern does not differ depending on the reporting context which suggests that nonverbal communication skills need to be improved. Absolutely unbiased journalism may not be possible, but in order to achieve the neutrality standard, nonverbal communication competence should be incorporated both into curricula and into the journalist code of ethics.

        "description":"Children are busy observers of natural objects, and have many questions to ask about them. But their inquisitive observation is commonly repressed, instead of being encouraged and guided. In this book the object of the author is to supply the mother and the teacher with the means of introducing the child into one department of natural science--that which relates to the vegetable world, or vegetable physiology. The author begins with the most simple and obvious facts--those which relate to flowers--and goes on through fruits, seeds, leaves, roots, etc., step by step, until, at the latter part of the book, the circulation of the sap, and other points at first view complicated, are made perfectly intelligible. By this gradual unfolding of the subject, many points are made clear to the child, which are not fully understood by some of those who in riper years have studied botany; for in the common mode of teaching this science the mere technicalities of it are made prominent, while the interesting facts which vegetable physiology presents to us in such variety receive but little attention. The best time to use this book in teaching is during the summer, because then everything can be illustrated by specimens from the field and the garden, and the teacher can amplify upon what the author has given.",

        "description":"Our topic is focused on health education within the school curriculum. It's to emphasize its importance in the short and long-course during the learning and growth process. Healthy diet presents an outstanding medium in enhancing cognitive efficiency and helps in assisting the acquisition process. Adopting a guided nutriment practice participates in empowering young individuals to better manage their consuming habits. It has been outlined in several studies across continents how food behaviorism, lifestyle factors, poor quality nutrients can compromise intellectual efficiency in the stage of knowledge acquisition alongside health issues. This has drawn serious concerns to governments and institutions (WHO, UNICEF, European Union, and states) to outpoint the impact of nutriments, notably their type and quality, on childhood health and development. Our paper is set to deliver scientific-based evidence through selected studies conducted across the globe on health and nutrition and their consequence upon pupils and school performance. The majority of the surveys centered on how good diet and appropriate food consumption habits or their absence could improve or impair the overall health conditions as well as school achievements. Health education programs throughout education curriculum can partake in drawing public awareness in regards to impoverished diets and processed fast-food. The aforementioned are often considered responsible for causing chronic diseases endowed with characterized symptoms. Integrating lifestyle principles in the education agenda would bestow worthy elements to amend physical and learning conditions. [For the full proceedings, see ED623569.]",

        "description":"The author has created a series of books on the natural sciences carefully adapted to the different periods of the course of study, with this textbook intended for the older scholars in what are commonly called grammar-schools. At the same time they are suited to scholars who are advanced to a higher grade who have not gone through the previous books of the series. The general plan and style of these books are very different from what are seen in most of the books for schools on the same subjects. The order of the subjects and the mode of developing them differ from the stereotype plan which has so generally been adopted. One prominent feature is the free use of illustrations from familiar phenomena. It makes the books suitable for use in the family as well as the school, between which there should be more common ground than the present mode of education allows.",

        "author":["Polson, Diana"],
        "description":"President Biden's recent announcement regarding student debt relief has brought the issue to center stage across Pennsylvania and the U.S. Access to quality higher education is so important to Pennsylvania's individuals and families, yet the high cost of college in the state has both limited who has access to a good education and, for those attending college, weighed down students with crushing amounts of debt. Carrying such a debt burden at the start of one's career hinders Pennsylvanians' choices, careers, and life decisions and holds back our economy. This research examines the student debt crisis in Pennsylvania. It analyzes publicly available data on Pennsylvania and looks at the financial and economic implications of student debt for Pennsylvania families, students, and regions. Among the findings are: (1) Low state funding and the high cost of college sets Pennsylvania up for a statewide student loan crisis; (2) Outstanding student loan debt has skyrocketed in the last two decades, and Pennsylvania graduates have high amounts of debt compared to other states; (3) Some communities are hit harder by the student loan crisis; (4) For-profit colleges have poor student outcomes; (5) Pennsylvania students are using nonfederal loans at higher rates than much of the nation; and (6) Student loan debt is dragging down the economy. Policy solutions for Pennsylvania conclude the report.",

        "description":"In the ESSA Leadership Learning Community (ELLC), education agency leaders, community organization leaders, and others have together taken on challenges facing schools and school leaders in their states. They have produced advice to state agencies on policy design and rollout, for example on official definitions of equity, on requirements for principal certification, and on approaches to improvement for schools that are identified for low student achievement. They have created new programs of professional learning for school leaders and contributed to changes in existing programs of preparation and professional learning. They have produced materials for statewide use by community members and educators, focused on equity or on ways in which parents and communities can work with their schools. These practical results have emerged in 11 participating states, in each case because a team brought together different voices to articulate a shared vision and act on it. This report provides a look at the accomplishments of the teams and how the ELLC structure and resources contributed to them. It explores the ways in which teams influenced policies and practices related to equity-focused leadership and school improvement, and what factors made a difference.",

        "description":"Many Pre-K through grade 12 (PK-12) students have experienced traumatic events throughout the pandemic in a myriad of ways including the death of family members and peers, loss of social interaction and increased violence at home. The consequences can be traumatic and manifest themselves in fear, anxiety, anger, isolation, and loneliness. Too often this leads to depression, anxiety, grief, substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation and even suicides. This study assesses the impact of an innovative virtual human role-play simulation that prepares PK-12 educators, administrators, and school staff to respond to a student death in the school community by creating communities of support to help manage traumatic loss. The simulation addresses crisis response planning, postvention plans, and provides learners with role-play practice in using evidence-based motivational interviewing communication strategies in conversations with students and colleagues after the occurrence of a death. The sample consisted of educators and staff who were recruited from geographically dispersed areas across the US between January 2021 through December 2021. Matched sample t-tests and ANOVAs were used to assess quantitative data, and a qualitative analysis software, MAXQDA, was used to assess open-ended response data. Results show statistically significant increases in school personnel's preparedness and self-efficacy to recognize signs of trauma in their students and colleagues, and to approach them to talk about concerns and, if necessary, make a referral to support services. Simulations such as this hold tremendous potential in teaching educators how address trauma due to a student death.",

        "description":"Nowadays, Augmented and VR in teaching disciplines such as Human Anatomy has made it feasible to promote learning through a gamification process that allows the development of teaching-learning proposals that improve students' motivation significant learning and not merely memoirist. This new practice moves away from the traditional methods used in Human Anatomy subjects. This work shows the result of implementing a methodology based on Augmented and Virtual Reality (VR) in high school students within the subject of human anatomy. Specifically, this implementation was developed in students (n = 16), all of them belonging to a public education center. Moreover, they were involved in nursing care, primary nursing techniques. The results, derived from the analysis of the instrument used to assess their level of acceptance and their level of learning, showed a significant increase in both motivations for learning and the acquisition of knowledge in the area (significance * p &lt;0.001, ANOVA). Our study concludes that the use of Augmented and VR improves the learning and motivation of students in daily practice. [For the full proceedings, see ED623569.]",

        "description":"This article explores the effectiveness of the pedagogical practices associated with the cognitive load theory and the van Hiele theory, which are two theories from cognitivism and constructivism perspectives, respectively. Following a quasi-experiment, the quantitative analysis of 157 high school students' responses to pre, post, and retention tests revealed that the students taught with the van Hiele teaching phases performed significantly better at the post and retention tests. While the cognitive load theory intervention bridges the gap between low and high ability students, the van Hiele teaching phases is beneficial to both low and high performing students. These results have implications for mathematics teaching practices and learning.",

In this paper, we report on the types and functions of visual representations of multiplication and division in South African early years mathematics textbooks. There seems to be a reliance on textbooks amongst teachers in South Africa as they assist in providing pedagogic content knowledge. The research from which this paper emerged was a document analysis of multiplication and division visual representations in nine textbooks (Grade 1-3). A Visual Representation Framework was used to analyse the textbooks. The findings indicated that the most dominant type of visual representations across all three textbook series and across the three grades were equal groups and the majority of visual representations had an exemplifying function.",

The purpose of the qualitative phenomenological action research study with a disability critical race theory framework was to investigate the role educational strategies played in the college experience of first-year African American males with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The study examined five research questions. How do African American males with ADHD describe their first-year college experience, during the first year of college experience, what factors do African American males with ADHD see as contributing or not contributing to academic success, how often do African American male college students with ADHD request assistance for academic strategy support such as time management, tutoring support service, and test-taking strategies. For African American male college students with ADHD, what is the process for registering with a disability resource office to request academic accommodations. How often do African American male college students with ADHD visit student success centers for support? If not provided the right tools to help them persist beyond the first college year, the role academic strategies can play in the first-year college experience of African American male college students with ADHD can be harmful to their academic experience, with four themes emerging: African American male misconception, environmental transition, reluctance results in passivity and sense of belonging.

TEAMS is partially funded through an Office of English Language Acquisition National Professional Development grant from the U.S. Department of Education, and participants receive scholarships to cover tuition. This study explores whether TEAMS professional development had an impact on the academic outcomes of English learner students whose teachers participated in TEAMS. The study authors used a two-step matching procedure to identify a group of comparison teachers in TEAMS school districts who appeared likely to enroll in TEAMS. They then selected a subset of students who had statistically indistinguishable demographic characteristics, program enrollment, and academic achievement from TEAMS students. Due to complications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, reliable assessment data were only available for the academic year 2018/19. The study found that teachers' participation in TEAMS positively impacted English learner students' English language arts assessment outcomes. English language arts testing scores of English learner students taught by TEAMS teachers were 0.348 standard deviations higher than those of comparison students taught by comparison teachers. This difference is statistically significant and of moderate size, representing a 13.6 percentile point increase for an average English learner student. Teachers' participation in TEAMS had no impact on students' English language proficiency outcomes.",

        "description":"The State Higher Education Executive Officers Association's (SHEEO) &quot;Communities of Practice&quot; project builds upon SHEEO's ongoing efforts to measure the capacity and effective use of state postsecondary data systems and provides states with opportunities to develop solutions to common issues with those systems. The sixth Community of Practice convening, &quot;Aligning K-12 and Postsecondary Education,&quot; was held December 7-8, 2021, in Denver, Colorado. The two-day meeting included representatives from 13 states: Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, and Washington. Teams included representatives from SHEEO agencies, state K-12 agencies, P-20 partnership organizations, state longitudinal data systems, and others. The Community of Practice also addressed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on student transitions and how state data systems can be used to promote equitable outcomes for low-income students and students of color. During the convening, teams explored practical uses of state P-20 data for improving college access, equity, and success and how state postsecondary data can better inform the K-12 to postsecondary pipeline. This white paper highlights key themes and findings of the convening, including challenges and lessons learned from the participating state teams and suggestions of topics for further consideration. Case studies describing ongoing efforts in Georgia and Pennsylvania are included in the appendices. Presentations from the December 2021 convening are available on SHEEO's state postsecondary data website.",

With 197 Chinese fourth graders as participants, this study explored the mechanism by which the spacing/spatial relationship in handwriting legibility affects number-line estimation through VMI. The results indicate that (1) the spacing/spatial relationship in handwriting legibility had a direct and positive effect on students' number-line estimation performance; (2) VMI completely mediated the relationship between the spacing/spatial relationship in handwriting legibility and number-line estimation. Overall, the findings confirmed one specific mechanism of linguistic influences on students' numerical knowledge.

        "title":"Developing a Bomb Threat Annex: Enhancing the Higher Ed Emergency Operations Plan. Fact Sheet",
        "description":"Our nation's postsecondary institutions are entrusted to provide a safe and healthy learning environment for the students, faculty, and staff who live, work, and study on campus. Planning for emergencies may be challenging for institutions of higher education (IHEs) because of geography, environment, governance, around-the clock-operations, and the multiage population served. While the risk and vulnerability for certain types of threats and hazards may be driven by location and other factors, some threat and hazard types, including bomb threats, can universally impact all IHEs. However, in 2022, there was an unprecedented spike in bomb threats targeted at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). In the first 3 months of 2022, more than one-third of our country's HBCUs received bomb threats. As a result of these threats, learning was disrupted and critical resources were diverted to emergency response, adding to the burden already placed on overwhelmed campus mental health systems. Considering this rise in bomb threats and the high number of those bomb threats disproportionately targeting HBCUs, additional resources, strategies, and planning are needed to maintain the safety and security of all students, faculty, and staff, regardless of the institution type. This fact sheet outlines how IHE core planning teams can plan for potential bomb threats through the creation and modification of a higher education emergency operations plan (EOP) that addresses the threat in a Bomb Threat Annex.",

This research was carried out in the &quot;Computer for Low&quot; (ITEC190) and &quot; computer introductory&quot; (ITEC115) courses of Eastern Mediterranean University in the 2019-2020 Spring semester. In these courses, hybrid learning was applied and students' perceptions of the effectiveness of this method was investigated. The results showed that the students had positive opinions about this method in the classrooms with hybrid learning. Furthermore, students' perceptions on the learning environment can be defined favorably. Learners could only physically join courses for 4 weeks because of the COVID-19 outbreak. The remaining classes has been taken online. Some learners said they experienced loneliness as a result. Moreover, there is a statistically significant difference in the participants' perceptions by gender. However, the findings showed that there was no significant difference in the perceptions of the participants depending on how many hybrid courses they had taken before.",

Play is an every thing for children through which they experience the world. A child playing is practicing minds-on, hearts-on and hands-on activities. This study was aimed at the exploration of play-based instruction at Hawassa College of Teacher Education in Ethiopia. It followed a qualitative research design; phenomenological approach in which reality is viewed in constructivist o/interpretivist paradigm. Total participants of the study were 8 involving 2 teacher educators and 6 prospective teachers from early childhood care and education department. All participants were selected purposively. Document analysis, FDG and interview were the main data gathering tools. Data was analyzed thematically through transcription of interviews and FGDs in to meaningful statements. Findings of the study reveal that play-based instruction implementation in the study area is poor. TLM developed for the program was not suitable for it. Teacher educators' perception about the practice is not constructive. Trainees are trained in a very similar way to primary school trainees. Therefore; the researcher strongly suggests that early childhood teacher training needs to be revised so as to incorporate play-based pedagogy. Again, teacher educators require trainings. Lastly, colleges of teacher education should establish playgrounds, resource rooms and model ECCE classes so as to promote the training program.",

        "description":"Socio-emotional constructs have been receiving increased attention as contributors to children's literacy development. However, in comparison to positive socio-emotional constructs, negative socio-emotional constructs have been understudied with respect to their role in reading achievement in both dual language learners (DLLs) and English speakers (ESs). The present study addressed this gap by examining reading anxiety in 339 DLLs, who primarily spoke Spanish as their first language, and 178 ESs in Grades 3-5 using a latent variable approach. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to form latent variables for reading anxiety, reading engagement, and reading achievement, compare latent variable means for DLLs and ESs, and examine relations among the three focal constructs across the two language groups. The DLLs and ESs showed similar levels of reading anxiety and reading engagement, although the ESs showed stronger reading achievement. Further, for both DLLs and ESs, reading anxiety related negatively to reading achievement, both directly and indirectly through reading engagement, controlling for grade level. However, both the direct and indirect effects were greater for DLLs than ESs. In the discussion, we interpret these results in the context of theoretical views of the potential mechanisms linking reading anxiety and achievement, giving attention especially to the multidimensional nature of reading engagement and the possible role of stereotype threat. Based on the current findings and other recent research, we conclude by contending that reading anxiety merits increased scrutiny by researchers and educators endeavoring to understand and strengthen children's reading achievement.

By this geometrical drawing their eyes will be taught to seize the shape of an object and their hand to delineate it with accuracy; the mere painting of alphabetical characters, which is commonly styled penmanship and considered as a necessary accomplishment, instead of being a difficult labor, would then be only an amusement for children.

However, the SVR has been challenged, and evidence has proved it to be too simple to explain the complexities of reading comprehension in the elementary school years. Hypotheses have been advanced that there are cognitive-linguistic factors that underlie the common variance between D and LC, which are malleable, although there is no clarity at this point regarding what these are. We propose that one such group of malleable cognitive factors is executive function (EF) skills. Further, we posit that EF skills play equally strong roles in explaining reading comprehension variance in emergent bilinguals (EBs) and English monolinguals (EMs). We used multigroup structural equation modeling to determine the contribution of these constructs (D, LC, and EF) to reading comprehension in 425 EBs and 302 EMs in Grades 2 through 4. The shared variance between D and LC was explained by direct and indirect effects in the models tested, with strong indirect effects for the EFs of cognitive flexibility and working memory through D and LC, respectively, for both language groups. The indirect effect of cognitive flexibility though LC on reading comprehension was considerably larger for EBs than for EMs. Considerations for a more nuanced view of the SVR and its implications for practice are discussed.

It deals, in the main, with what is familiar to the child. An attempt has been made, in a few instances, to enable the children to construct pictures of scenes in unknown lands; but here most of the ideas needed by them are those gained in their own experience at home. Some lessons will suggest lines of work for the teacher with the children, which, it is hoped, will prove helpful. The words most needing drill in pronunciation and assistance in understanding, are printed at the beginning of the lessons. These will serve at once as the basis of special instruction by the teacher, and drill in pronunciation and spelling by the pupils. [For Book III, see ED623723.]",

This meta-analysis presents evidence on the effects of Tier 1 reading instruction on the reading outcomes of students in Grades 4-12, and a synthesis of effects for students identified as struggling readers. Results from this meta-analysis of 37 publications conducted between 2000 and 2015 reveal significant, positive effects for Tier 1 reading instruction on comprehension and vocabulary outcomes. A synthesis of the results for struggling readers indicates that they maintained or improved reading comprehension over struggling readers receiving typical instruction.

In this paper, we focus on teacher views of the role of parents in these efforts gathered through two questionnaires administered from 2020 to 2021. Twenty-five Grade 4-7 mathematics teachers from schools in the Eastern Cape province took part in the study. We address the question: What were teacher perspectives on the role of parents in the continuation of mathematics teaching and learning during COVID-19 and the gradual reopening of schools? We explore the teacher responses and show how the pandemic context provided a stimulus to forge stronger teacher-parent relationships and opened opportunities for productive ways of extending mathematics learning almost exclusively undertaken in the classroom into homes.",

The control group received face-to-face in-class reading practice; whereas the experimental group received synchronous online practice using Eluminate Live, a web-conferencing software associated with Blackboard LMS. Elluminate has virtual rooms or vSpaces where virtual classes and meetings can be held. Elluminate Live communication tools include integrated Voice over IP and teleconferencing, public and private chat, quizzing and polling, emoticons, a webcam tool, a whiteboard for uploading presentations for viewing by class, a recording feature, a graphing tool, breakout rooms for group work, and a timer. In the present study, Elluminate was used as supplement in in-class instruction to provide students with extra reading practice from home. The present study aims to describe the following: (i) steps followed in preparing for and conducting synchronous reading web-conferences between EFL students and instructors using Elluminate Live; (ii) technical requirements of synchronous reading web-conferences using Elluminate; (iii) technical difficulties of synchronous web-conferences using Elluminate; (iv) the effects of using Elluminate live reading practice sessions on students' achievement; (v) participants' views of the benefits and shortcomings of synchronous reading web-conferences using Elluminate; (v) recommendations for conducting effective synchronous reading web-conferences using Elluminate. Results of the posttest showed significant differences between the experimental and control groups in reading skill development, in favor of the Eluminate reading practice sessions. Students who participated in those reading practice sessions developed positive attitudes towards web-conferencing and reading practice as well.",

Continued work on reducing these gaps benefits from an understanding of students' reading and math growth from typical school instruction and how growth differs based on initial proficiency, grade, and demographic characteristics. Data from 5,900 students in Grades 1--5 tested in math and reading at six points across two years were analyzed using cohort-sequential latent growth curve models to determine longitudinal growth patterns. Results indicated that students with low initial proficiency grew more quickly than students with higher proficiency. However, after two school years their achievement remained below average and well below that of students with higher initial proficiency. Demographic characteristics had small but significant effects on initial score and growth rates.

In fiscal year 2021, nearly $13 billion was appropriated for capital projects at public institutions, representing 11.6% of the total state contribution to higher education. When compared to general operating support and state financial aid programs, there is very little information on public capital appropriations. In an effort to fulfill this data need, SHEEO has started collecting information on total capital appropriations as part of the annual State Higher Education Finance (SHEF) data collection. This issue brief highlights the mandatory and optional data elements that SHEEO is now collecting annually and provides an initial snapshot of the first two years of data. The data show that capital appropriations tend to be more volatile than the rest of state support, to which they are only loosely correlated. These data also show that states use capital appropriations to fund a variety of projects and that these uses change based on the projects funded each year.",

The final section in each SHEF report has focused on the effort and capacity of states to fund higher education. While this information provides valuable state comparisons, publicly available data from the federal government are needed to calculate the state effort and capacity metrics. The federal data lag the SHEF report data by one or two years, making the state effort and capacity section somewhat detached from the rest of the report, as the reporting years have not matched. With the SHEF report's overall expansion for fiscal year 2020, SHEEO has decided to turn the state effort and capacity section into a new, separate report. The State Effort and Capacity to Fund Higher Education report will continue to report the same capacity and effort metrics that were in the SHEF report and should look familiar to long-time SHEF readers.

A detailed analysis of the templates that statewide boards require institutions to use during the program approval and review processes reveals the role these processes play in ensuring academic quality and ensuring that state resources are used wisely. Because most statewide boards are involved in academic program approval and review processes, the boards should take steps to continue to improve their processes. Specifically, statewide boards should ensure that templates exist for both processes and make the templates publicly available to provide transparency. Students often attend an institution to enroll in a specific program, and those programs have a tremendous impact on the likelihood that an individual student will successfully earn a credential. Therefore, individual programs play a key role in diversifying our colleges and universities and addressing existing equity gaps. However, many programs have serious equity gaps by race/ethnicity and gender. Therefore, individual programs ought to have articulated plans for attracting, enrolling, and graduating underrepresented students and other minoritized student populations.",

However, most of these studies have focused on one embodied mode and one piece of content, and many have been laboratory studies with limited ecological validity. Though less numerous, educational studies in classroom settings have confirmed the potential of particular haptic-mode strategies to improve learning outcomes.

To address this need, this study was a two-pronged approach to examine the use of evaluation data for improvement within the Chicago Public Schools (CPS). The first is an evaluation-specific approach that looked explicitly at teachers' instructional improvement efforts across the district that were prompted by Recognizing Educators Advancing Chicago's (REACH) Students. The second is a comprehensive approach that looked more broadly at how teachers' instructional improvement efforts were prompted by both: (1) their school's unique Instructional Improvement Support System (IISS); and (2) their school's implementation of REACH--and the dynamics between IISS and REACH-driven efforts. Together, this two-pronged approach allowed the author to identify common organizational conditions and sources of support for evaluation data use across school contexts while also surfacing the variability in how schools support teacher learning generally.

The three authors, guided by the theoretical framing of realistic mathematics education, engaged in a task design process over a 12-month period to develop integrated resources. Data were collected in the form of Zoom meeting recordings, among other sources. This paper describes some key findings from a narrative analysis of this process. We posit that the contribution is twofold--methodological insight of a task design journey and findings around the obstacles and resolutions of aligning representations across mathematics and music, despite the obvious confluence.",

Continuous improvement includes distinct repeating processes: understanding the problem, identifying specific targets for improvement, determining the change to introduce, implementing the change, and evaluating if and how the change led to improvements. This toolkit is intended for a team of educators who have already identified specific student learning needs and strategies to improve instruction to address those needs and are ready to test these strategies using continuous improvement processes. The toolkit aims to help the team with the final step in the cycle, which includes collecting data to measure implementation of changes and intended outcomes and using those data to inform future action. Measures for continuous improvement should be closely aligned to student learning goals and implementation of instructional strategies driving the continuous improvement effort, and they should be practical to use in a classroom setting. A team of educators can use this toolkit to proceed through a series of steps to identify what to measure, consider existing instruments, draft instruments, evaluate and refine instruments, plan data collection routines, and plan for data discussions to interpret the data and inform action. Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Southwest developed the resources in the toolkit in partnership with the Oklahoma State Department of Education team working with the Oklahoma Excel NICs.",

The five levels will be matched against the eight zones identified in the RMFII study supported by its Rasch analysis. We identify two shifts where students' capacity to generalise appear difficult to navigate. The first being where students move from noticing and describing regularities to formalising these regularities into verbal or symbolic expressions. The second is where students use their understanding of equivalence based on relational thinking to write and recognise equivalent algebraic expressions.",

The analysis is based on in-depth interviews with employers (n=38) in firms and organizations across a range of sectors who supervise and coordinate the work of college student interns from two public universities and two technical colleges located in different economic regions within the same U.S. Midwestern state. Using the anthropological theory of value (Graeber, 2001), we develop an analysis of how employers use discourse to ideologize and coordinate internship labor. Employers use three discourses of value to ideologize 1) the individual intern as the primary beneficiary of the internship (&quot;entrepreneurial discourse of value&quot;); 2) the organization or firm as the primary beneficiary of the internship (&quot;corporate efficiency discourse of value&quot;); and 3) the community, industry, or society in general as the primary beneficiary of the internship (&quot;community service discourse of value&quot;).

Both federal chambers have passed a bill purportedly aimed at elevating the competitiveness of the United States. The United States House of Representatives passed the America COMPETES Act on February 4, 2022, that now must be reconciled with the bill's Senate counterpart, the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 that passed on June 8, 2021. There is perhaps no greater priority facing the nation than to preserve its innovative edge upon which its prosperity and security depends. Playing defense is insufficient. The final bill has the potential to put America on offense. Each bill includes a mixture of provisions not directly relevant to advancing America's competitiveness that are beyond the scope of this paper. They both include provisions vital to bolstering American innovation and sadly other provisions anathema to competitiveness. As the conference committee convenes it should retain those elements that will truly help American innovation stay a step ahead and steer clear of provisions harmful to competitiveness. This paper seeks to state the case for action within the construct of a historical framework for elevating national innovation. It will identify categories of provisions to retain, perhaps even bolster and some provisions to jettison in the conference report for a competitiveness bill.",

        "description":"June 23, 2022 marks the 50th anniversary of the passage of Title IX. This federal civil rights law has been credited with profoundly changing education in the United States by barring sex discrimination in the nation's schools. Title IX, along with other equity laws, helped to unlock access to educational and athletic opportunities, paving the way for inroads into historically male-dominated professions. The work of five decades of Title IX's impact is writ large in every sector of American society. This report is grounded in the rich history of Title IX and takes a multi-dimensional look at its impact. The report is based on a rigorous literature review and original research using publicly available data sets. The focus is primarily on the enforcement of Title IX in athletics and the three major areas that should be reviewed in ongoing and regular Title IX audits: athletic participation opportunities, allocation of athletic scholarship funding, and allocation of resources in operational areas. The report examines Title IX through the lens of intersectionality, explores emerging issues, and looks ahead to what is needed to accelerate the pace of change for the next 50 years.",

What do they value, what do they need to know, and what information have they seen? Ruffalo Noel Levitz (RNL), Mongoose, Modern Campus, and PLEXUSS surveyed more than 1,000 high school students (9th-12th grade) to uncover their expectations, experiences, and preferences during the college search process. This report provides responses on topics such as: (1) When students start their college search and planning; (2) What prospective students want out of their college experiences; (3) Their plans and attitudes about college entrance exams; (4) How far they are willing to travel to attend college; and (5) The information and influencers students value most.

Teacher questioning data were analysed for question type (probing, factual, guiding) and further analysed against the conceptualized critical mathematical thinking framework for young students. Findings indicated that when teachers used clarifying, noting relationships, and offering opinions style probing questions, young students were supported to interpret and explain their critical mathematical thinking.",

In this paper I consider how teachers may exercise agency and professionalism in the context of online mathematics instruction. Whilst there is some evidence for the reduction of the teacher role, there is also considerable space for teachers to enact professional identities as teachers of mathematics. However, I suggest that care needs to be taken to ensure that there is a balance to the overall mathematics programme, including opportunity for teachers to make their own decisions and assessments regarding students' learning.",

        "description":"This paper reports on the potential for engaging students in an activity that considers the interconnectedness of the five Big Ideas of Statistics in the context of conducting random trials. In the study, two classes of Year 6 students (aged 11-12 years) used &quot;TinkerPlots&quot; to determine the sample space of a &quot;Mystery Spinner.&quot; Analysed for this paper were data collected from entries made in completed workbooks while engaged in the learning activity and responses to relevant questions in an end-of-year questionnaire from 27 students. The results indicated using an activity that included a probability model contributed to students working mathematically with percentages and frequencies and supported the development of intuitions about randomness and informal inference. This was promoted by students analysing the variation in the distribution of data and describing their expectations about an unknown sample space.",

Inquiry as a pedagogy has potential for supporting student development of statistical literacy as the investigation process is driven by the inquiry question. The aim of this paper is to gain insight into how a teacher's communication processes with her students supported their emerging understandings about the abstract concept of data. In this exploratory case study, we present data from a Year 4 classroom (age 9) in a guided mathematical inquiry within the STEM context of agricultural science. The inquiry question the students addressed was, &quot;How big is a leaf?&quot; The inquiry focused on linking data to the real-life context the data represented.",

Valsiner's zone theory is used to analyse how their beliefs, institutional context and professional learning opportunities shape their identities as MTEs.

        "description":"With an urgent change of the learning approach from face-to-face to online learning in academic institutions due to the COVID 19, this medium's effectiveness is arguable, particularly in the case of practicalbased courses. This paper discusses our experience in handling photography course during this pandemic time using an online simulator and proposes an interactive VR-based camera simulator to learn photography course using online platform. Photography has been selected as the main course based on the actual learning experience at the Applied Media Department, Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT), Men's Campus Abu Dhabi, UAE. We explore 10 online digital camera simulators and present an analysis of these applications' features, usability, and interactivity. Then, one chosen simulator is implemented to teach a 15 weeks photography course through a digital platform, and the feedbacks from students were collected and discussed. It is found that using a DSLR simulator allows students to explore and understand the concept of using a camera and photography. This paper presents the proof of concept for a DSLR simulator based on immersive environment and virtual reality, which is enhanced with interactive features that mimic the actual DSLR camera. Our proposal includes suggestions of missing features for the current simulators to overcome the course's physical and practical issues. [For the full proceedings, see ED623569.]",

One of the existing directions of the Kazakhstan government policy, which was initiated after gaining independence, was the process of attracting qandastar -- ethnic Kazakhs from abroad, and the enrollment of a large number of young people from this group in Kazakhstan universities through the provision of grants for a full course of study. This state strategy brought expectations that the young generation, who came to Kazakhstan for education will also affect the national identity and culture of the local community. However, the youth also associated certain plans with moving to their historical homeland. The purpose of our research is to find out how the expectations of qandastar students coincided with real self-realization in Kazakhstan. We conducted a series of interviews with people who have graduated from Kazakhstani universities in the past few years. [For the full proceedings, see ED623569.]",

Participants generally held &quot;knowledge-code&quot; (epistemic relations are foregrounded) or &quot;mixed-code&quot; (sometimes epistemic and sometimes social relations are foregrounded) perceptions. Further analysis showed that participants value both disciplinary knowledge and discipline-related practices such as analysing data and providing evidence-based discussions.

A qualitative case study was designed to examine the reflections of a teacher's pre-service and in-service teaching experiences. Data collection instruments included a timeline graphing tool and a semi-structured interview to capture and communicate her reflections. Findings reveal that providing structured resource materials within a professional learning project supported changes in pedagogical practice.",

Investigations include astronomy, ecology, chemistry, fast plant growth, force and motion, water use, heat and temperature, body height, light and microorganisms.

Arguments that make use of generic examples are both mathematically valid and accessible for even young learners. However, discerning whether students are viewing or using an example as a specific case, or a general case, is difficult. In this paper, we open the space between empirical and generic use of examples and establish categories of example-use regarding odd and even numbers.

The Introduction explains in simple language certain general conceptions too often ignored in the study of Grammar: the nature of language, its relation to thought and to style, the processes which affect its growth and decay, the province of grammar, and the relation of grammar to usage. Chapters II-LVIII deal primarily with the Parts of Speech and with their combination into sentences in the expression of thought. With Chapter LIX a more detailed study of inflection begins. This continues through Chapter CXV, and includes all the important phenomena of English inflection, which are explained, not as isolated facts, but as means of expressing varieties of human thought. Chapters CXVI-CXLIV provide a thorough and systematic review of the structure of complex sentences. The appendix contains a list of irregular verbs and other reference material.",

The project gathered a range of data from teachers and leaders on their dispositions and knowledge, as well as the opportunities and constraints they experienced, and the influence these variables had on planning, teaching and student learning outcomes.",

Good teaching practices evolve from telling to listening in order to understand the needs of the student. In this paper, lesson study, a form of teacher professional development, is used as a contextual platform for developing the practice of listening pedagogy. The findings suggest that lesson study provided a conducive and favourable context for the learning of listening pedagogy.

The participants were 209 students in Grades 2-4, including both DLLs and English Monolinguals (EMs) with and without S-RCD. Mean comparisons indicated that DLLs and EMs with S-RCD showed weaknesses relative to typically developing (TD) readers in oral language, word identification, inference making, and reading engagement, but not in executive functioning. Longitudinal analyses indicated that across two academic years S-RCD persisted for 41% of DLLs and EMs alike. Altogether, the study extends research on DLLs with S-RCD by identifying variables beyond oral language that may account for their difficulties and providing insight into the extent to which their reading comprehension and word identification performance levels evolve during elementary school. Further, the findings point to the importance of early identification and intervention for weaknesses in reading comprehension and its component elements in both DLLs and EMS.

        "description":"Employment is one of the most significant markers of independence and success for a person. One's ability to secure and maintain employment in a paid position can have a significant impact on their overall quality of life, community participation, financial self-sufficiency, and pathway to a long-lasting career. Unfortunately, the paid employment rate for youth and adults with a disability remains markedly lower than their peers without a disability. Our understanding of national employment trends and outcomes for youth with disabilities has been heavily informed by the National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) and NLTS2, with data gathered in 1987-1991 and 2001-2009 respectively. The National Longitudinal Transition Study 2012 (NLTS 2012) dataset offers an updated look at employment of youth in 7th-12th grade with data gathered in 2012-2013. Using the NLTS 2012 data, we examined employment in the past 12 months of youth with intellectual disability (ID) and autism (collectively referred to here as ID/A) compared to other populations of youth with and without disabilities.",

        "description":"This brief highlights lessons from the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) Centers of Excellence model, which has redesigned each of the system's seven campuses as a &quot;college-to-career center&quot; and consolidated academic programs in high-demand industries at particular campuses. The model incorporates features of sectoral training programs, which prepare people for quality jobs in specific industries and occupational clusters--sectors of the labor market--where there is strong local demand and the opportunity for career advancement. Evidence from studies of similar sector-focused training models outside of the community college setting suggests that the Centers of Excellence model could be a promising one for other large community colleges systems to emulate, and that it could even have important lessons for smaller systems and stand-alone community colleges. In a system in which each college focuses on a single sector or cluster of related sectors, colleges can be more responsive to employers, become the central point of contact for employers in a given sector, and, in the process, help ensure that students will obtain the skills and education that employers need and that will lead to good jobs with opportunities for career growth. This brief presents lessons from semistructured interviews conducted in 2021 with CCC faculty and staff members, employers, and community partners at two of the seven colleges in the system: Harry S Truman College and Richard J. Daley College. CCC administrators recommended that researchers focus on these two colleges because they represent two variations of the model: one Center of Excellence focus that is capital-intensive and one that is not. These qualitative research data were analyzed systematically to address the following primary research questions: (1) In what ways does the Centers of Excellence model help colleges deepen their knowledge of an industry and its needs??How, if at all, does the model facilitate connections with employers, industry associations, and public workforce agencies or help develop work-based learning opportunities for students; (2) How is the Centers of Excellence model put into operation in colleges??In what ways does it inform the development of career trajectories, services, and other forms of support provided to students in specific industries? and (3) What are the strengths of the Centers of Excellence model and what aspects could be further strengthened? What lessons does the Centers of Excellence model offer for other colleges and systems?",

Despite this, there is limited contextual research about how to prepare in-service teachers for such roles, and the organising structures needed to facilitate their progress. This paper describes background and emerging insights from a project offering sustained and supported learning experiences for in-service teachers to become primary mathematics specialist teachers in and across their school. Curriculum and contextual experiences designed around a theoretical framework of leadership development implemented over 2 years are described. Early insights include the &quot;priming&quot; influence of an extended focus on mathematical content and pedagogical knowledge on participants' confidence to lead others, and the benefits of being explicit about enabling structures that promote sustainable growth and change.",

Yet, there is little empirical evidence documenting the extent that this may be true and whether people from all racial and ethnic, and language backgrounds are benefitting equally. We provide a rare glimpse of this by reporting the patterns of economic mobility for Washington residents who received need-based financial aid and graduated with an associate or bachelor's degree from a public postsecondary institution in Washington. To provide insights, we match wage records from Washington's Unemployment Insurance program with financial aid records that report parental family income. The matching of data allows us to directly compare the annual wages of adult children in the third year after postsecondary graduation to their parents' family income. The findings from our descriptive analysis are promising and show that need-based aid and postsecondary degrees offer a path towards economic mobility for Washingtonians.",

Two groups of freshman students majoring in translation participated in the study. Before instruction, pretest results showed no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in their reading and writing skills in EFL (English as a foreign language). Both groups received traditional in-class instruction that depended on the textbook, completed the same chapters, did the same exercises and took the same quizzes. In addition, the experimental group received online instruction using RCampus (www.rcampus.com), an open source Online Course Management System. RCampus has as a discussion forum, ePortfolio for each student, i-Rubrics, course documents, a message center and other tools. The experimental group received online reading and writing extension activities. Each week discussion threads that required the students to search for information, read extra material and respond to questions in writing were posted. The students were free to post their own book summaries, discussion threads and comment on each other's posts. The instructor served as a facilitator. She provided feedback and individual help. At the end of the semester both groups were post-tested and their scores compared to find out the effect of using a combination of online reading and writing activities using RCampus on the students' reading and writing skills development. The students answered a post-treatment questionnaire to find out how they felt about RCampus and their online learning experience. Results will be reported in detail.",

        "description":"COVID-19 is a deadly pandemic that caused many colleges and universities to send students home and move courses online or to a hybrid of online and in-person learning. This qualitative study provides research on the impact of COVID-19 on the motivators and barriers of first- generation college students (FGCS). The study used a sample of FGCS enrolled in college in Fall 2021 from two private, four-year institutions in Washington, DC. The results of this study indicate that COVID-19 impacted the challenges and obstacles FGCS face in enrolling in college and staying in college. Family and financial aid were the factors that most influenced students' desire to attend college and stay enrolled. Students identified family as both a motivator and a stressor. Students indicated they need additional support transitioning to college. These students faced social and academic pressures when they returned to in-person learning and preferred learning online. These findings suggest that higher education institutions need to understand what barriers and motivators these students faced during the pandemic to make informed changes to eliminate or lessen these barriers and increase the motivation for those students to attend college. Improving communication and interaction with families, expanding financial aid, creating additional resources specific to FGCS, and fostering inclusion and building a sense of community in the classroom will help these students stay in school and graduate.",

Revealing the relationship between the variables in the home environment and the self-regulation skills of children can be a guide for families. In addition, it is thought that it will contribute to the literature by considering self-regulation skills in terms of different factors related to the home environment. It is aimed to examine the self-regulation skills of preschoolers in terms of various variables related to the home environment. Method: Relational screening model was used. The study group consists of 218 children from the 5-6 age group attending kindergarten in Ankara in the 2021-2022 academic year. In the study, &quot;General Information Form&quot; and &quot;Self-Regulation Skills Scale for 4-6 Years Old Children (Mother Form)&quot; were used. The ANOVA test was used to determine whether there was a relationship between variables related to the home environment and self-regulation skills. Findings of the Study: It was seen that the duration of children's play with family members, the type of games they played with family members the most, the time spent with technological devices, the daily book reading time of parents to the child, the number of books in the children's home were related to self-regulation skills. It was found that the self-regulation levels of the children did not constitute a significant difference according to the time spent outdoors. Research Results and Recommendations: It was seen that the variables related to the home environment were related to self-regulation skills. Families may be guided to create a home environment that will support their self-regulation skills. With the early age of preschool schooling, the negativities that may arise from the home environment can be prevented.

They considered the context of their schools, what was important, and what they valued in mathematics. Leaders thought about the tasks and pedagogies teachers select and the impact teachers' choices have on students' learning. Most of all, leaders reflected on ways that they could act to inspire changes that would lead to improved mathematical outcomes for students.

A principal component analysis (PCA) extracted four factors: deep affect (positivity expressed towards geometry learning), working privately, collaborative working and technology or calculator use. The final GDS contained 15 items. While validation is still not fully tested, the psychometric properties to-date suggest the GDS has promising benefits in measuring PSTs' attitudes to geometry learning, which may enable the adjustment of the teaching of geometry accordingly.",

Data were collected through a survey and semi structured interviews with the subject teachers. The study found that procedural flowcharts can foster a classroom environment that stimulates procedural fluency and student-centred teaching and learning of mathematics.

        "description":"Pioneer Valley Books (PVB) contracted McREL International to investigate the effects of the third grade Literacy Footprints (LFP) guided reading system on English language arts (ELA) performance on state assessments. LFP is a research-based, comprehensive, small-group literacy tool that facilitates explicit and systematic guided reading instruction to students in grades K-6. McREL researchers conducted a matched pair cluster randomized control trial to investigate LFP's possible effects on student achievement. The trial, conducted during the 2021/22 school year, included a sample of 3,071 students in 29 public elementary schools in a large suburban Florida school district. The district purchased LFP kits for grade 3 teachers in 14 elementary schools (SY2021/22) that were randomly assigned to the treatment group. Treatment teachers also obtained access to the Digital Reader and received virtual training and follow-up support to implement materials with students. Business-as-usual (BAU) instruction occurred at 15 schools (the control group). After the trial was completed, control group schools received the kits in the 2022/23 school year with access to the Digital Reader. Using a design-based estimator that accounts for both school-level clustering and school-matched pairs, the study found a statistically significant difference in the average English language arts standardized tests scores between treatment and control groups. By the end of the study, the treatment group students on average earned a 4.31-point higher scale score than the control group students. Results showed that, despite implementation challenges and limitations, students who received the treatment outperformed their control group peers on the Florida Statewide Assessment in English language arts. However, although statistically significant, the effect size (Hedges' g = 0.19) is small. This study showed promising evidence for the LFP guided reading system. Further research is needed to examine the generalizability of these results across different school districts and contexts and under more favorable conditions (e.g., without frequent COVID disruptions).

This book is an attempt to bring the subject of language home to children at the age when knowledge is acquired in an objective way, by practice and habit, rather than by the study of rules and definitions. In pursuance of this plan, the traditional presentation of grammar in a bristling array of classifications, nomenclatures, and paradigms has been wholly discarded. The pupil is brought in contact with the living language itself and made to deal with speech, to turn it over in a variety of ways, to handle sentences; so that the pupil is not kept back from the exercise -- so profitable and interesting -- of using language till the pupil has mastered the anatomy of the grammarian.",

        "description":"Can an academic institution be truly free if it relies on government funding? Federal dollars mean federal mandates, and those mandates grow increasingly draconian. More and more, they stifle debate on open questions, demand denial of verifiable scientific truths, eliminate due process for students accused of misdeeds by other students, or insist on unequal treatment for different groups in ways that corrupt the academic mission. Yet, it is still possible for academic institutions to remain free of government mandates by rejecting federal funding. The Martin Center located 19 such schools successfully operating in the United States, and tried to find out what they are doing, how they are doing it, and why they are good for the intellectual life of the nation. The ability of independent schools to function outside the boundaries of the federal government efficiently and effectively--offering lower tuition than most other private schools while holding high academic standards--suggests that federal funding is hardly necessary. And it poses a further question: does federal funding hinder education rather than improving it?",

One young lady, and the quartet of young men from 15- to 18-years old who have called themselves the &quot;Big Four,&quot; are students. They attend to regular studies a portion of the time, especially when the ship and her little consort are at sea; and when the party are engaged in sightseeing, which forms most of their occupation in this book, they are still students, and the commander takes the greatest pains to have them well instructed. All the excursionists are students in a less technical sense, and all of them are employed, not only in gratifying their curiosity, but also in acquiring knowledge. Through lectures and conversation the history of Egypt, ancient and modern, is brought out to a considerable degree, as well as the geography, resources, and religion of the country.",

Underpinning our approach is the South African construct of Ubuntu, which is very much about collaboration--I am because we are--so that there is a move away from doing research &quot;on&quot; participants and contexts to one which is very much about doing research &quot;with&quot; participants and contexts.

        "description":"This study aimed at exploring students' engagement, difficulties, and meaningful learning experiences in Biology class relative to the use of the intervention material developed--the digitized concept stories. Students' engagement towards learning Biology and difficulties experienced in class were revealed through in-depth interviews with 20 Grade 7 students. The digitized concept stories were structured based on the results covering the five (5) main topics in Biology 7 and Most Essential Learning Competencies (MELCs) identified by the Department of Education (DepEd). After the utilization of the intervention material, the same respondents were again interviewed to encapsulate their meaningful learning experiences while using the intervention. Meanwhile, to evaluate the qualities of the digitized concept stories, the researcher administered the acceptability survey questionnaire to 22 Science 7 teachers at the selected secondary schools in the 2nd Congressional District of the Quezon Province Schools Division Office. It was found out that digitized concept stories serve as a learning aid in Biology 7 because it makes the lesson easier to understand, help increase retention rate, provide additional knowledge, and clear explanation, and allows recognition of importance of the lessons delivered. It engaged the students by providing learning enjoyment and increasing their motivation and interest. It is appropriate in distance learning for Grade 7 students and can also be used for other topics in sciences and other disciplines. It was also found that the developed materials are acceptable for teachers as they gave favorable evaluation on its qualities. Hence, the validated digitized concepts stories are ready for utilization in Biology classes. It was then recommended that the developed intervention material may be used in an experimental study to further test its ability in improving students' academic performance.",

Among a great number of PMs encountered in daily conversations, I think is one of the most prevalent PMs in native speaker and non-native speaker discourse. Thus, the purpose of this study was to unravel and compare the overall uses and functions of I think among Turkish learners of English and native speakers of British English. Adopting corpus-driven approach to explore the use of I think in both groups, the uses of the marker were classified depending on their functions that were designated through integrated reading of the data by using Wordsmith Tools 6.0. According to the results, the functions of I think were categorized under the domains of shield, booster, structural, evaluative and interactional. Log likelihood statistics was administrated to figure out whether the difference across the groups was statistical in their use of I think with regard to frequency and functional variety. The results revealed that there was not a statistical difference between the groups regarding the overall uses of the marker. However, differences in the functional distributions of I think across the groups were observed.",

In this study, underserved youth refers to adolescents who experience inequitable access to educational resources. Purposeful sampling was used to select 84 focus group participants including educators and high school students (9-12th grade). Utilizing grounded theory analysis, focus group data revealed findings in three key categories. First, participants defined readiness as specific career knowledge and skills to develop concrete actionable post-school plans. Second, perceived barriers such as limited availability of career preparation experiences and challenging life circumstances combined to deter youth from fully realizing their college and career potential. Third, providing a broad array of career related learning activities, coupled with the presence of trusted adults who serve as mentors and guides, can create capacity for young people to expand career options and postsecondary opportunities.

As a result, ELLs may not only need math support but also reading and linguistic support. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a math comprehension strategy called Dynamic Strategic Math (DSM) on word problem solving for Latino ELLs. The strategy provides performance-contingent feedback based on the student's reading and language comprehension level. A multiple baseline design was used to assess 6 second-grade Latino ELLs at risk for math failure/math disability. As compared with the baseline phase, DSM increased word problem solving for all the participants. All students' level of performance was maintained during follow-up sessions. The results suggest the intervention facilitated math problem-solving performance.

        "author":["Hill, Paul T.",
          "Jochim, Ashley"],
        "description":"Public education depends on expertise, work, money, and cooperation from multiple actors who have different interests and beliefs. These lead to competition and negotiation--in other words, politics. Failure to consider the politics of reform implementation and sustainability has doomed many promising K-12 school improvement initiatives. This paper analyzes more than 10 years of data on the implementation of the portfolio strategy to identify practical lessons on managing the politics of reform K-12 schools. Sustaining complex reforms like the portfolio strategy in a political environment requires leaders to: (1) Continually seek new supporters and renew the support of existing ones; (2) Expect and prepare for attacks and be alert to the unnecessary harms caused by their own actions, which bolster opposition; (3) Develop information strategies that document intermediate results, alert leaders to emergent problems and actively counter hostile narratives; (4) Be attentive to competing agendas and political liabilities within their own alliances; and (5) Prepare for leadership succession so that reforms have a chance to last long enough to make a difference. These observations challenge the conventional wisdom that sustainable reforms can be built only upon the percolating up of good ideas and initiatives from below. Reform leaders are essential to knitting together fragile coalitions who may be motivated by different goals and aligning new programs and initiatives--and politically reinforcing them over time--so their benefits can accumulate.",

A careful progression has been preserved, thus leading the little learner forward, step by step, along an easy gradation, which, while it pleases, will at the same time instruct him in the use and meaning of language.

In &quot;The Young Reporter&quot; the author describes the adventures of a young printer boy with a taste for newspaper work, who became a reporter for one of the great New York dailies when he was only 18. His introduction to the office by taking in an important piece of news, his early experience there, his trials and temptations, his adventures among the convicts in Sing Sing, his exciting search for the stolen body of a millionaire, his voyage to Mexico and the West Indies, his experience with bookmakers, who consider a reporter a person to be bribed, are all described to the life. Every adventure through which Dick Sumner is taken is an actual adventure--something that has really happened. From his first visit to the Transport office until his successful production of &quot;The Through Sleeper,&quot; his experiences are as true to life as actual truth can make them.

This brief builds on other research to facilitate the implementation of an SLDN that would finally deliver accurate, complete, and timely data on enrollment, completion, and post-college outcomes while staunchly protecting student privacy. The findings in this brief align with a series of convenings that RTI and IHEP have hosted over the past two years with experts across the field of higher education to support the modernization of the nation's postsecondary data system.

Since many students were not physically required to be present on college campuses, one would expect a large shift in national enrollment and a disruption of the migration of high school students attending college in other states. However, newly released preliminary data from the National Center for Education Statistics reveal a different story of how the COVID-19 pandemic affected overall college student net migration patterns. This research brief details a review of trends over the past 20 years of overall national data on postsecondary student enrollment, net migration, and the impact of the pandemic.",

        "author":["Lee, Lung-Sheng"],
        "description":"The colleges and universities in Taiwan are confronted with the following two problems: (1) The average youth (aged 15-29) unemployment rate is more than double the overall unemployment rate; and (2) Mainly affected by the low birth rate, the admission and vacancy rates of colleges and universities have increased, and fierce competition exists among colleges and universities. This paper aims to answer the following two questions raised in Taiwan: (1) Does students' participation in the study opportunities created by university-industry cooperation really help the success rate of future employment? (2) In addition to cultivating cross-discipline talents, how can universities maintain their sustainable competitiveness? Based on a literature review and working experience, the author positively states that internship experience can improve students' employment rates, earnings, and job satisfaction after graduation. After that, several successful internship experiences and governmental promoting measures in Taiwan are mentioned. Four key success factors of internship are also described as follows: a clear structure, meaningful roles, paid internship, and a supportive environment. In terms of the second question, the author argues that the following measures should be taken: (1) Frequent inventory and analysis of the sources and quality distribution of students recruited by every academic unit; (2) Timely analysis of the resource allocation, financial revenue, and expenditure of academic units; (3) Appoint teachers based on expertise, and promote 360-degree feedback in the evaluation of teaching; (4) Strengthen the cultivation of STEM professionals; (5) Develop students' core foundations and transformative competencies; and (6) Appropriately manage world university rankings as needed.",

The new schools that opened were planned long before the pandemic. But even preexisting charter schools grew between 2020 and 2022, suggesting that more families opted into charter schools, possibly due to dissatisfaction with remote learning offerings in district schools. However, charter schools' rate of growth in 2021-22 has tapered slightly: two Center on Reinventing Public Education studies of Washington charter enrollment found that charter schools' growth outpaced that of their corresponding districts the first year of the pandemic but fell slightly short of their districts' growth in the second year. Heading into the 2022-23 school year, Washington charter schools are at a pivotal point in their development. Like all schools across the country, they must come up with new solutions to accelerate student learning, authentically engage families and communities, and provide a learning environment that heals and supports the well-being of both students and staff. This report offers some suggested courses of action for charter operators to harness opportunities in 2022-23.",

However a campus-climate survey published by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) in 2021 found that 5-in-6 college students have self-censored because of how they perceived other students, a professor, or the college administration would respond. Two-thirds of college students agreed that it was acceptable to shout down a campus speaker or to try to prevent them from speaking. FIRE reviewed the restrictions on free speech at 17 public or private colleges and universities in West Virginia and found 92 policies that restrict freedom of speech. This report reviews FIRE's ratings, gives examples of restrictive policies, and recommends ways to improve students' free speech rights.

        "description":"The study aimed to reveal the challenges experienced by the education students in using digital technologies with the end phase of developing an institutionalization plan. The utilization and integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the field is already critical to prepare the learners to be competent and skilled individuals for the 21st century's opportunities and challenges. However, various challenges and gaps arise because of the differences between and among the various stakeholders' preferences, capabilities, privileges, and affordances to digital technologies. It was even more intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic, where tertiary education institutes shifted to an online learning delivery modality. From the literature review, the researcher summarized the five factors that influenced the challenges of using digital technologies in education. Those are the availability and physical access to up-to-date devices and infrastructures; geographical location and community type; income, poverty, and socio-economic status; level of education and digital literacy skills of teachers; and motivation, engagement, and interest. These five (5) main factors have been the basis for crafting the interview questions administered to 20 second-year education students. Interview data were analyzed, and four themes emerged to generalize the challenges experienced by the students: (1) unavailability and physical inaccessibility to digital technologies; (2) poor internet connection relative to residence; (3) low socioeconomic status and inaccessibility to digital technologies; and (4) disengagement in using digital technologies. The four themes became the basis used in crafting the institutionalization plan.",

        "description":"School systems throughout the United States need collective healing. The COVID-19 pandemic sent a shock through the nation resulting in many families experiencing job loss, food insecurity, increased financial and emotional stress, and mental health issues for the first time, while exacerbating such issues for many other families who already experienced them. This practitioner brief is one in a series highlighting concrete ways that leaders can increase educational equity by building supportive learning environments that meet all students' social and emotional needs. The introductory brief to this series suggests that changes at three levels of the educational system are needed to promote students' social and emotional well-being: (1) the structural and policy level; (2) the level of educators' well-being and capabilities; and (3) the level of specific strategies that strengthen students' social and emotional well-being. This brief focuses on the first and second levels: how school districts can become healing spaces for all by reevaluating system-wide policies and structures and building educators' capabilities and supporting their well-being. It describes the experiences of three educational systems that are striving to address the adversity that affects their school communities. The brief begins by describing how adversity alters human development and learning and the opportunity schools have to mitigate those effects for students of all backgrounds. It then describes how these educational systems are recognizing the presence of chronic stress and trauma in their staff members and students, and in response adopting system-wide policies and practices that promote healing from harmful experiences.

        "description":"Drawing on the science of learning and human development, educational leaders are seeking ways to integrate approaches that develop the whole child, elevating the child's social and emotional development and well-being so they are considered as important as academic development. They are also increasingly aware that to address disparities in students' social and emotional well-being, they must also address inequitable experiences in schools that arise from school policies and structures and from students' interactions with the adults in the system. This practitioner brief is one in a series highlighting concrete ways that leaders can increase educational equity by building supportive learning environments that meet all students' social and emotional needs. MDRC and the Alliance for Excellent Education recently released a brief that describes state- and district-level initiatives to transform school districts into healing spaces for all by reevaluating system-wide policies and structures and by building educators' capabilities and supporting their well-being. This brief highlights how two educational systems engaged numerous stakeholders to develop &quot;healing-centered,&quot; &quot;trauma-engaged&quot; frameworks. This companion brief provides advice from leaders in the State of Alaska and Chicago Public Schools for other state and district leaders who may want to a develop a system-wide vision and its corresponding approach--a framework--that emphasizes collective healing and trauma-engaged practices.

The reasons for their anxiety varied; some were upset at the increasing politicization, others at rising costs, and so on. But it seemed as if there were no way to turn back the tide of higher education's degradation. That may be starting to change. Academia is moving into very extreme territory politically, promoting false, conjectural, and dogmatic theories such as critical race theory and indigenous science instead of long-accepted theories tested by proven methods. This extremism is heightening awareness among ordinary Americans about academia's alarming direction, and some are starting to get involved in campaigns to push back against the radical agenda. The James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal has been on the forefront of the struggle to end the abuse of our colleges and universities for several decades. Today, with increasing potential to attract new allies to its cause, it is providing this manual, titled &quot;Rules for Academic Reformers,&quot; to encourage those who are concerned about higher education's degraded state--particularly alumni, but also trustees, students, and other potential activists--to start a &quot;long march through the institutions of higher education&quot; of their own. And to offer suggestions about how to build a successful movement, how to deal with academic adversaries, and where to find allies.",

        "description":"Student attendance problems have numerous causes and serious consequences for student learning outcomes. Chronic absence (CA) is a critical indicator of these problems. Chronic absence is especially relevant today given that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused more students to be chronically absent. However, chronic absence is not a new feature for many schools and communities in large urban school districts. Large urban school districts have the opportunity to recognize in this continuing crisis a historic failure to learn how to support schools equitably. In this brief, the authors use available literature as well as collaborative research undertaken by the Center for Urban Education Leadership (CUEL) and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to address a set of questions relevant to CA. Although the authors draw on some of the research within CPS and write this in direct service to CPS, the authors view these findings as relevant to large urban school districts throughout the US. The questions that are investigates and addressed in this research brief are: (1) What does the research and practice literature tell us about chronic absence in terms of its root and proximal causes, consequences, and remedies?; (2) In what ways are these findings illuminated by collaborative research?; (3) What can schools do? That is, what kinds of systems and supports can schools put in place to support students who struggle with chronic absence?; and (4) What can large urban districts (CPS and other such districts) do? How can the district identify and prioritize supports for the schools who deal with populations most likely to struggle with chronic absence?",

Results indicate positive effects of both professional development and school ICT resources on ICT use in all three countries. The brief concludes with a discussion of recent policy efforts to promote the use of ICT through targeted investments in computer infrastructure and ICT-related teacher training.

We find that more boys than girls at grade 8 want to have a mathematics- or science-related job. Girls and boys who have high confidence in mathematics and science are significantly more likely to want to work in these fields than those with low confidence in mathematics. In addition, we find that boys want to pursue a job involving mathematics as adults significantly more than girls of the same achievement level. This increased likelihood for boys holds across both high- and low-achievement groups. In comparison, there are smaller or no gender differences in the likelihood of pursuing a science-related career depending on achievement levels.

Through their direct work with schools, especially the most vulnerable schools, these organizations straddle the larger ecosystem and the local schoolhouse, becoming a primary and proximal conduit of external leadership resources into schools. With this in mind, the authors examined a set of more mature non-system intermediary organizations that work directly with schools to generate important insights about their work in forging relationships within and gaining vital resources from these expansive and diffuse ecosystems. Examining the ecosystem from the vantage point of these organizations has potential for helping non-system intermediary organizations to better consider and gain access to the kinds of ecosystem relationships and resources that are likely to prove important to their work, to schools, and to students. It also sheds light on broader issues relevant for ecosystem-building efforts. [Foreword written by by James P. Spillane.

The inequities keep high quality educational opportunities beyond the reach of our country's Black, Latinx, Indigenous, immigrant, and the many ethnically and linguistically diverse students that comprise our population. To address the problems that stem from persistent educational inequity districts are increasingly hiring new administrators into roles called &quot;equity directors.&quot; The hiring of equity directors signals a new direction in how districts aim to confront persistent educational inequities. Although leadership for equity is not new, the role that equity directors play in advancing equity in K-12 districts is relatively uncharted. The authors outline some common ways the roles are designed and offer considerations that will help districts configure roles to best support the leaders that fill them.

Texas's six public universities that rank highest in the U.S. News and World Report 2022 rankings have been selected: The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), Texas A&amp;M University, The University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas), Texas Tech University, The University of Houston, and Sam Houston State University. The study finds that Texas's civics and history requirements have not been uniformly enforced. Some universities, especially those that are more highly ranked such as UT Austin and UT Dallas, take advantage of loopholes to undermine legislative intent. The second part of this report examines the rise of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) measures in these six Texas universities and shows how such measures have subjected Texas's higher education to bureaucratic growth and an increasing volume of explicitly politicized curricular and &quot;co-curricular&quot; content.",

The goal is to evaluate the health of American civics and history education at Utah's major public universities. The first section of this report examines the application of the .state's American Institutions requirement. The state requires every student who attends a public university to study American history and government--to understand America's &quot;history, principles, form of government, and economic system.&quot; Because of this law, many students in Utah are at least exposed to a conventional civics education, which lays the groundwork for our contentious political debates. That said, Utah's &quot;American Institutions&quot; requirement ultimately sets a low bar, mandating only one course that can easily veer from the intent of the requirement. The second section of this report shows the ways in which diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programming has taken hold throughout Utah's system of higher education, and how it has become a rival civics education--an anti-civics devoted to the transformation of the American republic.",

True to Chancellor Donde Plowman's vision, these colleges and units propose extensive and ideologically-charged reforms. The National Association of Scholars finds in these plans nothing short of a blueprint for an institutional overhaul--the anatomy of a diversity, equity, and inclusion takeover. Such a takeover will have obvious implications for education at the University of Tennessee. The National Association of Scholars believes that true education will erode and indoctrination will flourish. These plans, moreover, reveal in extensive detail what an exhaustive diversity, equity, and inclusion program looks like.

As Freire puts it, &quot;Leaders who do not act dialogically, but insist on imposing their decisions, do not organize the people--they manipulate them. They do not liberate, nor are liberated: they oppress.&quot; As literacy educators we should strive to work along with our students, to co-create with them, to learn from them. Freire reminds us that &quot;the (literacy) teacher is of course an artist...What the educator does in teaching is to make it possible for students to become themselves.&quot; Therefore, as literacy educators it is our duty to provide access and opportunities for students of all socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds as they navigate their way in our classrooms. All the articles within this Yearbook represent a portion of the sessions presented at the conference. After a peer-review process for conference acceptance, the ensuing articles underwent an additional two rounds of double-blind peer review before acceptance in the Yearbook.

Academic indicators include attaining proficiency on state achievement tests, grade point average, enrollment in advanced courses, and community service learning. Behavioral indicators include attendance, suspension, and expulsion. Using data on statewide grade 6 cohorts from 2008/09 and 2009/10, the study examined the percentages of students who attained the readiness and success indicators and the percentages of students who attained postsecondary readiness and success outcomes by gender, race/ethnicity, eligibility for the National School Lunch Program, English learner student status, disability status, age, and district locale. The study also examined whether the predictive accuracy, specificity, and strength of the indicators varied by these student groups. Three key findings emerged. First, the attainment of indicators of postsecondary readiness and success differed substantially for nearly all student groups, with the number of substantial differences on academic indicators exceeding those on behavioral indicators. The largest number of substantial differences in the attainment of academic indicators were between Black and White students, between students eligible and ineligible for the National School Lunch Program (an indicator of economic disadvantage), and between students who entered grade 6 before and after age 13. Second, attainment of postsecondary readiness and success outcomes varied substantially across student groups, with the largest differences between students with and without a disability. Third, predictive accuracy (the percentage of students with the same predicted and actual outcomes) and strength (the relative importance of a single indicator) were similar across student groups in most cases. Leaders at ADE and in Arkansas districts can use these findings to identify appropriate indicators of postsecondary readiness and success and to target supports toward student groups who most need them. These findings can help leaders identify and address disparities such as inequitable access to resources and supportive learning environments. [For the appendixes, see ED624015.]",

        "description":"Regional Educational Laboratory Southwest partnered with the Arkansas Department of Education to examine Arkansas's middle school and high school indicators of postsecondary readiness and success, building on an earlier study of these indicators (Hester et al., 2021). Academic indicators include attaining proficiency on state academic examinations, grade point average, enrollment in advanced courses, and community service learning. Behavioral indicators include attendance, suspension, and expulsion. Using data on statewide grade 6 cohorts from 2008/09 and 2009/10, the study examined the percentages of students who attained the readiness and success indicators and the percentages of students who attained postsecondary readiness and success outcomes by gender, race/ethnicity, eligibility for the National School Lunch Program, English learner student status, disability status, age, and district locale. The study also examined whether the predictive accuracy, specificity, and strength of the indicators varied by these student groups. This document presents the following three appendixes that accompany the study: (1) Data and Methods; (2) Supporting analyses; and (3) Supplemental analyses. [For the full report, see ED624014.]",

So also as regards classification: the groups of animals are arranged in an order that represents the latest knowledge of the various forms that constitute them. The general characteristics of each branch or order are plainly defined, why and how they differ from preceding ones shown, and then examples are given of the individuals constituting the group that have been selected for their availability as representative forms, and for certain peculiarities that will be most readily impressed upon the memory. The student should be encouraged to become an investigator and collector, and available suggestions concerning the best methods of collecting and preserving specimens are provided after each branch. Object-study should be required, and dissections and drawings made, no matter how imperfect the one or crude the other. A distinctive feature of this work is the reference to the economic value of animals. This has been done as briefly as possible, in the form of suggestions to the teacher, to be enlarged upon as occasion offers. A carefully selected bibliography is provided following each principal group of animals. Illustrative representations of about five hundred animals and their parts are also included.",

        "description":"Introduction: Various studies have associated boredom in educational processes with a variety of negative effects. It is believed that boredom is caused by a failure in the environment to fulfill our need for motivation. Many tools (scales) have been developed to measure it. However, these scales are designed to measure global boredom, that is, at the end of the process, not in its stages. The present study seeks to develop a methodology to evaluate the effect of boredom in the stages of a university class to have a tool for the quantitative evaluation of specific activities. Method: This study proposed a boredom measurement scale with a minimally disruptive intervention tool. The data obtained undergo mathematical processing to reduce the effect of subjectivity (perceived level of boredom) on the scale. The proposed methodology was applied to a group of students from the University of Costa Rica. Results: The most important result was the correlation between specific activities in a class and the gradient of boredom. Discussion: The reduction in the variability between students achieved with mathematical processing allows the proposed methodology to be used for the quantitative analysis of the stages of a class based on perceived boredom. This information can be used to design learning processes focused not only on the global process but on each stage of it, which, to the best of our knowledge, is not achieved by any of the commonly used scales.",

Objective: In the interest of gaining a historical understanding of the role of the Universidad Nacional, Costa Rica (UNA) in adult education in Costa Rica, this essay aims to analyze philosophical perspectives by drawing on relevant written documentation. Discussion: This institution is currently one of the five public universities in Costa Rica and has a robust student funding system. Under its &quot;necessary university&quot; principle, students with different economic and social statuses have access to high-quality post-secondary education. Having a clear educational philosophy is vital as it helps examine the educators' and the institution's practice critically. This essay gives a broader understanding of the philosophical perspectives behind the teaching and learning practices proposed by UNA's core guideline, the Pedagogical Model (PM). Conclusions: As final conclusions, it can be stated that this institution has lost its driving humanistic perspective, established in the first Organization Statute. In addition, on a sad note, Nuñez's founding philosophical orientation and goals for UNA are partially accomplished since even though there is an accessible education for all, teaching and learning practices do not guarantee any commitment to social action and social reform.",

The Next Gen Public Media initiative has observed growing interest across the public media ecosystem in developing tween- and teen-focused initiatives to develop new content, modes of engagement, and community-based programs. However, the investment of time and resources to meaningfully partner with youth can be significant, and organizations without prior experience may find it difficult to know where to start. Fortunately, the public media community is not alone in facing these challenges, and there is much to be learned from recent research and tool kits in adjacent fields. Drawing on best practices for youth participation from a wide range of academic resources, nonprofit organizations, and youth-focused government initiatives, this research brief points to evidence-based models to structure youth-adult collaborations.",

Furthermore, at 56.3%, Kentucky has one of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation. This depresses economic development, limits knowledge-economy job creation, curbs social and economic mobility and reduces enthusiasm for credential attainment beyond high school. To increase prosperity and well-being for our state and its people, the Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) and Kentucky's postsecondary community are resolved to increase postsecondary opportunities for undereducated adults in both the short and long term. Adult learners often face barriers to earning their degree or credentials such as full-time employment, parenthood, poor health and housing and food insecurity. The strategies presented in this report will help lower these barriers. The plan's strategies fall under three main headings: accessibility, institutional change and partnerships. They are further categorized as occurring now (in progress or within six months), next (to be undertaken over the next 12-18 months) and later (action steps needing further collaboration and refinement, occurring in the next two to three years). The report concludes with data analyses to determine a priority population for future action.",

How should a badge be designed to represent an incentive for a specific goal like optimal exam preparation? This study examines usage data of a higher education learning app to determine whether the used badges have the intended motivational effect. The preliminary results suggest that the badges that were initially implemented in the app have the intended effect in most cases, but the stages of the multi-level badges could be optimized. The methodological framework used in this study can be transferred to usage data of other similar learning tools. With the help of easy-to-interpret outputs of decision trees, researchers and practitioners alike can work towards an optimal badge design. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]",

Since many learning systems in use today adhere to these principles, an important component of such systems is the set of rules or algorithms that determine when a student has demonstrated mastery. A relevant issue when discussing mastery learning is its durability--in particular, we are interested in the relationship between different mastery learning thresholds and the forgetting of the learned material. As such, in this study we investigate this question using a large data set from the ALEKS adaptive learning system. Applying a quasi-experimental design, we find evidence that, while a higher mastery threshold is initially associated with a higher rate of knowledge retention, after several weeks this difference has largely disappeared.

However, as machine learning techniques for student competency modeling have increased in complexity, the need for substantial data to induce such models has likewise increased. This raises scalability concerns, as capturing game interaction data is often logistically challenging yet necessary for supervised learning of student competency models. The generalizability of such models also poses significant challenges, and the performance of these models when applied to new domains or gameplay scenarios often suffers. To address these issues, we introduce a zero-shot learning approach that utilizes conditional generative modeling to generalize stealth assessment models for new domains in which prior data and competency labels may not exist. We evaluate our approach using observed student interactions with a game-based learning environment for introductory genetics. We use a conditional generative model to map latent embeddings of genetics concepts and student competencies to student gameplay patterns, enabling the generation of synthetic gameplay data associated with concepts and game levels that have not been previously introduced. Results indicate the zero-shot learning approach enhances the performance of the competency models on unseen game levels and concepts, pointing to more generalizable stealth assessment models and improved prediction of student competencies.

        "description":"Dual enrollment allows high school students to take college courses and earn college credits that can provide a valuable head start toward a college degree. The practice has multiple benefits for students in both systems, improving college preparation and increasing efficiency toward completion of degrees and certificates. Many states--including California--have capitalized on these benefits by increasing high school student access to community college courses, though not all students have benefited equally. This brief builds on previous Wheelhouse research by providing a closer examination of dual enrollment growth in California. We present data about which students are participating in different types of dual enrollment in the California Community Colleges (CCC)--the primary provider of dual enrollment statewide. Matching the most recently available K-12 and CCC data, we also document how participation differs across high schools and course subjects pursued. There is cause in our findings for optimism, in that one type of dual enrollment--courses taught exclusively to high school students--is growing and appears to be increasing equity in participation. However, dual enrollment opportunities remain scarce or non-existent for many students and largely depend on the high schools they attend.

        "description":"Given the importance of a college degree for both individual and societal economic prosperity, policymakers and educators are focused on strengthening the path to college beyond college entry. In this report, we synthesize the existing literature on four factors key to educational attainment--aspirations and beliefs, academic preparation, knowledge and information, and fortitude and resilience--and the implications of each. (1) Aspirations and beliefs--the belief that college is possible and integral to educational success. By establishing strong college-going cultures, positive role models, and practices that extol and encourage a growth mindset, schools can promote college aspirations and college identity from an early age, an important precursor to cultivating self-efficacy; (2) Academic preparation--the skills one develops in order to engage with college- level work are dependent on a student's course of study. While students typically self-select into a course of study, many structural dimensions constrain this choice, resulting in persistence inequality in educational pathways. Current efforts have focused on addressing disparities in curricular offerings, particularly in college gateway courses, but more work is needed to address differences among schools in academic rigor and disparate access to advanced coursework within schools; (3) Knowledge and information--information is key to decision-making in the college-going process; however, students from low-income backgrounds and those who are the first in their families to attend college tend to have less access to quality information. To remedy this, information interventions have been particularly effective, but studies have also shown notable differences among schools in their efforts to guide students through the steps for collegiate access and success; and (4) Fortitude and resilience--an intrinsic set of social-emotional competencies and self-management skills necessary for individuals to engage more fully with academic content, navigate college and workplace processes, and persist through challenges. Although difficult to measure and disentangle the direct impact of these skills, research coalesces on their importance for future success and small-scale interventions show promise in their development through authentic pre-collegiate experiences, such as college-level courses, capstone projects, and internships, among others. College readiness is therefore a dynamic process between choices, actions, and beliefs bounded by structural constraints in opportunities often at the school level. Given that schools play a large role in this process, there is much for schools to consider in developing students' skills and dispositions for successfully navigating the pathways to and through college. The conclusion of our report highlights several frameworks currently used to monitor key indicators along students' educational trajectories in order to foster an affirmative college-going culture, strengthen academic preparation, improve college knowledge and information, and cultivate stronger resilience for success in college.

        "description":"Apprenticeship is a learning model and a proven strategy for (1) developing a talented and trained pipeline of workers for employers; and (2) expanding family supporting careers for individuals not pursuing a traditional four-year college track (without foreclosing their opportunities to pursue college down the road). Yet in Pennsylvania, as in states across the United States (U.S.), apprenticeship has been underutilized. In Spring 2016, Pennsylvania established the Apprenticeship and Training Office (ATO) within the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry (L&amp;I). ATO established a strategic partnership with Keystone Development Partnership (KDP), a labor-management partnership with extensive experience building Industry (training) Partnerships, to expand the state's outreach capacity to employers and unions about apprenticeship The ATO also began engaging and sharing information with workforce boards across the state, elevating apprenticeships as a central Pennsylvania workforce development strategy and a key tool for expanding &quot;employer driven&quot; training. Since 2017, Pennsylvania has invested in expanding and assisting apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs through grants from L&amp;I (e.g., through the new PAsmart initiative) and through the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED). This report sketches the major challenges to the expansion of apprenticeships and the benefits of apprenticeships--which make the challenges worth overcoming. The second half of the report outlines 10 actions the ATO and Pennsylvania state government could take to grow apprenticeships and capture its benefits at a larger scale.

Studies that deploy and test interventions, when informed by data-driven modeling, are often described as &quot;close the loop&quot; studies. Studies that close the loop attempt to link improvements in statistical and machine learning models of learning to real-world learning outcomes. After first considering challenges to internet scale experiments, we review several educational data science/mining studies that close the loop between data-driven modeling and learning outcomes. Next, we describe UpGrade, an open source architecture that, when integrated with educational technologies, helps overcome challenges to large-scale field trials (or internet scale experiments) that close the loop between data-driven work and real-world learning outcomes. In addition to describing preliminary randomized experiments that have been conducted and will soon be conducted using the architecture in two educational technology platforms, we end with a &quot;call for contributors and integrators.&quot; UpGrade contributors and integrators will be researchers and developers who seek to drive continuous, data-driven improvements in real-world settings where learning with technology occurs.

        "description":"Online educational technologies facilitate pedagogical experimentation, but typical experimental designs assign a fixed proportion of students to each condition, even if early results suggest some are ineffective. Experimental designs using multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms vary the probability of condition assignment for a new student based on prior results, placing more students in more effective conditions. While stochastic MAB algorithms have been used for educational experiments, they collect data that decreases power and increases false positive rates [22]. Instead, we propose using adversarial MAB algorithms, which are less exploitative and thus may exhibit more robustness. Through simulations involving data from 20+ educational experiments [29], we show data collected using adversarial MAB algorithms does not have the statistical downsides of that from stochastic MAB algorithms. Further, we explore how differences in condition variability (e.g., performance gaps between students being narrowed by an intervention) impact MAB versus uniform experimental design. Data from stochastic MAB algorithms systematically reduce power when the better arm is less variable, while increasing it when the better arm is more variable; data from the adversarial MAB algorithms results in the same statistical power as uniform assignment. Overall, these results demonstrate that adversarial MAB algorithms are a viable &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; solution for researchers who want to preserve the statistical power of standard experimental designs while also benefiting student participants.

        "description":"Automatic short answer grading is an important research direction in the exploration of how to use artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools to improve education. Current state-of-the-art approaches use neural language models to create vectorized representations of students responses, followed by classifiers to predict the score. However, these approaches have several key limitations, including i) they use pre-trained language models that are not well-adapted to educational subject domains and/or student-generated text and ii) they almost always train one model per question, ignoring the linkage across question and result in a significant model storage problem due to the size of advanced language models. In this paper, we study the problem of automatic short answer grading for students' responses to math questions and propose a novel framework for this task. First, we use MathBERT, a variant of the popular language model BERT adapted to mathematical content, as our base model and fine-tune it on the downstream task of student response grading. Second, we use an in-context learning approach that provides scoring examples as input to the language model to provide additional context information and promote generalization to previously unseen questions. We evaluate our framework on a real-world dataset of student responses to open-ended math questions and show that our framework (often significantly) outperform existing approaches, especially for new questions that are not seen during training.

        "description":"The complex and dynamic nature of collaboration makes it challenging to find indicators of productive learning and quality collaboration. This exploratory study developed a collaboration metric to capture temporal patterns of joint attention (JA) based on log files generated as students interacted with an immersive astronomy simulation using augmented reality headsets and tablets. JA is defined as the ability to coordinate attention, which thus plays an important role in collaborative problem-solving to build the common ground for knowledge co-construction. We first developed a JA metric consisting of six distinct but closely relevant states as a measure of the collaboration process. We then conducted descriptive statistics to compare frequency and temporal pattern of JA states across three learning performance groups. Our results showed that high-learning-gain groups demonstrated visual coordination behaviors more frequently and utilized this collaboration strategy in the early stage. We then investigated sequences of these JA states, focusing on one key behavior: long and consistent shared view as a proxy for collaboration. This sequential analysis revealed two different collaboration profiles: attention follow-leader and turn takers, suggesting the existence of asymmetrical participation. Our findings indicate the potential of JA metric to predict overall collaboration quality, identify undesirable collaboration behaviors, and serve as an early warning to provide just-in-time guidance.

        "description":"Research shows that dual enrollment--a practice in which high school students take college courses while they are still in high school--has multiple benefits for student success in both systems. To capitalize on those benefits, California and other states have moved in recent years to increase high school students' access to college courses. In California, the historical lack of an integrated state data system that connects information from K-12 to higher education has hampered efforts to understand the extent of dual enrollment here. The prevailing narrative has been that California lags other states and the nation in dual enrollment, which is offered in 89% of U.S. high schools, with 11% of all high school students participating nationally. This brief, released in partnership with Wheelhouse, the Center for Community College Leadership and Research, breaks new ground by matching high school and community college datasets to provide a clearer picture of college course-taking among California public high school students statewide. The analysis of course-taking for the population of students who were seniors in the 2016-17 school year--the most recent cohort for which data from both segments was available--shows that 12.6% of California high school students take college courses, a rate higher than the national average and well above what previous reports suggest for California. A closer look at the matched dataset, however, reveals significant differences in college course-taking by race and socioeconomic status. Latinx and African American students were underrepresented in community college course-taking compared to their share of overall high school students. Socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED) students were also less likely to dual enroll than their non-SED peers. The vast majority of California public high schools do not have a formal dual enrollment program, though many have at least one student enrolled in a community college course during high school. Access to an important onramp to the early college experience, and its many demonstrated benefits, is not currently available to all California high school students.

This paper reports on the students' use of emoji in an online course forum in which students annotate and discuss course material in the margins of the online textbook. For this study, instructors created 11 custom emoji-hashtag pairs that enabled students to quickly communicate affects and reactions in the forum that they experienced while interacting with the course material. Example reporting includes, inviting discussion about a topic, declaring a topic as interesting, or requesting assistance about a topic. We analyze emoji usage by over 1,800 students enrolled in multiple offerings of the same course across multiple academic terms. The data show that some emoji frequently appear together in posts associated with the same paragraphs, suggesting that students use the emoji in this way to communicating complex affective states. We explore the use of computational models for predicting emoji at the post level, even when posts are lacking emoji. This capability can allow instructors to infer information about students' affective states during their &quot;at home&quot; interactions with course readings. Finally, we show that partitioning the emoji into distinct groups, rather than trying to predict individual emoji, can be both of pedagogical value to instructors and improve the predictive performance of our approach using the BERT language model. Our procedure can be generalized to other courses and for the benefit of other instructors. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]",

We introduce an approach that couples a gradient boosting classifier for predicting outcomes from an allocation strategy with a local search optimization algorithm, which optimizes strategies based on their expected outcomes. Unlike most existing approaches that focus strictly on allocating merit based awards, ours optimizes simultaneously the allocation of both merit-based awards and need-based aid. Further, the multi-objective optimization lets users experiment with different combinations of institution-centric and student-centric objectives to deliver outcomes that suit desired goals. With this approach, we identify multiple allocation strategies that would yield higher enrollment, revenue, or students' affordability and access to higher education than the University's existing strategy. In particular, one strategy suggests that with moderate changes to the current funding structure the University can increase students' access to higher education by more than 100%, while still maintaining a similar level of enrollment and revenue.

        "description":"Academic grades in assessments are predicted to determine if a student is at risk of failing a course. Sequential models or graph neural networks that have been employed for grade prediction do not consider relationships between course descriptions. We propose the use of text mining to extract semantic, syntactic, and frequency-based features from course content. In addition, we classify intended learning outcomes according to their higher- or lower-order thinking skills. A learning parameter is then formulated to model the impact of these cognitive levels (that are expected for each course) on student performance. These features are then embedded and represented as graphs. Past academic achievements are then fused with the above features for grade prediction. We validate the performance of the above approach via datasets corresponding to three engineering departments collected from a university. Results obtained highlight that the proposed technique generates meaningful feature representations and outperforms existing methods for grade prediction. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]",

        "description":"Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is a 21st-century skill essential for learning gains, workplace success, and tackling increasingly complicated global problems. Group diversity plays a vital role during collaborative activities, especially in a digital space. Although CPS involves dynamic communication behaviors, few studies have considered the impact of cultural diversity on the complex and reoccurring discourse involved in CPS tasks. In this study, we explore team conversations during a CPS task to understand the role of cultural diversity on team communication patterns. First, we characterized team dialogues with an existing CPS framework; then used recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to quantify group communication and capture recurrent patterns. Finally, we compared the patterns across groups with varying degrees of cultural diversity. Our results suggest that groups with higher levels of cultural diversity, compared to more homogeneous groups, had a higher number of group messages, spent more time in group discussions, and demonstrated greater convergence and complexity in communication patterns. These intricate and complicated communication patterns support the notion that cultural diversity can produce both positive and negative outcomes and may explain the perception of cultural diversity in teams as a &quot;double-edged sword&quot;.

The reliability of peer assessment systems is influenced by various factors such as assessment ability of peers, their strategic assessment behaviors, and the peer assessment setup (e.g., peer evaluating group work or individual work of others). In this work, we first model peer assessment as multi-relational weighted networks that can express a variety of peer assessment setups, and can also capture conflicts of interest and strategic behaviors. Leveraging our peer assessment network model, we introduce a graph neural network which can learn assessment patterns and user behaviors to more accurately predict expert evaluations. Our extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, which outperforms a variety of peer assessment methods. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]",

        "description":"As online learning platforms become more ubiquitous throughout various curricula, there is a growing need to evaluate the effectiveness of these platforms and the different methods used to structure online education and tutoring. Towards this endeavor, some platforms have performed randomized controlled experiments to compare different user experiences, curriculum structures, and tutoring strategies in order to ensure the effectiveness of their platform and personalize the education of the students using it. These experiments are typically analyzed on an individual basis in order to reveal insights on a specific aspect of students' online educational experience. In this work, the data from 50,752 instances of 30,408 students participating in 50 different experiments conducted at scale within the online learning platform ASSISTments were aggregated and analyzed for consistent trends across experiments. By combining common experimental conditions and normalizing the dependent measures between experiments, this work has identified multiple statistically significant insights on the impact of various skill mastery requirements, strategies for personalization, and methods for tutoring in an online setting. This work can help direct further experimentation and inform the design and improvement of new and existing online learning platforms.

        "description":"Interactive simulations allow students to discover the underlying principles of a scientific phenomenon through their own exploration. Unfortunately, students often struggle to learn effectively in these environments. Classifying students' interaction data in the simulations based on their expected performance has the potential to enable adaptive guidance and consequently improve students' learning. Previous research in this field has mainly focused on a-posteriori analyses or investigations limited to one specific predictive model and simulation. In this paper, we investigate the quality and generalisability of models for an early prediction of conceptual understanding based on clickstream data of students across interactive simulations. We first measure the students' conceptual understanding through their in-task performance. Then, we suggest a novel type of features that, starting from clickstream data, encodes both the state of the simulation and the action performed by the student. We finally propose to feed these features into GRU-based models, with and without attention, for prediction. Experiments on two different simulations and with two different populations show that our proposed models outperform shallow learning baselines and better generalise to different learning environments and populations. The inclusion of attention into the model increases interpretability in terms of effective inquiry. The source code is available on Github. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]",

Other studies have identified quality feedback as focusing on detecting problems, providing suggestions, or pointing out where changes need to be made. However, it is important to seek students' perspectives on what makes a review helpful to a reviewee. This study explores the helpfulness of feedback from students' perspectives when the feedback contained suggestions or mentioned problems or both. We applied natural language processing techniques to identify suggestions and problems mentioned in peer reviews. We also analyzed important text features that are associated with suggestions or problems detected by the peer feedback. The result showed that students are likely to find a review helpful if a suggestion is provided along with the problem mentioned in the feedback rather than simply identifying the problem.

        "description":"What can eye movements reveal about reading, a complex skill ubiquitous in everyday life? Research suggests that gaze can reflect short-term comprehension for facts, but it is unknown whether it can measure long-term, deep comprehension. We tracked gaze while 147 participants read long, connected, informative texts and completed assessments of rote (factual) and inference comprehension (connecting ideas) while reading a text, after reading a text, after reading five texts, and after a seven-day delay. Gaze-based student-independent computational models predicted both immediate and long-term rote and inference comprehension with moderate accuracies. Surprisingly, the models were most accurate for comprehension assessed after reading all texts and predicted comprehension even after a week-long delay. This shows that eye movements can provide a lens into the cognitive processes underlying reading comprehension, including inference formation, and the consolidation of information into long-term memory, which has implications for intelligent student interfaces that can automatically detect and repair comprehension in real-time.

The amount of help that students receive is highly dependent on the quality of the reviews. Previous studies have investigated using machine learning to detect characteristics of reviews (e.g., Do they mention a problem, make a suggestion, or tell the student where to make a change?). Machine-learning approaches to peer-assessment evaluation are heavily reliant on labeled data to learn how to identify review characteristics. However, attaining reliable labels for those characteristics is always time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we propose to apply pseudo-labeling, a semi-supervised learning-based strategy, to improve the recognition of reviews that detect problems in the reviewed work. This is done by utilizing a small, reliably labeled dataset along with a large unlabeled dataset to train a text classifier. The ultimate goal of this research is to show that for peer assessment evaluation, we can utilize both unlabeled and labeled datasets to obtain a robust auto-labeling system and thereby save much effort in labeling the data.

The report accompanying this brief considers a rich set of school administrative data, collected over the course of three school years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic: 2016-17 through 2018-19. Early evidence suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to exacerbate the crisis of housing instability; some who had previously experienced housing stability are, for the first time, experiencing some form of housing instability, and others who previously experienced some form of housing instability may now face even greater or more frequent instability. The report's findings highlight the importance of strengthening systems for identifying students who are experiencing housing instability, improving data systems for recording and maintaining this information, and using such data to inform policy and practice not only in schools and districts, but throughout the county. Needs are greater than prior to the pandemic, adding to the strength of calls for integrated county- and state-wide responses to this ongoing crisis in housing and more.

This study considers a rich set of school administrative data, which allow us to describe youth based on their dwelling status designations reported by the school districts, their free or reduced-price meal participation, and several demographic characteristics. We also examine the relationship between student dwelling status designation and educational outcomes. At a high level, our research finds that over 2,600 adolescents in San Mateo County experienced housing instability over the course of the three school years before the pandemic. Students experiencing housing instability were also: (1) disproportionately Latinx, Black, and/or English language learners; and (2) likely to miss more days of school than their housing stable peers. Based on these findings, we conclude that youth experiencing housing instability face a range of unique challenges, and we recommend a set of concrete actions that state policymakers, local and county leaders, school district leaders, and leaders from youth-serving organizations can take to help ensure positive and equitable outcomes.

        "description":"Learning objectives, especially those well defined by applying Bloom's taxonomy for Cognitive Objectives, have been widely recognized as important in various teaching and learning practices. However, many educators have difficulties developing learning objectives appropriate to the levels in Bloom's taxonomy, as they need to consider the progression of learners' skills with learning content as well as dependencies between different learning objectives. To remedy this challenge, we aimed to apply state-of-the-art computational techniques to automate the classification of learning objectives based on Bloom's taxonomy. Specifically, we collected 21,380 learning objectives from 5,558 different courses at an Australian university and manually labeled them according to the six cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy. Based on the labeled dataset, we applied five conventional machine learning approaches (i.e., naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and XGBoost) and one deep learning approach based on pre-trained language model BERT to construct classifiers to automatically determine a learning objective's cognitive levels. In particular, we adopted and compared two methods in constructing the classifiers, i.e., constructing multiple binary classifiers (one for each cognitive level in Bloom's taxonomy) and constructing only one multi-class multi-label classifier to simultaneously identify all the corresponding cognitive levels. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrated that: (i) BERT-based classifiers outperformed the others in all cognitive levels (Cohen's K up to 0.93 and F1 score up to 0.95); (ii) three machine learning models -- support vector machine, random forest, and XGBoost -- delivered performance comparable to the BERT-based classifiers; and (iii) most of the binary BERT-based classifiers (5 out of 6) slightly outperformed the multi-class multi-label BERT-based classifier, suggesting that separating the characterization of different cognitive levels seemed to be a better choice than building only one model to identify all cognitive levels at one time.

Intelligent social agents can provide a source of personalized support for students, and their benefits likely extend to collaborative settings, but it is difficult to determine how these agents should interact with students. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers an opportunity for adapting the interactions between the social agent and the students to better support collaboration and learning. However, using RL in education with social agents typically involves training using real students. In this work, we train an RL agent in a high-quality simulated environment to learn how to improve students' collaboration. Data was collected during a pilot study with dyads of students who worked together to tutor an intelligent teachable robot. We explore the process of building an environment from the data, training a policy, and the impact of the policy on different students, compared to various baselines.

        "description":"Recommender systems in educational contexts have proven effective to identify learning resources that fit the interests and needs of learners. Their usage has been of special interest in online self-learning scenarios to increase student retention and improve the learning experience. In current recommendation techniques, and in particular, in collaborative filtering recommender systems, the quality of the recommendation is largely based on the explicit or implicit information obtained about the learners. On free massive online learning platforms, however, the information available about learners may be limited and based mostly on logs from website analytics tools such as Google Analytics. In this paper, we address the challenge of recommending meaningful content with limited information from users by using rating estimation strategies from a log system. Our approach posits strategies to mine logs and generates effective ratings through the counting and temporal analysis of sessions. We evaluate different rating penalty strategies and compare the use of per-user and global metrics for rating estimation. The results show that using the average number of lessons viewed per-user is better than using global metrics with a p-value under 0.01 for 4 of our 5 hypotheses, showing statistical significance. Additionally, the results show that functions that penalize the rating to a lesser degree behave better and lead to a better recommendation. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]",

Students' assignment submission time provides valuable information on study attitudes and habits which strongly correlate with academic performance. However, the number of assignments and their submission deadlines vary among university courses, making it hard to use assignment submission time as a feature to predict academic performance. In this paper, we propose a new method called Relative Assignment Submission Time (RAST) which uses the assignment submission information of peer students to improve the correlation with course grades. Experiments on real-life data of 20 courses show that RAST has a high correlation with students' academic performance. We also build a machine learning model using RAST as a feature to detect students who would suffer from poor grades. Our method outperforms the traditional method by up to 61% on f1-score. We believe that our proposed method can help other studies on assignment submission time to improve the prediction accuracy on academic performance and detecting at-risk students.

Students skilled in SRL are more likely to effectively set goals, search for information, and direct their attention and cognitive process so that they align their efforts with their objectives. An influential framework for SRL, the SMART model, proposes that five cognitive operations (i.e., searching, monitoring, assembling, rehearsing, and translating) play a key role in SRL. However, these categories encompass a wide range of behaviors, making measurement challenging -- often involving observing individual students and recording their think-aloud activities or asking students to complete labor-intensive tagging activities as they work. In the current study, we develop machine-learned indicators of SMART operations, in order to achieve better scalability than other measurement approaches. We analyzed student's textual responses and interaction data collected from a mathematical learning platform where students are asked to thoroughly explain their solutions and are scaffolded in communicating their problem-solving process to their peers and teachers. We built detectors of four indicators of SMART operations (namely, assembling and translating operations). Our detectors are found to be reliable and generalizable, with AUC ROCs ranging from 0.76-0.89. When applied to the full test set, the detectors are robust against algorithmic bias, performing well across different student populations. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]",

Their pervasive success in predictive performance comes alongside a severe weakness, the lack of explainability of their decisions, especially relevant in humancentric fields. We implement five state-of-the-art methodologies for explaining black-box machine learning models (LIME, PermutationSHAP, KernelSHAP, DiCE, CEM) and examine the strengths of each approach on the downstream task of student performance prediction for five massive open online courses. Our experiments demonstrate that the families of explainers do not agree with each other on feature importance for the same Bidirectional LSTM models with the same representative set of students. We use Principal Component Analysis, Jensen-Shannon distance, and Spearman's rank-order correlation to quantitatively cross-examine explanations across methods and courses. Furthermore, we validate explainer performance across curriculum-based prerequisite relationships. Our results come to the concerning conclusion that the choice of explainer is an important decision and is in fact paramount to the interpretation of the predictive results, even more so than the course the model is trained on.

However, individual fairness also plays an important role in fair evaluation and has not been yet explored. Initialized by Dwork et al., the fundamental concept of individual fairness is &quot;similar people should get similar treatment&quot;. In the context of AES, individual fairness means that &quot;similar essays should be treated similarly&quot;. In this work, we propose a methodology to measure individual fairness in AES. The similarity of essays can be computed using the distance of the text representation of essays. We compare several text representations of essays, from the classical text features, such as BOW and TFIDF, to the more recent deep-learning-based features, such as Sentence-BERT and LASER. We also show their performance against paraphrased essays to understand if they can maintain the ranking of similarities between the original and the paraphrased essays. Finally, we demonstrate how to evaluate the performance of automated scoring systems models with regard to individual fairness by counting the number of pairs of essays that satisfy the individual fairness equation and by observing the correlation of score difference with the distance of essays. Our analysis suggests that the Sentence-BERT, as the text representation of the essays, and Gradient Boosting, as the score prediction model, provide better results based on the proposed individual fairness evaluation methodology.

However, students who lack representational competencies do not benefit from these visual representations. Therefore, students must learn not only content knowledge but also representational competencies. Further, as learning progresses, knowledge likely becomes more abstract, so that content knowledge may no longer be tied to a specific representation. This raises the question of whether students integrate representational competencies with content knowledge as learning progresses. The present study addresses this question by building knowledge-component models using log data collected from two studies in an introductory electrical engineering course. We compared knowledge-component models that separate representational competencies from content knowledge to knowledge-component models that integrate representational competencies with content knowledge. Our results show that as learning progressed, integrated knowledge-component models had better model fit. This finding indicates that over time, students' representational competencies become gradually integrated into content knowledge. Further, this suggests that different knowledge-component models might be needed at different times during a learning progression. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]",

        "description":"Collaborative learning is a complex process during which two or more learners exchange opinions, construct shared knowledge, and solve problems together. While engaging in this interactive process, learners' satisfaction toward their partners plays a crucial role in defining the success of the collaboration. If intelligent systems could predict peer satisfaction early during collaboration, they could intervene with adaptive support. However, while extensive studies have associated peer satisfaction with factors such as social presence, communication, and trustworthiness, there is no research on automatically predicting learners' satisfaction toward their partners. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the automatic prediction of peer satisfaction by analyzing 44 middle school learners' interactions during collaborative coding tasks. We extracted three types of features from dialogues: (1) linguistic features indicating semantics; (2) acoustic-prosodic features including energy and pitch; and (3) visual features including eye gaze, head pose, facial behaviors, and body pose. We then trained several regression models to predict the peer satisfaction scores that learners received from their partners. The results revealed that head position and body location were significant indicators of peer satisfaction: lower head and body distances between partners were associated with more positive peer satisfaction. This work is the first to investigate the multimodal prediction of peer satisfaction during collaborative problem solving, and represents a step toward the development of real-time intelligent systems that support collaborative learning.

        "description":"Gaming the system, a behavior in which learners exploit a system's properties to make progress while avoiding learning, has frequently been shown to be associated with lower learning. However, when we applied a previously validated gaming detector across conditions in experiments with an algebra tutor, the detected gaming was not associated with learning, challenging its construct validity. Our iterative exploratory data analysis suggested that some contextual factors that varied across and within conditions might contribute to this lack of association. We present a latent variable model, &quot;item response theory-based gaming detection&quot; (IRT-GD), that accounts for contextual factors and estimates latent gaming tendencies as the degree of deviation from normative behaviors across contexts. Item response theory models, widely used in knowledge assessment, account for item difficulty in estimating latent student abilities: students are estimated as having higher ability when they can get harder items correct than when they only get easier items correct. Similarly, IRT-GD accounts for contextual factors in estimating latent gaming tendencies: students are estimated as having a higher gaming tendency when they game in less commonly gamed contexts than when they only game in more commonly gamed contexts. IRT-GD outperformed the original detector on three datasets in terms of the association with learning. IRT-GD also more accurately revealed intervention effects on gaming and revealed a correlation between gaming and perceived competence in math. Our approach is not only useful for others wanting to apply a gaming assessment in their context but is also generally applicable in creating robust behavioral measures.

Machine learning models can detect this behavior in both real-time and in historical data. However, intelligent tutoring system designs often change over time, in terms of the design of the student interface, assessment models, and data collection log schemas. Can gaming detectors still be trusted, a decade or more after they are developed? In this research, we evaluate the robustness/degradation of gaming detectors when trained on older data logs and evaluated on current data logs. We demonstrate that some machine learning models developed using past data are still able to predict gaming behavior from student data collected 16 years later, but that there is considerable variance in how well different algorithms perform over time. We demonstrate that a classic decision tree algorithm maintained its performance while more contemporary algorithms struggled to transfer to new data, even though they exhibited better performance on unseen students in both New and Old data sets by themselves. Examining the feature importance values provides some explanation for the differences in performance between models, and offers some insight into how we might safeguard against detector rot over time.

        "description":"A child's ability to understand text (reading comprehension) can greatly impact both their ability to learn in the classroom and their future contributions to society. Reading comprehension draws on oral language; behavioural measures of knowledge at the word and sentence levels have been shown to be related to children's reading comprehension. In this study, we examined the impact of word and sentence level text-features on children's reading comprehension. We built a predictive model that uses natural language processing techniques to predict the question-level performance of students on reading comprehension tests. We showed that, compared to a model that used measures of student knowledge and subskills alone, a model that used features of sentence complexity, lexical surprisal, rare word use, and general context improved prediction accuracy by more than four percentage points. Our subsequent analyses revealed that these features compensate for the shortcomings of each other and work together to produce maximal performance. This provides insight into how different characteristics of the text and questions can be used to predict student performance, leading to new ideas about how text and reading comprehension interact. Our work also suggests that using a combination of text features could support the adaptation of reading materials to meet student needs. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]",

        "description":"Providing timely feedback is crucial in promoting academic achievement and student success. However, for multifarious reasons (e.g., limited teaching resources), feedback often arrives too late for learners to act on the feedback and improve learning. Thus, automated feedback systems have emerged to tackle educational tasks in various domains, including novice programming, short-essay writing, and open-ended questions. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated automated feedback generation on students' project reports. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven system, named &quot;Insta-Reviewer,&quot; for automatically generating instant feedback on students' project reports, using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models. We also propose a framework for manually evaluating system-generated feedback. Experimental results show that feedback generated by Insta-Reviewer on real students' project reports can achieve near-human performance. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of automatic feedback generation for students' project reports while highlighting several prominent challenges for future research.

        "description":"In collaborative problem solving (CPS), people's actions are interactive, interdependent, and temporal. However, it is unclear how actions temporally relate to each other and what are the temporal similarities and differences between successful vs. unsuccessful CPS processes. As such, we apply a temporal analysis approach, Multilevel Vector Autoregression (mlVAR) to investigate CPS processes. Our data were collected from college students who collaborated in triads via a video-conferencing tool (Zoom) to collaborately engage a physics learning game. Video recordings of their verbal interactions were transcribed, coded using a validated CPS framework, and organized into sequences of 10-second windows. Then, mlVAR was applied to the successful vs. unsuccessful CPS sequences to build temporal models for each. A comparison of the models together with a qualitative analysis of the transcripts revealed six temporal relationships common to both, six unique to successful level attempts, and another eight unique to unsuccessful level attempts only. Generally, for successful outcomes, people were likely to answer clarification questions with reasons and to ask for suggestions according to the current game situation, while for unsuccessful CPS level attempts, people were more likely to struggle with unclear instructions and to respond to inappropriate ideas. Overall, our results suggest that mlVAR is an effective approach for temporal analyses of CPS processes by identifying relationships that go beyond a coding and counting approach.

        "description":"The challenge of learning programming in a MOOC is twofold: acquiring programming skills and learning online, independently. Automated testing and feedback systems, often offered in programming courses, may scaffold MOOC learners by providing immediate feedback and unlimited re-submissions of code assignments. However, research still lacks empirical evidence of their effect on learning behavior of MOOC learners, with diverse backgrounds and goals. Addressing this gap, we investigated the connections between the use of automated feedback system and learning behavior measures, relevant for MOOCs: engagement, persistence and performance. Further, two subjective measures of success are examined: sense of learning and intention fulfilment. In an experimental design, we analyzed data of active learners in a Python programming MOOC (N=4652), comparing an experimental group provided with automated feedback with a control group that did not. In examining the effect of automated feedback, prior knowledge of programming and Python was considered. Empirical evidence was found for the relation between automated feedback usage and a higher engagement and better performance, as well as higher attendance in &quot;active watchers&quot; and &quot;high-performed completers&quot; clusters, obtained by cluster analysis. Learners reports on their experience with the automated feedback system supported these findings. Regarding the subjective measures of success, however, no difference was found between groups. Our study and the offered future research may contribute to the considerations regarding the integration of automated feedback in MOOCs for programming. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]",

Domain modelling techniques map questions to concepts and student modelling techniques generate a mastery score for a concept. We conducted an evaluation using six large datasets from a Python programming course, evaluating the performance of different domain and student modelling techniques. The results showed that it is possible to develop a successful and fully automated pipeline which learns from raw data. The best results were achieved using alternating least squares on hill-climbing Q-matrices as domain modelling and exponential moving average as student modelling. This method outperformed all baselines in terms of accuracy and showed excellent run time. [For the full proceedings, see ED623995.]",

The students' submissions are analyzed for repeating mistakes across different exercises by representing the context surrounding the error by a graph and applying graph mining techniques to discover their common grounds.

        "description":"Materialist design is presented as an embodied perspective on educational design that can be applied to redesign of classroom-based learning environments. Materialist design is informed by a framework of materialist epistemology, which positions material innovation on equal placement with symbol-based formal theory. Historical examples of Einstein's conceptual reliance on trains for his Theory of Relativity and the Wright brothers' use of wind tunnels in aeronautics illustrate how materialist design drives progress on complex design problems. A key aspect is the application of scale-down methodology, where complex systems are reconceptualized as interactions among nearly decomposable subsystems that can be redesigned and integrated back into the entire system. The application of materialist design is illustrated with the redesign of an embodied video game that uses real-time motion capture technology to promote high school geometry reasoning and proof, following its use in an ethnically and linguistically diverse classroom. Our embodied perspective offers particular insights for understanding and implementing designs of complex learning environments, and assessing their influences on educational practices and student outcomes.

This year's annual &quot;The State of Working Pennsylvania&quot; documents the accuracy of Tom Wilson's observation in Pennsylvania. In 2018, for the first time since 2001, Pennsylvania workers enjoyed wage increases across the board--3.1% on average across the entire wage distribution (i.e. from the 10th percentile to the 90th percentile). These gains reflect what is now the longest economic expansion in U.S. history and an unemployment rate in Pennsylvania below 4% for the first time since before 1976. This report recommends following Wilson's advice that business leaders create specific goals and execute a plan to grow more higher-paying jobs. The authors propose using the already existing Middle Class Task Force, which includes labor as well as business representation, to develop the plan and execution strategy. After 40 or more years of business leadership focused single-mindedly on profits, it will take a sustained team effort to create a kinder, gentler capitalism that we can all embrace.",

        "description":"To ensure that students obtain an effective and appropriate education, quality assurance in higher education is crucial. The primary concepts, structures, and procedures associated with quality assurance in higher education are extensively addressed in this paper. To improve student learning outcomes, institutional reputation, and overall accountability, it examines the changing landscape of higher education and the growing emphasis on quality. The introduction of the paper defines quality assurance in the context of higher education, emphasizing its complexity and the range of stakeholders it involves. It explores the numerous quality dimensions--both academic and non-academic--and their importance in promoting a well-rounded educational experience. The paper then addresses the essential tenets and strategies that support quality assurance. It looks at internal quality control approaches that enable institutions to regularly review and enhance their educational practices, such as faculty development, curriculum design, and self-assessment. To further promote openness, comparability, and accountability across higher education institutions, external quality assurance, including accreditation, benchmarking, and regulatory frameworks, is being investigated as well. The paper also explores international perspectives on quality assurance in higher education, emphasizing regional differences and global initiatives. It looks at how standards-setting organizations, professional groups, and quality control organizations influence policies and encourage institutional cooperation. To improve processes for making decisions and ensure constant enhancement, the paper also examines the role of data analysis, assessment instruments, and quality indicators. The paper also seeks to provide scholars, policymakers, administrators, and practitioners with a firm foundation to comprehend the concepts, theories, and techniques involved in quality assurance in higher education. It is a useful tool for promoting quality in higher education institutions around the world, encouraging discussion, and influencing decision-making processes.",

How do their financial aid packages compare with those of their peers? Does the Education and Training Voucher program meet their needs? If not, how can it be improved? To answer these questions, the authors used data on California students from the National Center for Education Statistics, &quot;National Postsecondary Student Aid Study-Administrative Collection: 2018, Undergraduates (NPSAS:18-AC)&quot; (Siegel, Ramirez, and Johnson 2021) (ED629113). The authors compared postsecondary costs and financial aid for students with foster care history versus those of students without foster care history. They found that students with foster care history do not receive the level of support needed to cover their postsecondary education costs, despite choosing lower-cost institutions. Further, while Education and Training Vouchers are meant to fill this need, the program is underfunded to serve all young people, and the funding cap leaves a lot of unmet need.

        "description":"University rankings have a growing impact on how people view the academic excellence of higher education. The complicated relationship between rankings and academic excellence is explored in this essay along with how it may affect higher education policy and practice. The importance of rankings and their influence on institutional decision-making is highlighted in the introduction to the article. After that, it goes into detail about how to understand university rankings, going over their methodology, metrics, and influences. The subsequent sections focus on the link between rankings and academic quality, highlighting how rankings can both reflect and shape perceptions of quality. The limitations and challenges associated with rankings are also explored, including the simplification of academic quality, data accuracy, and interpretation, and the potential for distortions and unintended consequences. Alternative approaches to assessing academic quality beyond rankings are presented, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive evaluation frameworks that encompass diverse dimensions of excellence. This paper goes into more detail about how rankings affect institutions of higher learning, including how they affect institutional priorities and the necessity of mission-driven decision-making. Additionally, discussions of student opinions on rankings and academic standards highlight the significance of including students in the evaluation process. Exploring the difficulties and possibilities for policy and practice while concentrating on themes of equity, data transparency, and public opinion. The paper concludes by highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of rankings and academic quality and the importance of adopting comprehensive approaches that prioritize student success, diversity, and institutional missions. By recognizing the limitations of rankings and embracing alternative assessment measures, policymakers and institutions can promote a more holistic and accurate assessment of academic quality in higher education.",

        "description":"Curriculum Development in Zambia is highly centralized, with the Curriculum Development Center (CDC) being charged with developing the curriculum through consultative and participatory approaches through the course and subject panels where teachers are engaged. Nevertheless, there has been no empirical evidence to show how teachers are actively involved in the development process. This study aimed to investigate the phenomenon of teachers' involvement in the curriculum development process in Zambia. This study was qualitative and used a case study design approach. Data was collected using a semi-structured interview guide from secondary school teachers and headteachers. Raw data were collected through semi-structured interview forms from secondary school teachers and headteachers. The researcher analyzed the data using MAXQDA qualitative software to identify initial codes and generate emerging themes quickly. The results showed that secondary school teachers were dissatisfied with the present way of curriculum development, which insignificantly neglects them, and also, the majority of them have never participated in the development of the curriculum. Further, the results revealed that most of the secondary school teachers in Lusaka were willing to participate at any stage of the curriculum development in Zambia. This study concludes by arguing that secondary school teachers are significantly neglected to participate in the curriculum development in Zambia and recommends that the Ministry of General Education (MoGE) broaden the scope of secondary school teachers' participation in the curriculum developed through the Curriculum Development Center (CDC).",

A promise scholarship aims to increase collegiate attainment by promising financial aid to eligible students. Promise scholarships differ from traditional scholarships in that promise scholarships are non-competitive and not necessarily needs based. Typical eligibility criteria for promise scholarships include a set minimum GPA and residence within a specific geographic area. Utah's Regents' Scholarship could be considered a promise scholarship. For Regents', the criteria included a minimum GPA of 3.0 with no grade below a &quot;C&quot; and residence within Utah for high school grades 9 through 12; specific coursework was also required. This brief studies the effects of the Regent's Scholarship awards finding that recipients earned more associate and bachelor's degrees in time than similar students, required less institutional and federal support, and helped more underrepresented populations complete degrees on time.",

Although New Jersey's child care employment has been rising, the numbers have not reached pre-pandemic levels. This ongoing child care workforce crisis has left programs understaffed, preventing them from operating at full capacity, thereby limiting child care options for working families, especially those with infants and toddlers. Advocates for Children of New Jersey (ACNJ) wanted to better understand the magnitude of this problem that is making it so difficult for working parents to find care for their youngest children. Through the distribution of a survey to all child care centers licensed to serve infants and toddlers in New Jersey, ACNJ was able to elicit from the responses why there is &quot;Still No Room for Babies.&quot; This report, highlighting those findings, makes it clear that solving the child care crisis warrants new policies to address workforce compensation.",

According to Howard Gardner's findings, the concept of multiple intelligences has been widely known and used in educational institutions. Multiple intelligences are also considered a theory that first recognized the diversity of human intelligence. With multiple intelligences, it can be said that no child is stupid. Therefore, each child is born with intelligence that is not always equal to each other. In Islam, the Quran is a complete guide for life. This research has discovered the powerful instruments to develop Qur'anic multiple intelligences in educational institutions through literature. With the thematic interpretation method (maudhui) approach, this study described the practical efforts, using the mindset of interpretation and reflection, to develop the concept of multiple intelligences based on the perspective of the Quran. After researching, collecting, and analyzing all terms in the Quran that relate to intelligence, it is found that the Quran is distinguishing the concept of multiple intelligences. It can be used further as a practical guide for educational institutions in developing the concept of multiple intelligences from the perspective of the Quran.",

This potentially leaves more than 150,000 very young children in New Jersey without the option of center-based care.

This descriptive study aims to assess the functional and research competencies that can determine faculty members' knowledge and skills. The authors used a faculty training needs survey form adapted from Ulrich and Dash (2013) which included a 5-level checklist and a 5-point Likert scale regarding the competencies acquired by the faculty members and was made through Google Forms. Thirty-five (35) faculty members of St. Dominic College of Asia from different schools in the Higher Education Department have responded to the faculty training needs survey. Based on the findings, most of the teachers have manifested the functional and research competencies required for their teaching and practice, although their functional competencies have majorly reached either on the first or second levels. Meanwhile, the research competencies have respective ratings of 4.20, 4.21, and 4.41 in scientific research competencies, project and team management skills, and personal aptitudes, which make a positive impact to the teachers. It was also revealed that instructional material development was extended up to the fifth level, wherein teachers even sought feedback from their students, peers, and administrators through observation, conservation, or written evaluations in developing and evaluating resources that can be taught in a certain course, which is a good indication of their engagement towards individuals. The study suggested that faculty members must continue their development through attending research seminars and conference trainings that may be applicable to their specific fields. Future researchers should conduct a correlation study regarding the functional and research competencies, as well as a qualitative approach for the opinions on the effectiveness of these competencies.",

        "description":"In recent years, schools and large-scale assessment developers across the United States have been providing English learners with language supports when they take tests to reduce construct-irrelevant variance, or errors in test scores due to factors that are extraneous to the construct being assessed (Thorndike et al., 1991). Some of these supports are linguistically related, such as word-to-word bilingual dictionaries and translated test directions, whereas other supports are linguistically unrelated, such as giving students extra time and testing them in a small group (Schissel, 2014). An appropriate support is one that reduces construct-irrelevant variance caused by limited language proficiency while producing comparable scores between English learners and non-ELs (Rios et al., 2020). Several studies have found that language supports are effective for improving English learners' test performance and reducing test score gaps between ELs and non-ELs (Kieffer et al., 2009; Li &amp; Suen, 2012; Pennock-Roman &amp; Rivera, 2011). Other studies have found that although some supports such as extra time could benefit both ELs and non-ELs, these supports tend to benefit students who are ELs to a greater extent (Sireci et al., 2003). In this report, ACT surveyed English learners who took the ACT® test on a National test date in February or April 2022 to learn about their experiences and perceptions when taking tests with language supports. The purposes of this survey were to (1) understand the types of supports English learners used when they took tests at school and when they took the ACT; (2) investigate how ELs felt about these supports, whether they thought the supports were useful or not; (3) explore whether using these supports when taking tests was associated with self-reported confidence on test performance or with test anxiety; and (4) learn why some ELs did not use supports when taking tests in school or when taking the ACT.

        "description":"Text classification has allowed researchers to analyze natural language data at a previously impossible scale. However, a text classifier is only as valid as the the annotations on which it was trained. Further, the cost of training a classifier depends on annotators' ability to quickly and accurately apply the coding scheme to each text. Thus, researchers need guidance on how to generate training data with optimal efficiency and accuracy. To this end, this study proposes the single-case study design as a feasible and causally-valid research design for empirical decision-making in annotation projects. The key strength of the design is its ability to generate causal evidence with as few as one annotator. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of the single-case study in an applied experiment and argue that future researchers should incorporate the design into the pilot stage of annotation projects so that, over time, a causally-valid body of knowledge regarding the best annotation techniques is built.

One of them tried to find the answers to the main question: How artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to improve learning, teaching, and planning? The other tried to find the answer to the main question: What new skills do officers need when artificial intelligence is coming? We did literature reviews and found out that intelligent technology combined with data analytics can offer several improvements to traditional classroom teaching. From literature reviews, we also found some new skills that officers might need to be able to handle AI-based technologies. This is a position paper presenting the arguable opinions of the writers. We have found lots of benefits that the use of intelligent learning technology can bring, mainly by supporting individual learning paths. There is also an obvious need for AI officers who should have a deeper understanding of the AI-supported technology than normal officers. This project and some other similar projects have raised a lot of discussions, one seminar series about artificial intelligence and we do have some trained AI officers as well.

In 2017, the São Paulo City Curriculum for Natural Sciences was introduced to teach students scientific literacy through inquiry-based teaching methods. This study focused on the perceptions of teachers from an primary school in São Paulo who participated by filling out a Google Forms questionnaire. The findings revealed that the majority of participating teachers had undergone curriculum implementation training. While they considered the organization of disciplinary content to be similar to their previous teaching methods, they struggled with implementing inquiry-based teaching strategies and linking scientific content to the United Nation Foundation 2030 sustainable development goals.

        "description":"This study aims to investigate the usefulness of a deductive-cum-process writing approach to raise native Cantonese-speaking ESL students' awareness of the inappropriate use of informal language in academic writing. Achieving tone formality by incorporating appropriate syntactic and semantic elements poses great difficulties to freshmen at the City University of Hong Kong. Furthermore, the effectiveness of using a deductive approach to teach word usage has been inconclusive despite numerous studies on this issue (e.g., Alzubi, 2015; Tammenga-Helmantel, 2014; Vogel, et al. 2011) . In the current study, seven types of informal language expressions and corresponding formal alternatives were first taught, followed by peer review and individual teacher-student consultations to reinforce the teaching. The experimental group consisted of 19 students taking an academic writing course in the summer semester 2017-18. The end-of-course written examination showed that the experimental group used significantly fewer informal expressions than did the control group in three measures -- the total number of informal expressions and two component measures (p[less than or equal to]0.05). Questionnaire findings confirmed the usefulness of the current teaching approach, as perceived by the majority of the participants. Qualitative analysis revealed informal expressions that were most difficult for the participants to identify and to make correction.

Students were required to provide response words for each of the eight stimulus words within the pre-determined period of time. Analysis of data was done in order to find the stimulus words with the highest number of associations in students' knowledge structures and to calculate the relatedness coefficient between the stimulus words, in order to construct the relatedness networks that should model the students' knowledge structures. The results showed that students managed to relate most of the stimulus words with strong or medium strength links, however, &quot;Cellular respiration&quot; remained unconnected to other stimulus words in the students' knowledge structures.

This project took the form of a self-study and engaged a task force that included a wide range of participants from various organizations in Washington. From this exploration emerged a clearer picture of Washington's strengths and challenges to successful transfer, as well as significant opportunities to improve aspects of the system. The TEP task force identified priorities for action that could reduce barriers to successful transfer and increase understanding of how to build more equitable and supported pathways. Through the TEP examination, the following three key themes were identified: (1) Increasing transparency and effective transfer pathways for students, advisors, faculty, and transfer stakeholders; (2) Developing a more complete picture of the transfer ecosystem and a future research agenda; and (3) Defining a statewide shared transfer philosophy and goals. Together, these themes should serve as a guide for continued conversation among stakeholders in the transfer landscape to move toward action.

Given the connections between economic stability, parenting, and caregivers' well-being, a stronger focus on family economic well-being in ECHV could benefit families in many ways. The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation in the Administration for Children and Families in collaboration with the Health Resources and Services Administration initiated the Supporting Family Economic Well-Being through Home Visiting (HomeEc) project to better understand how to define and measure family economic well-being and to learn how ECHV agencies have supported or could support it. This report summarizes the findings from targeted reviews of literature and practice documents from ECHV and related fields, such as social work, child welfare, and employment- and income-focused supports. It includes (1) a definition of family economic well-being; (2) a summary of the factors that contribute to or are influenced by it; (3) a summary of how it is measured in research and practice; (4) a set of practices that can support it; and (5) implications for later work on this project and future research.",

Shadow education is notably pervasive in South Korea, and accounting for high rates of domestic expenditure and increasing time demands on young people's lives. The paper traces the historical and cultural reasons for the widespread uptake of shadow education amongst young students in the South Korean context and problematises what it means to be educated by juxtaposing leading scholars' perceptions of the fundamental aims of education. Delving into the reality of shadow education whilst also revealing the disruptive nature of this common place practice, the paper concludes by highlighting the need for further empirical research to counterbalance the largely unsubstantiated beliefs and anecdotal evidence regarding its purposes.",

        "description":"The Washington Student Achievement Council partnered with the North Central Educational Service District to design and develop a series of animated videos to share simple and clear information with students about the Washington College Grant and the benefits of pursuing education or training after high school. The videos aimed to build an engaging storyline by presenting sequential information about financial aid and postsecondary education and training in short segments. Videos were available in English and Spanish. The pilot project intended to address information gaps and increase students' awareness and understanding of postsecondary education opportunities and state financial aid. Survey results from the pilot project found that the videos were received positively, and students learned relevant information about financial aid and postsecondary education and training opportunities in Washington. Positive feedback and evidence of knowledge transfer led to an expansion of the informational videos project to several additional areas of the state. This demonstrates how evidence from a pilot project can be translated into practice and brought to scale to reach more students. Building intentional outreach strategies can more effectively engage with students and families and could contribute to increased awareness of postsecondary opportunities and improved educational outcomes in the state.

This research aims to explore the use of interactive H5P video as an alternative to traditional teacher-led class presentations at the university physics practicum. The quasi-experimental research design was implemented with 60 undergraduate students at the University of Latvia, during two introductory-level practical laboratory classes on the topics of mechanical bending and fluid viscosity. Knowledge tests were used to assess the learning outcomes, classroom observations provided an insight into students' group work with the video, a survey revealed student attitudes to the H5P video, as well as their preferences in preparation for the physics classes. Results show that both presentation formats contributed to reasonably high scores in the Exit ticket test at the end of the class. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups working in different conditions, implying that video was successfully used for a group activity to substitute lecturing in preparation for laboratory work. Potential applications of H5P video for individual and group work are discussed in line with the student preferences. [For the full proceedings, see ED629086.]",

The quality of the environment has a tendency to deteriorate, so environmental education becomes one of the essential conditions for continued existence. In order to improve the situation, it is necessary to raise public awareness and encourage behaviour change. It is obvious that environmental education is needed, which would raise people's level of awareness, and encourage them to change their behaviour, accordingly, changes would take place in the field of production and industry, consumption habits, and the relationship with the environment itself. Environmental education is especially important in primary school. In forming children's environmental awareness, a great responsibility falls on the primary school teacher, therefore his preparation in the field of environmental education must be adequate. Empirical qualitative research aimed to reveal how future primary school teachers understand the meaning of environmental education, the topic, and what kind of realisation vision they have. 136 students from two Lithuanian universities, future teachers of preschool and primary education participated in the study. Verbal research data were analysed using the quantitative content analysis method. The research results allow us to state that environmental education is treated as significant, the themes of environmental education cover various areas that can and should be studied in primary school. Future teachers' environmental education implementation vision at school includes both cognitive and practical-behavioural components. [For the full proceedings, see ED629086.]",

        "description":"Formal science education is the last stage of acquiring scientific knowledge for most people. They rely on the knowledge acquired at school for the rest of their lives. Therefore, it is important that formal education changes students' colloquial knowledge into scientific knowledge and is correct. The study decided to test three situations. In the first one, it was examined whether formal education actually displaces colloquial knowledge of students. In the second, the level of knowledge acquired at school was compared with the level of extracurricular knowledge. The third examined the durability of knowledge acquired at school, i.e. can school knowledge be changed, e.g. through advertising or popular science publications? The main hypothesis of the research was the assumption that school knowledge eliminates erroneous, clichéd beliefs and is permanent over time. The study tested chemical knowledge related to cooking. 472 people participated in the study and an online questionnaire was used. The research built on previous research on the correlation between scientific knowledge and non-scientific beliefs and pedagogical theories on knowledge transfer. The obtained results did not confirm the main hypothesis. Formal school education turned out to be less effective than non-formal education. It seems, therefore, that school education should not focus on facts that students forget and that change during their informal (lifelong) education. Rather, it should focus on the ability to independently construct knowledge. [For the full proceedings, see ED629086.]",

However, studies on students' opinions about holograms in chemistry teaching and learning are scarce. The research aimed to examine the views of chemistry students on the application of 3D holograms in organic chemistry learning at the university level. In this cross-sectional study, 55 first-year chemistry students at the University of Novi Sad (Serbia) participated. The sample consisted of students aged 18-20, of which 85.5% were female and 14.5% were male. An online questionnaire designed for this research was used to collect quantitative data. Data obtained after an eight-week application of 3D holograms in organic chemistry classes revealed that students have a positive opinion about the application of 3D holograms in organic chemistry classes. Therefore, the research results imply that teachers should apply 3D holograms in chemistry classes.

Input has been found to interact with other factors, such as learner cognitive skills and the circumstances where language is heard. Language learning itself has sometimes been found to enhance cognitive skills. Indeed, intensive contact with another language has been found to sometimes boost cognitive skills, even in intensive instructed settings, such as immersion programs (bilingual advantage hypothesis). In this paper, we report a cross-sectional study to assess grammar learning of 79 fourth grade German students learning L2 English in two immersion schools. Verbal teacher input was assessed using the Teacher Input Observation Scheme (TIOS, Items 14-25), and the learners' L2 grammar comprehension was tested with the ELIAS Grammar Test II. Cognitive skills, including phonological awareness, working memory, and non-verbal intelligence, were determined using standardized assessment procedures. The results show that verbal input quantity and quality correlated significantly with the learners' L2 grammar comprehension. None of the cognitive skills moderated the effect of input on grammar comprehension but all predicted it independently. The combination of L2 input and phonological awareness was found to be the most robust predictor of L2 grammar comprehension.",

Given this, the present research was conducted with a group of deaf students in the 7th year of elementary school with the aim of verifying what ideas these students had about science. The research was carried out with a qualitative approach, using action research. For data collection, an activity was proposed with the elaboration of drawings, carried out in three stages: (1) initial conversation and elaboration of the drawings; (2) explanation of the drawings (in Libras); (3) closure of the activity. Drawings were prepared, speeches (in Libras) transcribed and notes from the logbook were used for analysis. The analyzed data revealed three categories in which students conceived decontextualized views, also demonstrating a distance from science and applications in everyday life. In relation to the visuality of the deaf student, the difficulty was evidenced in selecting and interpreting the various information that was conveyed around them.

        "description":"With the rapid advancement of technology, education is undergoing a transformational change. Chatbots have become increasingly popular in recent years and are being utilized as teaching assistants to support teachers and students in various ways. However, little research has been done on the skills required by teachers to prepare curriculum content using chatbots. The research aims to identify the skills teachers need to prepare curriculum content with chatbots. It examines the fundamental and cognitive skills individuals need to interpret content generated by chatbots and explores the difference between self-assessment and evaluator-based assessment. Fifty-eight third-year students, pre-service teachers, in the Elementary education program attempted to write a lesson plan using ChatGPT and completed a questionnaire to assess the skills required. Their communication with the chatbot as well as their prepared lesson plans were reviewed by an evaluator who rated the skills of the participating pre-service teachers. Results indicate that preservice teachers tend to overestimate their skills required to interpret chatbot-generated content compared to the evaluator's ratings. Such discrepancies could lead to inaccurate or incomplete assessments of their skills, which could hinder their potential for growth and development. [For the full proceedings, see ED629086.]",

Important topics are promoted to students in various approaches, addressing nowadays problems, answering scientific questions, or trying to make them aware of sensible issues. In this respect, the topic of plastics biodegradability embraced the clothes of a Science action, a format based on the Care-Know-Do model, proposed in the frame of the CONNECT project. Having the view to evaluating the students' interest in science after the implementation of the project-designed science actions, the partnership proposed a 5-point Likert scale instrument. In Romania, 373 students who participated in the Biodegradable Plastics action expressed their feedback, underlining--in an important proportion--their strong confidence in science, being ready to participate in collaborative science projects or benefit from their family support who consider that understanding and knowing science is useful for the entire life. Moreover, the students offered positive feedback related to teachers' ability to emphasize the importance of science for their life and future, but also in society, in general.

A content analysis was conducted using data mining on a major online portal in Korea. It examined the characteristics of creating and consuming content on evolution through the online portal service based on analyzing the number of posts related to biological evolution and active participants. It also discussed the feasibility of automatic document classification to distinguish between scientific understanding and nonscientific beliefs on the evolution and related online circulating contents.

Atomic structure, bonding, and associated properties are taught as parts of high school chemistry courses worldwide. The cumulative build-up of misconceptions about the periodic table is to blame for students' poor performance on atoms and bonding-related topics. This is primarily due to a lack of appropriate cognitive abilities. The periodic table is a fundamental organizing principle in chemistry that high school students are introduced to. The purpose of this study is to determine the commonalities among learners' misconceptions about various aspects of the periodic table in two distinct countries. This study had two objectives. To begin with, it demonstrated if learners from different locations developed the same type of alternate concepts. Second, it aided in discovering the most prevalent alternate conceptions in learners' minds regarding the periodic table. This study enrolled 97 students from India and 78 students from South Africa. The quantitative data for this investigation were gathered using a modified BRI. It is noticed that, despite disparities in their social environments, high school students generally possess similar alternate conceptions that act as a learning barrier at their higher level of learning.",

Consequently, a highly motivated workforce with skills in science and engineering is key to any prosperous economy. Science education has a critical role in providing scientific literacy to students, as well as in training young people to choose careers linked to STEM education. Understanding the science concepts and their application is nowadays challenging for students, due to lack of interest and motivation. &quot;Science is not for me&quot; is, unfortunately, a frequent phrase heard when discussing with young people. It is clear that the way science is taught must be adapted to the student's profile and needs. In this respect, in Romania, the CONNECT project comes to meet this gap by designing and implementing four structured scenarios, embracing the format of Science actions. In order to evaluate the impact of each Science action in terms of students' perceptions and attitudes concerning science, an instrument based on a 5-point Likert scale was developed in the frame of the project partnership. The feedback of 83 students who participated in the Rewilding Science action was collected, being emphasized that students are feeling more confident to solve problems in science and consider that learning science is enjoyable, even learning science is not easy. Although the majority of the respondents would like to do projects with others using science to improve the world, they -- in the same ratio -- would not like to be seen as experts in science.

Illustrations play a big role in the acquisition of the course material, especially if those help to make the interpretation of the textual content easier. Hybrid illustrations are made up of combinations of realistic images (photographs, drawings) with abstract conventional elements (symbols, models, chemical equations). This type of illustration fuses difficult-tointerpret symbols often found in chemistry with everyday images that bring students closer to the content. The following study examines the use of digitally edited hybrid illustrations in interactive learning tasks that were used in the review and practice lessons on the Hydrocarbons topic in eighth-grade organic chemistry classes. The research took place in an experimental group of students from primary school in Novi Sad (Republic of Serbia), during which the students solved the given tasks on their cell phones via the Moodle platform. In the control group, teaching and learning took place in the traditional, or conventional way applying a lecture and a discussion method. After processing the Hydrocarbons topic, the experimental and control groups underwent the same testing process, the results of which prove the advantages of using the tasks created with the help of digital hybrid illustrations in the abstract parts of the curriculum.

This research aimed to determine the differences in graphic illustrations in the contents of natural sciences in a regular textbook and a textbook for children with special educational needs in the Republic of Serbia. As the number of subjects that deal with the contents of natural sciences for children with special educational needs is small, as well as the number of schools that implement this type of teaching, physics is taken as a subject, because the number of common topics is quite similar. The research aim was to analyze illustrations in selected physics textbooks for the 6th grade of primary education, by the criteria for dividing illustrations by types, for determining abstractness and relative representation of illustrations. In addition, a supplementary classification of illustrations was applied. The obtained results indicate that the number of illustrations concerning the number of words is higher in textbooks for children with special educational needs, as well as that the most represented are illustrations from everyday life and greater abstraction compared to regular textbooks. Since the physics textbook for children with disabilities is quite old, these results can be examined in practice among teachers and help future textbook authors to write the best quality textbook taking into account the needs of teachers and children with special educational needs.

To address this gap, we systematically examine news reports, department of education data, and publicly-available information on teacher shortages for every state in the U.S. We find there are at least 36,000 vacant positions along with at least 163,000 positions being held by underqualified teachers, both of which are conservative estimates of the extent of teacher shortages nationally.

        "description":"The US teaching force remains disproportionately white while the student body grows more diverse. It is therefore important to understand how and under what conditions white teachers learn racial competency. This study applies a mixed-methods approach to investigate the hypothesis that Black peers improve white teachers' effectiveness when teaching Black students. The quantitative portion of this study relies on longitudinal data from North Carolina to show that having a Black same-grade peer significantly improves the achievement and reduces the suspension rates of white teachers' Black students. These effects are persistent over time and largest for novice teachers. Qualitative evidence from open-ended interviews of North Carolina public school teachers reaffirms these findings. Broadly, our findings suggest that the positive impact of Black teachers' ability to successfully teach Black students is not limited to their direct interaction with Black students but is augmented by spillover effects on early-career white teachers, likely through peer learning.",

        "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic upended the U.S. education system and the economy in ways that dramatically affected the jobs of K-12 educators. However, data limitations have led to considerable uncertainty and conflicting reports about the nature of staffing challenges in schools. We draw on education employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and State Education Agencies (SEA) to describe patterns in K-12 education employment and to highlight the limitations of available data. Data from the BLS suggest overall employment in the K-12 labor market declined by 9.3 percent at the onset of the pandemic and remains well below pre-pandemic levels. SEA data suggest that teachers have not (yet) left the profession in mass as many predicted, but that turnover decreased in the summer of 2020. We explore possible explanations for these patterns including (1) weak hiring through the summer of 2020 and (2) high attrition among K-12 instructional support staff. State vacancy data also suggest that schools are facing substantial challenges filling open positions during the 2021-22 academic year. Our analyses illustrate the imperative to build more timely, detailed, and nationally representative data systems on the K-12 education labor market to better inform policy.",

Enrolling in the program increases the probability of having an active nursing license by 59 percentage points within three years.

        "description":"Learning causes relatively a permanent change in one's behavior. There are multiple paradigms in the theories of learning, the latest theory in this group being Constructivism. This particular theory postulates that a learner himself/herself constructs his/her learning through an active and consistent engagement. This theory also brings the learning process to the center, where the concerned learner's prior experience is used as the base for future learning. Although quality learning is the global agenda in the 21st century, there is still no clear and concise definition. Quality of learning has diverse connotations. Researchers in this area search for it in its process as well as in its product. However, one may say the quality learning process motivates a student to have a deep engagement with the learning task possible through some suitable strategies. Kevin Warburton (2009) identified three main factors that greatly impact a student's motivation, leading to high or low engagement in the learning activity. A conducive learning environment, sophisticated course content, and favorable individual factors could enhance the student's motivation and make him/her have a deep engagement in the learning activity. The product of quality learning is measured by the nature and versatility of the learning outcome. The learning, which is extensive, integrative, and generative, may fulfill the rising demand for quality of learning.",

The research focused particularly on what role technologies such as text-to-speech apps, translators, electronic dictionaries, online reading apps and websites, etc., can play on students' reading, how they can impact students reading, and how they are perceived by students, teachers, and parents. At the end, the author provides some suggestions to consider for an effective use of these technologies.",

        "description":"In an era where the English language has become dominant in all fields and is the prevailing language worldwide, many Arab parents and intellectuals are wondering about the optimal age to start teaching their children English. Should they speak to their children in English at an early age? Should they enrol their children in a pre-school that teaches English only? What is the effect of teaching English to children in kindergarten on their learning of Arabic and their academic achievement in later stages? This study aimed to survey the opinions of a sample of mothers regarding the teaching of English to young children. The results of interviews with a sample of 300 mothers representing all segments of society showed that 70% of the mothers believe that the best age to teach children English is between four and five years old. 70% prefer to enrol their children in a kindergarten that teaches English, and 50% prefer to use a mix of English and Arabic languages when speaking with their children at home. About 70% believe that teaching English to children at an early age has no negative effect on their learning of Arabic simultaneously and has a positive effect on their academic achievement in later stages of education. The study also revealed some misconceptions among mothers about the optimal age for learning English, the effect of learning English on young children's Arabic language skills and academic achievement, and that the reason weakness of junior and senior high school students in English is due to not studying English at an early age. The researcher reviewed the results of previous studies on children and first and second language acquisition in several countries around the world acquiring a second foreign language alongside their mother tongue, the impact of learning a second language on their learning and acquisition of their mother tongue, academic achievement, and factors that lead to successful foreign language learning.",

This is a summary of a literature review that provides an overview of the research on GYO educator programs as a potential strategy for states and district to employ to help recruit and retain teachers of color. It emphasizes equitable approaches and critical perspectives that combine the powerful roles of &quot;homegrown&quot; teachers, culturally-relevant curriculum, and social justice pedagogy in addressing the achievement and opportunity gaps, especially for the nation's woefully underserved, largely urban schools serving students of color (e.g., Rivkin, Hanushek, &amp; Kain, 2005; Sanders &amp; Rivers, 1996). A growing body of scholarship underscores the value of recruiting people from communities that could successfully transition as teachers to the very communities from which they emanate (Fenwick, 2001; Gist, Bianco, &amp; Lynn, in press; Skinner, Garreton, &amp; Schultz, 2011; Valenzuela, 2016).

        "description":"Human language and cognition do not develop independently of each other but are intricately intertwined in various ways. This contribution presents the interplay between linguistic and cognitive abilities of learners at the individual level and relates them to the level of external contextual factors in social and educational environments. In empirical research, it is important to differentiate between so-called proximal and distal external factors: A causal effect on the individual learner can be primarily assumed through the direct stimulation of proximal factors, i.e., in personal interaction (Proximity of Stimulation approach, Kersten 2020, 2023). Therefore, external factors should be differentiated and special attention should be given to the proximal factors as direct influencing factors in empirical studies. This contribution begins with some terminological clarifications. In the following section, the connections between individual linguistic and cognitive development are discussed using selected variables in both directions (internal perspective). Initially, findings regarding the influence of multilingualism on cognitive abilities are examined, followed by the influence of cognitive abilities on L2 acquisition in the reverse direction. Finally, the contribution focuses on external contextual factors. Findings on family contextual factors such as linguistic and social background are presented. Lastly, educational contextual factors are explored, particularly discussing whether and how instructional factors can contribute to creating conducive conditions for mutual development in both domains, cognition and language, and potentially compensating for disadvantaged learner groups (cf. Kersten 2019).

This research focuses on the current state of Mendeleev eponyms in the context of education and ethnocentrism, addressing their usage in various languages, their educational value, cases of questioned priority and copyright violation in Mendeleev major eponyms--periodic table and periodic system. 106 chemistry textbooks in 4 languages including Soviet-time and current Russian textbooks were perused to identify and trace Mendeleev eponyms over 1924-2016. Advanced Google Search with queries in Belarusian, English, Latvian, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian was conducted to evaluate online presence of eponyms &quot;Mendeleev periodic table&quot; and &quot;Mendeleev periodic system.&quot; It was found that while Mendeleev eponyms occur generously on the Internet, periodic table and system with Mendeleev's name attached are seldom used on non-Russian webpages. Most Mendeleev eponyms were made up in the USSR and remain popular and Russia, which can be explained within the framework of ethnocentrism as a ruling tendency. Recognizing Mendeleev's priority, Flinn and Ross's periodic systems can be considered plagiarized; a few factors might favor their emergence, but ethnocentrism is unlikely to be one of them. Mendeleev eponyms remain valuable assets for science education, acting as shortcuts to the history of science and actualizing interdisciplinary connections.

In 2012, the Taiwanese government enacted a new national curriculum framework for early childhood education to enhance the quality of early childhood education programs. This new framework is key competence-oriented, meaning preschool educators must focus on children's learning and inquiry processes when designing the curriculum. A series of projects collecting information on the quality of the learning environment and learning outcomes of children aged 2 to 9, called the Early Childhood Learning Database, was built to understand the effectiveness of the curriculum reform. As a longitudinal study, young children's learning is long-term tracked and analyzed to understand the authentic situation and relevant factors to form a policy for optimizing education quality. The preliminary analysis confirmed the positive influence of the new curriculum. [For the full proceedings, see ED629086.]",

Using detailed financial data from the academic years 2004 to 2020, we analyze the longer-term effects of the GR on a broader array of U.S. public school district finances. Employing both difference-in-differences and event study approaches, our results indicate that public school expenditures and unspent end-of-year fund balances recovered and eventually exceeded pre-GR levels on an inflation-adjusted and per-student basis. However, the funding increases were heterogeneous such that districts receiving larger shares of funding from states were less successful at increasing spending and fund balances through 2020--more than ten years after the GR officially ended. Our empirical strategy survives a host of robustness checks. This pattern is concerning as more state-dependent districts tend to have higher proportions of disadvantaged students.",

This study was qualitative and employed a case study approach, and standard open-ended interviews were used to obtain data from the district education officers, headteachers, teachers, and parents to teen mothers. The study's findings imply that the re-entry policy implementation in the selected secondary schools is not practical to a high degree. The study findings further indicated that the policy is silent, and there is no awareness of the policy in secondary schools due to unclear policy goals and objectives. The study findings also indicated no sense of ownership of the policy by stakeholders responsible for implementing the policy. Further, the study concluded that secondary schools' policy implementation is not practical because there are no clear stated objectives, implementation and monitoring strategies, financial, human, and legal resources. Hence, this study recommended that the Ministry of General Education redesign the policy, including all stakeholders in the formulation process, and clearly state its goals and objectives to ensure future successful implementation.",

        "description":"Targeted instruction is one of the most effective educational interventions in low- and middle-income countries, yet reported impacts vary by an order of magnitude. We study this variation by aggregating evidence from prior randomized trials across five contexts, and use the results to inform a new randomized trial. We find two factors explain most of the heterogeneity in effects across contexts: the degree of implementation (intention-to-treat or treatment-on-the-treated) and program delivery model (teachers or volunteers). Accounting for these implementation factors yields high generalizability, with similar effect sizes across studies. Thus, reporting treatment-on-the-treated effects, a practice which remains limited, can enhance external validity. We also introduce a new Bayesian framework to formally incorporate implementation metrics into evidence aggregation. Results show targeted instruction delivers average learning gains of 0.42 SD when taken up and 0.85 SD when implemented with high fidelity. To investigate how implementation can be improved in future settings, we run a new randomized trial of a targeted instruction program in Botswana. Results demonstrate that implementation can be improved in the context of a scaling program with large causal effects on learning. While research on implementation has been limited to date, our findings and framework reveal its importance for impact evaluation and generalizability.

The estimator can be thought of as extrapolating the traditional fuzzy regression discontinuity estimate or as an observational study that adjusts for endogenous selection into treatment using information at the discontinuity. We show that it can be motivated as being the least complex model consistent with the data or as an estimator that is preferable to both a traditional regression discontinuity design and an observational study. We further show theoretically that no other estimators consistently generate better estimates than our proposed estimator. We then use this approach to examine the effects of early grade retention beyond the compliers around the retention cutoff. We show that the benefits of early grade retention policies are larger for students with lower baseline achievement and smaller for low-performing students who are exempt from retention. These findings imply that: (1) the benefits of early grade retention policies are larger than have been estimated using traditional fuzzy regression discontinuity designs; and (2) retaining additional students would have a limited effect on student outcomes.",

In 1854 Hermann Hemlholtz gave a popular lecture on the recent discovery that energy is conserved. Such lecture is used as a guide to introduce the pupils within several nuances of this concept. Not much mathematics is used, so Helmholtz's work, with several additions proposed here, is an excellent guide to understanding, from a qualitative point of view, the reasons that led scientists to establish the principle of conservation of energy. At the same time, it allows us to grasp two other concepts which are fundamental in reference to energy: work and heat. This panorama will be drawn in the first section. In the second one, some more mathematical and physical details on the teaching of energy in mechanics and thermodynamics will be offered. Finally, in the Conclusion, the interdisciplinary value of a historical approach to physics education will be pointed out. [For the full proceedings, see ED629086.]",

        "description":"Today's trend is the use of information technology in all areas of our lives. Emotions are a basic human characteristic, although they are difficult to define, recognise and classify. Proper assessment and recognition of human emotions can lead to a better understanding of user behaviour. The aforementioned technologies can also be used as a suitable teaching aid, which forms the core of the research and is able to guarantee an increase in the success rate of the teaching process itself in terms of students' understanding of the learning materials. The aim of the research was the use of sensor networks as an element of information and communication technologies in the educational process. Using the possibility of measuring physiological functions through smart wristbands in order to identify changes in students' emotional states. The overall proposed system was able to identify changes in students' emotional state, specifically levels of arousal. Based on the results from the proposed system, teachers should be able to adjust their teaching style in specific situations to suit the students and provide a basis for better teaching and learning.

Technological developments paved the way for a shift in skills requirements from learners which is termed as 21st century skills. This study utilized a comprehensive literature review to investigate the current issues and concerns in instructional supervision and assessment. It also determined conditions that would make these processes effective vis-à-vis the needs of the current times. The study showed that there is a need for a collaborative and trust-based type of supervision. There should be regularity, continuity, and quality in supervision with a provision for adequate funding and capacity building. For instructional assessment, a HOTS-based assessment in conformity with international assessment standards is appropriate to the current times. An online or e-assessment should also be considered.",

The study group consists of a total of 645 students, of whom are 429 female and 216 male, who are studying in different departments and come from different age groups. The Nomophobia Scale (NMP-Q) was used to determine the effect of variables on the nomophobia of university students. One-way ANOVA, simple and multiple regression analysis technique were used in the analysis of the data. Findings of the study showed that there was no significant difference between the duration of smartphone ownership and the level of nomophobia among college students, whereas the level of nomophobia was higher among the students who check the smartphone more frequently than during the day. Furthermore, according to the results of multiple regression analysis, variables such as duration of mobile internet ownership in terms of years, duration of daily mobile internet use and GSM mobile internet quota are predictive of the nomophobia prevalence of university students. Among these three variables, it is determined that the most predictive level of nomophobia is the daily mobile internet use.",

        "description":"Background and Aim of Study: The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected education systems dramatically. Remote teaching/learning practices have become everyday reality across the globe. The aim of the study: to assess the level of readiness of higher education stakeholders for distance learning/remote teaching, and to evaluate the role of social distancing measures. Material and Methods: 594 stakeholders (216 teachers and 378 students) provided anonymous responses to a questionnaire. Teacher did so during the round table discussion during the 6th International Academic Conference &quot;Psychological and Pedagogical Problems of Modern Specialist Formation&quot; (June 2020). Students responded using Viber, WhatsApp, and Telegram. Validation by Pearson method X[superscript 2] produced statistically significant results (df=4, X[superscript 2 subscript 2]=22.083, ?&lt;0.01; df=4, X[superscript 2 subscript 3]=44.389, ?&lt;0.01; df=4, X[superscript 2 subscript 4]=29.666, ?&lt;0.01). Results: 62.9% of teachers and 56.6% of students consider educational institutions ready for distance learning. The majority of teachers/students seem to be prepared for it (81.0% and 93.4% respectively). 68.5% of teachers are positive about educational outcomes (contrasted with 90.0% of students). Only 37.0% of teachers and 21.7% of students assess the impact of social distancing measures on physical and mental health positively. Conclusions: The survey results prove that social distancing measures impact on higher education is significant. The respondents assess highly their individual levels of preparedness and of satisfaction, students displaying higher levels of both. However, the view on social distancing measures impact on physical and mental health is more negative, the trend being more visible in student responses.",

        "author":["Dee, Thomas S."],
        "description":"Over the first two school years under the COVID-19 pandemic, K-12 enrollment in public schools decreased dramatically--with losses concentrated among the youngest students--and the pandemic has had historically unprecedented effects on available learning opportunities. Little is known about where these students went and what learning environments they are experiencing. Understanding the diverse character of these effects has not been straightforward. The pandemic has complicated the comparability of many conventional education indicators and conventional data from administrators, and surveys on student experiences are often available only after long delays. The data reveal that two of the primary explanations for the public school pandemic exodus are an increase in homeschooling and a decrease in the school-age population. But these two trends cannot explain the entire enrollment drop. The large amount of public school enrollment loss that, in many states, cannot be explained by changes in nonpublic enrollment and demographics suggests the possibility of other developmentally relevant behaviors (e.g., kindergarten skipping, unregistered homeschooling, and truancy) that merit further research.",

Unsolicited responses to a Twitter survey from 172 male and female adult Arabs with different ages, educational levels and areas of specialty showed that 13.5% use reading technologies, 15% prefer to listen audiobooks, and 71.5% read paper books. 16% read an hour a day; the majority read less than an hour a day and 13% read whenever they can. Some read 10 pages a day; others finish three chapters/articles a week; 14% read before bedtime; 15% listen to audiobooks while driving, working out, walking, cooking, and running errands; 5% read during wait times; 4% read before they start work; 3% read during their break at work; 3% read in the afternoon; 3% read after sunset prayer, and over the weekend. Some carry their Kindle device with them and read anywhere. To reduce distractions, 23% set a specific time for reading; 12% stay away from their smart phones or turn their mobiles to the silent mode; 6% read in a quiet place; 6% use a timer; 3% drink coffee to focus; 2% listen to music; and some use a pencil and paper to take notes and underline. No significant differences were found among respondents in terms of gender, area of specialty, educational level, the type of material read, reading technologies and applications they use, how much time they allocate to reading, where they read, how they reduce distractions, how they motivate themselves to read, their reading rituals and how they interact with the reading material. The study gave recommendations for encouraging the young generation to read in the age of social media and distractions and which technologies help them develop better reading habits.",

Variables such as age group (p = 0.05), enjoying class (p &lt; 0.001), hours spent for an online class in a day (p = 0.05), and period for educational work using an electronic device (p = 0.1) were found significant with satisfaction level using both bivariate test and inferential test of univariate binary logistics regression.

Each community planned cross-sector convenings to inspire action that would result in the approaches to learning that prioritize young people's growth and development. Just as their work was getting underway, the communities' efforts were unexpectedly and indelibly shaped by the upheaval of the past year--including the global pandemic and national reckoning with racism. The five communities in the How Learning Happens Community Convening Cohort were: (1) Nashville After Zone Alliance (Nashville, TN); (2) Parents for Public Schools -- San Francisco (San Francisco, CA); (3) Rennie Center for Education Research &amp; Policy and Transforming Education (Boston, MA); (4) Spartanburg Academic Movement (Spartanburg, SC); and (5) The Whole Child Connection at the Children's Institute (Rochester, NY). As a group, the community organizations' efforts were fueled by a reawakened appreciation for holistic and coordinated approaches to learning and development. The organizations and their communities also became more squarely focused on the themes of anti-racism and belonging and more intentionally centered on the perspectives of young people. The brief shares three major lessons learned across the communities: (1) Equity must be an explicit desired outcome of all social, emotional, and cognitive programming; (2) Shifting Adult Practice Requires Time and Space for Adult Self-Care; and (3) Youth Voice is a Crucial Influence in Transforming Learning Environments. This brief also explores unique strategies each community took to support young people over the last year and offers insights into cross-sector partnerships allowed these convenings to have a longer impact.",

We use a school's location to impute its catchment area by aggregating the nearest &quot;n&quot; census block groups such that the number of school-aged children in those &quot;n&quot; block groups is just over the number of students enrolled in that school. We then weight census data by the number of school-aged children in the block-group to estimate school-level measures. We conduct several robustness checks to assess the quality of our estimates and find that our method is broadly successful in replicating known school-level characteristics and producing unbiased estimates for school-level income. This method expands the available set of school-level variables to the broader and richer set of characteristics measured in the census, which can then be used to conduct descriptive and observational research across a long time horizon.",

While more teachers of color are being recruited than in years past, their turnover rates are high, in part due to inadequate preparation and mentoring, poor working conditions, and displacement from the high-need schools they teach in, where accountability strategies can include reconstituting staff or closing schools rather than investing in improvements. Increasing the number of teachers of color in the workforce requires both intentional preparation and hiring and provision of ongoing support to overcome the barriers to recruitment and retention described in the literature review. Fortunately, programs and initiatives across the country provide evidence that an intentional and sustained approach to recruiting and retaining teachers of color can be successful. This document describes policy strategies for state and local education agencies aimed at overcoming barriers to recruiting and retaining teachers of color.

        "description":"This literature review summarizes research and policy considerations regarding the connection between housing and school segregation. This relationship was an early and consistent theme in civil rights law, emerging in key school desegregation cases in the 1970s and in implementation of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. But since that time, the divide between school and housing policy has only grown wider, with little effort to formally link these policy areas. The review begins by surveying historical accounts of discriminatory housing, school, land use, and transportation policies. It then details social science research into reciprocal effects -- in other words the ways that housing and school policies interact to reinforce segregation. Finally, we discuss policy proposals -- past and present -- to coordinate housing, school and transportation policy in support of integration. [For the accompanying bibliography, see ED629236.

This is especially felt by young people who should continue studying at universities in these difficult conditions. The aim of the study: To identify the specifics of psychotraumatic impact in the conditions of war and martial law on university students and cadets, to detail their level of stress, anxiety and depression. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in November 2022 based on KNUIA, Ukraine. Respondents aged 20-27 were divided into 3 groups: 1) 115 cadets: 85.22% men and 14.78% women, who are outside of permanent deployment; 2) 107 students: 59.81% men and 40.19% women, who are forcibly displaced persons in Ukraine and abroad; 3) 103 students: 50.49% men and 49.51% women, located in Kharkiv and Kharkiv region. A Google-form questionnaire was used to study the level and nature of psychotraumatization. Data collection on the level of stress and its content was carried out using the DASS-21 tool. Results: Among the group 3 respondents, the psychotraumatic impact is characterized by high tension and the specific weight of vital psychogenia. Severe and extremely severe manifestations of anxiety in group 3 students were 2-3 times higher than the similar indicators of groups 1, 2 respondents. Manifestations of depression among women are the highest in group 3 respondents. Stress was more expressed among men in all groups. Group 3 respondents had the highest stress indicators among men. Conclusions: The negative impact of the war in Ukraine on the student youth' mental health requires the active implementation of psychological assistance and psychoprophylaxis measures in accordance with the individual results of psychodiagnostics.",

The aim of the study: to identify the particularities of psychological well-being and social adaptation of students and cadets in wartime conditions. Materials and Methods: Our study was conducted among the students and cadets of two Ukrainian universities (KNUIA, UzhNU) in 2023, February. 327 participants were divided into 3 groups: 1) 112 cadets whose permanent disposition was changed in Ukraine; 2) 108 students who were displaced and who are in Ukraine and EU countries; 3) 107 students who did not change their place of permanent residence and who are in Ukraine in the combat zone or near it. The 28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) to assess psychological well-being and emotional stability, and the Social Support Questionnaire (F-SozU K-22) to determine the particularities of emotional support, practical support, and social integration were used in the study. Appropriate internal consistency values (Cronbach a between 0.817 and 0.903) were found for both scales. Results: Group 1 has the best general health indicator: 1.65 times better than Group 3. The levels of somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia are lower in Group 1 (practically the same in women and men), and higher in Group 3. The highest rates of social dysfunction are found in Group 3. Men in all groups have more pronounced social dysfunction; women in all groups have more pronounced severe depression. Group 1 total perceived social support is 1.89 times better than Group 3. Emotional support, social integration are highest in Group 1, practical support is highest in Group 2. Conclusions: The lowest levels of psychological well-being and social adaptation were found in Group 3. This is probably due to uncertainty about the future, constant instability and insecurity. Teachers and psychologists are urged to consider the identified psychological and social peculiarities in the educational and clinical process when dealing with young students.",

        "description":"Collecting data on learners' performance in different chemistry contents and analysing them to identify their knowledge and understanding in related content areas is a major task of Chemistry Education Research. The data collection process on the learners' content knowledge and understanding of content knowledge requires a standard measuring tool. The preparation of standardized tools for measuring academic achievement requires computer software. All software used in the standardization of a tool comes at a cost and requires training for the researcher involved in handling the situation, which can impede the smooth running of a project. The same was the situation when the author was working on modifying the bonding representations inventory (BRI) for its local use in South Africa. The data analysis laboratory was situated in a different city, 500 km away from the researcher's field of work. Owing to the long distance and communication delay, the author was concerned with delays in the project. It is known that necessity, which can create an opportunity. The Microsoft Excel (MS-Excel) platform was used for standardizing the modified BRI because MS-Excel is available as a standard in MS-Office on the Windows platform. This paper presents a fact. That, a tool can be standardized by using MS-Excel without any complexity.",

The sample consisted of 272 educated Arabs (81% males and 19% females) who are Twitter users, who gave 437 responses to questions, hashtags and threads asking, &quot;which digital media and digital devices do you use for reading, why, the advantages and disadvantages of digital reading vs reading from paper material&quot;. Data analysis showed that 71.5% of educated Arabs in the sample read traditional printed books and 28.5% read digitally and use digital reading technologies as follows: 15% listen to audiobooks, 6.5% use Kindle, and 7% use e-Ink, Audible, Storytel, Feedly, text-to-speech software (Read Aloud, Natural Reader Pro and Kurzweil 1000), Instapaper, Evernote, Raindrop, Pocket, Siri, eBooks, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Tarteel, Wajeez, Sibawayh Reader, and Screen Readers such as JAWS, Window Eyes, VoiceOver, Thunder, and HAL by blind students. Digital readers in this study use smart phones, iPads, tablets, and computer screens and are familiar with digital document formats such as Pdf, Epub, Mobi, IPA and AZW. The percentage of educated Arabs who use digital reading and reading technologies and apps is small, taking into consideration that many Arab people have access to the Internet and have a smart phone, a desktop or laptop computer and should be able to access a plethora of reading apps, digital resources, and reading technologies. It seems that many educated Arabs are not familiar with digital reading, eBooks, e-libraries, online reading resources, reading technologies and applications. Digital readers gave some explanations for their preferences and how they use digital media reading, when and where. Some recommendations for familiarizing children, students and the public with digital reading and reading technologies are given.",

Intelligence increases as vocabulary continues to develop. The iSpy program provides high-quality, content-rich classroom books, learning manipulatives, and PreK teacher resources to increase early literacy access and enhance story telling and play-based learning opportunities. Engaging, informative books and exploratory tools are also distributed to families of the PreK children to ex tend literacy experiences and science and math exploration at home. Such evidence-based experiences build conceptual understandings and foundational literacies to set preschool children up for future vocabulary and comprehension success across the disciplines. RMC Research Corporation is an evaluation of the iSpy program. In fall 2021, RMC sent out pre-surveys to parents/caregivers and teachers considering signing up for the program. The surveys asked about relevant literacy activities adults were participating in with their PreK children and students. Selected survey findings and next steps are presented in this report.

During this time, institutions have increased the proportions of their instruction delivered in online and blended formats. They have also made greater use of digital technologies in the classroom and increased the adoption of digital materials, replacing print. This study examines the nature and extent of this transformation in two-year community colleges, using responses to the Digital Learning Pulse Survey (DLPS). The DLPS project began in the spring of 2020 and has completed seven data collection rounds. Designed to document the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on U.S. higher education, the project has investigated the massive changes that forced faculty, administrators, and students to adjust to new ways of conducting their day-to-day operations. This report examines four aspects of the digital transformation process: the use of technology in classes, moving from print to digital course materials, offering courses as a mix of online and in-person (blended or hybrid), and delivering fully online courses.",

This report summarizes the current state of student well-being across participating D.C. schools. It is intended to aid educators, policymakers, and communities in interpreting the survey results, tracking progress over time, and identifying strengths and areas for growth.

In this report, the authors conducted case studies of career pathways initiatives in Texas, Ohio, and Colorado to better understand the triumphs and challenges inherent in creating and operating career pathways programs amid a rapidly changing policy context. Through research and interviews with education stakeholders, the authors gathered meaningful insight into how legislators, policymakers, and program operators build high-quality programs and overcome barriers. The report examines the implementation of career pathways programs in these states to surface themes about the factors that support and hinder implementation, and to identify recommendations for state policymakers interested in supporting these programs. The recommendations include policy changes and practical administrative retooling that will have the greatest impact on improving pathways programs in these states and across the country.",

ESAs allow parents to spend public education funding on expenses such as private school tuition, tutoring, and homeschooling curricula. However the vast majority of students nationwide (84 percent) still attend traditional public schools--and will for the foreseeable future. Conservatives would be wise to support policies that give families choice within the public education system. The authors argue that cross-district open enrollment does precisely that, and it has strong bipartisan support. One state where families are reaping the benefits of open enrollment is Wisconsin.

Discipline policies and practices should reinforce these values, particularly safety and belonging. Unfortunately, ineffective discipline practices that punish students harshly and take them away from the classroom -- like suspensions, alternative school placements, corporal punishment, referrals to law enforcement, and expulsions -- are prevalent in U.S. schools. This technical assistance package and literature review is designed to help school leaders and educators identify ways to proactively build safe and trusting communities and end their reliance on approaches to discipline that are harmful to students. This report also addresses the persistent disparities in the administration of school discipline that target students of color, students with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ students. These troubling disparities demand interventions for the educators and administrators who are determining how and who to punish. It is critical to remember that disparities in punishment may be a reflection of adult bias and lack of training, rather than an indication of the prevalence of challenging student behaviors.",

In addition, it provides some specific ideas for how to support protected groups or students who are more likely to be targeted due to some aspect of their identity.

Millions of young children across the globe had to quickly adjust to innovations in technology that support cognitive development. The coaches and educators at the Quality Early Education System (QEES) in Hillsborough County-a comprehensive, multiagency effort to support the individuals involved in caring for young children aged birth to 5--had no idea how these children would acclimate. We are often too quick to underestimate the flexibility and resilience of young children. This past school year, they reinvented their classrooms and the programs we have built to support early learners, their families, and the educators that work with them. The Year 3 evaluation will provide insight into how the program components continue to develop to meet the needs of young children and the early learning community. In 2020-21, QEES delivered onsite support to 256 ECE providers throughout Hillsborough County, the third largest school district in the state of Florida and eighth largest in the country.

Provided in this toolkit is a set of strategies from which educators might draw to support the work of building bridges with community-based actors to prevent bullying and harassment. The authors want to explicitly note that they consider families key community-based actors; not only are families incredibly knowledgeable about their own student's needs, but they are often the folks who physically bridge the contexts of school and community for youth. The strategies listed work best when integrated into an explicit, multi-tiered effort to improve school culture and climate, such that administrators, teachers, educational support providers, and families are integrated into these efforts.",

But policies and practices have not evolved quickly enough to meet those needs -- and as a result, the system continues to fail far too many young people. In &quot;Levers of Change: How State Policies Support District Innovation,&quot; Bellwether delves into the ways states can support and catalyze innovation in public school districts -- adopting new laws, amending or repealing existing laws, changing policy or regulation, providing funding, or creating new programs. The report identifies seven states that have taken steps to enable innovation in public school districts -- Colorado, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Utah, and Washington -- and explores the lessons they can offer to leaders looking to spark innovation in their schools.",

Indigenous knowledge systems, values, and ways of being are understood and enacted within socio-ecological systems grounded in reciprocal kin relations. This means that for Indigenous peoples, teaching, learning, living, and being in relation with human and more-than-human beings is central to their knowledge systems. The authors worry that forwarding Indigenous pedagogies for educators broadly could result in a romanticization or appropriation of indigeneity, but hope that it will contribute broadly to sustainable and just futures.",

        "description":"Because bullying behaviors occur across the many spaces that exist within schools (e.g., classrooms, gyms, bathrooms, playgrounds, cafeterias), and because students often move between classrooms and teachers, it is critical for schools to take a schoolwide approach to preventing bullying and harassment (Jones &amp; Bouffard, 2012; Bradshaw, 2015). School-level strategies refer to actions that administrators and other school leaders can take to nurture a positive school climate and to prevent bullying and harassment. Therefore, school-based bullying prevention programming must begin with universal efforts, involving all administrators, teachers, counselors and other educational support providers (e.g., bus drivers, cafeteria employees, janitors, office staff). This toolkit provides guidance for school level strategies in the following areas: (1) Guidelines for Building Safer School Climates; (2) Structural Shifts &amp; Restorative Practices that Promote a Positive School Climate; (3) Positive School Culture-Building Strategies; (4) Developing or Updating Anti-Bullying and Anti-Harassment Policies; (5) Addressing Cyberbullying; (6) Intervention Strategies; (7) Dealing with Teachers Who Bully Students; and (8) Informing and Collaborating with Families.",

        "description":"Studies on nonverbal behavior that accompanies speech are common; however, conversation-analytical studies focusing on nonverbal phenomena that can initiate repair on their own is very rare and most of them do not focus on the observations in this study, which are leaning forward and cupping the hand behind the ear. Accordingly, the focus of this study is leaning forward that can initiate repair without any verbal prompts to contribute to the gap in the literature. The data comes from Newcastle University Corpus of Academic Spoken English (NUCASE) data, specifically language learning classrooms which were analyzed in a qualitative and descriptive way from a conversational-analytical perspective. The observations showed that teachers and students created and oriented to the nonverbal moves as an initiator of repair. Also, the analysis of the data indicated that both leaning forward and cupping the hand behind the ear were observed to indicate a hearing problem. Leaning forward can engender repair initiation alone while cupping the hand behind the ear accompanies verbal moves and leaning forward. As for the sequential position, they follow a students' problematic turn but after a silence of a few seconds. So, the student produces a problematic turn, a few seconds lapse and then the teacher uses one of these nonverbal phenomena to indicate that there is a problem.

Of Gateway 8th graders who attended a PLTW high school, the percentage of students who took at least one PLTW course during their high school years decreased from 20% in 201--2012 to 17% in 2012-2013. However, of the Gateway 8th graders who took at least one PLTW course, the percentage of students from both cohorts who earned course credits remained high (&gt;80%).",

        "description":"Objective: To analyze the scope of realization of professional learning communities with teachers and management teams who implemented that intervention during two years in a high school in the south of Chile. Methodology: In this applied research, teachers participated in phases of diagnosis of training needs for professional development. Based on this, a proposal of work sessions theoretically and methodologically linked to the professional learning communities was structured. The proposal was designed and implemented together with the school's management team. After the implementation, the study followed with qualitative interviews and focal groups about the experience conducted with 17 participants; these instances were analyzed by thematic analysis following the phenomenological approach. Analysis of Results: The analyses allowed the emergence of three elements related to professional learning and agency capacity. It was especially evident that teachers recognized their capacity to take charge of their professional learning by considering work routines, focusing on learning as a positive factor among teachers and being important in all phases of a collaborative work design. Conclusions: The findings show that, although specific stimuli, spaces, and moments are required to encourage teachers' work, it is possible to improve based on their own capacities, i.e., within each establishment, there is the possibility of achieving learning for all. This call is addressed to pedagogical leaders, who can modify their roles and adapt to professionals recognized as agents of change.",

Sexuality and equality education are considered areas of relevant pedagogical research and intervention within current educational contexts in view of the violence and inequalities derived from the patriarchal system. Aims. This paper presents the main results of a research study that seeks to analyze the competence in sexuality and equality of university students during teacher training in Spain (Castilla la Mancha University). Method. For this, the study used a quantitative methodology and administered a nine-dimension questionnaire to 371 students. Results. The study revealed the weak acquisition of competence in sexuality and equality and the persistence of stereotyped images of sexualities. Furthermore, these findings show that future teachers have a weak equality-based professional practice due to an educational approach that lacks a gender perspective. Conclusions. The main conclusions highlight the evident formative needs in sexuality and equality and the absence of transforming feminist knowledge. All this can affect the development of quality education in sexuality and equality in students' future educational practices.",

        "description":"Language is a magical key that human beings hold in their hands to open the door of communication. To succeed in communication, formal links are one of the aspects of language that need to be known and used in discourse in addition to the contextual factors (Cook, 1992). Hence, systematic exposure to them is essential for satisfactory language acquisition, and assessment should be in line with this as well. Consequently, this study aimed to reveal whether a national exam English as a foreign language (EFL) learners take include these links. Based on this purpose, English texts taking place in the last five years' national high school exams (LGS) held in Turkey annually were analyzed by the discourse analytical framework of formal links suggested by Cook (1992) as a part of the qualitative design. The analysis indicated that the types of formal links included in majority of the exams were found to be verb forms, parallelism, referring expressions, repetition, ellipsis, and conjunction. Moreover, outnumbering uses of referring expressions and the infrequency of substitution were revealed. In the light of these findings, high school EFL teachers and the material developers in the ministry were suggested to include different types of formal links in their lessons/materials more frequently so that students could internalize such aspects of language at early stages of their EFL learning process and be one step closer to a balanced acquisition process.",

In the existing studies, there are issues especially regarding sample size, methodology, and analyzing different variables. Hence, this study recruits more participants from different institutions and investigates the effects of five variables, which are gender, grade, daily amount of time spent on digital platforms, the most used device, and year of digital platform use. The participants were 186 pre-service teachers from Türkiye. The quantitative data were collected via the Digital Literacy Scale and analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 25.0 via independent samples t-test and one-way variance analysis. The qualitative data were collected via semi-structured interviews and analyzed by Descriptive Analysis. The findings showed that the participants had a medium to high level of digital literacy, while they reported higher levels in the interviews. The analysis of the survey indicated that the most used device and year of digital platform use had a significant effect on the participants' digital literacy levels. The interview results combined with the survey implied that the vital point in digital literacy training is to ensure &quot;learning how to exploit digital skills&quot; rather than gaining knowledge on all the available tools, applications, and resources.",

        "description":"This paper presents the use of the time-on-task analysis (TOTA) diagnostic model as an instrument to improve the efficient management of allocated academic time in schools and focuses on the descriptive analytics produced by the TOTA model. The model aims to analyse how time is spent during the school day to enable school leaders, managers, and teachers to identify opportunities for improving teaching and learning 'uptime' in their schools and classrooms. The theoretical underpinning of the TOTA model is overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), a powerful analytical productivity metric used widely in manufacturing, and thus provides a novel perspective on how time is spent in the school day. The descriptive analytics are based on a data set of 450 observations taken during a time-series classroom observation study in the intermediate-senior phase of a primary school. It is argued that the TOTA model can be a valuable tool for school managers and teachers to improve teaching and learning productivity through the efficient utilisation of allocated academic time. The time-on-task analysis presented in this paper further underscores the importance of teachers' classroom management competencies and has the potential to be a valuable tool to enhance the instructional and transformational leadership practices of school principals.

UK HEIs are well-versed in monitoring the diversity of their workforce and ensuring that recruitment is compliant with the legislation. However as HEIs become more diverse, we need to ensure that 'cultural differences' and 'misunderstandings', do not become barriers to genuine equality of opportunity for BAME staff. This small-scale research project explores these questions with BAME staff working in higher education in the UK.

        "description":"International large-scale assessments, such as Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), are a crucial source of information for education researchers and policymakers. The assessment also includes a student questionnaire, however, the data can be biased by the differences in reporting behavior between students. In this paper, we analyse differences in response styles of students in the Czech Republic and New Zealand based on data gathered in PISA 2018. The results show that Czech students use, on average, the acquiescence response style (ARS) and extreme response style (ERS) less than their counterparts in New Zealand. Contrarily, Czech students use, on average, the disacquiescence response style (DARS) more than students from New Zealand. A closer analysis according to the school type in the Czech Republic, showed that students from 4-year secondary general schools score, on average, the highest on ARS and ERS, but the lowest on DARS among all school types. The analysis in New Zealand according to the Year of study showed that students in Years 12-13 score, on average, the highest on ARS and ERS among all Year-of-study groups, the DARS values being similar across the Year-of-study groups. The mean ARS and ERS of each of the Czech school types remains below that of any of the New Zealand Year-of-study groups. For DARS, the mean score of the highest-scoring Year-of-study group in New Zealand (Years 9-10) remains below that of the lowest-scoring Czech school type (4-year secondary general school). Analysis of response styles is a crucial tool for the identification of some of the potential biases in student-reported data. Future research should take the differences in student reporting behavior into account and perhaps also employ other methodological approaches for their identification, such as the overclaiming technique.

It is incumbent upon organisations like schools to invest heavily in the development and upskilling of their teachers to benefit from organisational growth and advancement based on such an exercise.

        "description":"South African higher education experiences low outcomes regardless of the significant financial investments made into the sector to address student poverty through financial aid. Concerning is that more than half of the low-income students who receive funding from the government do not graduate which points to the presence of other deprivations that are not financial. Despite the well documented adverse impacts of multidimensional poverty and non-monetary deprivations, there has been limited research on it in South African higher education. This study fills in this knowledge gap by exploring non-monetary deprivation and ways of addressing multidimensional poverty without necessarily increasing funding. The study uses the Capabilities Approach to argue for universities to give attention to non-monetary deprivation in their interventions aimed to address multidimensional student poverty. The study employed a sequential-mixed methodology that collected data using four focus group discussions, followed by an online survey that collected quantitative and qualitative data using a questionnaire. A total of 2306 undergraduate students who were selected from one university using a simple random sampling technique completed the questionnaire. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. This paper only focuses on the data from the qualitative survey, which indicates that nonmonetary deprivation is manifesting in the following dimensions: being able to live stress-free lives, dignity, participation, self-determination and motivation, social networks and being safe and secure. The study recommends that universities should consider reducing the effects of the non-material deprivations, such as mental health in order for students to flourish in higher education.

        "description":"Summative assessment is often criticised as an unfair representation of learner effort and aptitude. In summative high-stakes examinations, economically privileged learners consistently outperform marginalised counterparts, perpetuating inequitable social class reproduction. But UN Sustainable Development Goal No.4 calls for equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all learners, irrespective of socio-economic status and aptitude. Consequently, many education systems are adopting project-based learning to reduce dependency on summative exit examinations and nurture learners' lifelong research and problem-solving skills. Informed by the capability theory, the current literature-based study casts a bird's eye on how teachers are capacitating learners with research skills in South Africa, Lesotho, and Zimbabwe -- three former British colonies with a shared heritage of dependency on summative high stakes examinations. Teachers in the three countries are worried by unclear implementation modalities, inadequate capacitation and heavy workloads that undermine project-based learning and the formative assessment it entails. While commendable progress in utilising the project-based approach has been recorded in South Africa and Lesotho, teachers in Zimbabwe are struggling to implement the change in an authentic and ethical manner due to poor remuneration and the government's power-coercive dissemination strategies. If the UN goal to achieve equitable quality education is to be attained, dual communication, consultation and teacher capacitation are imperative.

        "description":"This study investigated Nigeria's private university lecturers' welfare and their legal rights. The study adopted a doctrinal approach which enabled a proper examination of the extant laws applicable to a lecturer as an employee and the reviewed laws included: the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as Amended), Labour Act Cap L1, LFN 2004, Industrial Training Fund Cap 19 LFN 2004 (as Amended), National Health Insurance Scheme Act, Cap N42, LFN 2004, National Housing Fund Act, Cap N45 LFN 2004, Pension Reform Act 2014, Personal Income Tax Act Cap P8 LFN 2004, Trade Dispute Act Cap T8 LFN 2004, Trade Unions Act Cap T14 LFN 2004. The study made a case for lecturers with the private universities in comparison to their counterparts with the public owned universities. The findings showed that there is wanton disregard for the extant provision of the Labour Act in Nigeria amongst the lecturers working with the private universities. Similarly, the study likewise discovered that there is paucity of reported cases regarding enforcement action involving private university lecturers and their employers. The study perceives that the inability of private university lecturers to demand for their rights is because the Nigerian law also allows freedom of contract in upholding and binding employers and employees to their agreements. Recommendations from the study asserted that the lecturers are entitled to same right as every other professional employee in Nigeria. This exposes the lecturers in the private universities to a weak state where despite the existence of the laws protecting their rights, they are unable to leverage on the existing laws to advance their rights.

Yet, regardless institutions' commitment, many countries, especially developing ones, struggle to effectively implement sustainability-oriented principles and practices in higher education. To that end, this paper, based on the qualitative document analysis, brings attention to main challenges associated with the implementation of sustainability-orientated principles and practices in seven South African universities. The findings show that several challenges exist due to the holistic nature of sustainable development (SD) as it is a concept that not only connects different areas of knowledge but also articulates knowledge from distinctive disciplines. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the strategy with the most potential of enhancing the implementation of sustainability-orientated principles and practices and ensuring longevity and improvement require support from top management of higher education institutions (HEIs). In addition, in order to strengthen SD, HEIs need to adapt a holistic approach and implement sustainability principles, knowledge, and practices within all academic activities. In alignment with the theme of the conference, this study provides reflections and recommendations towards the improvement of education considering the experiences and lessons learnt in a specific context.

        "author":["Sakarski, Gergana"],
        "description":"Soft skills are key for the successful realisation of individuals in their personal, professional and social life, but scientific research conducted on the soft skills of homeschoolers is still scarce so far. One of the most frequent questions, when homeschooling is discussed concerns the presumed lack of social skills of homeschoolers. A common assumption is that homeschoolers' socialisation is compromised and homeschooled individuals' soft skills development is, therefore, impaired. However, researchers, education specialists, and homeschooling families have differing opinions about this question. Research shows that the concern of social skills deficit comes often from outside the families, although parents usually care the most about their children's wellbeing. Homeschoolers, who were surveyed in the framework of this research did not confirm this assumption either. Therefore, there seems to be a clear need for deeper understanding and further exploration of the soft skills of homeschoolers. This paper aims to present the initial findings, discovered through theoretical study and qualitative and quantitative analysis of the preliminary results of an online survey conducted with homeschoolers from 3 countries aged over 16 years in order to explore the soft skills they develop.

It analyses some of the reasons for high turnover and theories around effective leadership and management roles in retaining hard working employees, with reference to teachers in a higher education institution in inner London cities. When discussing teachers, it includes lecturers that teach in higher education. Retaining hard working teachers has been an issue in HE institutions, particularly, since the Brexit and COVID-19 crisis, therefore, important to explore the issue in the context of the leadership and management strategic roles to reduce high turnover. The mini research uses mixed methods, quantitative and qualitative data collection with thematic analysis of the key findings from literature and comments from teachers on why they will like to stay or leave their jobs for another employer. Having sampled the opinions of small sampled participants and the literature sourced, it is obvious that teacher retention is a big issue in education with some teachers wanting to leave or stay. Those wanting to stay will do so if they are motivated with better pay and compensation and effective leadership and management of education institute and those leaving would live due to poor pay and heavy workload. The most interesting to note is that most of the participants love the job they do as long as their students are achieving their qualifications.

        "description":"In the context of Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), paradoxical findings concerning the relationship between questionnaire scales and student achievement are often documented. These questionnaire scales are found to correlate positively with student achievement within countries at the individual level, but negatively at the between-country level (i.e., when correlating questionnaire scale and achievement values aggregated at the level of countries, the countries being the unit of analysis). These anomalous findings can be caused by the differences in reporting behavior of students in different countries and might lead educators and educational policy-makers to erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we examine the relationship between the teacher support scale and student achievement across three PISA cycles -- 2012, 2015, and 2018. Our results show that there is a consistent negative between-country correlation between teacher support and student achievement in all three examined PISA cycles, which is in line with the previously documented paradoxes. We have also found that some countries, which participated in all three PISA cycles under study, consistently contribute to this paradox by having quite high levels of student-reported teacher support but rather low achievement scores. Future research should take into account the differences in reporting behavior between students when making cross-country analyses and consider the application of methodological approaches to identify and adjust for these differences such as the anchoring vignette method and the overclaiming technique.

        "description":"When the COVID-19 pandemic forced school closures, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers were left with the challenging task of devising ways for students to conduct experiments at home. This was necessary because experiments and other hands-on activities are integral to STEM education and are linked to the development of students' critical thinking skills, academic achievement, and science-related real-world skills. Based on a literature review, this study examines the methods used at the time to conduct STEM experiments remotely and provides recommendations for educational policy and practice. Findings indicate that experiential and immersive learning were the two main strategies used to accomplish home-based STEM experiments. However, experiential learning appeared to be the most prevalent and easiest to implement, especially in disciplines such as biology and environmental science. Based on the successes and limitations of the two approaches, the study concludes that consciously incorporating experiential and immersive learning into educational policies and practises would be a significant step toward better preparing teachers and students to employ them in emergency situations when teaching and learning have to be conducted remotely.

Statutory regulations in South Africa contend that foster care lapses when young people reach the age of 18. It is however not certain how many of them are ready to navigate into an adult and independent lifestyle. This paper is concerned with the question on: &quot;How is the transition for youth with disabilities facilitated towards adulthood?&quot; Two foster homes catering for orphans, abused and children with disabilities were purposefully selected. Semi structured interviews were conducted with six caregivers. Findings revealed that there was no planning in place for these youth who are about to exit the foster care. Furthermore, these youths are not even aware that they will have to live independently after the age of 18 years. In conclusion, this paper suggests collaboration among the multi stakeholders, policymakers, and practitioners at all levels to best prepare youth with disabilities aging out of foster care for life beyond care and what lies ahead of them. A supportive environment can provide the tools and resources that youth with disabilities need as they prepare for their transition 'journey' and to make a smooth landing at their destination of choice.

        "description":"The COVID-19 outbreak has impacted all aspects of human life, including the educational settings. Online and hybrid learning carried out during and after the pandemic certainly has a positive and a negative side, especially when it comes to students' mental health. At the same time, psychological well-being problems have become increasingly common among students nowadays. Thus, the main objective of this research was to investigate the relationship between mental health and psychological well-being among university students. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and the Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWBS) were administered to a sample of 240 university students (129 female and 111 male students). The results indicated that there was a significant positive relationship between the level of psychological well-being and psychological distress. The students' psychological well-being had the highest rating in personal growth, self-acceptance, purpose of life and environmental mastery, while autonomy and positive relationship with others had lower levels. Simultaneously, there was a positive relationship between mental health and gender, but there was no correlation between psychological well-being and gender. The study concluded that those mental health problems have powerful predictive qualities with regard to changes in students' psychological well-being which reflects the implication of intervention programs and strategies that help students to better cope with and manage distress.

Three significant challenges paint a grim picture for students and public schools unless policymakers step in to help: catastrophic COVID-19 pandemic impacts on learning, declining enrollment, and looming fiscal cliffs. This brief offers ideas for state leaders as they address the interrelated educational challenges facing schools right now. The brief highlights Michigan, Georgia, and Arizona. These states, ranging from blue to red to purple, provide lessons that can be instructive for policymakers in almost any state. Each state demands different policy solutions, but all should aim to put family empowerment, not politics, at the center of their legislative agendas.",

The focus of ethnic studies courses can vary across the nation. Some courses prioritize the accomplishments and contributions of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, while others seek to build critical consciousness by analyzing not only these individuals but understanding systemic barriers racial and ethnic minorities overcame or continue to face. Additionally, some courses focus on the history of a wide range of racial and ethnic groups in the United States, while others cover a single community's history, perspectives, and contributions. This literature review explores the research and data on ethnic studies best practices in the following sections: (1) History of Ethnic Studies as Coursework; (2) Importance of Ethnic Studies; (3) Challenges to Offering Ethnic Studies; (4) Programmatic Best Practices; (5) Best Practices for Instruction; (6) Recruitment Strategies; and (7) Educator and Advocate Resources.",

        "description":"Family support is essential for academic success and the creation of resilient learners. Support is a complex and contested terrain that is variously described based on disparate philosophical lenses through which it is viewed. It cannot be denied that learners are bound to encounter several challenges during their educational expedition that might require support. In this study the focus is on learners with mild intellectual disabilities (MID) who are firstly assessed, diagnosed then recommended placement into a special class. Subsequently, they may well be required to transition from the mainstream class to a special class. Transition tends to be a challenging time for learners in general, however, it may particularly be more challenging for learners with MID for several reasons (i.e., fear of change, attachment issues, bullying from other peers etc.). Essentially, family support becomes critical in facilitating this process since it is construed for positive transition processes. Furthermore, it increases the motivation and confidence of a learner with MID who may potentially encounter discrimination and marginalisation during transition. Notwithstanding, the numerous benefits of family support for learners with MID, a variety of challenges experienced by families in the provision of support to a learner with MID have been identified in a school located in a semi-rural part of a South African province. Such challenges include but are not limited to poor communication between families and homes, lack/limited of knowledge and lack of functional family-school partnerships. Drawing from this, the current study aims to provide possible approaches to mitigate the challenges experienced by families in providing support to learners with MID during the transition process.

Shaping learners' contributions via acknowledgment and type-specific questions is argued to be a part of Classroom Interactional Competence as the 5th skill in language teaching. Hence, this two-step move is studied to achieve a broader understanding of teachers' interactional repertoire. This study has a qualitative design utilizing Conversation Analysis. Eighteen hours of classroom data from Newcastle University Corpus of Academic Spoken English make up the data. The findings suggest that teachers' acknowledgment followed by type-specific questions is an indicator of Classroom Interactional Competence, and it is highly dependent upon the task goal (i.e., a pedagogic repair). Contrary to the previous studies, the joint use of acknowledgment is found to shape students' previous turns by foregrounding achievement rather than closing a topic or indicating a transition. Then, this joint use allows teachers to acknowledge or approve a learner's utterance on one level while carrying out repair work on another level enabling them to operate on different levels in the complex realm of the classroom.

        "description":"Considering the fast-changing times and mounting challenges, higher education institutions (HEIs) became recognized as important change agents in the society but at the same time became more threatened. To that end, recently Magna Charta Universitatum, a declaration stating that intellectual and moral autonomy is the hallmark of any university and a precondition for the fulfilment of its responsibilities to society has been revised to reflect the changes of global society as well as to recognise HEIs' role to address the challenges that come with change. In fact, the revised document indicates that universities acknowledge their responsibility to engage with and respond to the challenges of the world and to their local communities to benefit humanity and contribute to sustainability. In order to achieve this promise, the academic freedom (AF) of scholars as knowledge seekers and builders as well as key actors in education and social change needs to be safeguarded. The aim of this paper is to enhance consideration for relationship between AF and sustainability. Based on the scholarly literature we explore the interconnection between the two notions. The preliminary findings clearly indicate that sustainability and AF play an imperative role in HEIs. Freedom of academic voices needs to be supported to protect and promote authentic participation in public discourses and to sustainably shape future society. Meanwhile, the infringement on AF carries unwanted consequences including slow transition towards sustainability. [For the complete Volume 21 proceedings, see ED629259.]",

Nevertheless, the roles of technology in law practice and law education in Nigeria have not received considerate research attention. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by examining law practice and education in the context of the roles technology plays. The doctrinal research method was adopted. The paper found that Section 1 of the Act established the Council of Legal Education and vests it with the responsibility for the legal education of persons seeking to become members of the legal profession. The role of technology in law practice includes documentation of client's instructions, case management, file management, personnel data management and the documentation of accounts of the law firm, research, filing of court processes and virtual court sittings. Similarly, technology plays important roles in law education including research and teaching aids. However, the integration of technology faces several challenges such as inadequate regulatory framework, inadequate infrastructure, lack of funds and technological illiteracy. The paper concluded that addressing the challenges will be critical to enhancing and expanding the roles of technology in law practice and education and that without a strategic long term approach, the roles of technology in law practice and education in Nigeria will remain very insignificant and slow to sustainable growth.

        "description":"The theme of the conference seems to assume that most countries had functional and well-performing education systems before the COVID-19 pandemic. All they need to do now is to recover and restore their systems to their former glory. Evaluations of the South African education system between 1994 and 2022 have been extremely negative. The question arises whether all systems could be restored and whether there are systems simply not worth restoring and needing a complete mind shift and a new start to begin to be able to provide quality education. I surveyed the South African school education system and the degree to which it complies with the legal framework that regulates it. I also consulted published material on education quality. I came to the conclusion that the system is performing extremely poorly and is probably not worth &quot;recovering&quot;. I then turned to the suggestions of prominent economic and education policy specialists. It became clear to me that an education system not worth recovering needs a mindset change in its leaders to be reset and begin over. Certain education systems will probably need to be reset and not merely recovered. I explain briefly what the literature suggests about resetting a system and then list a number of steps that might be taken to reset an education system.

        "author":["Kwatubana, Siphokazi"],
        "description":"Education systems, including South Africa's, were forced to embrace remote schooling and online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of this dramatic change, the principal's role as an instructional leader has also changed. The hard lockdowns in South Africa forced schools to be creative in ensuring education continuity through digital technologies in online teaching. This became impossible in many schools due to a lack of resources and skills and the digital divide. South Africa is in the process of implementing the ICT curriculum in schools. Instructional leadership becomes crucial in such initiatives as it determines how the ICT curriculum is implemented and its subsequent impact on teaching and learning. However, many challenges hinder the effective implementation of the ICT curriculum, incorporating the lack of understanding of the pivotal role principals can play in ensuring its effectiveness. This study analysed publications on ICT curriculum implementation and instructional leadership to provide an overview of principals' roles as instructional leaders. Instructional leadership referred to in this study builds on experiences and learning acquired during COVID-19. Implementation of ICT is becoming more important to schools, and the success of such implementation is often due to effective instructional leadership.

        "author":["Mfum-Mensah, Obed"],
        "description":"There exists a power asymmetry between instructors and students in the physical classroom and other learning spaces which symbolizes the distribution of power in social spaces. Because of the structured power asymmetry in most learning spaces, promoting effective classroom teaching sometimes requires instructors to replace existing hierarchical power relations and with fluid, organic, and transgressive classroom dynamics in their relationships with their students. This approach has the potential to empower students to become their own agency for interrogating the assumptions and ideologies that they bring to the classroom. This paper outlines the instructional strategies that I incorporate in my &quot;nonwestern&quot; course that aims to introduce students in my university to the sub-Saharan African region. The course uses the interdisciplinary approach to explore the complicated ways history and social changes (including globalization) intersect to shape education reforms, and economic and social development in sub-Saharan Africa. Students bring a plethora of assumptions about sub-Saharan &quot;Africa&quot; to this course and my goal as an instructor is to help students interrogate their own assumptions and deconstruct the myths and distortions about the &quot;Africa&quot; in a broader term. The paper outlines the way I deliberately select course materials, and sequence course contents and themes to scaffold and promote incremental knowledge about the region for students during the semester. Furthermore, the paper outlines the strategies that help nudge students' critical thinking and restructure the power relations in the classroom. While these strategies may not automatically change students' assumptions about sub-Saharan &quot;Africa&quot;, they nonetheless become opportunities for my students and I to reposition for effective discussions about the region with the goal to interrogating students' prior assumptions and views about the region.

        "description":"Struggles for educational equity in the United States (US) and South Africa (SA), particularly with regard to race, class, and ethnicity, remain significant and have become even more critical during and following the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns. Many scholars have focused on the daily struggles of school-aged children, indicating that millions in each nation are homeless, food insecure, and without health care. Moreover, schools often serve critical social reproduction functions in addition to their primary role of advancing learning by providing feeding schemes, computers and internet connectivity, and, in many cases, essential childcare for workers. Since 2020, the pandemic and lockdowns negatively impacted the education delivery system in both countries by enhancing the socio-economic and digital divides. Both countries struggled to provide equitable access to quality education for all children, regardless of their socio-economic status (SES) or geographic location. Through a comparative lens, we analyze attempts by the US and SA to address racial and economic divides over the past decades, and particularly during the pandemic and its disruptions, to better understand the mechanisms education systems used to address stakeholder inequalities. After a brief overview of the historical paths to greater social and economic equality made by both nations the paper explores the significant roles that race, ethnicity, and SES continue to play in determining access to quality education, especially during times of disruptions such as the recent pandemic. It also asks if the economic divide has become the more powerful and consistent factor determining access to well-resourced schools. The paper concludes by asking if patterns of historical racial and ethnic inequalities are now being replaced by an even greater economic divide that continues to provide patterns of unequitable education for children based on their race, ethnicity, SES, and access to supportive resources.

Data was collected through a survey and individual interviews that were administered to educators and members of SMTs (N = 88) in four multiracial schools. The survey included open-ended questions that focused on what was happening in schools, in racially diverse classrooms, and the interaction between racially diverse groups. SMTs and SGBs are seen as always advancing strategies that lead to racial integration at school. The results showed that racial integration was not evident in these schools but rather there was a heightened racial conflict and racial incidences were prevalent in former White, Indian and Coloured schools.

        "description":"Global competition results in an overall demand for higher skills. In the competitive world, China has no choice but to adjust themselves to become more efficient, productive, and flexible. Higher education in China has played a key role in achieving socialist economy and modernization. Since the open-door policy in the 1980s, there has been a shift from elite to mass education, practice of corporate managerialism in education governance, privatization of education, and spread of transnational education in the tertiary sector. The author first attempts to explore the strategies that have been adopted in higher education reform in China. Then there are reviews of the roles of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Initiative in higher education reform in China. Higher education reform has allowed mainland China to identify a small group of universities to be measured alongside the best universities in North America and Europe. However, there are also some backwash effects created from these trends of restructuring of higher education in China. [For the complete Volume 21 proceedings, see ED629259.]",

        "description":"Our world has become starkly inequitable with 0.01% of the population owning 11% of all wealth, 1% owning 38% of all wealth, 10% owning 76% of all wealth, and the lower 50% owning almost nothing. Amongst all of these, there is a group of the most vulnerable, the most underserved, and ironically the most silent because, for the most part, they cannot speak for themselves: orphans, most of whom are in the lower 61%. The world population of orphans today is approximately 153 million. Selfishness and indifference have brought us to an appalling point in human history, but a radical change could be made, starting with the orphan population, if the world's middle class and above would adopt them in some way. The purpose of this paper is to explore the feasibility of such a social action and demonstrate the viability and potentially rapid effectiveness of this positive social engineering. The subject area is social and emotional learning, social responsibility, social entrepreneurship, and global citizenship. One of the groups in question is underserved and one is overserved yet underserved in that it lacks real happiness, in effect, both orphans. Through the lens of social constructivism, we examine the feasibility of projects through which the overserved help the underserved and both find fulfillment. Quantitative facts highlight the possibilities for radically ameliorating the orphan problem and qualitative investigation can measure the ensuing fulfillment of these groups. The final significant implication is that the orphan problem could be solved in this generation. [For the complete Volume 21 proceedings, see ED629259.]",

It is well known that &quot;The Zondo Commission&quot; revealed numerous crises with principled leadership poisoning organisations in South Africa. The world is becoming more conscious of ethics and ethical leadership because of the numerous scandals that have occurred in a variety of sectors, such as state-owned corporations and government institutions owing to unethical conduct by those organisations' leaders. It would be wrong to think that because corrupt behaviour had been exposed, the golden era of frauds had ended and that organisations had reached a turning point due to democracy and open management. If fraudulent actions continue to deplete organisations of resources and offer difficulties for managers and leaders, I contend, principled leadership is becoming toxic in organisations. These leaders need to be visionary. They must be able to communicate with members of their team. When leaders and their teams communicate, trust and confidence are increased. They should inform team members of their decisions rather than forcing decisions upon them. Leaders should consider all relevant factors before making judgments. They ought to enforce their influence by persuasion rather than by pressure. They must be creative in coming up with new solutions to challenges, taking chances to support organisations in minimising toxic inclinations.

It attempts to gather the evidence as to what is affecting men's choice to reject teaching as a career. It explores the possible causes of this change, which has been increasing over the last few years and examines its causes and the effects on schools and on their pupils. In particular, it looks at the effects on boys and young men of a school world, with a lack of male role models and explores what can be done by governments, schools and the teaching profession to halt this worrying trend. Pupils need both male and female teachers as girls speed ahead in education, leaving boys behind in schools dominated by women, with few male teachers, to gain boys' interest and so become involved in their own education. Suggestions are made as to what can be done to overcome this problem, which is now moving into developing countries too. Governments need to act and society value more, the contribution teachers make towards the success and growth of a country, whilst being in many cases ignored or disregarded by politicians, some parents and in some cases their pupils.

        "description":"Whilst the starting point is the impact of the pandemic the overall aim of the paper is to advance the case for the introduction of a transdisciplinary approach to learning. The justification for adopting this radical method is to deliver specific graduate outcomes in line with the 10 job skills for 2025 identified by the World Economic Forum. More specifically to promote creative and critical thinking amongst undergraduates. If the integration of skills is viewed as a key component of higher education the question is how they can be best delivered. A key point is to develop student self awareness of the limitations to their learning to introduce critical reflection. The possibility of students being 'pulled up short' and experiencing self-realisation is examined and how this may contribute to the advancement of their studies and the delivery of specific skills. Finally, the paper considers the idea of transdisciplinary teaching and learning and differentiates transdisciplinary ideas from other forms of crossing disciplinary boundaries. It explores the stated advantages, in terms of skills development, for adopting this type of approach noting the challenges it involves for both educators and students. It concludes that although there exist realistic challenges to transdisciplinary learning it is a strategy that promises significant outcomes.

This study was participated by 200 senior high school teachers of Monkayo, Davao de Oro. The instruments used in gathering the data were adopted, content validated, and reliability tested. The result showed that the extent of teachers' attributes was very great, and the level of teachers' self-efficacy was also very high. As a result, the level of classroom management of teachers was described as very high. The result further showed the significant relationship between teachers' attributes to classroom management. Lastly, this study revealed that teachers' attributes and self-efficacy significantly predict classroom management. Therefore, the study recommends that the elementary school administrators develop programs that equip teachers with the necessary attributes, skills, and passion for the teaching profession and be given more professional growth consideration.",

        "description":"The quasi-experimental study examines the effect of the Problem-based Learning (PBL) teaching strategy on one higher secondary school student's academic achievement under Thimphu Thromde, Bhutan. The student participants were selected through non-probability convenient sampling techniques. All students of XI Arts (N=30) and XI Commerce (N=38) participated in the study. Class XI Arts students were used as a controlled group and XI Commerce students as an experimental group. The experimental group was taught using PBL, and the control group was taught using the traditional lecture method. The pre-test data were collected through class test 1, and post-test data were collected through class test 2 and 5 points Likert scale survey questionnaire. The results revealed that the experimental group scored higher marks in the class test than the control group. The mean score of the pre-test of the XI Arts and XI Commerce (both controlled group) were 40.75 and 38.81 initially. The mean score of the experiment group's post-test showed 44.73, while the controlled group managed only 43.00. Further, the experimental group had a favorable opinion on the effectiveness of the PBL strategy. The study recommends the implementation of the PBL teaching strategy despite PBL being time-consuming and resource-intensive.",

        "description":"South Africa requires an educated population to sustain her economic development. Higher education institutions are under pressure to produce graduates with skills and competencies to fulfil such an aspiration. Distance education is an essential avenue through which more South Africans can have the much-needed education without necessarily displacing themselves. Distance education is facilitated and regulated by the White Paper on e-Education which is a generic policy document to serve the needs of the system-wide use of ICT integration at all levels of education. It falls short of conceptualising the implications of ICT in distance education particularly the North-West University's (NWU) open distance learning (ODL) multi-mode of education content delivery. The conceptualisation shortfall facilitates a Western-oriented understanding of knowledge while ODL students' traditional understanding of their roles and responsibilities is ignored. The concepts of roles and responsibilities are critically important for the effective functioning of ODL, and they are essential to the attainment of students' education aspirations. At the NWU, approximately seventy per cent of ODL students are Africans whose worldviews do not harmonise with the vision of universities. The research question which underpinned this study was &quot;What are the experiences of the roles and responsibilities of open distance students at a higher education institution?&quot; This study followed an interpretivist research paradigm, which would draw on a qualitative research approach. A systematic literature review was utilised and subsequently the views of ODL students were explored. Purposive sampling was employed to select ODL students as research participants for focus-group interviews. The collected data were analysed using the computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (a CAQDAS), ATLAS tiTM. Due attention was given to ethical considerations throughout the study. The findings revealed that ODL students have several ways in which they understand their roles and responsibilities which were shaped by their African worldview, Africanisation. The findings that emerged from the analyses of roles and responsibilities were task orientation; time management; personal growth; social roles; financial responsibilities; personal responsibilities; family responsibilities; and social responsibilities.

        "author":["Rossouw, J. P."],
        "description":"To build new and better higher education systems, it is vital to consider all aspects of systems in the recent past. Measures should be taken to identify and address deficiencies, of which academic isolation and the prevalence of a silo mentality is a prominent example. The central question of this paper to be answered is how to effectively combat academic isolation. While an individual in solitude has a positive experience when alone, isolation resulting in loneliness is an uneasy feeling of being unwillingly detached from others. Education institutions, faculties, colleges or communities of practice as well as individuals can experience isolation, whether it is self-imposed or enforced by discriminatory measures. Highly specialized groups may isolate themselves, and so can experienced academics be unwilling to share ideas and so deny others to benefit from their expertise. During an analytical literature survey, which generated valuable observations and findings from scholars worldwide, some of the most prominent reasons for and effects of this phenomenon emerged. The analysis, into which personal experience was also factored, lead to proposing cooperative research and interdisciplinary research as effective ways to breach harmful silo forming amongst researchers, and combat academic isolation.

        "author":["Jurgens, Coenraad"],
        "description":"South Africa has an urgent need for qualified technical and mechanical people. Technical disciplines are encouraged in public schools to fulfil this requirement. Teachers are also in an environment that is becoming increasingly litigious. Technology teachers may be forced to pay greater attention to managing safety and security as legal liability for harm caused during activities in school workshops is expected to increase. The safety of all students is a crucial component in schools. Effective teaching and learning can be improved in workshop areas where learner safety, or &quot;Geborgenheit&quot;, is generated. The security of students while they participate in activities is the responsibility of the Mechanical Technology teacher. For school workshops, an efficient safety policy must be created to reduce the danger of injuries and harm to students. The primary method for reducing and preventing injuries and making sure that the teacher or school is not held accountable for damage, is a purposeful policy. The empirical investigation used a mixed research methodology, where Mechanical Technology teachers quantitatively and qualitatively assessed the management of security in school workshops. Data were triangulated (analytically, narratively, and discussed), and conclusions and suggestions were formed. The results show that teachers are unaware of their legal obligation to take care of students and are under-informed on delictual liability and education law. Due to the complexity of today's society, all participants in the education industry must recognize that understanding the legal and technological facets of the field is not only important, but also ought to be made essential.

In addition, the nature of parental involvement and the benefits thereof, have been sufficiently treated in the corpus on school improvement. The purpose of this paper is to probe the support that schools, through their School Management Teams (SMTs), provide to parents to enable them to be closely involved in their children's education. Seen through the lens of Epstein's model, parental involvement is conceptualized and related to school environments in diverse South African contexts. The model of parental involvement reveals six areas of involvement, namely, parenting, communicating, volunteering, learning at home, decision-making and collaborating with the community. Accordingly, parental involvement as defined by Epstein and the inherent support that schools should provide to parents, form the thesis of this paper. The paper concludes with a recommendation of implementing proactive strategies of parental involvement in education. [For the complete Volume 21 proceedings, see ED629259.]",

Associations were not widespread or large, and overall children's performance appeared to increase modestly when classrooms were more educationally focused and structured, and teachers were supportive and responsive as they were involved with children.

The paper commences with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Incheon Declaration, as the vision humanity has set for itself for 2030. The paper then maps out the gap between the reality of education globally in 2015, when the goals were set, and the vision for 2030. The intervention of the COVID-19 Pandemic increased that gap. This paper argues that at the same time the Pandemic brought with it an opportunity to redesign education in the world, benefitting from the opportunities offered by technology. The paper further argues that in effecting such a redesign of education in the world, the scholarly field of Comparative and International Education has a pivotal role to play to -- to connect to the theme of this book and of the conference of which this volume is the proceedings of papers presented -- to use education experiences of the Pandemic and post-Pandemic times, to learn to not only recover education to its pre-Pandemic state, but to ensure the recovery has enough momentum to move beyond the pre-Pandemic level, surging towards the goals set for 2030, i.e. building new better education systems.

Transition experiences were not uniform across programs, though. Using a consensual qualitative coding approach, we identified three crosscutting themes related to pre-K transitions: (1) pre-k programs and staff invest significant time and effort in supporting successful transitions; (2) preschool programs' school readiness efforts often center on the mechanics of the transition, like completing paperwork and teaching children basic school behaviors; and (3) there are concerns about a lack of alignment between pre-K and kindergarten in terms of readiness, behavioral expectations, and learning goals.",

Many achievement measures and observational measures exist, but there is a need for measures of children's experiences at the preschool level. Using data from 1102 preschool children, we evaluated the reliability and validity of a new measure of children's academic orientations, including their feelings about their teacher, school enjoyment, growth mindset, and perceived academic competence. We gave children a one-on-one 12-item assessment in which they responded to survey questions on a 3-point Likert scale. The psychometric qualities of the scale were evaluated using item factor analysis, invariance testing of the scale across important demographic groups, examination of item thresholds, and correlations of the scales with teacher-reported measures. Overall, the measures adhered to the hypothesized factor structure, were invariant across the diverse demographic groups in the sample, and correlated with teacher-reported outcomes in hypothesized ways. Results from the psychometric analysis are being used to update the scale for the next iteration.",

        "description":"Areas of misalignment between children's experiences in preschool and kindergarten are increasingly viewed as contributing to the fade-out of preschool effects. The current study examined alignment and misalignment of classroom experiences across the transition from public pre-k into kindergarten. As part of a longitudinal cohort study, we examined structural features, process features, and teacher beliefs and practices in 295 public kindergarten classrooms and 117 public pre-K classrooms that feed into them. Analyses revealed a number of differences indicative of potential misalignment, including fewer ethnically and linguistically diverse teachers, more time in teacher-structured activities, and less effective teacher-child interactions in kindergarten. Potential alignment was indicated in some areas, such as more time in kindergarten spent on academics; progression toward more advanced literacy and math content from pre-k to kindergarten; and teachers across both grades reported similarly child-centered ideas about children. Exploratory results by pre-K auspice comparing school-based and center-based pre-K raised further questions about what the meaningful components of alignment are. The field lacks a robust empirical base for defining &quot;good&quot; alignment, thus these descriptive results are discussed in terms of implications for future, predictive research.",

Proper understanding of the basic concept will enable students to realize the benefit of the subject. This study examined the effects of the self-concept transformation package on senior secondary school student's academic achievement in the quantitative aspect of Economics in Central Zone, Plateau State, Nigeria. A quasi-experimental research design, the non-equivalent control- group design, was used for this study. The sample size consisted of 105 economics SS2 students from intact classes of the four sampled schools. There were 50 and 55 students in the experimental and control group, respectively. Multi-Stage Cluster sampling techniques were used for this study. The instruments used for data collection were the Multi-dimensional Self-Concept Scales (MSS) and Quantitative Economics Achievement Test (QEAT). Research questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while the t-test of independent sample and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to test the hypotheses. The statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 23 was used for the analysis. The results show that the self-concept transformation package positively and significantly affected students' self-concept and academic achievement in quantitative economics. The study recommended that the use of abusive words on students by Parents and guardians should be discouraged to strengthening their student's self-concept.",

        "author":["James, Ted"],
        "description":"Post-secondary institutions in British Columbia and elsewhere were forced to react quickly and boldly when the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in early 2020. The pandemic had unforeseen consequences, but it also created opportunities for new approaches to institutional systems and service delivery. This study evaluates the impact of the pandemic on services provided by Registrars' Offices at the BC Transfer System's 39 post-secondary member institutions. The research included a literature review, an online survey, and interviews. While the Office of the Registrar was only one of many areas dramatically affected at most institutions, the impact of the pandemic on the work of Registrars' Offices was immediate and widespread. The areas experiencing the most impact were recruitment, class scheduling and convocation. Service delivery was largely impacted by moving operations to online delivery and by staff working at home. Policies and procedures were also temporarily amended at many institutions. The main pandemic-related challenges identified by participants were constant revising of plans and schedules, staff fatigue over time, and responding to student anxiety. Most participants reported that their offices successfully met most of the challenges that were experienced. This study provides recommendations for institutional practice and further research: (1) Institutions should continue to explore ways to improve service delivery in both online and in-person formats; (2) Where changes in response to the pandemic resulted in improved service delivery, institutions should consider maintaining those changes; (3) Institutions should consider continuing flexible staff work arrangements where feasible, but allow such arrangements to be guided by a balance of individual choice and institutional need; (4) Research on the impact of the pandemic on students and instructional faculty would broaden the picture; (5) A comparison of differences in impacts across a wider range of jurisdictions may be another direction for further study; and (6) Investigation of the long-term impacts of the pandemic may provide further insights.",

        "description":"The stakes are incredibly high in California to provide access to a high-quality education in a safe environment for all students. As districts across the state resumed full-time instruction and began the task of pandemic recovery, members of the California Collaborative on District Reform convened three times in 2021-22 to continue and deepen their ongoing exploration of local strategies for meeting students' academic, social and emotional, and mental health needs. Of particular concern in these gatherings was the need to address systemic contributors to the persistent inequities in both educational opportunities and outcomes that the pandemic had accentuated. This brief summarizes key takeaways from discussions among meeting participants exploring ways in which school systems center equity in their work. Importantly, the districts sharing their work and strategies in these meetings vary significantly in the human capital and other resources available to them, and each is at a different place in its equity journey. Nevertheless, the core takeaway was clear: centering equity begins with an explicit and visible commitment on the part of district leaders. But words alone are not enough. Participants in these meetings stressed that this commitment must become systemic action and must be integrated into all aspects of a district's work. This was both the message and the goal of the district leaders participating in these Collaborative convenings. This report presents four recurring themes that emerged from these discussions: (1) System Leaders' Explicit and Visible Commitment to Equity Is Essential; (2) Efforts to Center Equity Must Focus on the Whole Child; (3) Efforts to Enhance Equity Must Reach the Instructional Core; and (4) Advancing Equity Districtwide Requires Systemic Coherence.",

Universities and Basic Education designed an alternative mode of learning that fits the regulations of the Inter-Agency Task Force on COVID-19 (IATF). The researchers used a quantitative research design in collecting and analyzing the numerical data. Because it is the methodology that researchers use to test theories about people's attitudes and behaviors based on numerical and statistical evidence. Students' preferences in terms of the hybrid learning approach are with the in-person approach because they can easily understand and catch up with the subject being taught. The majority of students are still determined to have limited in-person or face-to-face classroom discussion. The most common challenges experienced by the students, being ranked accordingly, are the lack of appropriate devices and the interaction with teachers and students. According to Kohnke &amp; Moorhouse (2021), the utilization of various features of the video-conferencing software and other digital tools was seen as essential to the effectiveness of the HyFlex Learning Modality. That is why it is important for colleges to strictly monitor and strengthen the conduct of hybrid learning and follow the compliance set by the National Government Agencies.",

A modified questionnaire based on Survey for Academic English Language Exposure (SAELE) was used to determine the effectiveness of academic English language exposure on the pragmatic competence development of the respondents. The study employed the descriptive correlational method, while various statistical tools were utilized to analyze and interpret the data. Weighted mean was used to determine the respondents' pragmatic competence level and the effectiveness of academic English language exposure on the pragmatic competence development of the respondents. Moreover, Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC) was employed to determine the significant relationship between the two variables. Results in WDCT showed that the average scores in the pre-test and post-test results fall under the competent level. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of academic English language exposure on the pragmatic competence development of the respondents was 0.207, which is ineffective. Lastly, the statistical correlation of the two variables showed no significant relationship between them (r=0.046, p&gt;0.05).

        "author":["Marcelli, Andrea Mattia"],
        "description":"This paper tackles the issue of teacher researchers by offering a model for the design of teacher-led inquiries that meets both the theoretical and the practical requirements of scientific research in educational settings. Part 1 focuses on teachers' reluctance to undertake academic research during the course of their working year. Two practical reasons are identified, which explain teachers' lack of involvement with scientific investigations: excessive demands on behalf of policymakers and limited availability of resources. Part 2 moves on to the theoretical level and identifies two beliefs about knowledge that are culturally widespread, and which limit the academia's ability to embrace everyday workplace experiences as a type of scientifically informing educational practice. Drawing on Damiano (2015), the epistemological legitimacy of teachers' experiences is thus redrafted. Part 3 introduces a model for designing research activities in educational settings, so that no supplementary time or resources is required to pursue scientific goals, despite the manifold constraints of teachers' everyday work. The chief example described in this paper focuses on early school leaving and the possibility to convert an ordinary career day into an investigation based on visual ethnography, which aims to empower students at risk. Said case is rendered with a diagram, which constitutes a useful tool for designing research according to the model's guidelines. Finally, Part 4 assesses the viability of the model against a framework conceived for the meta-evaluation of evaluatory practices.",

The 55th annual conference is about returning to the classroom after an abrupt shift to online work and instruction demands a reimagining of how and why technology is incorporated in education. This year's conference highlights work that encourages empathy, equity, and intentionality when administering, supporting, and integrating technical components in the classroom.

        "author":["McQuarrie, Fiona A. E."],
        "description":"Stranded credit is credit that students have earned at a postsecondary institution, but cannot use or transfer because they have unpaid debts at the institution. Institutions will usually not issue official transcripts to students with debt, which results in the student being unable to formally document the credits they have acquired. This can cause problems for the student in many areas, including obtaining employment, undertaking further education, and maintaining their immigration status. Being unable to obtain an official transcript may be a barrier to a student obtaining more education or a higher-paying job that would help them pay off their institutional debt. Because of this, several US states have recently banned post-secondary institutions from withholding student transcripts. This study was commissioned by the Transfer and Articulation Committee (TAC) of the BC Council on Admissions &amp; Transfer (BCCAT). The purpose of the study is to investigate the extent of stranded credit in the BC Transfer System (BCTS) and to make recommendations to address it when it occurs. The study collected data from two sources: (1) a review of information on BCTS member institutions' websites around unpaid student debt; and (2) a survey of registrars at the 39 BCTS member institutions on their institutional policies and practices around student debt and withholding transcripts. The data indicate that almost all BCTS member institutions use &quot;transcript holds&quot; on student accounts with outstanding debt, as a means of motivating students to pay those debts. The majority of survey respondents indicated that their institutions use this practice because withholding transcripts is one of the few strategies available to institutions attempting to collect unpaid debts. However, very few respondents indicated that stranded credit is a problem at their institution. Recommendations based on the findings are provided.",

The goal of the project was to identify promising practices and to develop recommendations to guide REA data collection initiatives both at the institutional and system level in BC post-secondary education. The information was collected using systematic literature and documentary reviews of existing practices on data collection regarding REA, interviews with representatives from PSIs and other organizations, and focus groups with students and community representatives. The framework for the collection and use of student demographic data, which was developed through the project work, offers a comprehensive approach to demographic data both at the institutional and system levels, considering the tools to be used, as well as appropriate processes to meet the objectives of the data collection. The report contains a discussion of key terms and definitions as well as examples of data collection questions used by other PSIs and organizations.

        "description":"From February to April 2022, 39 British Columbia Teachers' Federation (BCTF) members who identify as Black, Indigenous, People of Colour (BIPOC) participated in the Policing in Schools Project. They discussed their experiences and perspectives on police in schools and shared their visions for creating and sustaining safe, healthy, and equitable schools for all students. The BCTF engaged an external facilitator to lead Talking Circles with participants. BCTF members hold multiple views on this topic. Discussing police in schools within Talking Circles elicited a range of perspectives, experiences, stories, and emotions from participants. In this report, BCTF has endeavored to honour participants' perspectives, treat their words with care and meaningfully represent the broad themes of their stories. The goal of the Policing in Schools Project report is to support continued conversations within schools, locals, the BCTF and broader community about how to create and sustain conditions for safe, healthy, and equitable public schools. There are three key themes to prompt future dialogue: (1) History matters and continues to be lived; (2) Student needs within a chronically underfunded public education system cannot be met by funding School Liaison Officers (SLOs); and (3) Schools that embody care and meet student needs are grounded in the community and connected to families.",

Rather than addressing each challenge ad hoc, they are looking to adopt a systematic, repeatable process proven to diagnose and respond to challenges efficiently and effectively. One such approach with wide application and use in education is a Networked Improvement Community (NIC). A NIC is a model of continuous improvement that brings together a group of professionals who work to solve a well specified problem. The Kentucky Department of Education (KDE) and Kentucky Educational Television (KET) have partnered to create the Kentucky Online Learning Experience Collaborative (KyOLXC) workgroups, which aims to provide support for Kentucky's online K-12 programs and full-time, online students by piloting a NIC to address challenges in administering virtual learning.

        "description":"Parents and caregivers across Boston continue to face immense challenges to find quality, affordable childcare and this crisis is having a far-reaching impact on our society. Neighborhood disparities continue to exist, but families in all 15 neighborhoods face this challenge -- child care in Boston remains unaffordable for the majority of families. The 2023 report from the Boston Opportunity Agenda and the Birth to Eight Collaborative, &quot;(Re)Building Boston's Early Education and Care Sector: Supply, Affordability and Quality Needed,&quot; indicates that this crisis is far from ending. It examines the current state of early education and care both for pre-K and infant and toddler programs, examining the continued impact of COVID-19 and pandemic recovery investment on child care in Boston, analyzing changes in supply and potential demand at the neighborhood level. The report finds that while the number of overall seats has stabilized just below pre-pandemic levels, those seats are unevenly distributed across neighborhoods and age groups. Also problematic, as of 2021, Massachusetts had almost 5,000 fewer early educators, on average, than before the pandemic. A shortage of early educators means programs have to close classrooms and cannot offer their full supply of seats. The challenge is particularly acute in infant and toddler classrooms, where in many Boston neighborhoods there is only one early education and care seat available for every 5 children under the age of 2 who might want or need one. Informed by data, the report presents five policy recommendations to build upon recent investments made by the city and state to address the challenges outlined in this report.

The study conducted searches on ERIC, ScienceDirect, JSTOR, Sage Journals, Sage Knowledge, Web of Science, and random Google search engine utilization for teaching quality, teacher quality, differences between teacher quality and teaching quality, and conceptual confusion. The study applied Gidden's structuration theory to foster clarity development amid conceptual confusion. The study also highlighted the relevance of the concepts' distinction, inter-relatability, and connecting boundaries and was guided by the research questions: how can the concepts be distinguished from each other? How can the conceptual confusion between them be cleared? The study discovered pathways to understand the conceptual differences through deconstruction, classification, and relationship and role pairing. The study discovered: differences do exist between the two concepts in content and realization; some of the relationships between the concepts serve as their explicit conceptual differentiators: some were discovered to possess purposes of linking the concepts, while some detached the concepts; the existing relationships also unveiled the deriving roles of the concepts on each other and in practice; and proposed a framework for their distinction and clarification. Implications for practice include enablement of professional development needs identification for teachers; clarification of areas for leadership coaching and mentoring of teachers; self-awareness creation for teachers in seeking professional growth; student achievement; school improvement and action research enhancement.",

        "description":"Recruiting tomorrow's information technology students is getting to be a challenging job even though there are a variety of many good-paying jobs in the field when they graduate. This is not just an issue for our department, Computer and Information Technology (CIT). According to experts, with declining birthrates, students determining there are alternate career paths besides college AND COVID may be an issue for years to come. At Purdue Polytechnic in Columbus, we continue to do the traditional types of recruiting. However, we feel we need to be more creative in an effort to beat our competition. In this paper, we will share some of the strategies and focus on the activities we have developed. We would like a dialogue with our audience, so bring activities that work for you!

        "description":"Learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) attach different values to learning EFL depending on their goals. Regardless of their perceived value, a multitude of studies have shown that learners tend to experience anxiety when learning EFL; however, little research has been conducted within the context of distance education. The purpose of the study is to examine the interplay between non-English major distance EFL learners' perceived value of learning English and their foreign language anxiety. A group of first-year undergraduate students (N = 383) who were enrolled in compulsory English classes from various departments completed a web-based questionnaire measuring their perceived value of learning English and distance foreign language anxiety. The findings indicated that first-year students valued learning English, and they were moderately anxious about distance language learning. Additionally, significant moderate to weak relationships were noted between perceived value and anxiety. Several sociodemographic and language background variables were also found to predict each construct.",

        "author":["Velusamy, V. Rajkumar"],
        "description":"India is the second-largest tribal population in the world. However, after the seven decades of independence, the tribal groups are disadvantaged and socially backward from the cycle of growth in many areas such as health, education, employment, and empowerment, and more. Among these, for tribal society, education is an essential requirement. The state and central governments have initiated several programs to educate tribal groups. Many of these programs have achieved only 10 percent of the targets. The vast numbers of tribal peoples are missing their education at various levels. They lag in education due to the high illiteracy rates among the tribal population relative to Scheduled Castes (S.C.s). Hence, the time has come to consider tribal education and inclusive growth seriously. In this context, the comprehensive literature review seeks to provide a contemporary overview of India's current status and challenging issues of tribal education. The paper is purely based on second-hand information from various research studies conducted in India and collected from different government sources. The outcomes are more helpful in implementing schemes that can improve tribal literacy and inclusive growth perspectives.",

The data was collected via across-sectional five-part web-based questionnaire using convenience sampling (n =86). The study reveals interesting findings regarding: (1) students' views about ERL; (2) their self-reported degree of learner autonomy; (3) their views about lecturers' L1 use in asynchronous video lectures; and (4) whether and how these variables are interrelated and can be predicted by background variables. The qualitative findings further suggest that students hold mixed opinions regarding their new learning experience and mention the technical issues, lack of contact, and psychological problems as the most urgent issues to be addressed. Students were also found to be quite autonomous, and this was correlated with ERL ratings. Additionally, a majority of the ELL students considered the use of L1 in video lectures acceptable as long as it was limited. The findings are likely to inform the academicians who teach English majors at higher education institutions as well as learning management system designers by providing them with various insights.",

Using a qualitative research approach, the effects of one specific targeted arts program focusing on authentic and real-world learning opportunities for students with language-based learning disabilities with the use of Makerspace will be investigated. A selection of six students enrolled in a private independent school for students with language learning disabilities was studied over the course of a 6-week period. Students were given PBL and arts-based STEAM activities to complete using a Makerspace. Data was collected through observational field notes, student interviews and self-assessments, and artifacts. Information on best practices for utilizing UDL and PBL to meet the needs of students with language-based learning disabilities within an art program was revealed throughout the course of this research study.",

        "description":"The Impact of Teaching for Artistic Behavior in a Post-Pandemic Urban Art Classroom explores the effects of a choice-based art curriculum on students in an urban K-8 setting, with a focus on the post-pandemic context. The study examines the behavioral and academic outcomes of students in an underserved community and investigates how a TAB approach can address their needs. By promoting student autonomy, choice, and self-expression, the TAB model aims to support students' socio- emotional well-being in a trauma-affected environment. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research collects data through observations, interviews, self-assessments, artifacts, and thematic coding. Seventh-grade students, aged 12-14, participate in the TAB art class model throughout an academic year, allowing for insights into their post- pandemic experiences. The analysis focuses on recurring themes such as the development of independence skills, emotional regulation and community reconnection, and the transformation of students with behavioral issues in the post-pandemic context. The findings indicate that the TAB model fosters the development of independence, resilience, and coping skills among students, addressing the specific challenges they face in the aftermath of the pandemic. Through art-making experiences grounded in a growth mindset, students demonstrate increased engagement, enthusiasm, and a reduction in disruptive behaviors, providing valuable insights into their post-pandemic well-being. The study emphasizes the importance of providing students with autonomy, choice, and opportunities for self-expression to enhance their academic and socio-emotional development in the post-pandemic context.",

This article aims to analyze student engagement in one research university in Brazil, the effects of student socioeconomic and academic characteristics and their associations with university structures (curriculum), and student trajectories. The data comes from the Student Experience in the Research University, an international survey administered in 2012 at the University of Campinas and longitudinal academic registers. The study used both Principal Component Analysis and also Multiple Linear Regression Models. Five modes of engagement were found: two related to curricular engagement (engagement with faculty and engagement outside the classroom), social and leisure engagement, curricular disengagement and co-curricular engagement. The main effects are associated with the disciplines. Regarding student trajectories, there was a negative association between academic engagement and dropout students and those still enrolled seven years after the survey application. The results align with other studies that associate disciplines with student engagement and student engagement with student success.",

        "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruption to education around the world. There is much to learn from this period, to better understand what happened, to provide support to those affected, and to inform future responses to disruption. This research aimed to contribute to this field by recording teachers' experiences of teaching in the pandemic. The authors carried out a survey of teachers at schools that use Cambridge Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring (CEM) assessments, with the intention of sampling a wide range of experiences, from multiple countries, from primary and secondary schools, and from state and independent schools. In doing so, the authors hoped to engage with both the overall patterns and the variation in experiences. The survey asked questions about impacts on students, impacts on teachers, and teaching practices. Although findings were wide-ranging, several emerging themes were identified. These were: (1) learning loss was common but more complex than may be acknowledged; (2) wellbeing of both students and teachers is an important consideration; (3) lessons can be learned from experiences of remote teaching, both in terms of the challenges faced and the beneficial aspects experienced; (4) parents played a vital role in education during the pandemic, presenting potential opportunities for continued engagement; (5) experiences were variable within and between groups, and this should be explicitly considered when supporting affected students; (6) developing communities of practice and good quality training resources was beneficial and could continue to be so outside of the pandemic; and (7) despite the challenges faced, there are opportunities to change 'normal' practice as a result of what was learned during the period of disruption. This report is intended primarily as a description of the study background and methodology, and as a repository of results, whilst the emerging themes indicate where there is potential for further research or, indeed, action to support those affected.",

This report concludes research on five school systems to reveal the academic, social, and political challenges posed by the pandemic and what leaders and their staff are doing to address student learning loss. This report provides a possible explanation for why lackluster student test scores continue and why school systems struggle to implement and scale targeted student supports. Significant findings in this report include: (1) A crisis in the quality of classroom teaching is, leaders say, diverting time and resources away from targeted supports for students and toward improving classroom instruction; (2) Leaders report less day-to-day chaos, but unexpected challenges in staffing and teacher development have curtailed recovery efforts. As a result, their COVID recovery plans have been difficult, if not impossible, to carry out; (3) Plans for tutoring and other customized help have been undone by leaders' need to build (or rebuild) teachers' core skills; and (4) Millions of dollars and the best of intentions and efforts notwithstanding, leaders are struggling to overcome challenges to providing baseline services to students.

        "author":["Tarraya, Hilger Ojos"],
        "description":"Teachers' workloads are common subjects of study. However, despite the pieces of literature and the endless calls for action, this remains among the prevailing issues in education. Hence, this paper aims to explore the policies further by gathering and analyzing the implications of workload policy and working hours of public school teachers, in the hope of producing a substantial view of the current impact of these policies on the field. Specifically, its (1) effectiveness; (2) efficiency; (3) economy; (4) equity; and (5) impact. The researcher's purpose is not to generalize teachers' views, competence, and performance but to review and analyze the prevailing issues and concerns evident in the existing literature and studies. The Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (SR/MA) was used to analyze the implications of workload policy and working hours of public school teachers. The primary sources of data are the policies, literature, and studies on teachers' workloads, selected through purposive sampling. Thematic analysis using a deductive approach was used to qualitatively analyze the data. The findings revealed that heavy workloads influence teachers' overall effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, these issues need to be addressed critically to augment the resources the government can provide to improve access and quality of education since education is vital in sustaining the Philippines' economy. Based on the findings of this analysis, the following strategies and actions are suggested: policymakers shall have a comprehensive review and analysis of the policy; reduce workloads; improve the data management system; improve the staffing system; hire additional non-teaching personnel; quality teachers' mentoring programs through professional learning communities (PLCs); programs of other government agencies implemented in schools must be facilitated by the concerned government office/agency, instead of fully delegating the implementation, monitoring, and reporting to teachers; and enhance teachers' welfare programs.

In the study, the data were analyzed with the structural equation model. Also, the bootstrapping method was used to test the significance of the indirect effect. As a result of the structural equation model, loneliness has been found to play a partial mediating role in the relationship between maladaptive thinking styles and emotional expressivity. In other words, maladaptive thinking styles predict emotional expressivity both directly and through loneliness. Also, the result of the bootstrapping method has shown that this indirect effect is significant.

Seventy students in secondary-one grade in Al-Shahid Hussein A. Abdul-Raouf Mixed Secondary School in Al-Maabda in the second semester of the academic 2022\\2023 year, Assiut Educational Directorate where the researcher works, were chosen as the study participants and were divided evenly into two groups. The researcher adopted the two-group quasi-experimental design. A creative writing pre-post test was administered to the participants of both study groups to assess students' development in the specified creative writing skills before and after the experimental treatment. A motivation scale was administered to the participants of the experimental group before the experimental treatment, and it was readministered to the participants of both the study groups after the experimental treatment to assess the effectiveness of the program in enhancing the students' motivation to learn English. The data collection process included both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The results were analysed, and the outcomes were demonstrated. The findings of the study assured that there were statistically significant differences at the (0.05) level between the mean scores of the two research groups in the pre-post administration of the creative writing skills test and the motivation scale in favour of the post-testing. The study revealed that using activities based on Social Learning Theory (SLT) that were facilitated by Facebook proved to be effective and have considerable contributions to developing English creative writing skills of secondary-one school students. Future research should focus on integrating Social Learning Theory and the virtual educational environment of Facebook in the English language content and curriculum. Research should also be conducted to investigate the use of Social Learning and Facebook in other language skills (i.e., listening, reading, and speaking).",

Data were collected through the personal information form, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form, the COV19-Impact on Quality of Life scale, and Positive-Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Data were collected through stratified sampling from Recep Tayyip Erdogan University and Kirsehir Ahi Evran University. The sample of the study consisted of 888 students. The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0. Necessary assumptions were ensured before the analysis. Afterwards, descriptive statistics and MANOVA were used in the research. It has seen that the number of students who do not do sports under license, who passively participate in sports 2-3 times a week, and whose physical activity level is moderate are more in number. The findings show that students who do sports under license, passively participate in sports, and are physically active experienced lower levels of negative emotions and COVID-19 affected their quality of life at lower levels. As a result, it can be said that participation in sports and physical activity have an impact on negative emotions and the quality of life of COVID-19 in the sample of university students.",

Provision in a subject is defined as the number or percentage of schools with at least one student taking the subject. It could be argued that this may not cover all of the 'provision' since schools might offer to provide a subject, but none of their students wants to study it. This report was produced using publicly available data from the Department for Education's (DfE) &quot;Find and compare schools in England&quot; service. The dataset consisted of Key Stage 5 (KS5) results of all subjects provided by each school and college in England. Other school information, such as schools' sex composition, admissions policy, and the number of disadvantaged pupils at the end of KS5 were also available. The level of provision is presented by the following school classifications: school type, school attainment, school deprivation level, school sex composition, and school size. However, it should be noted that the analysis is at the simplest level and takes no account of interactions between these classifications.",

        "description":"This report looks at the provision of A level subjects in England in 2019. Provision in a subject is defined as the number or percentage of schools with at least one student taking the subject. It could be argued that this may not cover all of the 'provision' since schools might offer to provide a subject, but none of their students wants to study it. This report was produced using publicly available data from the Department for Education's (DfE) &quot;Find and compare schools in England&quot; service. The dataset consisted of Key Stage 5 (KS5) results of all subjects provided by each school and college in England. Other school information, such as schools' sex composition, admissions policy, and the number of disadvantaged pupils at the end of KS5 were also available. The level of provision is presented by the following school classifications: school type, school attainment, school deprivation level, school sex composition, and school size. However, it should be noted that the analysis is at the simplest level and takes no account of interactions between these classifications. [For &quot;Provision of GCE A Level Subjects in 2018.

A new alliance of liberal arts colleges known as the Pacific Alliance of Liberal Arts Colleges (PALAC) was established in 2021 with the purpose to better articulate the global components of liberal arts education, and to collaborate on key projects that will build collective capacity for student-centered liberal arts education that engages with the world's most pressing problems. PALAC contains nine of the best liberal arts institutions from across the Pacific Region, including institutions in China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States. This essay describes the origins, motivations, and context of the creation of PALAC, its member institutions, and some of the initial projects planned by the new organization, and goals for global impact for PALAC.",

        "author":["Mambetaliev, Askarbek"],
        "description":"Language policy is crucial to any society's cultural and political fabric, as it shapes how individuals and groups communicate, interact, and identify. Language policy has important implications for nation-building and the creation of national identity. Language policy can also significantly impact university students' sense of belonging. Overt and inclusive policies can provide opportunities for students to develop language skills and cultural competencies, enhancing their academic and professional opportunities. Covert and implicit policies can create barriers to interaction between different language groups, leading to social fragmentation, exclusion, and discrimination. Overt language policies are those that are openly acknowledged and implemented, while covert policies are those that are more subtle and may be hidden. Overt language policies that promote a single national language can unite diverse groups within a nation. However, these policies can also lead to the suppression of linguistic and cultural diversity within a nation, potentially undermining the cultural richness of that society. Covert language policies can also have significant impacts on identity and national unity. For example, language policies not openly acknowledged can lead to confusion or mistrust among different language groups. These policies can reinforce power imbalances between language groups, perpetuating existing inequalities. Considering these concepts, this study aimed to answer the following questions: (1) What LP has been implemented in Kyrgyzstan? (2) How has LP affected university students? Information on the language policy implemented in Kyrgyzstan was necessary to answer the first question, which involved examining laws, banknotes, newspaper titles, and dissertation catalogs. It was necessary to gather data on how the language policy has affected the students to answer the second question. In addition, in-depth interviews with LP experts helped clarify both questions. The collected information was analyzed using textual analysis and statistical methods. Data analysis showed that different models of language policy were implemented in Kyrgyzstan, including multilingualism, bilingualism, and monolingualism. Overt, covert, and vague LP were used to promote these models. These models and methods have formed segregated communities, language discrimination, and different linguistic identities within the same ethnic groups.",

School system leaders faced difficult decisions about delivering instruction while maintaining the safety and well-being of students, families, faculty, and staff. Moreover, the spotlight on racial injustice also drew attention to the need for educational reform to better serve historically marginalized students with academic, social, emotional, and other special needs. This research explores how educational institutions and their systems responded to two sudden disruptions, the COVID-19 pandemic and increased awareness of racial inequity. This research compared responses from traditional, charter, voucher-receiving private schools and rural and urban districts. The findings were based on 68 interviews with district, school, and community leaders and 46 interviews with parents, plus website, social media, and document analysis across four states and Washington, DC.

As much of the nation reeled at yet another life violently taken at the hands of a police officer, education workers faced the challenge of responding to local and national demands for policy change at the school and district levels in order to better meet the academic, social emotional, and other personal needs of racially minoritized students. In this report, the researchers share data from our 2020-21 study of how schools in eight districts across the United States responded to racial injustice, as well as parents' satisfaction with these responses. Specifically, they ask: (1) How did school systems in different sectors (i.e. traditional versus charter) respond to heightened attention to racial injustice?; (2) How did these different organizational contexts or other conditions shape response?; and (3) How did parents experience this year of racial reckoning and system responses?

In the first year of the pandemic, school systems faced difficult decisions about how to deliver instruction while maintaining the safety and wellbeing of students, families, faculty, and staff. As the months passed, the consequences from this public health crisis became even more apparent, as it disproportionately affected historically marginalized communities and further exacerbated existing educational inequities. Therefore, it is essential to understand how schools and systems respond to crises so we can design and implement changes in policy and practice that will better prepare us for the future. In this research, the authors sought to accomplish this goal by asking the following questions: (1) How did school systems respond to challenges in this early phase of the pandemic?; and (2) And did these responses differ by school sector (charter, private, or traditional public school) and by context?

Numerous studies have demonstrated the association between the detention and deportation of parents-- including the threat of these actions--and negative outcomes for children and their families. These include developmental concerns, housing instability, educational setbacks, poor physical and mental health, and economic insecurity. While there have been overall decreases in arrests and detention numbers since 2009, funding for enforcement continues to grow. Moreover, despite reforms at the local, state, and administrative levels over the years, the interior enforcement policies that cause harm to children in immigrant families remain in place, and well-intentioned policies aimed at mitigating the harm are often stalled by federal courts or face implementation challenges. This brief presents key data on immigration enforcement and its impact on the nation's children, and it proposes action steps for the federal government as well as state and local policymakers. Building upon findings in the 2018 CLASP &quot;Our Children's Fear&quot; (ED582818) and the 2019 UnidosUS &quot;Beyond the Border&quot; (ED603926) reports, this brief focuses on interior immigration enforcement--policies carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the interior of the United States--not on enforcement policies at the country's border.",

In addition, California's nursing workforce currently does not reflect the state's diversity. Although Latinx residents account for 39% of the state's population, just 10% of California's Registered Nurses are Latinx. While California was previously on-track to meet the projected demand for nurses, conditions created by the COVID-19 global pandemic prompted a number of nurses to leave the profession--these included nurses near retirement who retired early, as well as nurses earlier in their career who opted to pursue other endeavors. Complicating matters are geographic disparities in the nursing shortages around the state. This report underscores the critical nature of the nursing pipeline given both the immediate global health crisis, as well as the larger backdrop of California's aging population. The report notes that, despite consistent increases in the number of qualified applicants to the state's nursing programs, the number of newly enrolled students has been dropping in recent years.

        "description":"Students face several challenges when learning through traditional teaching settings. They need to accumulate huge amounts of factual knowledge from the courses, and to keep up-to-date with the prolific growth in health knowledge. Lack of awareness about digital technologies and non-exposure to digital-friendly environments have made learning even more challenging. Therefore, an innovative approach to the education delivery system is needed. A flipped class includes two elements of education: (1) a recorded lecture (off-campus learning as homework); and (2) an active learning session (on-campus learning). Pre-recorded lectures are provided to the students as homework and as an aid to learning which is then interactively discussed later on campus. This review aims to explore whether there is empirical evidence that supports this method of learning for undergraduate health professional students. Do flipped classrooms improve academic performance and are students satisfied with the flipped class learning method? [This summary is based on Naing, C., Whittaker, M. A., Aung, H.

        "description":"In response to the significant and still growing number of college students experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity in California, the State Legislature appropriated $9 million in the 2019-2020 State Budget for ongoing funding to provide housing services to students. Per section 9795 of the statute, colleges, in partnership with local housing service agencies, must provide housing navigation and placement services, academic support, and case management services to homeless students or those at risk of becoming homeless. As an additional requirement of the legislation, funds were allocated to colleges that demonstrated the greatest need. In February 2020, the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office (&quot;Chancellor's Office&quot;) evaluated the need and capacity data submitted by interested colleges, including campus- and county-based data such as financial aid uptake rates, low-income housing availability, and poverty rates, and distributed funds to 14 California community colleges as part of the California Community Colleges Homeless and Housing Insecurity Pilot (CCC HHIP) Program. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has caused some delay in the implementation of the CCC HHIP Program, participating colleges have made significant strides in operationalizing their programs locally. Upon receipt of funding, participating colleges immediately began developing the necessary infrastructure to implement the program, including hiring staff, developing outreach and retention strategies, and engaging key internal partners such as campus financial aid and facilities staff. This report provides an outline of the progress that the 14 colleges have made in supporting homeless and housing-insecure students. Despite facing several unexpected COVID-19 related challenges in the first year of the program, the 14 colleges developed the required infrastructure and provided support services to over 500 homeless or housing insecure students. This report describes the challenges, steps and successes that occurred along the way.",

Community colleges traditionally serve special part-time and special full-time students through concurrent enrollment programs. Such programs are offered primarily through early- and middle-college high schools, college and career access pathways (CCAP) partnerships, and stand-alone programs. In recent years, districts have created new partnerships with local high schools to expand dual enrollment opportunities for high school students. As a result, in 2021-22, the total number of Special Admit FTES continued to increase from the prior years. Additionally, the total number of Special Admit pupils passing courses increased by 3.2% from the prior year.

        "description":"As children grow and develop, child care workers play a vital role in fostering learning and providing support in a safe and nurturing environment. High-quality child care jobs, where workers are valued and respected, benefit both workers and the children and families they serve. Unfortunately, the United States has historically undervalued the child care workforce and failed to foster healthy labor conditions in this industry. In addition to more federal and state investments, strong unions for child care workers are part of the solution. This brief walks through some of the history and current landscape of the child care workforce, including which states have collective bargaining policies in place for home-based child care providers, who fall outside the traditional employer-employee bargaining model and lack a mechanism for collectively organizing and advocating for themselves. It also outlines how such policies benefit workers, families, and the economy, sharing successes from across the nation.",

The participants were sixty Turkish EFL learners attending a state high school, and the data was gathered from their achievement test scores. We analyzed the data through one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and implemented t-test statistical procedures. The findings revealed that the treatment group, who were exposed to pre-reading activities in L1, obtained better results both in reading comprehension and focus-on-vocabulary activities than the control group. The positive effect of implementing the &quot;short-circuit&quot; L1 use in pre-reading activities for reading comprehension and focus-on-vocabulary exercises was observed. It was also seen that categorically different pre-reading activities enhanced EFL learners' reading comprehension and vocabulary learning.",

Yet, access for families with young children remains uneven, with significant gaps across geography, income, race, and ethnicity. Over the last few decades, many states have worked to broaden access to prekindergarten education (pre-K), but only three states--Oklahoma, Florida, and Vermont--have implemented statewide universal pre-K programs (UPK). In this report, the authors consider the three case studies of state universal pre-K programs--Oklahoma, Florida, and Vermont. In doing so, they outline the development, structure, and implementation of each state's UPK program and analyze the relative accessibility, quality, funding, and impacts of their programs. In analyzing these case studies, the authors consider how they can be instructive for other states as they seek to expand and improve pre-K policies and programs, in particular, for policymakers in New York State as they continue to work to expand access to pre-K and move the state towards more universal access.",

        "description":"Partners to Lead (PtL) is a school leadership professional development (PD) project funded by a 5-year Education Innovation and Research grant and implemented by the DuPage, Illinois, Regional Office of Education (ROE) in 37 public elementary, middle, and high schools in four Illinois ROEs. The American Institutes for Research® (AIR®), the independent evaluator of PtL, has completed an implementation and impact study of the program. This final report summarizes the PtL program and AIR's evaluation methods; the extent to which PtL was implemented as designed; and findings on PtL's impact on student achievement, changes to principal effectiveness as measured by the Illinois 5Essentials Survey, and principal retention. All 37 schools recruited to participate in PtL remained in the program across all 3 years of the intervention, and principals generally expressed satisfaction with the components of PtL. However, analyses indicate that PtL did not have a statistically significant positive impact on principal leadership effectiveness, student achievement, or principal retention. From March 2020 through the end of the intervention, some PtL principals may have become somewhat disengaged from the full PtL PD and coaching due to competing professional and personal priorities resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have attenuated the impact of PtL. Nonetheless, students in intervention schools scored 0.104 standard deviation higher in math in spring of the final year of the intervention, and the p value for the estimated positive impact on student math achievement was 0.06.",

        "description":"As student loans, the cost of college tuition, and even value of higher education remain at the forefront of public discussion, one thing remains true: Affordability is central to adult learners' academic success, and money is one of the primary reasons why adult learners stop out before they graduate. This report takes a deep dive into the experiences of adult learners as they finance their education. It gives voice to adult learners and how their previous experiences with postsecondary financing help shape decisions on their current and future studies. Key takeaways include: (1) adult learners' perspectives on financing their education are often formed by their previous experiences; (2) respondents with the highest average loan debt in our survey are the ones who can least afford it; (3) adult learners who stop out mostly do so for &quot;nonacademic&quot; reasons; and (4) employer tuition assistance (TAP) is hugely beneficial. The report offers recommendations for institutions and policymakers -- and even employers -- on how to better support adult learners in their pursuit of postsecondary education.

Overall, conversations with adult learners revealed that their approaches to financing their education are shaped by their previous experiences in financing postsecondary education. Many adult learners fall into the &quot;some college, no degree&quot; category -- they may have a long educational history but no credential. They may also be weighed down by the burden of student loan debt that has been accumulating since they left high school. For these reasons, adult learners can be hesitant to approach the financial aid office or skeptical about the information they receive. As a result, they might miss out on valuable cost-saving strategies or funding opportunities that could help make college more affordable. [This report received funding from the Truist Foundation.

This study examined intervention effects in addition to coaching modality effects on teacher and child outcomes. Findings suggested that child care teachers who received coaching (regardless of modality) demonstrated improved teaching behaviors compared to the business-as-usual group. Compared to remote coaching, there were also advantages of face-to-face coaching on some teaching behaviors, although these advantages were no longer evident after accounting for teachers' levels of responsiveness to the intervention. Additionally, although there were no direct effects of the intervention on child outcomes, there was evidence of positive indirect associations of the intervention and coaching modality on child-level outcomes through improvements in teachers' instructional practices.

The particular Learning Style Preferences (LSP's) observed belongs in the cognitive personality domain which is perceived to be permanent and insusceptible to external influences, while the teaching styles used are assumed to address the needs of each of the LSP based on their preferred way of taking in information. It utilizes a quantitative and qualitative approach of data analysis and presentation; the method is quasi-experimental research. The experiment was performed in teaching the Literature 2 Literatures of the World course. The findings show that both sequential and global learners can learn in any of the two teaching methods and can cope despite the methodical incongruences in the teaching-learning situation.",

This study intends to investigate whether the PBHL model affects the environmental sensitivity of Social Science Education students on environmental issues and conservation materials. The quasi-experimental design of the pretest-posttest controlled group was used in this study. Students of the Social Science Education Department, Universitas Islam Negeri Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang, Indonesia, were selected as research subjects using a purposive sampling technique. The research subjects were determined to consist of class D as the experimental class (29 students) and class B as the control class (29 students). Questionnaires with a Likert scale of 1 (strongly disagree) -- 4 (strongly agree) were used in taking student environmental sensitivity data on environmental issues and conservation materials, totaling 28 items with indicators: knowledge, attitudes, and skills. Subsequently, the data were tested for normality and homogeneity and analyzed using an independent sample t-test. The results showed that the PBHL model had a significant effect on the environmental sensitivity of Social Science Education students on environmental issues and conservation materials ((p (0.009) &lt; [alpha] (0.05)). The average results of the sensitivity of the experimental class environment (N-Gain = 13.29) were higher than the control class (N-Gain = 8.75). This goal can be achieved through the syntax in the PBHL model. The suggestion for further research is that it is necessary to develop further by combining the PBHL model and interactive mobile learning media as a means for students to investigate and actualize problem-solving.",

Adopting the concept of university social responsibility, educating immigrants in language and cultural learning encourages university members to solve societal problems, and to help the community meet the needs of the changing society. In this study, activities for empowering immigrants' learning abilities were implemented as a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) approach by a university in northern Taiwan. To analyze the implementation process and participants' responses to the approach, observations and teaching records were analyzed. Several themes were summarized, including &quot;Volunteer training,&quot; &quot;Managing activities,&quot; &quot;Integration of pedagogy,&quot; and &quot;Inter-institutional relationships.&quot; Immigrant participants also reacted positively toward the learning opportunity based on CRS criteria and teaching evaluation.",

        "description":"Discussion on the use of method and postmethod in teaching English has become a debatable issue in Nepal. Many methods emerged as reaction to others claiming each of them as the best one but questions of their practicality and utility led to the development of postmethod pedagogy. This pedagogy empowers teachers' autonomy in the classroom and encourages them to design the best alternative way from the choices on the basis of their experience, knowledge and the context. However, the inclination to method is also on the rise. Supports claim that no practice will be method free. In this context, this study attempts to explore the teachers' perception on postmethod pedagogy in English as Foreign Language (EFL) classes of Nepal. In order to achieve the designated objective, the descriptive phenomenological research design was used and 12 teachers who are teaching English at different schools in Pokhara were purposively selected. The data revealed that teachers have a positive and hopeful experience towards postmethod pedagogy and want to open quality changes in English language teaching, developing context and culture sensitive pedagogy.",

Learning a new topic which oftentimes seems foreign is never easy. However, reading a short article or reviewing a slide-show presentation on the lecture topic before the lecture happens (otherwise known as a pre-reading assignment) can help alleviate the many burdens of learning new in-class concepts. The research participants consisted of thirty American undergraduate college students and were divided into either a control or experimental group based on the alphabetical order of their last name. Each participant took two of the same financial literacy tests which served as their pretreatment and posttreatment comprehension tests. An elementary level article on investing from Investopedia outlined the background information of the lecture on financial literacy. The article served as the pre-reading assignment and was administered solely to the experimental group. Both groups were asked to attend a series of small interactive lectures in order to measure the difference between their pre-lecture test scores and their post-lecture test scores. The findings were analyzed statistically through three Hedge's G Tests to identify means, standard deviations, and T values. It was found that the difference in test scores between the control and experimental groups were statistically significant at a 0.05 significance level as students in the experimental group outperformed the control group by roughly 9%. Implications include the potential integration of pre-reading assignments across universities in order to help improve academic performance.",

        "description":"With the change in socio-political and educational contexts in global academia, the trend of writing academic papers has arisen among Nepali students and educators in higher education. However, many of them are still unfamiliar with the basic standard to be incorporated in an academic paper. In this context, this study examined the post-graduate students' errors in writing research proposals. A textual analysis method was employed, where quantitative phase of analysis was followed by qualitative, and the data were collected from 24 purposively selected research proposals and from the interview with 10 students. The quantitative data were gathered from content analysis of the research proposals and qualitative data were collected from the unstructured interview. The collected proposals were studied, erroneous expressions were listed and categorized in to four parameters like grammatical errors, lexical semantic errors, mechanic errors and syntactic errors. The information from the interview was recorded, noted and analyzed. The results exhibited that (1) article and preposition usages were more persistent grammatical errors; (2) run-ons and fragmentation were more reiterated syntactic errors; and (3) uses of single lexical items were more common lexical-semantic errors and punctuation was the more regular mechanical errors. These findings reveal that students have insufficient knowledge and skills for academic writing. Therefore, they need academic writing courses, training, or workshops from the early level of their schooling. The findings of this study are useful for curriculum designers, policymakers, instructors, and students because it provides significant information on the building blocks experienced by English language learners in writing research paper.",

The TCR on upskilling pathways for France highlights outreach and guidance for low-skilled adults, and the crosscutting dimensions of governance and financial and non-financial support in relation to the two areas of focus. Cedefop's work on the thematic country reviews on upskilling pathways aims at supporting Member States in the development of systematic, coordinated and coherent approaches to upskilling pathways for low-skilled adults. The aim is to undertake in-depth reviews of countries' national approaches to the implementation of the upskilling pathways Recommendation, with the support of key national stakeholders. France and Italy were the first two countries that undertook this TCR exercise in 2021; implementation is expected to last until the end of 2023.

        "description":"This study examines the emerging relationship between microcredentials and qualification systems. Information gathered through an online survey among European VET providers, national authorities, employee and employer organisations was complemented by in-depth country case studies and interviews with Cedefop's ReferNet network. Questions of whether and how microcredentials should be related to established qualification systems are at an early stage of consideration in most countries; the focus is on better defining and standardising their role within national qualifications systems. Existing trends towards modularisation and the recognition of prior learning provide potential avenues for realising the benefits of microcredentials in terms of flexibility and responsiveness, while also ensuring their quality for learners and employers. There is still significant debate over how to deal with microcredentials, and how to avoid potential negative effects, such as encouraging a shift away from holistic education towards short-duration learning based around reduced skill sets. Microcredentials are a complex phenomenon, particularly with regard to their relationship to qualifications. In recent years, there has been an acceleration in the availability and use of microcredentials in the labour market, raising questions about their relationship to VET and to qualification systems. The proliferation of microcredentials of different types across various sectors, occupations, education sectors and levels and countries, along with variations between countries in the nature of qualification systems -- which are undergoing change -- make this a complex landscape to research and analyse. To date there has been a lack of data at EU level informing decision-making in this area. This report aims to be a first step towards filling some key gaps in the knowledge around these topics, addressing three main research questions.",

Also, it aimed to determine the students' perception towards the online class in terms of instructional design and delivery on students, teacher roles on students, and class organization and format. Pure descriptive analysis was used in analyzing the data, such as mean and percentage distribution. Both adapted and adopted survey questionnaires were used to address this research's problem, and these were distributed to the respondents either via online and phone call. Results showed that the senior high school department professors were good enough to use online platforms with an overall mean of 1.76, which implies that most of them are technically sound. Students have agreed that their professors are satisfied with instructional design and delivery, teacher roles, and class organization and format. The overall mean of 3.60 of students' perception towards online class implies that students have perceived their teacher's teaching way amidst pandemics is still promoting students' desire to learn, which engaged them to become more interactive in various activities. Because there are observable few numbers that can be seen in the results indicating that the teachers are not proficient enough in digital literacy, it is highly recommended to get the respondents' demographic profile in terms of age and training attended about computer literacy. It is also recommended that the professors' e-readiness be correlated to students' perception of the online class.",

        "description":"This paper investigates the relevance of electronic resources and improved access for effective distance learning and continuing education. The descriptive survey design was adopted for the study. The total population of the study comprises 7,125 registered students of the National Open University of Nigeria. A convenience sampling technique was used to select a sample size of 379 respondents. Structured questionnaires were distributed to the respondents through a research assistant, and only 320 valid responses were returned and used for the study. The study used frequency counts and percentages as statistical measures for data analysis. Findings revealed that students access e-resources regularly. Electronic resources were also relevant as they provide students with up-to-date information, complete information from different sources, speedy and easy access to information, and more. Access to electronic resources can be improved through the following means: provision of useful Internet/server to enhance the accessibility of e-resources, online user guideline for accessing e-resources, creation of user-friendly interfaces for easy access to online contents. It was recommended that audio and video conference chats be made available to students to connect librarians for assistance when the need arises; compulsory user-education and orientation program should also be conducted for students on the use of electronic resources.",

        "description":"The concept of community schools can be traced back to the early 20th century when industrialization, immigration, and urbanization were rapidly increasing, and public schools in cities were struggling to meet the social and civic needs of students from low-income families. In the 1960s and 1970s, advocacy groups promoted community schools as a way to improve learning and address social issues, particularly in largely segregated and underfunded schools in urban centers unable to provide quality education to students. This research brief is a literature review and briefly reports on the characteristics of community schools and how they engage parents and all stakeholders to improve student achievement and well-being.",

The research employed a qualitative design using a case study and collect data. A purposive sample consisting of 5 teachers from Al-Amin Islamic Secondary School was selected based on teaching experience. The teachers were interviewed according to a theme-based strategy, and collected data was transcribed and analyzed accordingly. Findings have shown that integrating tawhid in the subjects of Science and History is an aim that teachers in Islamic schools in Malaysia hope to achieve. However, obstacles and challenges continue to hinder their efforts. Theoretical and practical propositions and recommendations to make this aim achievable, such as revisiting the concept of tawhid integration, enhancing teachers' creativity skills in the classroom, and providing relevant training programs by school authorities, would undoubtedly help attain their ultimate objective.",

This study also upholds that an understanding of their perceptions as EFL program managers will help create a better working condition and improve EFL programs and instruction, characterized by excessive proliferation of language centers that put profit-making as their utmost priority. Two research questions were utilized to investigate EFL program managers' challenges and barriers while managing foreign language institutes and centers. The study adopted a qualitative research design approach; 45 EFL program managers and coordinators with international qualifications with over ten years of experience were purposefully sampled and recruited as participants for this study. A semi-structured interview was the instrument for data collection, which experts validated to ensure it measures what it purports to measure. Data collected were transcribed and analyzed through thematic analysis to uncover themes used to define and interpret findings. This study's findings indicate that the absence of professional expertise, training/retraining programs, resource availability, and competition from other universities were the significant challenges EFL program managers face while carrying out their duties. It was also unveiled that over monetization of EFL programs within institutions brings about challenges in program management. Recommendations were given to bridge these gaps.",

        "description":"Cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) appears to match the tenets of post-qualitative inquiry. However, post-qualitative inquiry is credited with being averse to method and to adopt post-modernist stances that are not consistent with CHAT's structured reading of social reality. Notwithstanding this, it is possible to propose an interpretation of post-qualitative inquiry that overcomes such conceptual challenges. This article tackles the issue both theoretically and with reference to the way current CHAT research is undertaken. First, we propose post-qualitative research should be understood as compliant with post-Gettier epistemological standpoints. Second, we show that CHAT-inspired formative interventions are both educational in nature and, given their approach to learning processes, display the core features of post-qualitative research. Given CHAT's distinction between immanent aspects of social reality and methods tailored to tackle local issues, post-qualitative inquiry is justified in retaining its flexible--almost anarchic--methodology while, at the same time, enjoying epistemological soundness.",

The approach has been developed jointly by a group of interdisciplinary VET researchers over a 5-year period as part of Cedefop's research on the future of VET and has been reviewed several times. The framework introduces 50 dimensions for analysing VET systems, as well as parts of them, structured according to three overlapping main perspectives: epistemological and pedagogical, education system, and socioeconomic or labour market. The framework is particularly suited to 'clearing the ground' for policy work and provides a model for how research can support policy. This model can be flexibly adapted and applied in any comparative research or international policy learning activity related to VET.

Whenever any changes to the general education revenue program are proposed, it brings up an ongoing question--will some districts benefit more than others? To help with this transparency issue, this report examines how an increase to one component of the general education revenue program--the basic education revenue formula allowance--would impact districts across the state, and in doing so, hopefully provides some insight into how the general education revenue program works.",

However, the long strides in the move toward a fully-fledged digital economy are not reflected in the digital technology workforce with regard to gender balance. While digital technology careers are highly touted as the jobs of the future, women occupy less than 30 percent of digital technology positions in Kenya. The root cause of the problem can be traced to disadvantages that girls and young women accumulate throughout their years in education. This study takes a qualitative approach in trying to identify the root causes for the exclusion of girls and young women from digital technology courses at all levels of education--namely lower primary, upper primary, junior high school, senior high school, and the tertiary level in both rural and urban communities. The study identifies various cumulative factors that contribute to fewer women taking up digital technology courses, such as: (1) inadequate infrastructure; (2) insufficient staffing and training of digital technology personnel at learning institutions; (3) the negative impact of gendered social norms; (4) poor advocacy of digital technology careers and the absence of vocational counseling; and (5) the lack of women role models.",

We examine the impacts of the Temporary Certificate of Eligibility (Temporary CE), which allowed teacher candidates in New Jersey to enter the workforce before completing assessment and performance requirements. Relative to the novice teacher workforce before the pandemic, Temporary CE teachers were substantially more diverse without any significant effects on teacher performance or student test scores. However, Temporary CE holders were less likely to remain in the same school or in the New Jersey teaching workforce between 2020-21 and 2021-22. Although Temporary CE holders disproportionately entered through alternate routes into teaching, these patterns hold for both traditional- and alternate-route entrants.",

The 2022 New Hampshire Preschool Development Grant's (PDG) Family Needs Assessment Survey explored how New Hampshire families with children under age nine fare in accessing early childhood care and education, measured their knowledge and use of supportive programs, and identified new and enduring needs. Using survey responses from a non-random sample of parents statewide, this brief focuses on early childhood care and education, a sector for which the pandemic exacerbated long-simmering challenges. Key findings include: (1) three-quarters of respondents with young children had searched for child care in the past year; half reported the search was difficult, most often due to a lack of openings; (2) seventy-four percent of responding parents used at least some nonparental care for their young children, most commonly using a licensed center; and (3) respondents were most likely to indicate that the way to improve their child care arrangement was if it were more affordable.",

But the college and employment pathways that prospective teachers take to TEP enrollment and completion have not been comprehensively examined. A better understanding of how credentialed individuals find their way into TEPs helps us understand the sources of new teacher supply early in the prospective teacher pipeline. With that in mind, we analyze pathways into and through TEPs using historical postsecondary and unemployment insurance data from Washington state. We find that the pathways are quite varied with around 40% of bachelor's-level TEP completers spending at least some time in community colleges and less than 40% enrolling and finishing at the same university directly after high school. Pathways to master's TEP completion are even more varied, with almost half of the completers having prior employment experience. For researchers, this varied landscape raises important questions about the relationship between pathways, candidate persistence, and eventual job performance. For policymakers, the results suggest that efforts to recruit the next generation of teachers need to look beyond the pool of students already enrolled at a 4-year university to include students at 2-year colleges or in the labor force who might be interested in entering a TEP.",

        "description":"Future Forward is an early primary literacy program that pairs one-on-one tutoring with family engagement. Future Forward's approach is informed by both systems theory and a school-family-community partnership model. Future Forward understands that schools are not solely responsible for developing student literacy. Instead of viewing families and communities as barriers that need to be overcome, they are viewed as having untapped potential for contributing to student literacy development. In 2017, Future Forward was awarded an Education Innovation and Research Mid-phase grant to expand to 14 schools across three states. In 2019-20, the randomized control trial study was designed to examine the implementation and impact of one year of participation on the reading achievement and school attendance of 293 students assigned to Future Forward. Attrition was low, with only 20 of 587 study participants leaving the study. Implementation results suggested progress was made toward scaling Future Forward up to 14 schools. Nearly all students received tutoring as intended. However, family engagement implementation was less consistent between sites. In spring of 2020, schools shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, shortening the program and limiting the evaluation to only testing its impact on school attendance. Overall, Future Forward had a statistically significant positive impact on school attendance (1.4 percentage points). Its impact was greater with Black students (2.4 percentage points) and students who started the program with low school attendance (2.3 percentage points). Black students with low school attendance were particularly affected, improving by 3.6 percentage points. Possible explanations for the differential positive impact on Black students are discussed.",

The study used Google class &amp; Television lesson observations to gain the first-hand experience and face-to-face interviews with students, parents, and teachers to get in-depth views. The Google class and television lesson observation and interview data were analyzed using emerging themes. The findings revealed that Google class and Television lessons played an essential role in making up lessons lost during schools' closure. However, the study further revealed some pertinent issues related to the Google class and Television lessons, including students resorting to copying assignments and homework directly from friends or copying directly from textbooks and the internet. Students were overburden by the heavy load of assignments assigned by different subject teachers, among many others. More preparedness and training for teachers in ICT based pedagogy was required. The study might draw policy attention to consider the problem and challenges before implementing Google class and Television lessons shortly to avoid pitfalls. The study was limited to the Thimphu Thromde, Bhutan, using a small sample size of students, parents, and teachers. A future mixed-method research approach uses surveys with students, parents, and teachers; focus group discussions with students, parents, and teachers; and policymakers' interviews are recommended.",

Yet, inadequate working conditions and low pay routinely hamper educators in their efforts to apply effective teaching and caregiving practices (Institute of Medicine and National Research Council, 2015; McLean et al., 2021). The Center for the Study of Child Care Employment (CSCCE) had the opportunity to ask early educators about their working conditions. Educators employed in both center- and home-based programs were surveyed throughout the state of Oregon. Notably, this was the first CSCCE study utilizing the Supportive Environmental Quality Underlying Adult Learning (SEQUAL) tool to capture the experiences of family child care (FCC) providers and their staff and also the first SEQUAL study to examine working conditions after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "description":"Early care and education (ECE) programs for children prior to kindergarten in California are provided through a mixed delivery system that includes licensed home- and center-based programs as well as school settings. The requirements, experience, and supports for educators vary widely across settings, depending more on funding sources and regulatory status and less on what educators and children may need. This situation is typical across the ECE system for children from infancy through preschool, though California has made substantial changes in providing preschool for four-year-olds. Transitional Kindergarten (TK) was introduced into this mix in the 2012-13 school year. As of the 2022-23 school year, TK became the only free, universal ECE program in California available for four-year-olds. This brief explores the experiences of ECE lead teachers across settings: TK classrooms, child care centers, and family child care (FCC) programs. It examines their demographics, classroom context, working conditions, compensation, and economic well-being. It identifies threads of continuity among lead teachers regardless of setting: for instance, virtually all these early educators are women, and many are age 40 or older. They teach similar numbers of dual-language learner students, and they face similar classroom challenges. By contrast, educators in centers and FCC providers are much more likely to be women of color and/or immigrant women. Teacher pay and benefits also diverge sharply, with TK educators earning at least twice the salary of other lead teachers with a bachelor's degree along with corresponding metrics of economic well-being. By exploring the experiences of teachers by setting, the authors aim to understand the state of equity in ECE employment. For the purposes of this analysis, they focus on educators who lead their respective classrooms in order to compare similar job roles and level of teaching responsibilities. They then explore the implications for sustaining an effective and equitable ECE system in California.",

They demonstrate the significant differences in the reach and adequacy of child care financial assistance programs (&quot;child care scholarships&quot;) across state lines, with Vermont's program setting family income eligibility thresholds higher and delivering higher-value reimbursements to child care providers than New Hampshire's program. While scholarships are key for widening low-income families' access to high quality care, they are not a panacea. Not all eligible families participate in child care scholarship programs. Those who do may still be required to pay substantial cost shares. Similarly, not all providers accept scholarships as payment, due to low reimbursement rates and administrative burdens. The authors identify key policy opportunities to strengthen scholarships' impact, including expanding family eligibility, increasing reimbursement rates to providers, and encouraging providers to participate in scholarship programs.

While data limitations preclude the authors from identifying which child care pandemic relief programs worked best and for whom, the authors find spatial and program type differences in relief receipt. Using data from interviews with early childhood educators in the Upper Valley, the authors identify the role that temporary relief funds have played in keeping the sector afloat during the pandemic. While relief funds served the role of &quot;keeping the doors open&quot; for many providers, these short-term funds are unable to address the deep-seated challenges of the sector's unsustainable economic model, a challenge that predated the pandemic and has worsened since. The authors conclude by identifying important policy steps to support the sector in New Hampshire, Vermont, and beyond.

        "description":"The present study explores the effect on student satisfaction and student loyalty of higher education service quality dimensions. Ensuring quality improvement and implementation of strategies for the tertiary education sector has become critical. Moreover, the study also tests the mediating impact of university reputation and external prestige between university service quality and satisfaction and loyalty. Data has collected through a structured questionnaire from a sample of 390 graduate and undergraduate students of two public universities in Bangladesh. The study reflects that the performance on service quality dimensions of selected public universities is not satisfactory. The study results have shown that teaching, support services, library and lab facilities, and internationalization significantly influence student satisfaction except for administrative service and hostel facilities. Teaching, administrative services, library and lab facilities, and internationalization significantly influence student loyalty. The mediating analysis has shown that student satisfaction partially mediates between service quality and student loyalty. The study results have also indicated that university reputation and external prestige partially mediate between service quality and student satisfaction and loyalty. The previous studies which measure service quality of Bangladeshi higher educational institutions have applied the SERVQUAL model, which is not suitable for an educational institution. However, this study has applied a higher education service quality model uniquely developed to measure higher educational institutions' service quality.",

Specific foci included applicant recruitment and selection, components of applications (e.g., forms, essays, interviews), and how applicants' DEIJ-related information and orientations factor into admissions. We found that all MSTPPs participating in the study collected information related to DEIJ (e.g., applicants' ethnoracial backgrounds, citizenship), and all interviewed faculty expressed an interest in increasing the diversity of applicants and admitted students. Faculty expressed preferences for applicants who evidenced positive DEIJ orientations, such as recognizing social and ethnoracial injustices, but at the same time, differences were evident in how MSTPPs and faculty attended to DEIJ. Considerations, implication, and dilemmas for teacher preparation programs and faculty are discussed.",

        "author":["Bjarnason, Nicole"],
        "description":"The ability to communicate in different languages is increasingly essential in today's interconnected world. However, language learning outcomes can often suffer due to low engagement and participation, especially among students from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. To address this challenge, it is crucial to create a culturally responsive classroom environment that values inclusivity and fosters a sense of belonging for all students. Incorporating culturally responsive teaching practices that consider students' cultural backgrounds, interests, and proficiency levels while providing comprehensible input can significantly enhance language learning outcomes and promote a positive and inclusive learning environment. Comprehensible input involves the use of language that students can understand, even if it is slightly beyond their current level, in the context of meaningful and relevant language use. Culturally responsive teaching in world language classes involves tailoring the curriculum to be relevant and meaningful to students' cultural backgrounds, using instructional strategies that are culturally relevant, and creating a classroom environment that respects and values cultural diversity. This inclusive framework of culturally relevant education goes by various terms, including culturally relevant pedagogy, culturally responsive teaching, and culturally sustaining pedagogy. This thesis presents a curricular planning approach that is intentionally designed to be engaging and relevant to students, while also incorporating culturally responsive teaching practices. The approach centers around communicative strategies that foster inclusivity in the classroom, ensuring that every student feels valued and heard. A key component of this 3-day curricular planning unit revolves around a novel, which provides comprehensible input on real-world issues that are compelling for students, such as quinceañeras, turbulent relationships, gang violence, immigration, and more. By incorporating these themes and strategies into the curriculum, the aim is to create a learning environment that is both academically rigorous and personally meaningful to students' lives, while also recognizing and respecting their diverse cultural backgrounds.",

        "description":"In this brief, authors Jess Carson and Sarah Boege describe changes in the early childhood education and care landscape of Grafton and Sullivan Counties in New Hampshire and Orange and Windsor Counties in Vermont, collectively known as the Upper Valley. The authors find that the Upper Valley lost 25 regulated child care providers serving children under age 5 between 2017 and 2021. However, with closure rates twice as high among family-based providers than among center-based providers and some new providers opening, the net number of slots has remained relatively stable (5,169 slots in 2021). The overall effect has been to consolidate available care into fewer, larger settings across the region. Three-quarters of Upper Valley providers open in 2017 were still open in 2021, reflecting greater stability than in non-Upper Valley portions of New Hampshire (71 percent) or Vermont (65 percent). However, the authors caution that early childhood educator workforce shortages limit the ability of child care providers to remain fully operational. They conclude by noting that workforce-supporting policy proposals differ in intensity across states, building on a stronger foundation of investments in Vermont than in New Hampshire.

Participants (N = 95) completed a multiple document reading task wherein they were prompted to think aloud, self-explain, or evaluate the sources while reading and then write an integrated essay based on their reading. Natural Language Processing techniques were used to analyze the cohesion of the constructed responses at both within- and across-text levels. Both within- and across-text cohesion indices were positively related to essay quality; however, across-text cohesion indices exhibited stronger effects.

        "description":"At least 11% of California youth identify as LGBTQ+. These youth have diverse backgrounds and identities, but one fact remains the same: LGBTQ+ youth continue to face alarming rates of systemic and interpersonal marginalization. In a 2020 national survey, the Trevor Project found that 60% of LGBTQ+ youth experienced discrimination at some point in their lifetime because of their gender or sexual identity. In 2022, this rate increased to 73%. A closer look at what California's youth are saying themselves shows that a renewed commitment from state leaders, schools, and communities is needed to provide proactive, identity-affirming support. California's schools. Nearly 26% of lesbian, gay, and bisexual students had attempted suicide in the 12 months prior to responding to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System survey, a rate 4 times higher than that of straight students. This disparity is reflective of California's conflicting sociopolitical landscape. On one hand, California has some of the strongest legal protections for LGBTQ+ children in the country--including a recently-signed law that protects children moving to California in search of safe, gender-affirming resources. On the other hand, despite these legal protections, uneven implementation of policy, a lack of awareness and accountability from school leaders, and the tolerance of interpersonal discrimination in California schools, results in high rates of LGBTQ+ youth who continue to fear for their safety. Urgent work is needed to eliminate disparities in the wellbeing of California's LGBTQ+ youth.",

CASEL has recommended three priority areas for social and emotional learning (SEL) investment that can assist states and districts in optimizing ARP for student success: (1) Promote social and emotional learning (SEL) for students; (2) Align SEL efforts across schools, families, and communities; and (3) Support adult SEL competencies and capacity building. This &quot;Bright Spots&quot; brief highlights policy innovations around Priority Area 2--aligning SEL efforts across schools, families, and communities--through state investments in evidence-based SEL to support academic recovery and social and emotional well-being, the need for which was made abundantly clear by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using the game-based digital algebraic notation system, From Here to There!

In fall of 2019, 409 middle-school students completed a randomized control trial where they worked in either GM or an online problem set control over four half-hour sessions during their math block. We found that students in the FH2T condition showed enhanced performance over the control (p = 0.043, [partial eta-squared] = 0.010). We will describe the FH2T technology, describe our results, and discuss implications for the usefulness of digital environments in mathematics education.

In addition, the pandemic led to the cancellation of test administrations, which, in turn, caused many institutions to eliminate admissions test requirements. These developments present an opportunity to reconsider the role of college admissions testing. The report begins by recounting the history of college admissions in the US, the relationship of admissions tests to intelligence testing and military testing, and the motivations for developing standardized exams to replace the admissions methods used at the turn of the twentieth century. Next, it describes the college admissions tests used today, along with their role in the admissions process, their advantages and limitations, and the ongoing debates about their fairness. Finally it discusses the future of admissions and admissions testing and end with a discussion of the concept of meritocracy as it applies to college admissions.",

        "description":"An important component of many Adaptive Instructional Systems (AIS) is a 'Learner Model' intended to track student learning and predict future performance. Predictions from learner models are frequently used in combination with mastery criterion decision rules to make pedagogical decisions. Important aspects of learner models, such as learning rate and item difficulty, can be estimated from prior data. A critical function of AIS is to have students practice new content once the AIS predicts that they have 'mastered' current content or learned it to some criterion. For making this prediction, individual student parameters (e.g., for learning rate) are frequently unavailable due to having no prior data about a student, and thus population-level parameters or rules-of-thumb are typically applied instead. In this paper, we will argue and demonstrate via simulation and data analysis that even in best-case scenarios, learner models assuming equal learning rates for students will inevitably lead to systematic errors that result in suboptimal pedagogical decisions for most learners. This finding leads us to conclude that systematic errors should be expected, and mechanisms to adjust predictions to account for them should be included in AIS. We introduce two solutions that can adjust for student differences &quot;online&quot; in a running system: one that tracks systemic errors of the learner model (not the student) and adjusts accordingly, and a student-level performance adaptive feature. We demonstrate these solutions' efficacy and practicality on six large educational datasets and show that these features improved model accuracy in all tested datasets.

        "description":"We provide the first causal evidence of the returns to maternal educational curricula on offspring's health at birth. Educational programs that aim to deliver more general knowledge may potentially improve women's earning potential and maternal prenatal investment by increasing the portability of skills across occupations and improving women's ability to make informed decisions about fertility options and health behavior. We study the impacts of a comprehensive educational reform that postponed students' curriculum choices and integrated more general education into the high school system on infant health outcomes. Using a dose-response difference-in-differences (DiD) model research design applied to linked population registries, we find that the reform led to a significant reduction in the incidence of very low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams) and very preterm birth (less than 33 gestation weeks). Overall, the reform's positive effects on infant health at birth seem to be driven by increased mothers' labor market opportunities and better family planning, rather than increased ability to avoid risky behaviours or increased women's earnings via different occupational choices or assortative mating.

        "description":"EPS contracted with LXD Research, a third-party research company, to examine the relationship between progress in S.P.I.R.E. and student reading outcomes at Martin County School District in Florida. LXD Research analyzed 192 students from grades 3-5 in 13 elementary schools who use S.P.I.R.E./i.S.P.I.R.E. reading intervention that uses an Orton-Gillingham approach. The Martin County School District's largest racial/ethnic group is Hispanic (48%), and over one-third of students (38%) had a Limited English Proficiency class or were still being monitored. Researchers used S.P.I.R.E. progress level and the Florida Assessment of Student Thinking (FAST) to understand the impact of the intervention program on student's learning outcomes. LXD Research found that students who completed more lessons in S.P.I.R.E. had higher literacy achievement at the end of the study, and these relationships were statistically significant. For all grades, students who completed more S.P.I.R.E. levels had higher spring FAST achievement (t(190) = 2.9, p &lt; 0.01, Cohen's d effect size = 0.44). For all grades, S.P.I.R.E. ending level was significantly correlated with spring FAST achievement (r(190) = 0.43, p &lt; 0.01) for students in Grades 3-5. After controlling for grade, race, LEP status, gender, and Fall FAST scores in an Analysis of Covariance, S.P.I.R.E. significantly predicted spring FAST achievement for students across Grades 3-5. This study provides results to satisfy ESSA evidence requirements for Level III (Promising Evidence) given the study design and positive, statistically significant findings.",

        "description":"Automated scoring of student language is a complex task that requires systems to emulate complex and multi-faceted human evaluation criteria. Summary scoring brings an additional layer of complexity to automated scoring because it involves two texts of differing lengths that must be compared. In this study, we present our approach to automate summary scoring by evaluating a corpus of approximately 5,000 summaries based on 103 source texts, each summary being scored on a 4-point Likert scale for seven different evaluation criteria. We train and evaluate a series of Machine Learning models that use a combination of independent textual complexity indices from the ReaderBench framework and Deep Learning models based on the Transformer architecture in a multitask setup to predict concurrently all criteria. Our models achieve significantly lower errors than previous work using a similar dataset, with MAE ranging from 0.10-0.16 and corresponding R[superscript 2] values of up to 0.64. Our findings indicate that Longformer-based models are adequate for contextualizing longer text sequences and effectively scoring summaries according to a variety of human-defined evaluation criteria using a single Neural Network.

        "description":"Schools are increasingly engaging in career-connected learning to increase career exposure and skill development. But focusing on skills alone will fall short, particularly if schools hope to address long-standing opportunity gaps. Awareness of possible careers and access to jobs depends not only on learning and achievement, but on personal and professional relationships that serve as gateways to career opportunities. Opportunity sits at the intersection of students' human capital--what they know and can do--and their social capital--who they know and can depend on for support and access. To launch a career, students need more than skills--they also need people willing to take a bet on their potential. With the aim of helping leaders implement effective, equitable strategies for building students' social capital, this report offers field-tested considerations for piloting social capital building within existing career pathways initiatives. The observations draw from an 18-month pilot during which the authors leveraged their social capital playbook to provide direct support to a group of three intermediary organizations--Education Strategy Group, Generation Schools Network, and Hawai'i P-20--collectively supporting 20 sites in the K-12 career pathways space. In the course of the pilot, the authors sought to understand how schools and nonprofits can make social capital building an explicit, effective, and equitable component of existing career-connected learning models.",

How can schools create safe environments while also fostering welcoming, equitable school climates that support growth, learning, and community? To help Colorado policymakers and school communities answer this question, the Colorado Children's Campaign has identified and compiled research on strategies that are supported by strong evidence. While school safety can be defined broadly as freedom from physical, emotional, and psychological violence, this brief focuses on promoting freedom from bodily harm in a school setting. Strategies that support students' well-being and prevent bullying, fighting, the use of weapons, and other types of violence can contribute to reducing harm.

For students of color, having a teacher of color can increase academic achievement and advanced course-taking, reduce discipline incidents, improve attendance, increase high school graduation and college-going, as well as increase social-emotional outcomes like grit and sense of self-efficacy. The national movement for teacher diversity--driven by both a national reckoning around racial injustice and mounting research on the positive impact that teachers of color have on students--is clearly ascendant. This is a policy area that will require sustained commitment from states to achieve progress and increase the number of teachers of color in the workforce.

Logistic regression on 857 problem-level data points from 227 middle-school students showed that students were more likely to use productive solution strategies on addition and multiplication problems when proximity supported number grouping, 100 was the problem-solving goal, and students had high prior knowledge. Furthermore, when proximity and number goals did not support problem-solving, students with low prior knowledge were less likely to use productive solution strategies on multiplication problems than students with high prior knowledge.

        "description":"This paper examines how the process of making higher education choices in the United States--whether to enter higher education, attend a particular college, or follow a particular path through college--produces and legitimates social inequality. The paper's central thesis is that a societal regime of many choices--while serving individual freedom and producing social well-being--&quot;produces&quot; societal inequality in a way that obscures that process of social reproduction for virtually all who participate in that choice regime. Students often make choices that do not serve their interests as well as they might wish, particularly if students are faced with many choices and do not have adequate information. The incidence of those suboptimal choices is not random but is socially stratified. It is higher for less advantaged people, and unequal provision of good information plays a crucial role in producing those socially stratified suboptimal choices. Secondly, the provision of many choices &quot;legitimates&quot; social inequality. Seemingly offered many choices in life, both the fortunate and unfortunate in society come to feel that much of the inequality they experience is due to their own actions and therefore is legitimate. The paper concludes by offering various prescriptions for reducing the socially stratifying impacts and ideological consequences of a high-choice regime. It lays out how we could more equally distribute high-quality information, nudge students toward better choice making, reduce the costs to students of suboptimal choices, and mitigate blaming self and others by demystifying the nature of choice. In making these arguments, this paper draws on the research literature in sociology of education, behavioral economics, cognitive psychology, and social psychology of inequality.",

        "description":"The response to the COVID-19 pandemic upended the US K-12 education system, exacerbated pre-existing challenges around student achievement, and created new obstacles to delivering high-quality learning for all students. Concerns for the US education system were increasing prior to the pandemic as academic achievement and school reforms struggled to keep pace with the evolving demands of the 21st century. School disruptions during the pandemic enervated the US education system, highlighted inequities, and intensified deficiencies leading to a new level of national education crisis which is becoming more and more evident in recent national assessments of achievement. This Solutions Brief examines the impact of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic on the US K-12 education system. It reviews the historic investment by Congress to restore schools and identifies promising practice examples that offer hope for student success. The Brief also proposes a series of recommendations that includes utilizing advances in technology and the extraordinary federal funding for K-12 education in states to enhance learning recovery and repair systemic issues to ensure all children can progress in educational attainment and are equipped to succeed as productive, engaged citizens.",

Using statewide administrative data in Texas on students who entered 9th grade in 2015 or 2016 and took at least one dual enrollment course through a community college, this paper examines dual enrollment course enrollments and outcomes among recent high school entrants. We describe dual enrollment coursetaking and dual enrollment course characteristics (including instructor affiliation, course location, and instructional modality) for traditional Texas public high school students (as opposed to those attending an Early College High School or charter school), illustrating how students participate in dual enrollment (e.g., the types of courses taken and when in their high school career students take these courses) and highlighting typical course characteristics. We then examine how dual enrollment course and instructor characteristics predict student course completion, course grades, and subsequent college enrollment. Our descriptive analyses illuminate striking differences between the demographic and academic backgrounds of students who take academic dual enrollment courses versus career and technical education dual enrollment courses, as well as variation in course characteristics across these two dual enrollment course types. Our regression analyses illustrate how several malleable dual enrollment course characteristics are associated with students' course outcomes and subsequent college enrollment. The relationships we identify offer insights for the design of dual enrollment courses and programs.",

Research also makes clear, however, that access to early postsecondary opportunities is uneven, with lower rates of participation among students of color, those from low-income families, and those from other groups underrepresented among college graduates (e.g., English learners and students with disabilities). Moreover, research indicates that to be effective with students who do not have clear plans for college after high school, solely enabling students to take college courses is not sufficient; students from underrepresented groups also benefit from outreach, advising, and strong teaching and academic support building on their interests to further motivate and guide them to pursue postsecondary education after high school. This brief examines research on the five most common college-credit-in-high-school models and assesses their potential as large-scale on-ramps to postsecondary programs that lead to career-path employment for students who have not been well served historically in the transition from high school to college and careers.",

Spiritual intelligence (SI) is an intelligence that transforms emotions, thoughts, body and mind of an individual and helps in developing holistic approach to life. It not only helps to discriminate between good and bad but also helps to realize one's potential and activates positive qualities. Thus, it is a powerful ability to solve problems related to personal, professional, academic, social and other aspects of life. Developing a holistic approach to life is one of the key goals of higher education and SI enables students and teachers to handle difficult situations and to live a happy life. Keeping this in mind, the objectives of the present study was to measure the level of SI of teachers and students, explore the influence of designation on SI and its dimension based on cross sectional survey design. Data was collected randomly through a self- developed SI rating scale from 1266 students and 330 teachers. The findings revealed that almost equal number of teachers and students fall in low, medium and high level of SI. Results also showed no association between the level of SI and designation of participants. It was also found that designation of participants had significant influence on some dimensions of SI. Age and level of education may be responsible for this influence and that can be explored in further research.",

Similarly, the treatment group demographics comprise 51% males, 2% with SPED status, 36% ELL, 87% from diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds, and 20% identified as foster/homeless. Results of the study found that using PA Lessons substantially impacted student growth for Tiers 2 &amp; 3 over the fall. PA Lesson schools had reduced Well Below Grade Level by half (67% to 28%). Comparison schools only reduced the group by less than a third (67% to 47%). Notably, 41% of PA Lesson students were At/Above grade level mid-year, compared to only 25% in other schools.",

The study is a replication of a study conducted in the same medium-sized school district in California during 2021-2022. Students Below or Well Below Benchmark in Fall 2022 were assessed with Acadience? Reading was used to compare literacy growth from 2022-2023 using a quasi-experimental design, aligning with Moderate evidence standards associated with ESSA Level. The study follows 536 kindergarten students from 11 schools, 260 in the treatment group, and 276 in the comparison group. The demographic characteristics of the comparison group included 56% males, 3% with special education (SPED) status, 45% English Language Learners (ELL), 88% were Hispanic, and 24% identified as foster/homeless. Similarly, the treatment group demographics comprise 51% males, 2% with SPED status, 36% ELL, 87% were Hispanic, and 21% identified as foster/homeless. Results showed that using PA Lessons substantially impacted student growth for Tiers 2 &amp; 3 across the school year with a Cohen's d effect size .84, which is more than twice as large as previous studies. PA Lesson schools reduced Well Below Grade Level by 25 percentage points from Fall to Spring (72% to 47%). Alternatively, comparison schools only reduced the group by 20 percentage points from Fall to Spring (79% to 59%). Notably, an additional 10% of students ended the year At or Above Benchmark for the grade level (36% PA Lessons vs. 26% Other Schools).",

        "description":"The Pennsylvania Department of Education's (PDE's) Office for Safe Schools partnered with REL Mid-Atlantic to conduct a study using data from PDE's school climate survey. This survey, which is available on a voluntary basis to any school in the state, provides a way to track school climate and identify schools that need additional support to improve school climate. The REL study analyzed changes in scores from a pre-pandemic year (2018/19) to the 2020/21 and 2021/22 school years, both of which were affected by COVID-19 and related policy changes. In a sample of Pennsylvania public schools that took the survey consistently across multiple years, students and teachers reported more positive perceptions of school climate in the 2020/21 school year, during hybrid and remote learning, compared to 2018/19 and 2021/22. This was an unexpected positive bump in the year in which schools experienced the most pandemic-related disruption. In contrast, school climate scores were steady across the years before COVID-19. The study also found no evidence of a significant decline in school climate scores between 2018/19 and 2021/22, suggesting the pandemic did not have a lasting negative effect on school climate in this sample of schools. One important caveat of this study is that the sample of schools was small and not representative of the rest of the state of Pennsylvania. The study also examined the relationship between school climate scores in 2021/22 and the amount of virtual and hybrid instruction used during 2020/21 and found no association. However, this analysis was limited by the small sample size and could only rule out a large association; a small or moderate association is still possible. [For the appendixes, see ED629791.]",

        "description":"Income-driven repayment (IDR) plans are a subset of student loan repayment plans that cap a borrower's monthly payment at a percentage of their discretionary income, which is defined as a portion of a borrower's adjusted gross income (AGI) that exceeds a specified multiple of the federal poverty line (FPL) for the borrower's family size. A borrower may be in negative amortization under an IDR plan, which means that their monthly payment can be less than the interest that accrues in a given month, and the accumulation of unpaid interest may lead to an increase in their loan balance. Any loan balance that remains outstanding after the borrower has made qualifying payments according to an IDR plan for a maximum repayment period is to be forgiven. Over the last nearly 30 years, Congress and the Department of Education (ED) have created the following existing IDR plans: the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan, two Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plans, the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) repayment plan, and the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan. In January 2023, ED published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to make a number of substantial amendments to the federal student loan IDR plans. This report discusses the most frequently asked questions related to the proposed rules in the following areas: (1) background on IDR plans; (2) changes specific to the REPAYE repayment plan such as to borrower eligibility, monthly payments, interest benefits, and the maximum repayment period; (3) changes applicable to all IDR plans; other provisions related to delinquent and defaulted borrowers; and (4) the estimated cost of the proposed rules.",

The ESRA authorizes much of the federal government's efforts to collect statistics and conduct research on the U.S. educational system. Part A of the ESRA establishes the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as an independent research institute and the National Board of Educational Sciences to advise and approve priorities for data collection and research. Parts B thru E of the ESRA authorize four National Education Centers that carry out the research and data collection duties of IES. The ETAA authorizes support for technical assistance activities and the development of state systems that integrate student-level data from preschool through postsecondary education and employment. The NAEPAA authorizes support for assessments of the academic achievement of students across the United States. Although authorities in the acts expired in FY2008, funding has continued through annual appropriations legislation. In FY2023, $734 million was appropriated to support IES' activities.",

The multitude of training providers, the diverse range of courses available, varying fees, and differences among providers can present a daunting environment for students. Prior studies have identified several key influences on student choice of training provider, such as the views of trusted influencers, course timetables, location of the training, perceived quality of training provider and affordability. However, how these drivers of student choice compare with one another and whether student support services also play a role remain unclear. This report investigates the influence of student support service offerings on students' choice of training provider and how they compare with other drivers of student choice, for example, course cost, delivery mode and travel time. In particular, the research focuses on health and welfare support, career counselling and job-search support, and tutoring and guidance on study skills. [For Support Document 1, see ED629802.

Three forms of support were included in the DCE: (1) health and welfare support; (2) career counselling and job search support; and (3) tutoring and study skills guidance. Each varied in the level to which a hypothetic VET course provider offered the form of support, ranging from not offered at all, to group sessions and resources, to personalised one-on-one support offerings. Other VET course attributes known to influence student choice (price, delivery mode, travel time) were also included in the experiment to make the scenarios presented realistic and quantify the extent to which supports shaped prospective student choices relative to these. In combination, the three forms of support investigated represented approximately 26% of the total importance when deciding on a VET course (10% tutoring and study skills, 7.9% health and welfare, 7.8% career counselling). Respondents had a notably higher utility for one-on-one level support for tutoring and study skills relative to group-level offerings, although any provision of the three forms of support increased respondent preferences to select a course. Supports tended to be inelastic, meaning the demand for these services was not strongly impacted by course price. [For the full report, see ED629801.]",

The present study aims to describe students' critical and creative thinking skills in STEAM-CT integrative learning. The descriptive qualitative method was employed in this study. The current study included 26 eighth-grade students from a private middle school in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. According to the analysis, the students demonstrated critical and creative thinking skills during the integrative STEAM-CT learning process, particularly in planning problem solving, flexibility in providing problem solutions, and the aesthetics of their product designs. However, students must still be encouraged to conduct in-depth evaluations and use the results for improvement. For recommendation, to promote students' critical and creative thinking skills, feedback practices could be embedded in teaching and learning.",

        "author":["Hegji, Alexandra"],
        "description":"The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) program is the single largest source of federal financial assistance to support students' postsecondary educational pursuits. The U.S. Department of Education estimates that in FY2024, $85.8 billion in new loans will be made through the program. As of the end of the first quarter of FY2023, $1.4 trillion in principal and interest on Direct Loan program loans, borrowed by or on behalf of 38.3 million individuals, remained outstanding. For many individuals, borrowing a federal student loan through the Direct Loan program may be among their first experiences in incurring a major financial obligation. Upon obtaining a loan, a borrower assumes a contractual obligation to repay the debt over a period that may span a decade or more. Loans were first made through the Direct Loan program in 1994. Since then, Congress has periodically made changes to the program and the terms and conditions of loans. Changes have impacted program aspects such as the availability of loan types, interest rates, loan repayment, loan discharge and forgiveness, and the consequences of default. Over time, the accumulation of changes--many of which are differentially applicable to borrowers or loan types--has resulted in a set of loan terms and conditions that are voluminous and complex. Congress may contemplate making future changes to loan terms and conditions. This report has been prepared to provide Congress with a comprehensive description of the terms and conditions and borrower benefits that are applicable to loans made through the Direct Loan program. Emphasis is placed on discussing loan types, provisions related to borrower eligibility, amounts that may be borrowed, interest and fees, loan repayment, repayment relief, loan forgiveness benefits, the consequences of default, and the methods used to ensure borrowers are informed about the terms and conditions of their loans and their obligation to repay them.",

        "description":"This paper advances an approach to culture and language instruction through the theoretical construct of the 3Ps (Products, Practices, Perspectives), combined with an inquiry-based approach utilizing the theory on stages of second language acquisition. Culture elements, when embodied in a properly developed and organized curriculum can be systematically implemented all along the different phases of language growth. Mastery of a language is not simply mastery of vocabulary as well as grammar and spelling rules. The most successful language learners learn both culture and language together. The conceptualizations provided by research, although at times conflicting, form a useful foundation for language teaching that provides a deeper and a more enriching human experience. Making culture the core in a language class is akin to asserting the obvious (Furstenberg, 2010); they are two flip sides of the same coin. With its focus on revisiting the role of culture in the FL Classroom, the paper seems to fall into the same category - affirming the tried and true, but like Furstenberg, the author believes there is good reason to re-consider the possibility of closing the language and culture gap.

        "description":"Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA; P.L. 89-329, as amended) authorizes the operation of three federal student loan programs: the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) program, the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, and the Federal Perkins Loan program. While new loans are currently authorized to be made only through the Direct Loan program, previously made FFEL and Perkins Loan program loans remain outstanding and borrowers of such loans remain responsible for repaying them. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $1.6 trillion in these loans, borrowed by or on behalf of 43.8 million individuals, remained outstanding. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous questions have arisen regarding student loan repayment flexibilities and debt relief that may be available to individuals to alleviate potential financial effects related to COVID-19. The HEA generally authorizes several options for qualifying individuals. Congressional and administrative action, including the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (P.L. 116-136) and invocation of the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 (HEROES Act) by the Administration, provide additional student loan relief measures. This report provides an overview of student loan repayment flexibilities and debt relief provisions that may be available to borrowers facing financial difficulties in light of the pandemic. It first lists some preexisting loan terms and conditions (authorized through statute and regulations) that may be available to individuals. It then discusses specific administrative and congressional actions taken to address student loan debt in the context of COVID-19. The report concludes with a brief description of additional existing authorities that could be utilized to address other aspects of student loan relief.",

The GI Bills are the most well-known and popular veterans' educational assistance programs. The VA estimated that it provided $10.2 billion in benefits to over 800,000 participants in FY2022. The largest program, the Post-9/11 GI Bill, is estimated to account for approximately 82% of benefits and 69% of participants. In recent years, Congress has held several oversight and legislative hearings on a variety of subjects relating to the veterans' education programs, including (but not limited to), improving access and eligibility to benefits, automating claims processing to reduce payment delays, educating eligible individuals about their benefits and choices, and trying to ensure benefits are not wasted on poor quality programs of education. This report discusses measures enacted in the 117th Congress that made changes to the veterans' educational assistance programs. Some of the laws that enacted veterans' educational assistance measures address only veterans' education, while others address a broader set of policies.

Such requirements have changed throughout the course of history. Current law requires the Secretary of Agriculture to prescribe &quot;minimum nutritional requirements&quot; based on &quot;tested nutritional research.&quot; In addition, school meal nutrition standards must be &quot;consistent with the goals of the most recent Dietary Guidelines [for Americans]&quot; (DGAs). Under these parameters, USDA has established detailed nutritional requirements in regulations. This report discusses the latest proposed revision of nutritional requirements for school meals, as promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in a proposed rule on February 7, 2023. The proposal, according to USDA, was informed by the DGAs and feedback from stakeholders, particularly in the wake of temporary changes to nutrition standards for school meals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to analyse the impact of the emerging concept of 'learning acceleration' in addressing student's learning gaps and enhancing their learning levels, especially for high-risk students who struggle to pass state board examinations. The study focuses on understanding the impact of the tech-driven Learning Acceleration programme adopted by a remote and rural district - Dumka in Jharkhand State of India. This study examines the learning outcomes of randomly selected sample students from control and treatment groups. The control group included students who had no exposure to the project, while the treatment group included students who were exposed to the tech driven learning acceleration program in Dumka District. The performance of students was evaluated in the Maths subject for Grade 11 and Grade 12 students through the baseline and endline learning assessments deployed during the academic session 2022-23 and also, based on student's interaction with the platform. The impact of the program for students from different socio-economic backgrounds has also been assessed to analyse how useful has been the program to build equity for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. An overall improvement in Academic Performance by 14% in Mathematics was observed for treatment group students. Students from different socio-economic backgrounds - rural regions, low-income families (&lt; INR 10,000 per month, ST/ SC Category, Female Students and first generation learners have shown remarkable improvement in their performance. Treatment group students were able to overcome non-linear learning gaps by bridging their foundational learning gaps while also enhancing their overall understanding of the topic. Also, reduction of high-risk students who struggled to obtain passing scores and has seen a transformational rise in the number of high-performing students. The evidence from the study can help education policy makers to devote attention to learning acceleration as an effective tool to bridge learning gaps aggregated over years among students, especially after COVID-19.

        "author":["Liu, Edward C.",

        "description":"In August 2022, the U.S Department of Education (ED) announced it would invoke the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 (HEROES Act) to cancel up to $20,000 of federal student loan debts for borrowers who fell below certain income thresholds. The HEROES Act authorizes the Secretary to &quot;waive or modify&quot; statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to federal student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965 to ensure that borrowers are not placed in a worse position financially in relation to their student loans as a result of a war, other military operation, or national emergency. Plaintiffs filed multiple lawsuits challenging the cancellation policy before any borrowers could obtain relief under it. Certain suits resulted in two federal court orders blocking implementation of the program. The Supreme Court agreed to review these two cases, &quot;Biden v. Nebraska&quot; and &quot;Department of Education v. Brown,&quot; and heard oral argument in February 2023. The questions for which the Court granted certiorari generally can be divided into jurisdictional questions, that is, whether federal courts may hear the challenges to the cancellation policy, and merits questions, that is, assuming jurisdiction exists, whether the cancellation policy is lawful. This report begins by placing those important questions in their context, surveying affected federal student loan programs, past uses of HEROES Act authority, and congressional debates concerning student loan cancellation. The report then describes the cancellation policy itself and traces the history of Nebraska and Brown in the lower courts. This report next assesses the parties' key legal arguments about standing, statutory authority for the policy, and whether the Secretary adopted the policy in a procedurally valid manner. Finally, this report concludes with a discussion of potential implications of decisions in Nebraska and Brown for the cancellation policy, for the Secretary's HEROES Act authority, and for legal doctrines that are not confined to the federal student loan context.",

Pinder in collaboration with the University of the West Indies' (UWI) Mona Faculty of Science and Technology who hosted a UNESCO sponsored Disaster Heritage Webinar, i.e., Disaster heritage -- Jamaica National Commission for UNESCO (jncunesco.gov.jm). The webinar presentation focused specifically on natural disasters such as catastrophic storms or hurricanes like the powerful Category 5 Storm--Hurricane Dorian, which hit the Bahamas' northern islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama on September 1, 2019. Hurricane Dorian caused major damages to homes and properties, and resulted in loss of lives. The presentation and this current paper were developed as educational advisory guides to give teachers and other education professionals ideas on how to help young children to cope after natural disasters. Thus, it is important for teachers to help young children (students) to undergo various coping mechanisms in order to build resilience. Using stories/storytelling sessions, games, and comic sketches are some of the suggested tools and strategies that can be used with young children to help them better cope after psychologically disturbing events like the Bahamas' Hurricane Dorian.",

        "description":"The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), most recently comprehensively amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; P.L. 114-95), is the primary source of federal aid to support elementary and secondary education. The Title I-A program is the largest grant program authorized under the ESEA and was funded at $17.5 billion for FY2022. It is designed to provide supplementary educational and related services to low-achieving and other students attending elementary and secondary schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low-income families. Under current law, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) determines Title I-A allocations to local educational agencies (LEAs) based on four separate funding formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). State grants are the total of the allocations for all LEAs in the state under all four formulas. The four Title I-A formulas have somewhat distinct allocation patterns, providing varying shares of allocated funds to different types of LEAs and states. Thus, for some states, certain formulas are more favorable than others. This report provides FY2022 state grant amounts under each of the four formulas used to determine Title I-A grants. Overall, California received the largest FY2022 Title I-A grant amount ($2.1 billion, or 11.98% of total Title I-A grants to states). Vermont received the smallest FY2022 Title I-A grant amount ($40.1 million, or 0.23% of total Title I-A grants to states).",

        "description":"A longstanding goal of learner modeling and educational data mining is to improve the domain model of knowledge that is used to make inferences about learning and performance. In this report we present a tool for finding domain models that is built into an existing modeling framework, logistic knowledge tracing (LKT). LKT allows the flexible specification of learner models in logistic regression by allowing the modeler to select whatever features of the data are relevant to prediction. Each of these features (such as the count of prior opportunities) is a function computed for a component of data (such as a student or knowledge component). In this context, we have developed the &quot;autoKC&quot; component, which clusters knowledge components and allows the modeler to compute features for the clustered components. For an autoKC, the input component (initial KC or item assignment) is clustered prior to computing the feature and the feature is a function of that cluster. Another recent new function for LKT, which allows us to specify interactions between the logistic regression predictor terms, is combined with autoKC for this report. Interactions allow us to move beyond just assuming the cluster information has additive effects to allow us to model situations where a second factor of the data moderates a first factor.

        "description":"Many postsecondary institutions already recognize that adults comprise a significant portion of their student body -- or they may be starting to recognize the potential for serving more adults as they face declining enrollments from their traditional student pipelines. These institutions realize that they should have programs and services in place that are tailored to address the challenges and opportunities that individually and collectively shape adult learner success. However, institutions are often unaware of whether and how their existing programs and services effectively support adult learners. Consequently, it is difficult for leadership to allocate resources strategically to best invest in adult learner success. This report includes individual as well as aggregate summaries of how CAEL's Adult Learner 360™ has helped postsecondary institutions, systems, and partnerships use data to optimize resources for current and prospective adult learners. The CUNY School of Professional Studies, Lorain County Community College, the Virginia Community College System, and KC Scholars all utilized Adult Learner 360's integrated diagnostic solution. Adult Learner 360 uses parallel surveys to assess and benchmark institutional effectiveness in serving adult learners, identify challenges and opportunities, and chart pathways of improvement through a data-intensive gap analysis. One survey captures the perspective of institutional stakeholders who work with adult learners or lead those who do. The other captures the perspective of adult learners themselves.",

        "description":"Statewide longitudinal data systems (SLDSs) can enable researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to identify and understand important relationships and trends across the education-to-workforce continuum. A well-developed SLDS can increase state and territory governments' ability to establish more informed and equitable policies, enable agency leaders to act more strategically, and help practitioners make more data-informed decisions. The SLDS Survey was created to capture information about the data capacity of states' and territories' SLDSs across these varying circumstances. In addition to inventorying information about whether a given data type, link, or use is in place, the SLDS Survey explores the development of SLDSs and their varying degrees of implementation. By providing standard measures for various aspects of data capacity, the SLDS Survey helps stakeholders understand and assess the ability of SLDSs to store, manage, link, and use key data types across the preschool through workforce (P-20W+) spectrum. This Statistics in Brief provides aggregate data from the 2019 and 2020 administrations of the SLDS Survey. The primary focus of the report is on the 2020 SLDS Survey with results specific to the 2019 SLDS Survey. This brief is structured to address the following four research questions: (1) What types of K-12 data are included in the statewide longitudinal data system (SLDS)?; (2) What is the capacity for linking K-12 student data in the SLDS to other data? How are the data linked?; (3) Are there data dictionaries published publicly? Are data aligned to the Common Education Data Standards (CEDS)?; and (4) How do states and territories use data for reporting and decision-making?",

Considering recent concerns about the reading proficiency levels of students across the country and discussions about best practices to support foundational literacy skills development, the Council has developed a vision for foundational literacy skills instruction that meets the complex needs of English learners. This document provides a review of general and EL-specific research on early literacy, drawing from both to define a vision for foundational literacy skills instruction for ELs. The document outlines a framework for foundational literacy skills instruction around six principles to ensure that ELs develop the necessary literacy skills to engage with complex text in all subject areas successfully. Finally, the document also presents criteria by which school administrators and teachers can determine whether instructional materials for foundational literacy skills instruction are conducive to meeting the needs of English learners.",

Using operational concepts of assessment of learning for online learning, class observation, and interview were organized. The content and structure validity of the measures were evaluated in accordance with the developmental periods of young learners. The findings showed that the teachers assessed the primary students' cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains interactively during the online class meetings, in their portfolio, and through attitude direct observation. Several assessment strategies were advocated to circumvent the shortcomings of online learning. A criterion-referenced evaluation was used to conduct the analysis. The theoretical implications of the findings suggest that the various assessment procedures adopted have decreased the negative washback of online exams; however, further research is required to determine the consistency of the outcomes of online tests with other types of evaluation.",

        "description":"These proceedings are a written record of the research presented at the 42nd annual meeting of the North American Chapter of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education (PME-NA) held in Mazatlán, Mexico, virtually beginning May 27, 2021 and in-person June 2-6, 2021. The conference was originally scheduled to take place October 14-18, 2020; it was postponed, due to the COVID pandemic. In accordance with the major goals of PME-NA that include promoting international contacts and stimulating interdisciplinary research, the theme was proposed as &quot;Entre Culturas/Across Cultures&quot;. The goal of the theme was an academic exchange that would reflect the ample diversity of ways of teaching and learning of mathematics, and of the tools and communities involved in mathematics education; as well as an exploration of how the differences in cultures imply a need to consider how research results can be taken into account in varying contexts. The papers comprise 80 Research Reports, 190 Brief Reports, 147 Poster Presentations, 10 Working Groups, 2 Research Colloquia, and Plenary and special lectures. The program also includes a special tribute to Eugenio Filloy and a tribute to the PME-NA members who were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "description":"Since 2012, the Prudence Foundation has been working to address the gap in financial literacy in developing nations by creating and distributing financial literacy media and curricula targeting 7- to 10-year-olds in Asia and, more recently, Africa. &quot;Cha-Ching!&quot; is a multipronged learning initiative that reaches children, teachers, and parents in schools and at home through broadcast TV, digital and print curriculum, and web-based videos and interactives. The core of &quot;Cha-Ching!&quot; is an animated cartoon series featuring characters and songs that introduce children to basic concepts like earning, saving, spending, and donating. Built to accompany the cartoon series are a school based curriculum, a website with activities and materials for parents and children at home, and, now, a new interactive learning game, &quot;Cha-Ching! Money Adventures.&quot; In January 2022, Education Development Center researchers conducted an evaluation study of &quot;Cha-Ching! Money Adventures&quot; to determine its appeal and effectiveness for eight- to nine-year-olds playing the learning game at home. Prior to beginning game play, all students completed a 24-item test of Basic Financial Literacy. At the conclusion of game play, typically three to four weeks later, students completed the same 24-item test and answered questions about their experience of the games and the context of home play. The research found that: (1) &quot;Cha-Ching! Money Adventures&quot; is effective in improving children's knowledge of the core financial literacy concepts; (2) &quot;Cha-Ching! Money Adventures&quot; is highly appealing to eight- and nine-year-olds; and (3) &quot;Cha-Ching!&quot; fostered family conversations about money. [For the executive summary, see ED629886.]",

        "description":"Difficulty transitioning from school to higher education or work remains one of the key barriers facing girls in disadvantaged contexts, with far-reaching implications for their futures and wellbeing. In this report, the first in a three-year research project on girls' transitions into higher education or work, we seek to understand the challenges facing these girls and highlight promising interventions to support their transitions -- including in challenging contexts where marginalisation persists. Transition from school to higher education and work is a fundamentally important phase that determines individuals' future trajectories and livelihoods. This is particularly a pivotal period for girls in resource-constrained settings, where poverty and gender inequality intersect. This report moves beyond recent quantitative studies on gender-related barriers to school participation and learning to explore the wider evidence base on girls' education to identify: (1) the key skills necessary for transition; and (2) the interventions needed to make effective transitions happen. Looking at transition from the lens of a complete schooling cycle, the report also provides lessons for policymakers, particularly highlighting the need for effective transition to be supported across education systems in an integrated way, rather than through isolated individual programmes. Key findings: (1) the barriers to girls' transition are complex, multifaceted, and often reinforce each other. Multi-sectoral interventions that target overlapping vulnerabilities have been shown to have a positive impact in supporting girls' transitions; (2) in contexts where disadvantaged girls drop out of school or are unable to develop foundational skills, literacy and numeracy catch-up programs should be integrated into vocational and life skills training, to offer girls a second chance to develop the core skills; (3) to ensure girls are effectively prepared to transition into work, vocational training and on-the-job training or internships could be combined. This would provide opportunities for learning transferable skills alongside applying skills acquired by training in work contexts; and (4) integration of ICT in training programmes holds promise for building girls' skills and confidence in navigating an increasingly digital world.",

        "description":"The fourth school year impacted by the pandemic is more than halfway complete, and school district leaders across the country are working hard to invest remaining ESSER dollars strategically to support learning recovery. With the ESSER spending window closing soon, however, many leaders are spending funds to meet the deadline, rather than continuing to deliberately invest in the evidence-based practices that students need most and that promote long-term sustainability. Fortunately, state legislatures and state education agencies have the power to provide districts and schools with the resources and time they need to ensure students fully recover from pandemic-related disruption. By providing targeted guidance and enacting statutory and regulatory changes, states can--and should--empower districts with more flexible, strategic spending. This brief report looks at the following questions: (1) Why Do Districts Need More Support?; and (2) What Can States Do to Support Districts--Now and Beyond ESSER?",

But despite some stabilization during the pandemic, teacher and principal turnover rates are rising again at the district and school levels, especially at high-need schools. And our recent original research underscores an overlooked cyclical effect impacting teachers and students alike: When principals leave their schools, teachers are more likely to leave, as well. But when principals get effective support from their district office--including around attracting and retaining highly effective teachers--they're less likely to leave their school, which can stabilize teacher turnover rates and improve student outcomes and experiences. Our latest brief outlines four key supports that district leaders can provide to principals, mitigating the turnover cycle and boosting both principal and teacher retention.",

We utilized a methodological review and the Checklist for Analyzing Discipline Policies and Procedures for Equity (CADPPE) to examine the extent to which current policies reflect recommendations from research regarding best practices for encouraging appropriate behaviors and preventing undesired behaviors, as well as correlations between those policies and exclusionary disciplinary outcomes for all students of color and students of color with disabilities. Data came from 147 district discipline policies and disciplinary outcomes (i.e., suspension and expulsion) from all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The analyses indicated the majority of policies do not include most of the research-based recommendations for preventing the overuse of exclusionary practices. Furthermore, there was no correlation found between CADPPE ratings and the risk ratios for exclusionary discipline for students of color and students of color with disabilities. Implications for policy development and implementation and limitations are provided. [This paper was published in &quot;Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions&quot; v23 n3 2020 (EJ1297883).]",

        "description":"The implementation of context-based chemistry programs has been started before 40 years ago since 1980s in an attempt to make the learning of chemistry more meaningful for students. Consequent to its lengthy, there has been a steady increase in the number of interventional context-based (ICB) approach chemistry studies investigating the effect of various instructional strategies on students' learning outcomes from primary to post-secondary levels. However, there is a limitation of the literature review conducted on interventional context-based chemistry studies. Hence, the present review was carried out to evaluate interventional context-based chemistry studies using six research questions based on the following categories (main headings): (1) countries or continents in which ICB chemistry studies were conducted in; (2) research methodologies implemented in ICB studies; (3) topics in which ICB chemistry studies used; (4) learning variables measured by ICB studies; (5) teaching methods and instructional strategies adopted by ICB studies; and (6) the effectiveness of context-based instructions on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, some sub-headings also followed the main headings. To achieve this objective, a rigorous systematic literature review has been executed using 25 selected ICB chemistry studies published between the years 2009 and 2022 based on the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. These studies were accessed in internationally well-known databases (Google Scholar, ERIC, Semantic Scholar, and Mendeley); and the studies were organized and reviewed thematically. To summarize and present the findings of the studies, matrices, constructed by the researcher, were used. The review analysis results revealed and shed light on the critical appraisal of interventional context-based chemistry studies, missing parts of the context-based approach, and implications and suggestions for future studies.",

        "description":"What are the barriers to employment for young people who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) or who have experience of care? What works best to support them? In partnership with the Employment Related Services Association (ERSA), our latest report draws conclusions from a survey of practitioners and young people to understand the barriers they face, what services are offered, and what is considered to work best in helping NEET young people--and especially care leavers--to progress into work. More than one in ten young people in the UK between the ages of 16 and 24 are classified as not in employment, education or training (NEET), and the rate of young people being NEET has not fallen below 10% over the last twenty years. We know that being NEET can have immediate negative consequences for a young person, such as decreasing levels of self-esteem, increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviours such as substance misuse and criminal activities, and increasing their chances of living in poverty. While there has been much research into the factors that lead to becoming NEET, how these can be mitigated, and the impacts of being NEET, there is not the same body of evidence to inform the support provided to young people to move into and stay in education, employment and training (EET). This study looks at what the existing research has to say and surveys young people and the practitioners who work with them on four key questions: (1) What are the key barriers to EET for young people and care leavers who are NEET?; (2) What is currently offered to young people and care leavers in terms of entry to EET support?; (3) What is currently offered in terms of in-work support for young people and care leavers?; and (4) What types of provision are most effective at dealing with the barriers young people face to EET? Drawing out lessons for practitioners and policymakers, this study contributes to our understanding of what young people see as the issues, the support they need and what service providers are offering to some of the most vulnerable people in society.

The study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data from an online questionnaire administered to 150 STEM students through Google Forms and qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with 15 STEM English language instructors affiliated with many Egyptian universities, including Ain Shams University in Cairo, Zagazig University in Northern Egypt and Minia University (in Upper Egypt). The results reveal that both students and instructors perceive the STEM courses as beneficial for developing students' language skills, content knowledge and critical thinking abilities. However, they also face several challenges, such as insufficient time, resources and support, lack of alignment between the course objectives and the students' needs and expectations, and difficulties in integrating language and content. The study concludes with a suggested framework that includes some implications and recommendations for improving the quality and effectiveness of the STEM courses.

Because of the homogeneity of schools, five schools were randomly selected out of the 24 public secondary schools in the Zone. Similarly, 387 student samples were taken by using simple random sampling techniques to give equal chances to all respondents, while 10 school principals and 10 teachers were selected by availability sampling. The research adopted an embedded mixed (QUANT+qual) design. Questionnaires (quantitative data) for students and unstructured interviews (qualitative data) for principals and teachers were used as collecting instruments. Besides descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, multiple correlations, and multiple linear regression using model IBM SPSS Statistics 20 were used. The result of the study signifies the positive and direct relationships between cheating and the predictor variables. The study is expected to provide evidence-based information for curriculum developers, policy makers, educational officials, school principals, science teachers, and school communities as a whole.

This framework describes &quot;unstructured literacy opportunities&quot; and &quot;structured literacy opportunities&quot; for each of the language modalities of reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Different structures within each modality are also detailed along with connections between the modalities. The framework is then applied to Illustrative Mathematics (IM) curriculum materials to reveal patterns of how different types of literacy opportunities are addressed and connected.

A teacher's pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) influences both instruction and students' learning. However, there is currently little research examining teachers' PCK within this domain, particularly regarding professional education of future teachers. To help address this need, the present paper presents an initial validity argument for a survey of preservice teacher's PCK for multiplication and division.

We present data from a teaching experiment to highlight how this task sequence supported students as they imagined constant increases in the amounts of change in one quantity, a kind of change they later understood to be a defining characteristic of quadratic growth. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and how our integration of the three frameworks proved useful to design a productive task sequence. [For the complete proceedings, see ED629884.]",

The main result is that students in both the Pre-Intervention and Redesigned classrooms made gains on the pre- and post-unit assessments. However, student gains on the assessments were higher in the Redesigned classrooms than in the Pre-Intervention classrooms. Additionally, on the assessment in the Redesigned classes, students classified as English Learners made larger gains than their non-EL peers, and the majority of the gains occurred on conceptually-focused items.

Part of this is due to the lack of authentic opportunities to engage in analyzing difficult scenarios involving power, identity, and access. Additionally, mathematics educators sometimes have trouble finding, sharing, and collaborating on activities and materials that interrogate these spaces. In this research report, we present how a collective of equity-oriented mathematics educators created, enacted, and studied the use of scenarios presenting difficult situations to pre- and in-service mathematics teachers. More importantly, this report shows how we, as a field of mathematics educators, can enact large-scale collaboration that disrupts the capitalistic norms of knowledge ownership and neoliberal approaches to teacher preparation. The CARDS tool was not created by an individual, but by an amorphous group aligned and committed to equity. [This article was written with The MathEd Collective.

Ethnomathematics has brought attention to the mathematical practices of particular cultural groups that differ from Western ways of mathematical understanding. These practices raise the following question for mathematics education, especially within Indigenous communities: whose knowledge should be taught and from whose perspective? One response to this question is to teach both dominant and non-dominant perspectives on mathematics, which can be considered an &quot;etic-emic&quot; approach to mathematics education. Drawing on the literature on decolonizing studies in education, I offer a theorization of this etic-emic approach in terms of re-mythologizing mathematics, pursuing recognition and reconciliation, and refusing colonization.

Following Tillman and Barner's (2015) linguistic study, three children (age five, six, and seven) were asked to organize four everyday activities from the shortest duration to longest duration: watching a movie, brushing their teeth, sleeping at night, and eating lunch. After creating their &quot;timeline&quot;, each child was asked why they ordered the events as they did. By allowing the children the opportunity to reflect on common experiences and explain how they reasoned about durations, we can begin to recognize how children understand time as a quantity. Their responses showed that reflections on lived durational experiences were heavily influenced by physical acts, such as speed of actions or movement of the sun. These findings were consistent with past research on children's conception of physical time (Long &amp; Kamii, 2001; Piaget, 1969). [For the complete proceedings, see ED629884.]",

This set of categories is called 'Interpretive Model of the Conceptualization of Polygon Congruence' (MICP). This model emerged from the interpretive analysis of empirical data recollected during the investigation. The MICP categories can be used by teachers or researchers to cover different didactic objectives (e.g., interpret the resolution of tasks with congruence content; prepare student profiles or identify their difficulties. See Peña, 2019) and it is relevant because it does not seem to exist in the literature a similar model that covers the previously stated objectives. [For the complete proceedings, see ED629884.]",

Interviews of four elementary mathematics specialists then revealed that the extent to which agency was achieved depended on not only their evaluations of the constraints and affordances of their contexts, but also their past experiences and future goals.

However, not a lot is known about the mechanisms underlying this conceptual change. The purpose of this study was to investigate two potential mechanisms that underlie learning from novel statistics: numerical estimation skills and epistemic cognition. This research investigated two treatments--a numerical estimation and epistemic cognition intervention--that were expected to enhance people's ability to make sense of key numbers about climate change. Results indicated that undergraduate students (N = 516) who were given instruction on numerical estimation strategies before shown novel climate change statistics had fewer misconceptions when compared with people who did not. Findings provide emerging evidence that supporting mathematical reasoning skills can enhance conceptual change in science. [For the complete proceedings, see ED629884.]",

Then, the paper briefly historicizes some of the changing and enduring economies for affect in mathematics education across three historicized &quot;moments&quot; of U.S. mathematics education reform circa the 1830s, 1890s, and 1930s.

Our initial assumption that multivariational reasoning would be built on covariational reasoning appeared validated, and there were also several other aspects of reasoning employed in making sense of these structures. There were important similarities in reasoning about the different types of multivariation, as well as some nuances between them. [For the complete proceedings, see ED629884.]",

Employing artificial intelligence (AI) tools to give students personalized and immediate feedback holds great promise. Project Topeka offered middle school teachers pre-curated teaching materials, foundational texts and videos, essay prompts, and a platform for students to submit and revise essay drafts with AI-generated scores and feedback. We analyze AI-generated writing scores of 3,233 7th- and 8th-grade students in school year 2021-22 and find that students' growth over time generally was not explained by teachers' (n=35) experience or self-reported instructional approaches. We also find that students' growth increased significantly as their baseline score decreased (i.e., a student with the lowest possible baseline grew more than a student with a medium baseline). Lastly, based on an in-person convening of 16 Topeka teachers, we compared their scores and feedback to AI-generated scores and feedback on the same essays, finding that generally the AI tool was more generous, with differences likely driven by teachers' ability to understand the whole essay's success better than the AI tool.",

However, learning journeys are rarely continuous; opportunities, challenges, and evolving circumstances can result in both the development of skills and competencies and a change in the way in which individuals demonstrate and get recognized for their skills and competencies. Further, systemic barriers and inequities disproportionately impact learning transitions for historically and systematically excluded (HSE) communities, barring access to supports and resources to enter and persist in the education and workforce ecosystem. To help inform the the design of LER technologies to be of value and useful in supporting HSE learners and workers during learning transitions and along multiple pathways, this report highlights the following: (1) co-design methodologies and experiences that center HSE learners and workers in LER design, development, and testing; (2) recommendations and insights from HSE learners and workers on the opportunities and challenges of utilizing LERs through education and career pathways; and (3) seven learning transition design principles that support the multiple and often fluid transitions between education and the workforce that many HSE communities experience. These findings will inform the future work in developing a certification that guides developers to center HSE learners and workers as they design LER technologies to support individuals over time and through learning transitions. Based on these findings, LER developers, postsecondary education providers, and the workforce ecosystem, may develop a more inclusive skills-based learning and employment record system.",

We engaged secondary mathematics teachers in a semi-structured, clinical interview focused on a nonroutine mathematical task involving exponential growth. The results suggest experienced teachers may not explicitly attend to learning opportunities in their review of a task, and their own mathematical work contributes to their anticipation of student work and thinking.

The increased emphasis on science stems from recognition of the following: (1) young children are curious and interested in making sense of the world around them (Larimore, 2020); (2) early science experiences not only support children's later science learning but also promote and strengthen young children's learning and development in other key areas (Bustamante et al., 2018; Bustamante, White, &amp; Greenfield, 2017; Sarama et al., 2017; Conezio &amp; French, 2002; Wheatley et al., 2016); and (3) young children have the right to learn about science phenomena and develop problem-solving skills that will allow them to be problem solvers and active citizens in their communities (NASEM, 2022). Although science is increasingly recognized as a key dimension of early learning, young children, especially those in programs serving historically excluded communities, continue to have few opportunities to engage in high-quality science activities (Dominguez &amp; Stephens, 2022; Morgan et al., 2016; NASEM, 2022). Early childhood educators are interested and find science valuable for young children, but adding science into an already packed curriculum can be challenging, especially given the lack of resources that can be feasibly integrated into existing whole-child curricula. This report describes the co-design of a preschool science program, Early Science with Nico &amp; Nor®, with partner teachers and families, curricula and media developers, and researchers. It also summarizes findings from a field study to understand how teachers and families utilized the resources at school and home to promote STEM teaching and learning.",

The fixations showed that tables concentrated students' attention on the dependent variable data, whereas diagrams distributed students' attention evenly across the numeric and visual elements of the task. According to the theoretical framework, tables did not constrain a covariational interpretation of numerical data, whereas diagrams effectively constrained covariational interpretations, disrupting recursive tendencies and promoting the construction of a mental model of covariation.

Each stage corresponds to a certain level of technology and certain pedagogical theories. Some of the reasons for using computer-assisted Language Learning are experiential learning, motivation, greater interaction, and global understanding. However, teachers have some barriers in the practice of CALL. It is expected to be important improvements in CALL, in the future.

As an added component of our transition-to-proof course, we designed an intervention so that students researched the Twin Primes conjecture or the Collatz conjecture. Students wrote reflections about their research and described how their perceptions of mathematics were influenced by the research.

Overall gain scores on all three instruments were statistically significant. Moreover, gender and level (elementary vs. secondary) were statistically significant predictors of TPACK gain scores. However, the influence of level on TPACK gain score was different for female prospective teachers (PTs) than male PTs. Even in the case of low gain scores PTs displayed beliefs that were aligned with productive uses of technology in the classroom. PTs showed greater gains on knowledge subdomains associated with technological knowledge than on technology free subdomains (e.g., pedagogical content knowledge).

Churches and monasteries were established as the Kingdom and Christianity spread to Ethiopia's south and southwest. The study was planned with an ethnographic, qualitative methodology. The researcher primarily collected textual data by transcribing and translating the &quot;Amharic&quot; version audio data using high-quality tape recorders. The data were analyzed using an inductive and thematic analytical technique. The study's findings demonstrated that for many centuries, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church School System served as the primary defender of traditional culture. Particularly, Ethiopia's Orthodox Church had preserved a highly structured and organized system of education from primary to higher school from the sixth century. It was discovered that the church education offers a variety of study fields (specializations) at various levels with amazing teaching-learning techniques. The philosophy of Perennialism and Existentialism serves as the primary foundation for Ethiopian Orthodox Church education. It had established a foundation and made a substantial contribution to the growth and construction of Modern Ethiopia. It also offers incredible teaching and learning characteristics that should be incorporated into the current system of scientific and math education.",

Our objective relates to the development of a gradual generalization in arithmetic-algebraic thinking in a socio-cultural approach to the learning of mathematics. We experimented with investigative situations using a paper-and-pencil approach and technology. We analyze the emergence, in this context, of a visual abstraction, the production of institutional and non-institutional representations, a sensitivity to contradiction, and, finally, the concepts of variable and of covariation between variables.

        "author":["Proulx, Jérôme"],
        "description":"This lecture reports on aspects of a larger research programme focused on studying mental mathematics in elementary and secondary mathematics classrooms. It specifically addresses an unplanned aspect that became salient through the work conducted in these classrooms. In this research programme, mental mathematics sessions are designed on a variety of mathematical topics (e.g., algebra, geometry, measurement, statistics, trigonometry, fractions), where students are given short amounts of time to solve tasks given orally and/or on the board, without the use of paper-and-pencil or any material aids. Whereas the central objectives centers on inquiring into the nature of the strategies students engage in to solve the tasks, more seem to be happening in these sessions. In particular, students' solutions and strategies to the task given in the mental mathematics context led to numerous questions, discussions, follow-up explorations, and so forth, by students, which in turn enabled the emergence of significant mathematical issues. This raised interest in investigating these (additional and unplanned) mathematical issues. This represents the core of this lecture, which focuses on the nature of the mathematics (in terms of content and of practices) that frequently unfolds in the mental mathematics sessions conducted. Using an illustrative extract from a mental mathematics session on analytical geometry in a Grade-10 classroom (15-16 years old), the analysis outlines how not only mathematical content is being worked on through these mental mathematics sessions, but also how mathematical practices are being enacted by students. This raises issues about the nature of the environment that these mental mathematics session plunge students into, one that could be tentatively, and boldly, aligned with Papert's concept of mathland.

The Analogical Reasoning in Mathematics (ARM) framework captures the activities that students engage in when anticipating, creating, and reasoning from mathematical analogies. This considers activities along several dimensions including: inter/intra domain activity, foregrounded/backgrounded domain, and attention to similarity/difference. These dimensions are integrated with Gentner's (1983) analogical mapping framework to characterize student activity when they are presented with tasks where reasoning by analogy can productively support their mathematical investigations. By characterizing these activities, we can better develop tasks to support students in productively analogizing between mathematical domains. [For the complete proceedings, see ED629884.]",

As a result of our analysis, we characterized one coach as having a high ratio of questions to suggestions, another as having annotations coded as interpretation, another as having more evaluations and suggestions, and the fourth as having asked more questions.

The results show that the students used their mathematical knowledge and skills related to linear and quadratic functions to describe the situation; they moved from a quantitative cycle of understanding (associated with linear and quadratic behaviors), to an algebraic cycle of understanding (associated with quadratic behaviors).

Data were collected in two different mathematics courses for elementary school education majors (n = 51 total PSTs). Analyzed were (a) written journals in which PSTs defined tasks that promote student engagement in argumentation, (b) tasks PSTs posed to engage students in mathematical argumentation, and (c) accompanying explanations in which PSTs motivated tasks they posed. The analysis revealed that PSTs interpret tasks that foster argumentation in terms of activities of argumentation that a task elicits and space for argumentation that the task provides. Several features that PSTs associated with each of the two major task characteristics were identified. While posing tasks to engage students in argumentation, PSTs did not place equal emphasis on all of the identified features. [For the complete proceedings, see ED629884.]",

The methodology was developed based on the articulation of: the didactic structure of Díaz-Barriga, the teaching method ACODESA of Hitt and the curricular developments of Taba. The methodology has been tested with a group of 11 teachers in a course-workshop of 40 hours, the results obtained were three didactic sequences elaborated by three teams of teachers in a technological context (using Geogebra), where it is perceived that it is possible to design using this methodological proposal, however, teachers presented some difficulties during the process of articulation with technology.

Findings indicate that teachers' perceptions of learning may be associated with explicit goals and intentions of the PD program, their perceptions of community and the relevance of the content, pedagogy and resources provided to their everyday work in mathematics classrooms.

The analysis was carried out through the categorization of the results based on the relationships established between the components of the urns (favorable, unfavorable and possible cases).

        "description":"Student Debt and the Class of 2012 is the eighth annual report on the cumulative student loan debt of recent graduates from four-year colleges. The authors' analysis finds that the debt levels of students who graduate with loans continue to rise, with considerable variation among states as well as among colleges. Seven in 10 college seniors who graduated in 2012 had student loan debt, with an average of $29,400 for those with loans. The national share of seniors graduating with loans rose in recent years, from 68 percent in 2008 to 71 percent in 2012, while their debt at graduation increased by an average of six percent per year. Even though the financial crisis caused a substantial decline in private education lending while these borrowers were in school, about one-fifth (20%) of their debt is comprised of private loans, which are typically more costly and provide fewer consumer protections and repayment options than safer federal loans. State averages for debt at graduation ranged widely in 2012, from $18,000 to $33,650, and graduating seniors' likelihood of having debt ranged from 41 percent to 78 percent. In five states, average debt was more than $30,000. High-debt states remain concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, with low-debt states mainly in the West and South. Average debt varies even more at the college level than at the state level, from $4,450 to $49,450. This report includes policy recommendations to address rising student debt, including collecting more comprehensive college-level data. Other recommendations focus on reducing the need to borrow, improving consumer information, strengthening college accountability, and protecting private loan borrowers.

The study focused on 11 fifth-grade students within a larger study involving 97 fifth-grade students engaging with 24 mathematics task-based assessment activities. Results showed that students that typically struggle with mathematics were more likely to participate in group discourse during reflective discourse. Additionally, discourse contributions by these students were more likely to be high cognitive demand during reflective discourse. Reflective discourse provided students with time to think through and write down their own strategies which may have increased student confidence and willingness to engage in explaining and justifying their thinking.

        "description":"Although gender differences in mathematics are smaller than they have been in the past, prominent voices still attribute these differences to a variety of fixed individual factors, such as genetic characteristics of men and women. We hold the alternative view that these differences can be ultimately attributed to malleable factors. From this vantage, societies could influence gender differences in mathematics by changing students' experiences in school. In this study, we built on prior work suggesting that mathematics anxiety causes lower mathematics scores. In particular, we found that mathematics anxiety entirely explains the gender differences evident in mathematics scores from the 2012 US Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Furthermore, we found that gender moderates the mediating role of mathematics anxiety: math anxiety is more detrimental for male than for female students. Because math anxiety is a malleable individual characteristic, we conclude that gender differences reveal more about gendered societal experiences than they do about innate characteristics of men and women.

This case highlights the complexity of shared authority and the ways that authority is construed by discourse practices and negotiations over the ownership of knowledge. We offer a nuanced interpretation of how the teacher and student shared epistemic authority through their joint activity. Further, we argue for the importance of distinguishing teachers' epistemic authority and deontic authority to further our understanding of how a teacher can share authority with students during instruction.

However, more research is needed to understand how such PD can foster sustained teacher learning about high-quality instruction and materials. In this paper, we share the evolution of our analytic method that aims to reveal how secondary mathematics teachers learn while collectively analyzing video of mathematics teaching. We found that conceptualizing this PD within a community of practice, along with applying analytic tools from frame analysis and professional noticing, helped us recognize and describe the process of teacher learning in this setting.

The online courses, which involved primarily synchronous activity, emphasized high-leverage discourse practices. We applied a community of inquiry framework, which emphasizes deep intellectual work, and its three tenets: cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence. We adapted the framework by creating a category on content-related interactions and by using mediating processes from our conjecture maps (e.g., Sandoval, 2014) to characterize cognitive presence. The adapted framework allowed us to notice substantive differences between the course iterations, especially in relation to teaching presence and cognitive presence. The implications of the study are that the framework helps us gauge the efficacy of synchronous online interactions and to better gauge goals for future iterations of the course.

A primary challenge confronting content-focused coaches when working one-on-one with teachers is finding a productive balance between giving suggestions and inquiring into teachers' practices through reflective questioning. This paper articulates a process for identifying suggestions made by a coach during a planning conversation and an analytic process for examining how a teacher takes up the suggestion during lesson implementation.

However, what counts as acceptable classroom-based mathematical argumentation remains an open question. In this study, building on Habermas' theory of communicative action, we developed two analytic frameworks to examine questioning strategies used to support the validity of collective mathematical argumentation. Habermas' three components of rationality allowed us to focus on fine-grained rationality components of teacher questioning as well as teachers' intentions of asking these questions. The theory of validity claims was used to capture different forms of validating argumentation. The frameworks may help teachers to be aware of the types of questions that they are asking when aiming at supporting valid argumentation. [For the complete proceedings, see ED629884.]",

Results indicated that the first half of the PD supported their interpreting and deciding-how-to-respond skills, and the second half of the PD supported their attending skills, which were already strong even before the PD.

We surveyed 26 PSTs using a set of 9 fraction-comparison tasks. We report the frequency of complete strategy-arguments and the perspectives (ways of reasoning) used for each item. We further examine incomplete strategy-arguments, noting substantial evidence for productive seeds of reasoning. Using data from interviews with 10 of these PSTs, we identify evidence suggesting these seeds are, in fact, productive in that they provide foundations for further development.

        "description":"Research in mathematics education has overlooked creativity in mathematics, partially because of a lack of an accepted definition of mathematical creativity. The present study investigates elementary pre-service teachers' (PSTs') conceptions of creativity in teaching and learning mathematics. Data were collected using observations and semi-structured interviews with nine PSTs and analyzed using thematic analysis. PSTs' conceptions of mathematical creativity included using multiple approaches to solve problems, designing mathematical tasks from scratch, making learning challenging but not impossible, and exercising independence in learning. Implications of these results are applicable to teacher preparation programs, and they suggest a need for more research on the nature of experience(s) that shapes PSTs' conceptions of mathematical creativity and how to develop it.

The proposal is supported within both the Onto-semiotic Approach (EOS) and the Mathematics Teacher's Didactic-Mathematical Knowledge and Competence model. The proposal follows a design research methodology based on EOS. The results show the complexity related to the development of the competence of identifying primary mathematical objects, they also highlight the influence that competence has on the development of the epistemic and cognitive facets of prospective teachers' didactic-mathematical knowledge on linear variation.

Using discourse analysis and a comparative case study design, we examine how two teacher teams' conversations recruit external conceptual resources to support the development of their collective pedagogical judgment. In particular, these external resources offered the teams rich representations of practice and productive framings of teaching problems. [For the complete proceedings, see ED629884.]",

However, performance on related tasks has not been thoroughly studied. We investigate a leading model called Macaw on the task of multiple choice question generation and evaluate its performance on three angles that systematically reduce the complexity of the task. Our results indicate that despite the promise of generalization, Macaw performs poorly on untrained angles. Even on a trained angle, Macaw fails to generate four distinct multiple-choice options on 17% of inputs. We propose augmenting multiple-choice options by paraphrasing angle input and show this increases overall success to 97.5%. A human evaluation comparing the augmented multiple-choice questions with textbook questions on the same topic reveals that Macaw questions broadly score highly but below human questions.

        "author":["Nagourney, Jessica Corinne"],
        "description":"Prior research indicates a connection between culturally responsive teaching practices and student engagement in the classroom. Color-evasive pedagogy, which can negatively impact students' understandings of content and course success, is also common in secondary social studies classrooms across the U.S. Factors contributing to color-evasive social studies pedagogy and the impact on student engagement were examined using Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory. A mixed-methods needs assessment (N = 11) explored how high school social studies teachers understand culturally responsive pedagogy and what strategies they use to create safe classroom spaces, a strategy identified as culturally responsive and capable of increasing student engagement. Findings indicated that, although social studies teachers in this context understood the importance of incorporating culturally responsive teaching practices, there was a need for comprehensive professional development to identify specific strategies to incorporate culturally responsive practices specifically. A 5-week professional learning program utilizing peer coaching sessions and instructional round observations was designed to increase self- efficacy for culturally responsive teaching practices. The program was evaluated through the collection of qualitative data, including pre- and post-interviews, audio-recordings of peer coaching sessions, and a self-report survey. Findings indicate that the professional learning program had a high-level of participant engagement and was associated with increased self- efficacy for culturally responsive teaching practices in social studies classrooms. The purely qualitative data allowed for a thorough analysis and understanding of participants' experiences. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed, acknowledging a need to connect teachers' self-efficacy for culturally responsive teaching practices with increased student engagement and learning.",

Virtual charter students have substantially worse high school graduation rates, college enrollment rates, bachelor's degree attainment, employment rates, and earnings than students in traditional public schools.

        "description":"Addressing the unmet physical and mental health needs of school-aged children in the U.S. has moved to the forefront of the emerging policy conversation about effective, school-based strategies to support students. Although some new and unique challenges regarding the physical and mental health of school-aged children can be directly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers and educators have long grappled with finding, funding, and implementing effective strategies to support the physical and mental health of school-aged children as means to promote their learning, growth, and development. Providing care for students' mental and physical health in a school-based setting offers the potential to meet students where they are and provide them with access to services that support their learning, growth, and development. These services can include primary care, mental health care, and urgent care, all of which can help students and their families manage and address both chronic health conditions and acute health needs. This brief describes the state of school-aged children's health and healthcare access in the U.S. and then summarizes research on the link between children's health and educational performance and on the effects of school-based healthcare. The brief concludes by presenting examples and models of school-based healthcare along with summaries of the existing evidence on their effectiveness and by discussing funding considerations.",

        "author":["Pope, Joshua"],
        "description":"Tracking in education is a process that started in the early 1900s. What started as a tool to help migrant students, evolved into a discrete form of segregation. Tracking normally negatively affects marginalized students. It often separates students by socioeconomic status and race. Black and Hispanic students normally make up a small percentage of students placed in higher-tracked math classes. When students are placed in a lower-track math class, they often continue that track until they graduate, which gives them little to no room for advancement once they are on that particular track. Tracking is developed by grades, test scores, and possibly a biased teacher's idea of perceived student potential. To remedy the problems that tracking creates, de-tracking in classes, especially math class, must occur. De-tracking can help enable equity in math classrooms. It will also help close the opportunity gap which in turn can help close the achievement gap between minority and nonminority students. There has been a lot of research on tracking but not as much on the benefits that de-tracking can have on marginalized students. My research will study the benefits of de-tracking for marginalized students. The research will also study the confidence and mental psyche of students that are placed on lower tracks versus higher tracks. Given the opportunity, all students can be successful. De-tracking can help all students grow and be victorious in all classes, especially in math class.",

Using a digital storytelling approach, this research report analyzes the mathematics identities of 14 informal adult educators. Situating the stories shared though Critical Race Theory counternarratives, this study enables participants to ground their narratives within their own spaces of power--to tell and forge their own digital mathematics story. Because informal adult educators are not family members nor school-based educators, they often are invisible variables in conceptualizing a child's mathematics learning. This research seeks to elicit their mathematics stories and understand how to enactment digital mathematics storytelling through listening to how the community positions and visions math.

Our investigation builds on this prior research with a focus on elementary mathematics curriculum use. We analyzed interview transcripts from five teachers' first three years drawing on a framework developed by Forbes and Davis (2010). Our analysis indicates that these five teachers used their mathematics curriculum in different ways from Year 1 through Year 3. They followed their mathematics curriculum with few adaptations in their first year, and then began to modify their curriculum more extensively in their second and third years.

We present the results of a teaching experiment conducted with eighth-grade students to support stable meanings for emergent graphical shape thinking. We focus on the in-the-moment meanings expressed by a pair of students as they engaged in a sequence of tasks that we conjecture could support stable meanings for constructing and interpreting graphs.

Both written data and video records of students were analyzed to elicit the facets of their models of negative integers. We found that students' thought that either daily life contexts or people's need drove the invention of negative integers. The findings also indicated students' reasoning on the evolvement of mathematics ideas by contribution of different culture, revealing the role of math history integration into the modeling process.

This qualitative study examines the use of guess and check by middle-grades students to solve linear systems of equations. Students' reasoning is examined within the number sequences framework, which is based in part on students' units coordination. Only students at the fourth and fifth stages (out of five) correctly solved systems of equations algebraically; this is attributed to their operations on two- and three-level unit structures, and to a disembedding operation. Students at the third stage applied strategic guess and check methods, which is attributed to assimilating with composite units (i.e., units of units), but these students could not correctly use an algebraic method. For students at the second stage, guess and check was non-strategic, which is attributed to their construction of composite units in activity. Implications for instruction are discussed.

Findings suggest that the series describes slope from multiple components, and this development is grounded in various levels of covariational reasoning. While many connections were found between components, occurrences of both visual and nonvisual approaches within components were not prevalent.

This learning occurred in a teaching experiment intended to foster abstraction of these logical relationships by comparing the predicate and inference structures among various proofs (in number theory and geometry). We document the progression of Theo's emergent set-based model from a model-of the truth of statements to a model-for logical relationships. This constitutes some of the first evidence for how such logical concepts can be abstracted in this way and provides evidence for the viability of the learning progression that guided the instructional design.

Students first chose which of three worked examples correctly represented an integer subtraction problem and used the example to solve a similar problem. Later, we presented only the correct worked example and had them solve another similar problem. Our results highlight how their initial ideas around which worked example was correct supported or constrained their later interpretation and use of the correct worked example. Students were attuned to the number of jumps shown in the examples; however, they sometimes misinterpreted the jumps' direction. Students' visual answers were correct more than their written answers, suggesting further attention to visuals could support students' reasoning. [For the complete proceedings, see ED630060.]",

Results from an end-of-course proof test are also presented to attest to the effectiveness of the teacher's approach. By engaging with descriptions of the theorem-proving routine, one can learn about different strategies that may support students to learn to prove theorems, such as asking students to put forth claims in the form of conjectures or other statements that they believe are true and seeking justifications for these claims as well as sanctioning a theorem once proven.

In this report, we share our literature-based efforts to identify the tools and objects used by pure mathematicians in their work. We share the overarching framework we developed, Authentic Mathematical Proof Activities (AMPA), and illustrate the ways we have used this framework to analyze teacher-student activity using an activity theory lens.

Using a constant comparative method, we use classroom video data of two episodes containing joint exploration and closely analyze the shifts in epistemic positioning within them. We find that shifts in epistemic positioning, especially when students position one another with epistemic authority, help to support continued joint exploration. We also find that the teacher can play an important role in decentering themselves as the epistemic authority. [For the complete proceedings, see ED630060.]",

Analysis included coding for correct solving of the problem as well as making sense of and determining reasonableness of the associated student work. Results indicate that making sense of student work was not dependent on correctly solving the problem. Determining reasonableness of student work was more challenging for our 32 participants. The think aloud interview, we argue, mimics responding to student thinking in a live setting. Implications for teacher knowledge as well as professional development and teaching will be discussed.

        "description":"Over the last two decades, researchers have portrayed quality professional development for mathematics teachers as collaborative and situated in teachers' instructional realities. However, empirical findings also point out various impediments to transforming teacher conversations into consequential learning. These findings illuminate the need to acknowledge additional resources that teachers bring to professional interactions and the need for ever more nuanced theories of teacher learning to inform teacher educators' work. Inspired by ecological models of learning, in this conceptual paper I work towards understanding teachers' collaborative sensemaking as part of broader teacher learning ecologies. I distinguish and name possible scopes and contexts for the study of teacher learning in conversations about instruction, and then identify directions for future research towards stronger connections between immediate and broader contexts.

We explored these questions by comparing performance on an MKT-P questionnaire of in-service secondary mathematics teachers, undergraduate STEM majors, and pre-service secondary mathematics teachers. The latter group completed the questionnaire twice- before and after participating in a capstone course, Mathematical Reasoning and Proving for Secondary Teachers.

        "description":"The work of mathematics education often seeks to increase student success, but rarely explicitly defines this concept. When it is, it commonly corresponds with quantitative measures that enable the positioning of students as economic resources within a school or university's institutional structure, providing an incomplete portrait of student success and reinforcing deficit perspectives on student achievement. Fostering critical analysis of how we conceptualize student success within mathematics requires aligning how we define such success with the perspectives of mathematics students. I advocate for centering student voice in the (re)defining of student success, and issue a call to the mathematics education community to (1) make definitions of student success explicit in mathematics education research and policy, and (2) acknowledge and value the expansive nature of students' definitions of their own mathematical success.

        "description":"Bridging the gap between mathematical learning at home and school has been an issue for education research for decades (Galindo &amp; Sheldon, 2012). Expectations for mathematics do not often align for teachers and parents (Posey-Maddox &amp; Hayley-Lock, 2016) and a limited view of what counts as mathematics persists. What needs more attention is the meaningful mathematical learning that happens at home but is rarely seen as mathematics. Parents frequently struggle in supporting their children's mathematical learning, but that struggle becomes productive when parents are recognized as mathematically capable. This paper shows how two mothers shift their perspectives of what counts as mathematics and recognize the rich content in their current interactions with young children. Making such connections between mathematics and parent action can strengthen the relationship between at-home and school learning. [For the complete proceedings, see ED630060.]",

EMSTs were sought out by more individuals compared to other teachers, and when sought out by others, provided advice and information at a greater frequency than formal leaders. We also considered the school's informal and formal structure, finding that EMSTs' positioning was related to the broader school's information seeking behavior and whether there is a math-specific formal leader.

        "description":"This study investigated the relationship between job satisfaction, emotional intelligence, and organizational commitment to job performance among teachers in the Aparri East District. Involving 145 teachers across five secondary schools, the study used a descriptive correlational research method. Results showed high levels of emotional intelligence among teachers, despite room for improvement in stress management. Teachers reported high job satisfaction but were dissatisfied with the promotion speed. The workload and paperwork were stressful, and concerns were raised about policy fairness, despite satisfaction with salaries and benefits. Several factors influenced teachers' emotional intelligence, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment, including educational attainment, nature of appointment, plantilla position, monthly income, type of school, and school assignment. A complex relationship was found between emotional intelligence, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and job performance. Emotional intelligence negatively correlated with job satisfaction but positively with job performance. Job satisfaction and organizational commitment negatively correlated, without significant correlation to job performance. The study proposes recommendations to improve job satisfaction and performance, including promoting gender diversity,supporting early-career teachers, fostering an inclusive curriculum, encouraging continuous professional development, reducing workload and administrative burdens, enhancing supervisor fairness, improving promotion prospects and recognition, optimizing working conditions, fostering positive co-worker relationships, and further research. Implementation of these recommendations can enhance job satisfaction, improve performance, and lead to better student outcomes.",

        "description":"Writing in English with confidence is a matter of great concern for non-native speakers. Since writing fluently requires a multidimensional mastery of language skills, students always regard it as an open question. This paper investigates writing skills which seem to be the least favored and most problematic skills to acquire in a foreign language acquisition. The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of Differentiated Instruction (DI) on the English writing fluency for the students in the first year of secondary education in Al-Azhar Institutes. To answer the study questions, the researcher adopted the quasi-experimental approach using the one-group design. The study subjects were thirty two (32) students who have been randomly chosen from the Secondary education of Al-Azhar Institutes in Sohag governorate, Egypt. The sampling method is probability sampling which means that every individual of the population has a chance of being selected. The researcher used a program based on Differentiated Instruction's theory in teaching the study group in the second term of the year (2018-2019). The program consisted of 12 units. Each unit has four lessons. To measure the effect of the program, the researcher designed and validated a writing fluency test to be used as a pre and post test. The data of the study were analyzed, using SPSS 19 software, to confirm the test reliability. The researcher used a t-test to spot the statistical differences in students' performance before and after the intervention of the program. The study indicated that there are statistically significant differences at the level of ( 0.05) in English writing fluency skills of the first-year students in favor of the posttest. This meant that the use of the program had a significant impact on developing the students' writing fluency in Al-Azhar Institutes. Based on those findings, the study recommended implementing the suggested program to bring about better outcomes in students' writing fluency. It also was suggested that further research should be conducted concerning other language domains such as reading and listening.",

Quantitative research design was used to find out the factors, forms, functions, and frequency of the students' code switching, and to correlate the code switching and the students' English achievement. A survey questionnaire was used to gather the needed data and Pearson correlation was used to determine the relationship between the students' code switching and their English achievement. The results of the study showed that the dominant factors or reasons which influence the students' English-Cebuano code switching were loss of words, exposure in English and Cebuano languages, comfort, and lack of awareness on equivalent English terms or phrases. The study found out that the most common form of the students' code switching was extra-sentential or tag switching. Furthermore, the findings showed that the prevalent functions or usage of students' code switching were quotation, addressee specification, interjection, message qualification, personalization, clarification, and facility of expression. Generally, the students rarely code switched and they have very satisfactory English achievement. It was found out that the students' code switching has no significant relationship with their English achievement.",

The examination delves into the theory of genre and its role in constructing meaning within cultural and social contexts, exploring its impact on language acquisition. The paper underscores the pivotal role of learner-centered teaching and the potential efficacy of genre-based pedagogy in enhancing the Chinese language learning experience for adult learners, particularly those with limited linguistic and cultural backgrounds in a foreign language. Through this exploration, a contribution is made to the understanding of effective teaching strategies tailored to this distinct group of language learners.

There is critical importance in collaborating with educators to establish topics of engagement, positioning, and partnership including the importance of stakeholder buy-in, which can be enhanced or promoted by the inclusion of stakeholders' voices in center planning and decision-making. Many teaching and learning centers historically focused on &quot;faculty&quot; as primary stakeholders, but welcoming, seeking out, and embracing a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and ideas in voices represented by adopting a widely inclusive definition of &quot;educator&quot; is vital to a successful teaching center establishment.

This study used semi-structured interviews to investigate how international doctoral students at Auburn University perceive their advising relationships with academic advisors. The finding of this study indicates that lack of guidance and support are the main concerns in the advising relationship for international doctoral students. Moreover, the communication delivery way is not the key point for them to connect with their advisors and influence communication satisfaction with their advisors.

The data of the study were analyzed, using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS 19), to confirm the test validity and reliability. On the other hand, t-test was used to measure the statistical differences in mean scores between the pre and posttest administrations of the test mean scores due to the use of the program. The study indicated that there are statistically significant differences at the level of (0.05) on English writing fluency skills of the first year secondary students in favor of the administration of the posttest. It means that the use of the program had a significant impact on the students. Based on those findings, the study recommended implementing the suggested program for developing writing to bring about better outcomes in students' writing fluency.

This brief summarizes the research on dual enrollment programs--programs which allow high school students to enroll in college coursework through a partnering college or university--and offers policymakers a strategy to increase college enrollment and attainment via such efforts. Dual enrollment represents a promising lever for increasing educational equity, given its large scale and demonstrated effectiveness for increasing college access and success among its participants. Black, Latinx, and other minoritized students benefit from dual enrollment participation, yet these and other groups underrepresented in higher education often do not have meaningful access to such programs. Strong dual enrollment programs have the potential to raise college enrollment rates among high school graduates and improve college-attainment rates for students who participate.

Chronic absenteeism also correlates with higher rates of grade retention and dropping out (UEPC, 2012).

As a result, many states now use a measure of chronic absenteeism as a component in the accountability system they use to evaluate their public schools each year.

Individual objectives, relating to racial balance, community involvement, staff development, and academic achievement, are outlined and ways of evaluating each objective are reviewed. Finally, serious barriers to voluntary desegregation are discussed, particularly the tendency toward &quot;one way&quot; desegregation; that is, minority students attend  predominantly white schools, but few white students voluntarily attend schools in minority neighborhoods.

Using the study of race differences in educational attainment as an example, the paper reviews a number of relevant published studies and demonstrates that evidence for such differences is inconsistent across studies, that differences in the regression coefficients are subject to artifactual sources of fluctuation, and that statistical inferences based on such differences are weak. The paper concludes that the study of statistical interactions requires the design of creative studies and data collection strategies that anticipate and compensate for such problems as inadequate data, differential measurement properties, and  differences in the sampling frame.

CIS's solution to this problem was reviewed in the light of the following assertions: (1) CIS will provide a superior structure and process for service delivery to disadvantaged youth; (2) the higher quality of service leads to significant, positive impact on youth; and (3) these positive benefits can be achieved without excessive increase to costs of the present delivery  systems. Also discussed are problem reduction strategies versus solution building strategies in the evaluation of CIS, and CIS elements as part of the solution.

        "description":"A legalization program for illegal aliens living in the United States is examined in this statement by Doris Meissner, Acting Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Meissner states that the Administration's current proposed legislation is designed to regain control of the immigration process through the development of more effective enforcement measures. This legislation is said to be based on the rationale that: (1) qualified aliens would be able to contribute more to society if they were granted the right to open participation; (2) the enactment of employers sanctions legislation would curtail further uncontrolled hiring of illegal aliens; and (3) legalization would enable the INS to target its enforcement resources on new flows of illegal aliens and  avoid devoting limited investigative resources equity claims by aliens. Meissner explains that the current bill would provide &quot;temporary residence status&quot; to illegal aliens who entered the United States prior to January 1, 1980 and have had a continuous residence since that time. Meissner says that the Administration supports a one time legalization program but does not believe that the process of legalization should begin until new enforcement measures, such as employers sanctions have been instituted.

Reynold states that compulsory busing of students is not an acceptable remedy to achieve racial balance. He emphasizes the responsibility of state and local school boards to formulate educational policies in accordance with Titles IV, VI and IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as well as the Equal Education Opportunity Act of 1974. Reynolds argues for alternative solutions to achieve school desegregation. In developing specific remedial techniques, Reynolds cites the Department of Justice's intent to thoroughly investigate the background of every racially  identifiable school in a district to determine whether the racial segregation is de jure or de facto. Reynolds also states that the Department further recognizes several desegregation approaches that seem most promising: voluntary student transfer programs, magnet schools, enhanced curriculum requirements, faculty incentives, inservice training programs for teachers and administrators, school closings in systems that are overcrowded, and adjustments to attendance zones.

        "description":"A case study of the magnet school program in an anonymous midwestern United States city provides insights on the types of organizational and political changes that result from this form of school desegregation. Organizationally, the normal life of school systems depends upon a delicate balance of two sets of contradictory elements: individual school and teacher autonomy, on the one hand, and the larger administrative structure of the entire system, on the other. The use of magnet schools to achieve desegregation changes the balance of authority by: (1) formalizing the existence of variation in school practice; (2) tightening the linkage between the school system and individual schools; and (3) giving increased power in the organization to parents as clients. In addition to these  organizational changes, by contradicting the principle of equivalent education and facilities among different schools, the magnet system exacerbates political conflict, particularly with regard to competition for resources between minority and privileged goups. Elitism becomes a significant problem when white or wealthier students are disproportionately drawn to magnet schools. Given the changes described above, it is understandable that the magnet system has provoked resistance from teacher unions, office and instructional staff, parents and, at different times, the black and white communities.

The results indicated significant nonlinear relationships between the black percentage of white hostility, but did not show black percentage as significant predictor of white attitudes toward contact with blacks. It was found also that maximum hostility occurs in schools between 40 percent to 60 percent black. In conclusion, it was suggested that the  hostility of white students toward blacks might best be minimized by placing white students in predominantly white schools or in predominantly black schools.

Using National Longitudinal Survey data, the survey examines academic course areas and extracurricular memberships to determine the degree of white-minority interaction. Findings show that black and white students are almost equally likely to be enrolled in most courses in desegregated schools, but resegregation occurs through tracking or ability grouping procedures which significantly reduce the  opportunities for cross-racial contact. For extracurricular activities in desegregated schools, it was determined that blacks participate more in athletics, music, and drama, but whites participate more in academic honorary clubs. Fairly equal participation was found in student government and academic subject clubs. (Author/JCD)",

The data include regional and educational level comparisons of classroom segregation; average participation rates in extracurricular activities by race, sex, and region in segregated and desegregated schools; participation in activities by students in the same desegregated high schools by race, sex, and region; percent participation in academic programs and courses by students in the same desegregated high schools by race,  sex and region; and a comparison of estimated probabilities of cross-race student contact in desegregated high schools under different course assignment practices by sex and region. The results of the survey showed greater participation in extracurricular activities among black male students in desegregated schools, but found less participation among whites in the same setting. The results also showed that black students are less likely than whites to be enrolled in academic programs in segregated and desegregated schools; however, blacks and whites are equally likely to be enrolled in most courses in desegregated schools.

The following results  are cited: (1) privately funded community organizations have more network ties than public funded organizations; (2) advocacy group organizations have the most network ties, followed by service and public information organizations; (3) single issue and older organizations have more network ties than multi-issue or younger organizations; and (4) community organizations which identify the school as its target have more network ties than groups which target either the black community or the public at large.

Lack of difference on the &quot;Genocide Fears&quot; scale may indicate the pervasiveness of black alienation from the larger society. (Author/APM)",

        "description":"This collection of papers on the youth employment problem consists of 15 papers that cover the dimensions, causes, and consequences of youth unemployment and that also focus on problems in measuring the extent of the problem, the dynamic aspects of youth labor force participation, and problems associated with adequately assessing the consequences of youth labor market experiences. Included among those topics discussed are teenage unemployment, the youth labor market problem in the United States, and the relationship of labor market turnover to youth unemployment. The reasons for differences among rates of youth labor force activity across surveys are analyzed. Also examined are time series in youth joblessness, economic determinants of geographics and individual variation in the  labor market position of youth, and the dynamics of youth unemployment. The effects of family, dead-end jobs, minimum wage and job turnover, and high school preparation and early labor force experience on youth employment are described. Compared next is the extent of youth unemployment in Britain and the United States. The effects of teenage unemployment on the individual and the employment and wage consequences of teenage women's nonemployment are also investigated. (MN)",

        "description":"A descriptive study was conducted to identify and define different types of short-term vocational education training programs in community colleges and to report on the benefits of the selected short-term programs as compared to the long-term offerings at the respective community colleges. Because this is an unresearched area, this phase I study is not a hypothesis testing study, but a descriptive one intended to generate hypotheses. In addition to a literature review, programs offered in trade and industrial subjects in the Eugene and Portland, Oregon, areas were studied by on-site reviewing of selected training projects at five community colleges and by interviewing a number of providers and users of short-term and long-term vocational education programs. Types of short-term  programs found included entry-level courses, occupational preparatory programs, and upgrading programs. Long-term programs included one- and two-year certificate programs, and two-year diploma or associate degree programs. The study concluded the following: first, that both short-term and long-term training programs are meeting crucial needs of trade and industry in different areas; second, that short-term training programs are underdeveloped and underutilized; third, there is a strong need for refining existing guidelines and developing new guidelines which would identify effective models of short-term training programs; finally, there is no clear, concrete model which incorporates both aspects of short-term and long-term training programs. It was recommended that a phase II study be  conducted to develop short-term training program guidelines, identify the short-term training needs of trade and industry, develop a practical model of short-term training, and explore incorporating aspects of short-term programs into more traditional long-term programs.

JOBS curricula were developed for four content strands (aggregations of 12 Class &quot;A&quot; schools based on common content and prerequisite skill and knowledge requirements). Volunteer recruits (N=2212) were randomly assigned to two groups: JOBS direct-track, who entered JOBS training immediately following recruit training, and JOBS delayed-track, who first completed apprenticeship and time in the fleet. Data collected from the two groups were compared with that from a fleet control group with two &quot;A&quot; school-qualified groups who attended&quot;A&quot; school with the JOBS groups. The JOBS groups included twice as many minorities. There were no significant differences in test performance between JOBS direct- and delayed-track students. Overall attrition for JOBS groups from &quot;A&quot; schools was twice that for comparison groups. In general, JOBS students took longer to complete training and scored lower on end-of-course comprehensive tests. The JOBS program appeared to have potential for attenuating Navy technical manpower shortages and contributing to minority upward mobility. (YLB)",

While most of those interviewed expressed a need to enhance their self-concept, their attitude towards life was surprisingly optimistic. Many interviewees evidenced a dependency on and difficulty in relating to others and difficulty in solving problems. Although most study  participants were uncertain about their ability to compete successfully for jobs, they felt that ABE considerably sharpened their consumer skills and helped them reach their personal goals. In general, they wanted more educational programs, increased support services, and more teachers who could assess learner needs and interests and make learning easier yet more challenging. (MN)",

          "And Others"],
        "description":"While there is significant variation in women's economic participation rates across cultures and situations in Third World countries, the common features in work patterns of poor women are striking. Segmented labor markets predominate throughout the developing world and restrict the demand for female labor to subsistence activities or to jobs in sectors of the market economy with low pay and status, limited tenure, and few chances for upward mobility. Low income women are most often engaged in household and market work, which is time consuming, inefficient, and intermittent; and their activities use few modern tools and skills and entail little or no capital investment. Poor working women, more than men, lack the benefits of productive resources, which increase productivity and  economic returns to labor. This occurs because of women's place in the structure of technology and credit use--women are not in a position to have access to these productive resources in their modern forms. Women do not demand modern technology and credit because of several factors: lack of information concerning the availability of credit or technology; limited opportunity for profitable investments; cultural constraints that restrict women in interacting with male bank officials or extension agents; and lastly, women's lack of control over other economic resources, such as land or other property, which realistically prevents them from demanding their resources. Policy changes need to be made to improve women's access to technology and credit in the Third World--both through general  development of resources and through specific strategies to help women. (Such strategies are suggested in this report.) (KC)",

Each of these functions contained  four management activities for a total of 20 items rated using a nine-point Likert-type rating scale. Agricultural teacher education program leaders and staff agreed that all five management functions and the 20 management activities were important and were being implemented in their respective programs.

A survey instrument was developed from a review of the literature and input from a panel of advisors, and administered to 15 supervisors and 27 paraprofessionals at agencies that received state funds to teach independent living skills to developmentally disabled persons. Forty-six of the survey's 51 listed job skills were identified by the supervisors and/or paraprofessionals. Supervisors targeted 21 job skills as inservice training needs. Those most strongly identified related primarily to general skills: understanding the handicapping condition, observing and evaluating behavior, developing ways to teach, and  knowledge of medical concerns. Highest areas related to training for independent living skills were protection of rights, appropriate sexual expression, and use of first aid. Recommendations made as a result of the study included the following: (1) those job skills and training needs that were identified should provide a basis for preservice education; (2) training programs should include an independent living training component; (3) a long-term, self-sustaining training system should be developed; (4) preservice training programs should be based on common competencies needed by special education teacher aides and houseparents; (5) state licensure specifications should provide incentives for training paraprofessionals; and (6) training should be field-based and problem-centered.

The first section of this volume consists of a compilation of reports on vocational education/CETA coordination. Covered in these reports are a historical perspective of coordination, the educator's side of coordination, coordinative mechanisms, and improvement of existing coordination efforts. Case studies of 111 programs involving cooperative efforts between vocational education and CETA, Title IV, and other  employment and training programs are appended to the compilation. Discussed in the remaining sections of the volume are the status of coordination efforts between CETA and vocational education, CETA linkages with postsecondary vocational education, postsecondary responses to unemployed youth, and prime sponsor utilization of colleges and universities in implementing CETA youth programs.

The education and work council concept, the Work-Education Consortium Project, and an independent study of work education councils are described. Analyzed next is the process of council formation, including the planning of goals and activities. Various council operations evolving from or included in the process of council formation are investigated. Discussed next are some of the external forces affecting council development. Following an analysis of the collaborative  process, different dimensions along which to measure success in achieving community collaboration are identified. Summarized next are a series of recommendations pertaining to integrating council activities and planning changes, the need for council members to act as institutional representatives, the role of community leadership, and the need for councils to periodically reassess their operations.

This book addresses both legal and operational questions relating to the use of criminal justice data for private employment and decision-making purposes. The informative, non-prescriptive report is in three parts. Part 1 describes current actual practice among private employers in obtaining and using criminal history records. In addition to describing employer conduct, this part of the report describes the current thinking concerning the extent to which a criminal history background is predictive of an individual's work performance. Part 2 provides an overview of statutory and case law that bears on employer access to and  use of criminal history records. This part of the report looks at (1) the legal principles, including privacy law principles governing the disclosure of criminal history records to employers; (2) state statutory law provisions; (3) employer liability for collection and use of such data; (4) employer liability for collection or use of criminal history data; and (5) employers' common law duty to hire safe employees. The report turns in Part 3 to an analysis of policy considerations. Presented are the policy considerations that support employer access as well as those that support restricting such access. The analysis turns on two key variables: (1) the nature of the criminal history record; and (2) the nature of the job in question. (KC)",

(ACTS incorporates an adaptive computer program that learns the student's diagnostic and decision value structure, compares it to that of an expert, and adapts the instructional sequence so as to eliminate discrepancies.) Chapter 1 overviews first-year objectives and accomplishments. Chapter 2 describes this interactive system and the four functional units of training that it models and simulates: the task being trained and student, instructor, and instructional logic. Other topics include the hardware configuration, the instructional approach, and the software. Chapter 3 focuses on the pilot study  to yield data on the subjects and training potential of ACTS and to test ACTS so that modifications could be made for the full-scale study in year 2. Appendixes, amounting to approximately one-half of the report, include a student handout with an introduction to the task and to concepts relevant to power supplies in general and to the 1P-28 in particular and with a troubleshooting guide and sample instructional sequences for a preliminary lecture and a troubleshooting lecture and presentation.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine labor market factors influencing one's psychological well being and economic security after retirement. Research was found that supported the hypotheses that a worker's employment, earnings, and industry in the labor force greatly affect a retiree's financial position; the reason for labor force withdrawal influences economic position and outlook toward life; a positive relationship exists between income and life satisfaction; and health problems and job satisfaction influence life satisfaction after retirement. Data were drawn from the older men's cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Work Experience. A logarithmic function of the income received from pension and Social Security was used to measure income. Life satisfaction was  measured by response to a question regarding how happy the respondent was with his life. It was found that workers with successful labor market experiences were likely to have a better financial situation in retirement that was transmitted into greater life satisfaction. Whites appeared psychologically affected by job loss, while blacks' ties to the labor market were purely financial. Life satisfaction was not related to the comparison of retirement to preretirement income but was related to the absolute level of income after retirement. (Three tables are appended.) (YLB)",

Also developed was a teacher's guide for use in reinforcing the message of career doors with student viewers. First, the film &quot;Reentry Women&quot; was made and  field tested at eight sites with 47 adult education students and 28 instructors. Because the comments concerning the film were extremely positive, the same basic format in storyline was applied to &quot;Reentry Men.&quot; Based on the reactions of students and staff who viewed the filmstrips, the project was deemed successful.

Background information is provided concerning the phenomenon of illiteracy with discussions of basic principles (particularly functionality) behind actions toward its eradication. A short history of adult basic education programs is presented, demonstrating the increased emphasis on adult practical literacy education. Teaching strategies are identified based on the premise that adult students have unique characteristics as learners. Then andragogical theory is reviewed in the context of changes in self-concept, the role of experience, readiness to learn, and  orientation to learning. Next, a chart that represents both pedagogical and andragogical assumptions and a list of 15 principles of teaching are presented. The final chapter provides a detailed outline, including a time frame for a four-session pre-service workshop for ABE teachers. This is followed by a brief bibliography. Appended are additional references to models of learning, a five-page competencies questionnaire, guidelines for the use of learning contracts, a sample learning contract, a two-part workshop evaluation form, and a learning need diagnostic guide.

Because the emphasis of the project was on the counseling process rather than on counseling tools, only one counseling tool was purchased for the project--the Self-Directed Search. Other tools used were simple paper and pencil exercises. Included among  these project-developed tools were a needs assessment, a goal-attainment profile, a student/counselor contact sheet, and a client/counselor agreement. Counseling sessions focused on skills identification, values clarification, communication skills, the relationship of personality characteristics to the career decision-making process, and improving job search skills. From an analysis of student evaluations, pre-post-counseling tests, and retention/separation data, project staff found that approximately 75 percent of those involved made significant progress.

        "description":"In order to meet the career investigation needs of younq adults of Hispanic origin, a project was conducted in Indiana to adapt an audiovisual vocational interest test (the Comparative Career Search) to the Spanish language and to adapt the visuals so that 50 percent of the work roles were of persons of Hispanic origin. A listing of the occupations presently included in the Comparative Career Search was developed and reviewed to determine the specific photographs which were necessary for achieving a 50 percent Hispanic imagery in the 72-item career interest test. Nominations and requests were conducted to gain photographic permission to obtain the job-specific shots. Laboratory preparation converted the pictures to correct-format slides, which, in turn, were developed into  filmstrips for the final product. The instructions, scoring directions, and answer format were translated from English to Spanish and both printed and narrated to produce the answer sheet and taped directions. Following quantity production, a task force of Spanish speaking persons reviewed the instrument by completing the test. Their suggestions for improvement were gathered and are provided in the recommendations for further development and dissemination. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A model (called Vocational Orientation for Individual Counseling Evaluation--V.O.I.C.E.) was developed to assist Adult Basic Education (ABE) students enrolled in Indiana adult and community education programs to meet their career development needs. The model is intended to assist the ABE students in a self-evaluation process for self-career awareness, occupational cluster exploration as applied to their interests, temperaments, talents, and limitations, and acquiring job survival skills. The V.O.I.C.E. model process consisted of four steps. First, the ABE students met with the instructor for an explanation of the program and to establish rapport; they took the Career Development Inventory and a presurvey of their knowledqe of self, job opportunities, and job skills. Second,  students met and used career resource materials for occupational information At a third meeting, the instructor (counselor) and ABE students met to grade a job survival skills homework assignment, practice writing resumes, practice filling out a job application, and to role play job interviewing techniques. Finally, students completed the same Career Development Inventory and pre-survey (now used as a posttest) as at the first meeting. Through the V.O.I.C.E. project the participants were involved in activities which increased their awareness of self/career and career planning capabilities, achieved job survival skills, and had increased involvement with business/industry and community groups who could assist them. Scores in the posttest were higher in most areas for most students. (Among  appended items is the &quot;Student Stage Lesson Manual.&quot;) (KC)",

The purpose of guidance evaluation is discussed. Covered in a description of problems and difficulties in doing guidance evaluation are general problems; problems relating to objectives, criteria, and goals; and sampling problems. The following aspects of the process of guidance evaluation are described: basic steps in evaluating guidance programs, classification systems of guidance evaluation, common guidance evaluation strategies to avoid, a model for classifying guidance evaluation procedures, using goal attainment scaling for guidance evaluation, and the accountability record approach. Facets of using the  results of guidance evaluation are considered, including principles of change useful to implement evaluation of guidance outcomes, knowledge gained from evaluation studies of school counseling, implications of evaluation studies for the school counselor, and benefits of evaluating guidance.

        "description":"A project designed a national curriculum model for Energy Conservation-and-Use Technicians (ECUTs) and developed and tested instructional materials for use in the courses. The two-year postsecondary ECUT curriculum was designed to provide an interdisciplinary technical base (electrical, mechanical, thermal, and fluidal principles) and technical specialty training. Sixteen courses, consisting of 124 course modules, were developed specifically for ECUT training: Fundamentals of Energy Technology; Energy Economics; Energy Production Systems; Energy Conservation; Energy Audits; Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning; Microcomputer Operations; Microcomputer Hardware; Electronic Devices and Systems; Electrical Power and Illumination Systems; Technical Communications; Mechanical  Devices; Instrumentation and Controls; Fluid Power Systems; and Chemistry for Energy Technology I and II. Each module contains an introduction, prerequisites, objectives, subject matter, exercises, laboratory materials and procedures, data tables, reference materials, and test. Four schools piloted the curriculum and provided feedback for materials improvement. The materials were used by postsecondary institutions for two-year ECUT programs, for selected courses infused into other technical specialties, for adult and community education courses, and for employer-sponsored retraining courses. (Appendixes, amounting to over one-half of the report, include a list of equipment used by ECUTs, curriculum design, information booklet, and diffusion workshop materials.) (YLB)",

Teenage entry and exit into the labor market and unemployment flows are discussed. Also examined are job search implications of the transition from school to work and the role of work attitudes and labor market knowledge in establishing stable and successful employment careers. Following a description of economic and sociocultural variables  affecting rates of employment are explored. The effects of child labor laws on youth programs are investigated. Included is a discussion of social development and group selection, methods of allocating funds to alleviate teenage unemployment, and the cost of lowering youth unemployment. (MN)",

The seven chapters of the publication, each written by a recognized leader in the field, focus on the following: (1) the growth and development, both historically and conceptually, of the deinstitutionalization movement and its impact on human service systems; (2) approaches to identifying, quantifying, and assessing the needs of various populations who might be served through deinstitutionalization programs; (3) sources and mechanisms for funding deinstitutionalization services, with an emphasis on maximizing available federal and state funding; (4)  a system-oriented analysis of roles and relationships within and between agencies that provides a basis for improving continuity of care for clients and closer working arrangements between service providers; (5) a review of principles and characteristics of community-based programs and of models that serve the residential, social, and vocational needs of formerly institutionalized clients; (6) emerging issues and trends in the areas of personnel training, development, and use, with special notice given to the changing roles of workers involved in the deinstitutionalization field; and (7) the importance of community attitudes and behaviors toward deinstitutionalized clients and programs, as well as proposed strategies for achieving more positive public acceptance. A final chapter provides  a summing up by the editor. (KC)",

Following a review of literature and interviews to determine the approaches currently used to accredit women's life experience learning, researchers surveyed 131 adult female reentry workers to obtain information pertaining to their prior learning and life experences. Based on their responses, an Experience Description Summary was developed to aid in identifying job- or program-related experiences of individual women. These competencies were analyzed with respect to their transferability to employment requirements and admissions requirements for vocational education programs. A  process was then designed to further the recognition of women's experiential learning. After an examination of the performance of those women who were placed on the basis of the competency analysis, the analysis was revised. Publications describing the process were then prepared and disseminated. (Detailed reports on individual phases of the project are available separately--see note.) (MN)",

Participants in the study were 1103 secondary students in 18 experience-based career education programs in 16 states. The questionnaire administered to the students included open-ended questions on student activities at the site and questions regarding the career being explored and personal career preference. Respondents indicated the degree to which they valued various factors that contributed to a community site being an excellent or poor learning experience. Findings showed that activities at learning sites considered excellent tended to include hands-on experiences, adults who were friendly and helpful, and  tasks that had a moderate to high level of responsibility. Discriminant analyses of student responses were also conducted to show different value patterns related to sex, ethnic background, grade point average, and job preference. There were, however, no significant differences in the proportion of site experiences viewed as excellent by different categories of students. Implications for employers focused on improving student tasks--for education practitioners, on student needs and making employers aware of them; and for researchers, on studying paid work experiences and use of the indepth interview format.

Recent legislation raising the mandatory retirement age to 70, when combined with the future elimination of mandatory retirement altogether and the removal of employment disincentives in present pension plans, would together add nearly one-half million older workers to the labor force by the year 2000. In contrast, a 10 percent reduction in Social Security  benefits would increase labor force participation only by 64,000, while at the same time placing heavy economic burden on millions of elderly retirees.

A total rate of offending in personal crimes as well as crime specific rates for robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault were examined. Analysis focused on three major issues. The first involved analysis of the general relationship between economic conditions (unemployment, Consumer Price Index, and Gross National Product) and overall rates of offending (total, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault). These economic conditions were shown not to be related to NCS rates of offending. The second issue was the relationship between age-race-sex specific rates of offending. Analysis found  virtually no relationship between quarterly fluctuation. The third major issue was the interrelationship between adult unemployment and juvenile crime. Sex and race specific adult unemployment rates were correlated with comparable sex and race offending rates for juvenile (12-17) and youthful (18-20) offenders. Only four of 32 relationships were found statistically significant.

The EEOC reorganized its operating and case-handling procedures, resulting in the processing of new charges without delay (under four months). By the end of Fiscal Year 1980 (FY-80), the case backlog had been reduced by two-thirds--to 35,000 charges; the remedy rate for new charges approached 50 percent; and benefits to individuals exceeded $43 million. Also, more than 125 new systemic cases were initiated pursuant to specific and coordinated selection standards. During FY-80, because of increased interest in ADEA, coupled  with EEOC's high visibility in enforcing the Act, the ADEA workload increased dramatically. The individual charge rate increased by about 60 percent, from 5,374 charges filed in FY-79 to 8,779 in FY-80. To resolve the growing workload problem, EEOC requested in its 1981 budget funds for state fair employment practices agencies so they could help process some of the workload. Procedural reforms began by the EEOC should also help to smooth the age discrimination complaint process. (This annual report includes a detailed description of the process of transferring ADEA from the DOL to the EEOC, a description of cases settled and pending, and a summary of state age discrimination in employment laws.)

To analyze the sex equity of CETA's resource distribution, researchers used data from the Continuous Longitudinal Manpower Survey (CLMS) for fiscal 1976, 1977, and 1978 CETA enrollees. Respondents were sampled from each quarter's CETA enrollees, interviewed in the quarter after their enrollment, and followed for 36 months. Analyzed in the study were data pertaining to program participation by CETA title, program assignment within CETA, occupational desegregation in CETA, and in-CETA wages. Based on these data, researchers drew the following conclusions: (1) women between 18-25 years of age are underrepresented in all  CETA titles for all fiscal years except Title I in fiscal 1978; (2) although women are at least as likely as men to get the activity that they desired at CETA entry, CETA integrates women less into the workplace (providing classroom rather than on-the-job training) and less into jobs intended as transitions to unsubsidized employment than it does men; (3) CETA's occupational desegregation record is still not notable; and (4) based on available data, CETA does not appear to pay inequitable wages by sex.

Within the last 15 years, computer-based systems have been developed that put occupational descriptions, labor market information, plus education, training, and financial aid information into formats usable by students and adults in school and nonschool settings. The proliferation of systems marketed competitively, the increasing depth and breadth of information available, plus the sophistication of the guidance aspects of systems have produced a consumer's dream, but also a major dilemma. Selection of a system for a statewide or substate unit that corresponds to the particular needs of the targeted constituency requires thorough knowledge of the prospective users' characteristics,  material and human resources available, hardware capacities, software content, and hardware/software compatibility. All of these factors were taken into consideration during the Career Information Delivery System Feasibility Study in Illinois, and the study provides a model for the selection process.

Findings were that a wide range of mathematics content was being taught to students in the health occupations under investigation, within a technical area respondents agreed as to which skills were considered important, mathematic skills needed by the dental laboratory technician  were different from that needed by other health technicians, and there were high levels of agreement between rankings of mathematics skills by mathematics faculty and other respondents. Some conclusions and implications from the data analyses included agreement as to importance of skills indicating communication between schools and employers, a common core of mathematics needed by dental laboratory technicians that is different from that needed by other health technicians, and implementation of the study through use of the survey for needs assessment and development of a curriculum responsive to local needs.

        "description":"A study of the regional vocational agriculture centers in Connecticut was conducted to determine the following: (1) the need for vocational agriculture (vo-ag) in the state; (2) criteria to be used as guidelines in the future development of vocational agriculture programs; and (3) alternatives for the further development of vocational agriculture in the state. Research factors were identified as relevance factors (community and vo-ag program enrollments, current and potential agricultural and related employment, and graduate placement) or access factors--(program awareness, transportation, and instructional environment). Data were gathered from vo-ag students, instructors, superintendents, and employers through document research, development and implementation of survey  instruments, interviews, and researchers' observations. Findings included the following: (1) enrollment--increasing for five years because of greater participation by female students; (2) placement and employment--more than one-third of the vo-ag graduates were furthering their education, while more than half had found employment in agriculture-related fields; employment needs greater than supply were projected for nonfarm agricultural occupations, but fewer farm jobs were forecast; (3) program awareness--public relations techniques were used, but minority recruiting was not perceptible; (4) transportation and tuition did not appear to be problems; and (5) instructional environment--facilities and pupil-teacher ratios were generally perceived as good. Through the data gathered, criteria  and strategies for maintenance, expansion, and relocation of programs and development of new programs were prepared. (KC)",

        "author":["Mannebach, Alfred J."],
        "description":"Several methods for determining priorities for research in agricultural education can be cited. These include the following: to rely on individual initiative, as has been done in the past; to get organized as a profession and reach agreement regarding research priorities at the national, regional, or state levels; to wait for federal and state direction regarding research priorities; or to obtain input from the various publics regarding what agricultural education's priorities should be. Research priorities can also be approached from the standpoint of process and product. Some process approaches that might be considered include: (1) inventorying those problems that have no current answers to find priorities (educational ignorance), (2) determining felt need--but whose need?, (3)  waiting for federal or state initiative, which may be blocked by fund shortages; and (4) expecting leadership from the profession--if it has the resources needed. A look at the \"product\" of research reveals many valid areas for research in agricultural education, such as annual personnel needs in agricultural occupations, agricultural curricula, agricultural special needs students, impact of Future Farmers of America, predictors of success in students and teachers, and many other potential research subjects. One example of an area that could spawn many research projects is the assessment of parttime employment of in-school youth. Thinking about the questions raised regarding process and product of agricultural education research should aid the profession in determining relevant actions to  take to determine research priorities.

The Delphi inquiry technique was used to examine concepts and criteria for practice and to explore assumptions and value dilemmas in sexual assault prevention and treatment. Expert judgments were made by 51 nationally-based participants in the sexual assault field. Questions about intervention with sexual assault victims revealed that assisting victims in coping with emotional and physical trauma and minimizing risk to potential victims were the respondents' highest priority goals. In terms of intervention with assailants, participants emphasized behavioral change outcomes; the use of constructive behavioral alternative in place of coercive sexuality  was given highest importance for assailants and potential assailants. In the area of primary prevention, participants ascribed high priority to changing social institutions and individual attitudes and behaviors to alleviate conditions that permitted sexual assault. Respondents expressed uncertainty as to the best way to accomplish primary prevention. Participants found legal definitions inadequate from conceptual and practical standpoints; they preferred the concept \"sexual assault\" to \"rape\" and recommended defining that concept as simply \"any forced sexual activity.\" Results suggest several implications for intervention, prevention, treatment, research, and policy.

Other questions concerned the respondent's experience of socio-sexual behaviors on current and previous jobs, definitions of sexual harassment, attitudes about male-female interaction at work, and demographic characteristics. Results from descriptions of respondents' experiences showed that, compared to those of men, the comments of women about sexual touching, expected socializing, or expected sexual activity were more likely to be called sexual harassment by an independent rater. In terms of definitions of sexual harassment, women were more likely than men to  consider certain behaviors as sexual harassment. Descriptions of initiators of sexual activities, information concerning negative consequences of sexual harassment, issues of organizational ambience, and worker attitudes suggest that a great deal of ambiguity surrounds the issue of sexuality at work.

To help centers meet these demands, researchers have begun to examine student needs and to evaluate counseling services. University freshmen (N=2180) interested in different types of counseling or no counseling were compared on attitudinal and demographic items. Students interested in personal-social counseling expected that getting to know others would be difficult. These students were more likely to live in residence halls, advocated more student participation in campus decisions, and were likely to attribute low enrollment of blacks to racism. Students interested in educational-vocational counseling  were more likely to have fathers who had college degrees; they were more undecided about majors and considered selection of a major to be a problem. Students interested in reading and study skills counseling cited earning satisfactory grades as their hardest adjustment to school. They were quite sure of their vocational goals and were more likely to attend the university for its academic program. The results suggest that this type of information is useful in establishing optimal student services. (Author/NRB)",

A questionnaire examining the study habits, exam preferences and attitudes toward various instructional formats was administered to 762 introductory psychology students enrolled in either lecture/seminar or PSI sections. Analyses comparing methods revealed different behavioral patterns for students who performed well under PSI and lecture/seminar formats. Successful PSI students were orderly, systematic hard workers who emphasized the printed word; they believed that the PSI method would produce higher grades. Successful lecture/seminar students  focused their studying to the time prior to performance events, required aid in organizing course material and were as concerned with the spoken as with the written word. Science students gravitated toward PSI while Arts/Humanities students prefered lecture/seminar courses. The findings suggest that PSI is personalized for some, but not all, students.

Similar data for the BSRI items in an American sample were compared to Indian results, revealing some cross-cultural similarities in sex roles, but fewer sex-role distinctions in the Indian sample, especially for traits related to assertiveness. Traits rated more  desirable for Indian males suggested a pattern of entrepreneurial tendencies. Traits rated more desirable for Indian females suggested a pattern of expressive tendencies. Traits highly desirable in Indian society included those related to ability, interpersonal warmth, trustworthiness, interpersonal strength, motivation, and family orientation.

To examine the association of the dominance of &quot;spouse&quot; over &quot;parents&quot; and &quot;peers&quot; orientation with perceived behavioral and affective mutuality in the couple's financial management, couples (N=30) were randomly chosen from a list of couples meeting certain criteria found to affect conjugal power distribution. Subjects completed the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), the Inventory of Family Feelings (IFF), and the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, devised behavioral and affective scales of financial management. Correlations between perceived high mutuality in the couple's financial management and dominance of &quot;spouse&quot; over &quot;parents&quot; orientation was significant on  the TAT but not on the IFF; &quot;peers&quot; orientation was significant on both scales. The results suggest that a personality attribute may be considered as one of the bases of conjugal power structure. Additionally, the level of maturity in interpersonal relations may determine if a partner would &quot;want&quot; to have more power or if he or she would rather do things jointly with his/her partner, no matter what resources exist.

Initial estimates of validity suggest that the instrument measures constructs which are: (1) amenable to change through specific skill training in  problem-solving; (2) unrelated to conceptualizing means to solving a hypothetical problem situation; (3) related to general perception of problem-solving skills; (4) unrelated to intelligence or social desirability; and (5) related to personality variables, especially locus of control.

The Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ) was the subject of an intensive study designed to elaborate the construct interpretation of the six PAQ scales. A data base including a large battery of well-known self-report personality inventories and a systematic sample of personality ratings made by multiple judges was established for a mixed-sex sample of 116 college sophomores. Separate analyses of the data by sex indicated a strong intellectuality component in high M- scale scores in females, which  refined the meaning of the PAQ scales.

Research in the area of drug abuse demonstrates that drug use is not limited to any one population segment or age group, but is pervasive across population subgroups. More and more evidence suggests that the family is clearly implicated in the initiation, maintenance, cessation, and prevention of drug abuse by its members. Systems, intergenerational, and life-cycle studies of the past have relevance to a life-span perspective and can provide a database from which more specific life-span-oriented studies may be conducted. Life-span oriented drug abuse research must identify and understand the complex variables which can  contribute to the development of drug abuse during an individual's lifetime. Through the family, the complex roles on drug abusing behaviors of societal institutions, peer groups, and developing technology can be studied. As a first step toward the integration of a life-span orientation with more traditional drug abuse research approaches, several content-related and methodological questions must be explored. (NRB)",

Since social norms prescribe sex-stereotyped behavior, an androgynous person may initially behave in a sex-typed way. Same-sex pairs (N=26) of undergraduates, matched on similar or dissimilar Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) scores, rated themselves once and their partners at two different times on the BSRI. \"Liking for other\" and \"perception of other's liking\" scales were also completed twice. Results indicated that subjects did not change in their perceptions of partners toward congruence with the partner's perception of self in terms of liking, perceived liking, and similarity on the BSRI. The finding  that subjects' perceptions of partners on the BSRI did not change over time may be attributed to the idea that the partners did not actually develop a relationship during the course of the study.

        "description":"The training of psychotherapists has been an ongoing process in psychiatry and clinical psychology. Recently, however, a growing demand to operationalize competence criteria to enable independent evaluation of therapists' skills in specifically defined psychotherapies has occurred. To examine this phenomenon, evaluation procedures were developed and tested during a pilot training program in Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT). Several different instruments and procedures were used to monitor the therapist trainees' skills on a variety of dimensions. The Didactic Examination was designed to assess therapist trainees' cognitive understanding of the theoretical background, rationale, techniques and procedures of short-term IPT; other instruments were developed to assess the therapist  trainees' practical IPT skills in therapy sessions. Results of analyses of the trainee outcome data confirmed the decision to rely on multiple information and derived composite scores. Although scores on Didactic Examinations showed significant improvement at post-testing, the written examination had little predictive validity for determining the competence of the therapist to perform IPT during practicum. Findings of a lack of agreement between supervisor and independent evaluator perceptions of the therapist underscore the importance of including videotape reviews of actual therapy sessions as part of therapist assessments.

        "description":"Social support has been studied in the context of its relationship to and effect on negative experiences. While this buffer aspect of social support is important, support may also play a satisfaction-enhancing role. Both the negative event-buffering and positive event-boosting effect of social support on students' satisfaction with their college experience were investigated. A questionnaire on life stress and social support was completed by 312 community college students. Subjects reported which of 100 events had occurred recently; whether the event was a positive, negative, or neutral experience; and who they had talked to or received assistance from about the event, i.e., family, friends, teachers. Data from Anglos, Mexican-Americans, and mature women students were analyzed.  Results provided evidence for boosting and buffering effects of social contact on satisfaction with college. Different types of people served different types of supportive functions. Teacher support appeared to enhance the effects of positive school events on satisfaction with college. Family support did not appear to enhance the effects of positive events but reduced the negative effects of negative events. The supportive effects of friends were obtained only for the Mexican-American group and only as a buffer against negative events. The findings suggest that enhancing the positive as well as reducing the negative aspects of life experiences is an important aspect of life adjustment. (Author/NRB)",

A systematic skills training program for foster mothers was evaluated to investigate the relationship between skills training and the outcome of the placement for the child. The sample consisted of inner-city, lower socio-economic minority foster mothers and their foster children. The 10-week training program was eclectic and emphasized personal development as a prerequisite for skill development. The foster children of a group of foster mothers (N=8) trained in the program were compared with those of a no-contact control group (N=6) before and after training with regard to self-esteem, asocialization, emotionality-tension, self-exploration and placement stability. Dependent measures  included self-report paper-and-pencil tests, foster parent ratings, independent judge's ratings of videotaped parent-child interactions and objective determination of placement continuation. Children of training group foster mothers improved significantly more than control children on emotionality-tension, but not on other measures. The findings suggest that future research should examine the effects of an extended training program. (Author/NRB)",

The relationship between child care workers' sense of power (both in their agencies and to help youth) and their perceptions of the youth was examined for a sample of 171 child care workers employed in 6 public and 6 private child care agencies. Subjects completed a questionnaire about their agencies, jobs, and the youth with whom they worked. Youth (N=98) completed a comparable instrument. Analyses revealed reliable relationships that substantiated a positive association of perceived organizational power and a personal sense of efficacy with favorable perceptions of the youth and external attributions for  their problems. Child care workers who felt able to impact the lives of youth reported favorable impressions; those who tried but were frustrated in their efforts or ineffective tended to derogate. Workers who reported similarities between themselves and the youth tended to feel more powerful and assumed that the youth could be helped. The findings suggest that interventions designed solely for youth may be insufficient to improve conditions in juvenile justice. (NRB)",

Instrumental (Type I) behavior reflects a problem-solving orientation; expressive (Type E) behavior reflects an affective concern for the welfare of others. To examine the hypothesis that these two dimensions theoretically resembled those studied by leadership and conflict resolution literatures, male undergraduates (N=47) completed 3 inventories: (1) the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) from which Type-I and Type-E scores were computed; (2) the Fleishman Leadership Opinion Questionnaire (FLOQ) from which &quot;structure&quot; (Type-I) and &quot;consideration&quot; (Type-E) scores were computed; and (3) the Thomas-Kilman Conflict Mode Instrument (MODE) from which &quot;assertiveness&quot;  (Type-I) and &quot;cooperation&quot; (Type-E) scores were computed. A factor analysis of scores generally supported the view that the BSRI, the FLOQ, and the MODE, representing PAT, leadership, and conflict resolution literatures respectively, provided similar measures.

To test if the primacy effect occurs in situations where specific cues about the person and nature of the test materials are lacking or greatly reduced, college students corrected a multiple-choice test in which a phantom stimulus person correctly answered 15 of 30 questions in a descending or ascending pattern of success. Subjects were then asked to make judgments concerning the person's performance, intelligence and gender. Contrary to expectations, the lack of cues enhanced, rather than diminished, the primacy effect for ability attribution found by earlier investigators. The performer with descending success was perceived as having solved more problems and being more intelligent,  and was expected to perform better in the future. An overall bias toward perceiving the stimulus person as a male also occurred. The findings reflect the importance of person cues for confidence in making ability attributions. (Author/JAC)",

Gloss notations may serve as an aid to direct students to content areas of text and to levels of understanding that make optimal use of their current--and sometimes limited--reading ability. Since one purpose for using gloss is to encourage development and application of specific comprehension skills and the &quot;general strategies&quot; that efficient readers use in understanding text, it seems appropriate to use reading materials that are designed to teach reading skills and strategies. Three possible times to introduce gloss activities include (1) the initial stages of reading instruction, (2) the  transition from learning reading skills in a reading class to applying them to content area materials, and (3) during remedial instruction. It must be noted that too much gloss may interfere with students' understanding, while too little gloss is likely to have no effect at all on their understanding. Also, the stages of gloss may be primarily reader/text dependent. Ultimately, glossing is both a way to strengthen students' reading comprehension skills and strategies, and a means to provide students with the metacognitive knowledge and insights assumed to underlie the ability to control one's own mental activities.

        "author":["McCormick, Christine B."],
        "description":"A study was conducted to demonstrate the value of a mnemonic strategy in remembering information from prose passages and to assess processing differences associated with three variations of the mnemonic strategy. The subjects were 220 eighth grade students who read four short fictional biographies and answered recall questions that were either randomly ordered or ordered to reflect the way the information was presented in the passages. The students participated as members of the following conditions: (1) two control conditions in which students used their own best methods of remembering the biographical information, (2) a keyword paired condition connecting keyword-stimulus and concrete referents at the sentence level, (3) a keyword-chained condition connecting the keyword and  the concrete referents of two sentences, and (4) a keyword-integrated condition that combined the keyword with concrete referents throughout the prose passage. Students in the keyword groups recalled significantly more passage information than did students in the control groups. The likelihood of correctly recalling pieces of information that had been contiguously presented within a passage was found to vary as a function of instructional condition and question order. The experimental groups also differed in terms of the kinds of errors made. Overall, the results suggested the efficacy of using the keyword mnemonic strategy. (RL)",

        "description":"Gloss, or marginal notations in a text, and other similar techniques can be used by reading specialists both as they attempt to develop meaningful content area reading programs and as they review what is already known before attempting to learn new information. For example, several social studies teachers began their gloss activities by instructing students to make a list of important ideas they had or facts they already knew about a particular topic. Other teachers wrote gloss activities, designed to assist students, that identified sections of text where new ideas were introduced and where rereading and reorganizing appeared to be required. Also, teachers have made use of gloss activities to direct students to go back to a section of text and reread or to note a concept that  would be important when the next section in the text was read. Writing marginal glosses and discussing the research ideas and insights that can be associated with them appears to be one way of working with teachers and their texts in a public school setting. The gloss concept is comprehensive enough to include many approaches and ideas related to effective reading and studying; teachers seem to accept it as a credible technique that requires much work and effort on the part of both the teacher and the students.

The first section of the literature review deals with research offering explanations of language production development, and includes discussions of the nativist and cognitive theories of language acquisition. The second section presents research concerned with the interaction between language development and learning to read, and covers those studies that (1) directly apply language theories to reading achievement, (2) see a difference between oral and written language and, therefore, a  difference in learning to speak and learning to read, and (3) consider oral language competency to be important in learning to read. The paper concludes that reading teachers must become aware of elements of language competence, but cautious about assuming a direct carryover of this competence to reading tasks. (FL)",

        "description":"A study was designed to investigate the auditory-visual integrative abilities of primary grade children for five long vowels and five short vowels. The Vowel Integration Test (VIT), composed of 35 nonsense words having all the long and short vowel sounds, was administered to students in 64 schools over a period of two years. Students' indications of the vowel sounds they heard were recorded along with information regarding the test form, school district size, school's percentage of students enrolled in Title I programs, type of reading program, grade level, and subject's sex. The results revealed that the long vowel sound and the short vowel sound of \"a\" and \"o\" were easily mastered by first grade children. However, the remaining short vowel sounds (e, i, and u) were difficult  for children even at the third grade level. The type of reading program was a significant factor, with supportive programs--using both basal and supplementary vowel development materials--showing consistent superiority over phonetic and nonphonetic programs. Sex type and the percentage of Title I students in a school were not significant factors. (RL)",

        "description":"Diagnostic teaching should be considered a two-step operation: the first half is skills assessment while the second half is related basic skills instruction. As part of the basic skills instruction, the students should be taught to be aware of certain features of the text itself when reading or writing: identification of topic, formats, relationships of parts to whole, and use of key words. To help them learn and store information in organized, meaningful units, students need to develop a framework for information by generating questions from text that will allow them to predict information, to create their own questions, and to develop a grid to organize information. Such a grid might have the questions down one side and categories of answers across the top. As the students read  they verify their questions and jot down notes for answers. After reading, students decide which of their questions they can use for further research. They can then do a variety of writing activities, such as writing summary paragraphs to answer the questions, as a framework for their writing. The grid can also be used to develop vocabulary, with students relating words from a list to their questions. Another use of the grid is the identification of concepts and the kinds of relationships that exist among concepts through the use of cue words, circles, and lines. Thus, the grid is a system to teach students to consciously recognize and apply structure to new information. (HOD)",

        "description":"To determine what influences a teacher in providing reading instruction requires surveying more than one body of literature. It is important to note that the findings of any study are shaped by the questions that are asked and by the methods used to answer them. Although a large amount of research demonstrates overwhelmingly that teachers can acquire a variety of instructional skills and that various program formats can facilitate their development, these studies do not indicate the best way for developing a particular behavior. Only a small amount of research has attempted to identify and compare the range of things which influence how reading is taught. To determine the range of experiences that influence reading teachers, one study analyzed descriptions using an open-ended  critical incident technique. The study concluded that almost anything that occurs in a reading classroom has the potential for influencing a teacher's attitude or behavior. Also, it may be that teachers are more influenced by events that happen by chance during daily school activities than by those that are planned as part of a formal training program. Reading education programs should provide high-impact, immediate-feedback situations since research has shown that these situations influence reading teachers the most. By following this procedure, programs stand a better chance of having an effect upon teacher attitudes and actions, which in turn positively affect a child's reading achievement. (HOD)",

The study focused on the British audience's evaluation of the clarity of the campaign issues as presented in the media and on individual cognitions about Europe formed prior to the campaign (cognitive stability). Data used in the study were gathered through interviews conducted with 372 potential voters in two separate cities. Subjects responded to questions concerning their perceived clarity of the campaign issues, their personal opinions concerning Europe, and the extent of their exposure to various media. Results indicated that people equally exposed to election information from  different media during the campaign had a more confused perception of the campaign issues and showed higher levels of cognitive instability than did individuals who were exposed to only one source of information. The findings suggest that if exposure to the campaign had been measured only in terms of reliance on a single news source, it would show that media use reinforced previously held opinions. However, measuring communication exposure in terms of diversity revealed that the media were able to change opinions. (FL)",

        "description":"The composing processes of apprehensive and nonapprehensive college freshmen writers were explored in a case study of two female students. The two students, one a high apprehensive and the other a low apprehensive writer, completed a questionnaire that elicited information about their attitudes toward writing, writing concerns, time spent writing, and other composing habits. The students then wrote two essays (one personal and one expository), on separate days, while being videotaped. After each writing session, the student watched the videotape of her performance and commented on all she could remember about her thoughts, sources for ideas and examples, pauses, word changes, rereadings, revisions, and other pertinent acts. The essays were then analyzed for all the information  they conveyed about the composing process of the writers. The results showed many differences between the two students. The apprehensive writer disliked writing and took a great deal of time to complete an assignment, while the nonapprehensive writer enjoyed writing and wrote rapidly. The apprehensive writer paused often during writing and usually wrote only one draft. In contrast, the nonapprehensive writer usually finished a first draft with few pauses, made a few minor changes, and immediately started on a second draft. Only occassionally did she reread the first draft after she began the second or subsequent drafts. (Writing samples are appended.) (FL)",

The first sequence deals with the past, from the creation of the cosmos to the middle ages in human history; the second sequence concerns the discovery and colonization of the United States in relation to the rest of a developing world; and the third sequence deals with the skills, the attitudes, the facts, and the concepts needed to face a  future filled with alternatives. The descriptions and outlines of each of these sequences include possible course schedules that integrate English with other disciplines (such as the social sciences), general and specific course objectives, descriptions of units of study within the sequence, and lists of sample activities and reading assignments.

        "description":"A study examined how children visualize, draw, and make inferences about story content presented either aurally on tape or as an animated film. Audio versions of the story were manipulated to include short descriptions, in either literal or nonliteral language, directly analogous to the film's visual depiction at four points in the story. These points were chosen to examine medium effects in children's visualizations of the appearance, movement, and affect of character as well as specific points of view. Forty-five fourth grade children were assigned to either a literal audio, nonliteral audio, or film condition and individually presented the story. Afterwards, they drew and talked about their visualizations and answered inference questions about related story content. The  subjects' drawings were compared with those made by children in a baseline sample to assess the degree to which they included conventional ideas and prototypes in their depictions. Results provided evidence for the capacity of visual media to encourage children to visualize and draw story content in nonstereotypic ways and to provide them with numerous visual &quot;reference points&quot; for understanding content. In contrast, aural media afforded children the opportunity to apply their own ideas and experiences to the interpretation and visualization of stories.

        "description":"If college freshmen know something about syntax, have practiced combining and breaking down sentences, and have learned to think in terms of deep structures and surface structures, they may be better able to understand and relieve the discomfort caused by a garbled key sentence structure. Grammar instruction in freshman composition provides a vocabulary and a method for sorting out the semantic elements of a confused thought. One approach to integrating grammar into a regular freshman composition course is to break instruction into four modules: syntax, free sentence combining, directed sentence revision, and theory. The purposes of the syntax module are to activate students' awareness that sentences do have formal properties, to give them a vocabulary for discussing the  properties, and to get them to apply their awareness when they feel uncomfortable about specific sentences they have written. The general goal of the sentence-combining module is practice in combining sentence kernels in various ways. At the same time, students are directed to revise specific sentences in their own papers. Theory is presented in the final quarter of the term. At this time the concept of deep structure is introduced, not as a psychological fact, but as a metaphor for how sentences might take shape in students' minds. This approach allows for individualized grammar study and sentence work in the context of current writing assignments and for writing assignments to be ordered to lend themselves to such study.

A content analysis was undertaken of a random sample of programs drawn from the three major networks over a period of 14 evenings. The primary unit of analysis was the \"drinking incident\"--the actual or implied consumption of an alcoholic drink by a actor with a speaking role. Other items recorded included the number of times actors refused drinks offered to them, the function of each drinking episode, and the negative short-term and long-term consequences of drinking that were presented. The results revealed 293 male and 113 female drinking incidents, with 64% of all programs  containing at least one such episode. The overall rate of drinking incidents was 3.92 per hour. The negative consequences of drinking were seldom presented, and the ratio of drinking incidents to negative short-term consequences was 25.4 to 1, and to negative long-term consequences 101.5 to 1. No program dealt with alcohol abuse and treatment. (FL)",

The rules, derived from H. P. Grice's &quot;be cooperative&quot; principle, referred mainly to the maxim &quot;be perspicuous, unequivocal, clear, and intelligible&quot; and to turn-taking behavior in conversation. The subjects were interviewed individually and were shown 13 film scenes, each containing a face-to-face encounter between two girls in which one participant showed inappropriate behavior illustrating a rule violation. After each scene, the subject was asked to identify the rule violation that had taken place. The results showed a clear age-dependency of scores, with younger subjects showing a greater  ignorance of communication rules than older subjects. The poor performance of the younger subjects was attributed to a lack of understanding of messages that refer to the representational level (rather than to an ongoing action) and to lack of role taking ability. The findings support a hierarchical model of different levels of perspective taking ability. (FL)",

        "description":"Teaching a unit on effective briefing techniques early in a basic speech class can develop in the student a sense of time consciousness, verbal conciseness, objectivity, appreciation for documentation, and logical organization. Briefing in this sense is a type of informative speech in which selected and compressed information is presented to one's superiors or other important listeners whose time is valuable and limited. An understanding of briefing is gained by considering a competitive intercollegiate debate. Although intercollegiate debate involves other facets such as debate strategy, some of the speech behaviors common to debate are useful in briefings. At the end of a unit on briefing, students will be able to (1) distinguish briefings from other forms of oral  presentations, (2) describe two different types of briefings, and (3) prepare and present information and decision types of briefings. The content of the unit should include preparation for the briefing (analyzing the listeners and occasion, researching the subject, organizing the presentation, and rehearsing the presentation); types of briefings (information and decision); formats for briefing; and evaluation of briefings. (The paper includes a list of learning experiences for which briefing techniques are useful and important.) (HOD)",

All subjects read a scenario from the Friendship Survey entitled &quot;Letting Someone Know That the Friendship Is Over&quot; and responded to a series of questions that elicited (1) a list of all possible strategies that could be used to terminate a relationship, (2) the strategy most preferred by the respondent, and (3) the reason for that preference. All respondents, except the fifth grade students, also completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory. Both fifth grade students and adults  displayed a preference for confrontation as opposed to avoidance relationship termination strategies, whereas adolescents preferred avoidance strategies.

        "description":"The first step in developing a communication competency assessment instrument is determining whether there is conceptual support for such an instrument. Funding should also be determined, since speaking skills must be assessed as a person speaks, a procedure that requires more time and money to complete than in the case of machine-scored tests. Next, specific skills must be identified. This means a delineation of skills more complete than the generic \"speaking,\"\"listening,\" and \"interpersonal\" categories. Once this is accomplished, the search for instruments can begin. It must be kept in mind that the purpose of the instrument, if it is to measure skill attainment, must be to elicit skills for subsequent measurement. Following pilot testing, the instrument is ready for  refinement, which with the evaluation process must continue until some assurance is obtained that the instrument is valid and reliable. Follow-up procedures are also essential at this stage of development. Test development can become a futile endeavor if careful consideration is not given to all procedural elements throughout the process. Accountability hinges on the assumption, and ultimate proof, of the consistent nature of purpose, concept, and instrument. (HOD)",

        "description":"Based on research suggesting spatial zones of proximity in human behavior (individuals have definable zones of intimate, personal, social, and public space), it was hypothesized that \"framed shots\" of people on television screens would suggest specific distances to the viewer. The hypotheses were that subjects would estimate a greater interpersonal distance for each succeeding shot ranging from close-up to long shot, and that subjects would perceive a given shot in relation to a similar interpersonal distance. After a brief explanation of the nature of subjective shots, 45 subjects were asked to estimate the distances between viewer and eight subjective shots of people framed in a television screen. The shots varied between extreme close-ups and long shots. Seven  order-relationships were possible for each subject, allowing 315 pairs of distance comparisons with which to test the hypotheses. The analysis of data indicated that (1) regardless of the order in which shots were seen, the subjects estimated greater distances ranging from close-up to long shot; (2) mean distances for shots differed significantly; and (3) the variance within each shot was high but increased proportionately to the mean. These findings strongly indicated that the manner in which a person is pictured within a frame creates a phenomenon related to perception of physical distance. (RL)",

Each participant makes assumptions about the listener's knowledge and ability to communicate effectively. The way a speaker reacts to the other participant depends upon the speaker's own assumptions and perceptions about the other, the other participant's role, and what each believes to be the real topic of discussion. For effective communication to occur between a youth and an elderly person, four criteria must be fulfilled: (1) the participants must be viewed as unique or worthy of the exchange, (2) they must experience the expected balance of inclusion and affection, (3) they must engage in a fluctuating balance of &quot;investment  stake&quot; during the conversation, and (4) they must adhere to certain conversational rules such as turn-taking, sticking to a topic, returning with a &quot;new&quot; component for the message, and answering in an appropriate manner. Interference or misinterpretation occurs when participants have false assumptions or fail to meet the expected exchange of messages due to sensory, physical, or cognitive differences. The result is information distortion, message failure, and social discomfort. A poorly defined relationship, often found with elderly people, results in distortion of the meaning in shared utterances. (RL)",

The survey measured the ways the subjects matched three communicator types: (1) the rhetorically sensitive person, one who generally accepted the variability of communication and interpersonal relationships and did not try to avoid stylized verbal behavior; (2) the &quot;noble self,&quot; one who would see any variation from personal norms as hypocritical and a denial of integrity; and (3) the &quot;rhetorical reflector,&quot; who would present a different self for each person or situation. The results of  the attitude survey revealed that the widowed subjects scored significantly lower on rhetorical sensitivity and significantly higher on noble self than did the divorced/separated subjects. No significant differences were found between the two groups as rhetorical reflector types. Based on these results, it was hypothesized that the grieving process may differ for the two groups, creating variations in the way these people reorder their social systems after the loss of a spouse.

Ferris State College (Big Rapids, Michigan) was selected for this study because of its unusually high success rate in placing students. A questionnaire designed to elicit information on career placement attitudes and frequency of career placement activities was completed by the directors of 25 programs related to the study of speech  communication at the college. The results indicated that career-sensitive attitudes and placement activities at the department level were crucial variables in the placement success at Ferris State College, in marked contrast to results of other nationwide studies indicating that most speech communication departments felt they should not be career oriented or responsible for providing career guidance at the undergraduate level. The findings suggest that the widespread use of internships by Ferris College program directors may be the most important department level activity contributing to career placement. (HTH)",

        "description":"Ninety-three officers and enlisted men of the United States Army National Guard were surveyed for their communication attitudes in a study comparing rhetorical sensitivity to two organizational communication variables--leadership effectiveness (as a managerial skill) and position in an organizational hierarchy (rank). The survey measured the ways in which the subjects matched three communicator types: (1) the rhetorically sensitive person, one who generally accepts the variability of communication and interpersonal relationships and does not try to avoid stylized verbal behaviors; (2) the &quot;noble self,&quot; one who sees any variation from personal norms as hypocritical and a denial of integrity; and (3) the &quot;rhetorical reflector,&quot; who presents a different self for each person or  situation. The results showed that subjects who scored high in rhetorical sensitivity were not rated significantly higher in leadership effectiveness than individuals who scored low in rhetorical sensitivity. However, rhetorical sensitivity did relate to rank, so that scores for rhetorical sensitivity increased across groups from enlisted men through sergeants to officers. Other results showed that sergeants tended to score higher in noble self than officers and enlisted men, but lower in rhetorical reflector than the others, while the enlisted men tended to score relatively high in both areas.

        "description":"Noting that the formal split between instruction in written and oral modes of communication is a relatively recent one, this paper presents arguments against that split--at both the secondary school and the college level--and arguments for instruction in communication. The paper offers a historically based definition of communication, positing that the communicative act requires the communicator to: (1) categorize data relevant to a communication situation, (2) conceptualize that data, (3) symbolize it, (4) organize the symbols into some sort of order that will further the purposes and meanings of the communication situation, and (5) operationalize that data into a message. From this definition, the paper concludes that writing and speaking are modes of communication and that  instruction in the two should be integrated. It then describes the rhetoric program at the University of Iowa, which for 30 years has offered such an integrated curriculum. In conclusion, the paper discusses the problems often encountered in student writing and explains how an integrated speaking/writing program can counter those problems. (FL)",

The first paper presents results of a national survey of elementary and secondary speaking and listening assessment procedures that was sponsored by the Speech Communication Association. Various sections of the paper focus on state legislative activity, specific skills tested, standards, and testing procedures. The paper reports the findings of the survey on a state-by-state basis. The second paper deals with the current assessment of  speaking and listening skills at the college level and concentrates on the development and evaluation of the Communication Competence Assessment Instrument. The third paper reviews potential sources of bias in assessment--including stimulus conditions, response mode, rating procedures, and use of test results--and suggests strategies for dealing with each. The fourth paper identifies several issues related to the use of rating scales in evaluating oral communication proficiency--including scale development, psychometric evaluation, and the speech type assessed--and suggests new directions for research.

        "description":"A questionnaire was designed for a study assessing both the importance of 28 variables in movie attendance and the importance of movie-going as a leisure-time activity. Respondents were 130 ninth and twelfth grade students. The 28 variables were broadly organized into eight categories: movie production personnel, production elements, advertising, criticism and reviewing, interpersonal influence, perception of film content, financial costs to the patron, and miscellaneous. Overall, 4.2% of the sample reported movie-going as a favorite leisure activity. This percentage was slightly higher than those of similar studies, and suggested that movie-going as a leisure activity diminished with age. When data on the 28 variables were analyzed, subject matter of the film and interpersonal  contact were the reasons cited most often for going to films. The data also demonstrated the low salience of \"behind-the-screen\" production personnel in attracting high school movie-goers. The frequent movie-goers in the sample considered more of the 28 variables as being important in making their choices than did the occasional movie-goers. Overall, the 28 variables accounted for nearly one-third of the movie attendance variance in a multiple regression analysis. (RL)",

Communication specialists can help by applying speech communication knowledge in the training of health care professionals. In-house training, professional workshops, and on-site seminars are generally more accessible to health care practitioners than are college courses, and are therefore good channels for health communication training and developmental work. Health communication training can be divided into two different categories: health communication skills training, and health communication  process training. Training areas include verbal and nonverbal skills, perceptual skills, listening skills, and presentational speaking skills. Process topics include patient interviewing, health education, practitioner-patient relationships, health care team building, therapeutic communication, health care ethics, and communication in health care organizations.

        "author":["Dowling, Ralph E."],
        "description":"Academic debate may be regarded as an educational game since it includes the adversary quest for favorable decisions from a neutral judge within an artificial context defined by myriad rules and traditions. In academic debate, the requisite fairness is provided by such game rules as time limitations, speaker order, uniform resolutions, critic neutrality, and rules or traditions regarding evidence integrity. While the rules of most educational games provide no variation or uncertainty in determining the outcome, debate is a unique game because winning is determined by rules that are brought into practical application by the critic. These rules have produced critics whose stances no longer require or reward the demonstration of superior debate skills, whose decision options are  unrealistic, and who are theoretically bound to ignore the real means and ends of oral advocacy. These results in turn inhibit the educational fairness functions they were designed to fulfill. Changes in debate judging might include (1) a modified critical stance that would operate on the assumption of critic neutrality concerning the area of dispute and opposing advocates while requiring an active critical evaluation of the arguments presented, (2) the use of presumption that assures quality in each argumentative component prior to its acceptance as a relevant factor in the final decisions that are reached, and (3) modified debate ballots to allow the critic the option of remaining undecided on the issues in controversy when that is how the critic perceives the arguments.

The first paper reviews several critiques of traditional argumentation theories and offers directions for new theories, and the remaining eight papers offer responses to the ideas and positions of the first. Specific topics covered in the papers include (1) the constructivist/interactionist approach to the epistemological functions of argument studies, (2) logic-in-use among everyday arguers, (3) the logic of the coordinated management of meaning, (4) conversational arguing, (5) rhetorical argument as reduplication, (6) &quot;eiconology&quot; as a philosophical ground for understanding the roles of arguing in knowing, (7) argument  as epistemological method, and (8) the need for new argumentation theories. Other materials included in the collection are an edited transcript of the seminar and a list of the participants and their topics. (FL)",

        "description":"Describing the middle school as extending from the fifth or sixth through the eighth grades, this review describes current middle school philosophies and characteristics and cites middle school research and implications. Ideally, the report maintains, the middle school is designed to serve the needs of early adolescents through such techniques as interdisciplinary courses, exploratory classes, individualized instruction, team teaching, and flexible scheduling and student grouping. Research comparing the middle school and junior high is cited, concluding that at this time, no clear results are available. The report also reviews research on teacher competencies needed for middle school teaching, among them the abilities to structure teaching, use concrete materials and focus  learning strategies, incorporate indirectness in teaching, and ask varied questions. Evidence of cognitive growth patterns of adolescents is explored, concluding that from age twelve to fourteen, adolescents experience a period of very slow intellectual growth. The research suggests that middle school teacher training needs to stress competencies identified as useful in working with adolescents and that curriculum should consider the seventh and eighth grade intellectual lull. It is noted that the inconclusive research on middle schools may merely indicate that the middle school philosophy has not yet been fully applied. (Author/JM)",

The case entries  provide information about the name and procedural history of each case, the issues, and the plaintiffs' attorneys. Other sections of the catalog explain the procedures used to find the cases and attempt to estimate the completeness of the compilation. Additional statistical information provided in the study includes the incidence of cases of each type in each state, the number of cases filed by students or by schools, the types of attorneys, the number of filings by year, and the outcomes of the cases.

        "description":"Censorship of books and learning materials is a growing trend nationwide, according to responses from a 1980 survey of 1,891 public elementary and secondary school administrators and library personnel from across the country and of state administrators overseeing evaluation and adoption of textbooks in 21 states. This summary and interpretation of the survey findings discusses local and state views on textbook adoptions and challenges, presents overviews of local- and state-level survey results, and gives recommendations for establishing district policy on materials selection and for formulating responses when selections are challenged. The report includes comments from individual questionnaires as well as implications drawn by the researchers. The authors conclude that  challenges to classroom and library materials often result in limiting students' access to information and ideas. They found that many schools lack, or fail to follow, written policies for selecting and/or restricting instructional materials. Those schools that do have written policies, however, appear to resolve conflicts with fewer restrictions on materials and, therefore, less negative impact on the educational environment. Responses to the state-level survey suggest that local and national pressure groups, especially those considered politically right-of-center, exploit controversy over textbook and materials selection for political ends.

        "description":"Based on the premises that there is a legitimate federal role in education, that federal education programs need to be simplified, that federal aid must pass through states to the local school districts, and that state and local agencies should be accountable for using federal resources, this paper offers specifications to suggest ways to eliminate unnecessary features of current federal programs. In relation to the controversy over whether it is preferable to institute a form of special revenue sharing or to tighten federal controls, the authors urge a combination of strict accountability for outcomes and wide latitude in determining how those outcomes are achieved. Included in the discussion are programs under Titles I, II, III, IV, and V of the Elementary Secondary Education  Act. Recommendations include maintaining the categorical identity of some programs, such as compensatory education, education for severely handicapped children, vocational education, and educational research and development, and consolidating others. This grant simplification proposal would incorporate the principles of &quot;hold harmless&quot; (giving assurances that grantees will receive a minimum allocation based on the previous year's award), performance accountability, and shared state and local control.

        "description":"Demographic and economic growth in the sunbelt states has been interpreted by some as a threat to the northern frostbelt states. Consequently, many have argued for the revision of policies affecting the distribution of federal funds among states. This paper examines the merits of such an argument by looking at concrete economic and demographic data, including the results of the 1980 census. The author concludes that the sunbelt-frostbelt conflict is essentially a myth, resulting from misinterpretation of data, erroneous extrapolation of short-term trends, and confusion between relative and absolute changes. Recent studies have calculated state-by-state ratios of per capita federal spending to per capita federal tax collection, showing that frostbelt states pay more than they  receive and vice versa for the sunbelt states. The author argues that such studies are misleading and suggests that a better bias in the distribution of federal funds is the regional share of federal transfers to states and local governments. He then explores alternatives in funding for three programs--vocational education, rehabilitation, and public library services--and concludes that elimination of income adjustments from federal formulas governing funds distribution would negatively affect educational opportunity.

The author cites evidence that time-on-task is related to student achievement and describes two instructional approaches that have been associated with high levels of time-on-task. The first of these is mastery learning, which includes nine key elements, summarized here in checklist form. The second, direct instruction, has ten key elements and, according to the author, is similar to mastery learning. Central to both is the need for clearly defined goals, communication of expectations to students, and careful monitoring of student progress.  The author lists several school districts currently involved in puttinq the research on learning time and instruction into practice and includes a capsule description of each program. Finally, implications of the learning time concept for instructional and teaching effectiveness are offered. (Author/WD)",

Four trained observers recorded the administrators' activities throughout every minute of the workday for one week in the fall, winter, and spring. Different observers were assigned to each day in a week's observation to allow for analysis of interaction between observers and the observed subjects. The data were coded using Mintzberg's Managerial Work Activity Classification system, which organizes all managerial activity into five categories and assigns one of twelve purposes to each activity involving interpersonal interaction. In essence,  the project sought answers to five questions: Where do superintendents work? How do they spend their time? With whom do they interact? Who initiates the contacts? What are the purposes of superintendent contacts? Comparison of results with other studies; discussions of interpersonal contacts, contextual factors, and managerial work; and the introduction of the concept of &quot;managerial ecology&quot; form a framework for the study's findings. Appended are the Mintzberg classification system, tables, and the data coding manual. (Author/WD)",

The study looked particularly at the effect on learning outcomes of allowing students to assist each other or work together. More generally, it examined the relationship of several aspects of curriculum implementation on learning. Subjects were teachers and students in nine bilingual classrooms in San Jose (California). Data were gathered through observation of students and teachers and through content-referenced and standardized tests of student achievement. Major results include the following: (1) Talking and  working together was a predictor of achievement gains on the content-referenced test. (2) Reading and writing behavior was a predictor of gains on the standardized test. (3) The quality of performance on the worksheets was a predictor of gains on standardized tests. (4) The level of engagement in the task was unusually high with this curriculum. More general findings emerged when a sociological perspective was applied: productivity of students and occurrence of prescribed learning behaviors were direct predictors of learning outcomes; degree of differentiation of the technology was linked only indirectly to learning outcomes.

Interference involved such problems as interruption or replacement of core instruction, clashes in teaching methods, administrative burdens, staff conflicts, and segregation of  students. Cross-subsidy problems included providing funded services to unfunded programs, reducing funded services, and diverting personnel from one program to another. The evidence indicated that the problems resulted from both the multiplicity of federal programs and the choices of local administrators. The researchers recommend that the number of programs and the competition between funded and unfunded programs be reduced; that local administrators be assisted in coordinating programs; and that categorical programs be consolidated to increase effectiveness.

        "description":"Based on articles about and interviews with citizens and school staffs involved in value conflicts, this report looks at two sources of home-school conflicts--home education and book selection. The first section considers the positive and negative consequences of parent-school conflicts about home schooling; summarizes attitudes of families who resist compulsory schooling; and clarifies the problem of proving that a home education plan is equivalent to that offered by the school. It also looks at the public reaction to home schooling and the ideological defense of government schooling. The issues involved in court litigation on home schooling are examined, especially the questions of how much power a family has over the education of its children and how much power school  authorities have to regulate home schooling. The second section of the report treats the topic of book selection and looks at the censorship of books in libraries and classrooms on grounds of religion, science, patriotism, or obscenity. The issue of creationism is dealt with in detail. The section closes by looking at the effects of book selection conflict on teachers, school board members, and students. The report concludes with a number of recommendations, including increased recognition of First Amendment consequences of school policy and structure. (Author/JM)",

Opposition at the time led to the separation of the schools from the regular school system. Development of the schools was also hampered by inadequate discussion of the implementation process. Since 1975, a governmental change has reduced the schools' resources, opposition has continued, and comprehensive schools have not developed at a national level. Within the schools, lack of expertise and money has slowed organizational and curricular development. Further, lack of comparative data on the experimental schools has reduced the opportunity to learn  from their experiences. In 1985 the Dutch parliament will decide whether to implement comprehensive schools nationally. A move to comprehensive schools will cause problems unless better research is available and unless the regular secondary schools are brought closer to the comprehensive schools. (RW)",

Children were taught with lessons over a 2 day period which provided direct instruction on a medial vowel sound, practice on monosyllabic words containing the sound, and specific transfer training on nonsense syllables. Word attack strategy was varied for the five treatment groups: (1) initial bigram training in which words were broken down into two components--the initial bigram and the final consonant; (2) final bigram training in which words were broken down into two components--the initial consonant and the final bigram; (3) letter by letter training in which words were broken  down into individual phonemes; (4) initial-final bigram training in which words were broken down into individual bigram and final consonant on Day 1 and by the initial consonant and final bigram on Day 2; and (5) final-initial bigram training in which words were broken down first by the initial consonant and final bigram on Day 1, and then by the initial bigram and final consonant on Day 2. The initial bigram strategy yielded significantly better performance on transfer words. The strategy appeared to be differentially effective because it emphasized both left to right processing and reduced the number of units to be synthesized. This finding called into question approaches which emphasize rhyming patterns or letter by letter decoding. (Author/SB)",

Results indicated that: overall, the learning disabled group had lower accuracy and retention scores than the nondisabled group; and the reduction of either response competition of stimulus complexity during instruction significantly improved the accuracy and retention of the disabled children, but did not significantly influence the performance of the nondisabled group.

In the practice plus feedback (PPF) condition, Ss received information regarding their vocalization speed as well as accuracy. Findings indicated that disabled readers had significantly slower vocalization times for both high and low frequency words than did their normal peers. The normal readers evidenced relatively stable prformance across trials under both conditions, while disabled readers had a more rapidly decelerating curve under PPF than under P.

Most of these children, when reading, went beyond using prior knowledge to provide schemata and interpretations; they distorted text information to make it conform to prior knowledge. They could comprehend text but can not learn from text. Several of the children used this same strategy even when a written text is read to them, suggesting that one basis for this unproductive strategy may lie in characteristics differences between spoken and written language. The children did learn well from class discussions. Many of the component tasks in typical verbal  intelligence tests appeared to measure ability to use prior knowledge (e.g., vocabularly, similarities, information). Thus, the strategy these children applied unsuccessfully to written language comprehension can be applied successfully to typical intelligence tests. Early decoding problems and early success with the strategy in beginning reading tasks were among possible influences leading to its development. Plausible approaches to treatment included those that emphasize attention to cohesive markers (words that signal relationships between sentences and even paragraphs, and thus hold the text together).

For more than three-fourth of the graduates, followup took place within 3 years after leaving the project. Data is presented on sex, ethnicity, functional impairment, and primary handicap. Seventy-seven percent of the graduates followed were attending a public school, while only 4% were in a residential program, despite a relatively high percentage (approximately 20%) of students rated as severely impaired at program exit. No relationship of consequence was found  between place of service and type of agency sponsoring the project or between place of service and primary handicap of the child. Analysis of cost information was based on figures for salaries and consultant fees and revealed an average personnel cost per child per year of $2,147. Wide extremes in cost per child and in personnel resources expended per child were found among the projects. (CL)",

Multivariate analyses, followed by univariate and paired comparison tests, indicated that both EMR and normal Ss increased in attentional efficiency with age in both attentional processes. Findings suggested that at about 12 years of age, the capacity for most attentional processes has already developed in both EMR and normal children. Lack of difference between EMR and normal Ss on the attention components was interpreted as supporting the developmental position of retardation. Correlations between the two attentional measures were not significant, further supporting the  interpretation that the hypothesized components of attention represent independent influence on children's academic performance.

Teachers were asked to list at least 10 curriculum materials presently used by the students. Of the 536 materials named, 255 were classified through the use of the Annehurst Curriculum Classification System. Two profiles were created for each material classified: the first describes the material according to learning attribute (experience, intelligence, motivation, emotional/personality, creativity, and social development); and the second according to learning style required to use the material (verbal expression, auditory perception, visual perception, and motor perception). It was concluded that materials in use are  low in five of the six learner characteristics, but are more diverse in learning styles. It is suggested that a broader range of use should be made available for teachers experiencing a greater range of abilities within their classrooms.

A battery of psychological tests was used to assess treatment effects and included Goodenough-Harris Drawing Test; Boehm and Slater Cognitive Skills Assessment Battery; Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test; Krug, Aric, and Almond Autism Screening Instrument for Educational Planning; Educational Subtest; Modified Autism Behavior Checklist; and Leiter International Performance Scale. Three control Ss spent the 48 hours in the hospital ward  setting being cared for by parents. REST Ss improved on self initiated communicative speech for the 2 weeks following treatment and improved performance on discrimination learning tasks for 2 weeks. Analysis of behavioral records kept by Ss during the REST session allowed for the identification of the child's most prominent behaviors without interference from distractors or social interaction. It was concluded that REST was nonaversive to autistic patients and appeared to have at least short range beneficial effects. (DB)",

In the introduction, characteristics of the learning disabled child are considered, and the Myklebust formula, which looks at the ratio of actual achievement level to expected achievement level, is explained. Studies evaluating the formula are noted. The Macomb study used the formula with 163 children previously diagnosed as learning disabled. Ss in grades 1 through 12 were given the Kuhlman-Anderson test (to generate mental age), the Peabody Individual Achievement Test, and the Science  Research Associates Achievement Series. Wechsler Intelligence Scale scores were also used when available to calculate learning quotient according to the Myklebust formula. Results indicated that use of the formula would decrease the number of children labeled learning disabled from 6% of the total school population to 4%. Modifications of the formula when applied to grades 1 and 2 and to high school aged students are proposed. The third section presents the screening steps to be used in applying the eligibility formula in the Macomb schools with separate guidelines for grades 1 and 2, 3 and 8, and high school.

The objective is to show the impact of that connection on learning and derive a cognitive methodology for language instruction. Such research and methodology would seem necessary in view of the situation in which material is presented, but the process of making connections is left to the students themselves. The study  is presented in three parts. First, the role of the past is examined with respect to memory, learning, language acquisition and second language learning, and intervention. The second part describes three experiments dealing with the organization of memory and both prospective and retrospective uses of memory. Third, the concept of creative learning is examined and pedagogical implications are discussed. (AMH)",

Each entry includes a name form or lemma, its pronunciation if not clear from the lemma form, part of speech, and examples to illustrate its range of inflections. The discussion of semantics begins with a syntactic framework for the definition using a typical sentence, followed by the definition proper, phrased in terms of elements of the typical sentence as examples of the semantic range of actants. There is a brief equivalent in Spanish -- or sometimes in the regional dialect of rural Nayarit -- and a statement of the diathesis or mapping between semantic actants and grammatical constituents, with semantic restrictions among actants spelled out. The entry also contains  references to other words whose definitions share the same structure as the one being defined (not necessarily synonyms), the values of all the lexical functions, and finally the cross references to that word from other parts of the inventory. A summary in English reviews the strategy and form of the inventory, the writing system, abbreviations, and special symbols used, and the lexical functions cited. (Author/JK)",

        "description":"This study investigates plural noun forms in Modern Hebrew to show that the pattern of regularization differs for specific words, rather than for classes of words. Early regularization, in which the children add a plural suffix with no stem change, applies unconditionally. Subsequently, the pattern changes and while some words are still regularized by six year olds, others are given the correct plural form by grade-school age children. Other words continue to deviate from the norms of classical Hebrew, even in the speech of educated adults. A test was administered to 48 native Hebrew speakers of high socio-economic status, 12 each at the ages of three, six, and twelve, and non language-major college students. The 20 items tested plural formation for two classes of feminine nouns  and two classes of masculine nouns. Results reveal the complex interaction between formal linguistic knowledge and incidental knowledge due to familiarity of specific forms in language usage and in formulaic contexts. Both kinds of knowledge are developmentally determined, yet some historically deviant forms have entered standard usage. What constitutes an error may need to be evaluated differentially with respect to the language of young children compared with that of older speakers. (Author/JK)",

Recombinative generalization is introduced as a process that enables individuals to express and to comprehend novel utterances. This review focuses on the use of a miniature linguistic system paradigm to explore how recombinative generalization can be efficiently established. How the necessary stimulus conditions vary depending upon the linguistic repertoires of individuals are discussed. Examples of learners who have no knowledge, partial knowledge, and near complete knowledge of the lexical constituents included in language systems are used to illustrate differences in the necessary conditions that can yield generative language learning. Also mentioned are implications  for understanding normal language acquisition and for developing efficient language intervention programs. (Author)",

        "description":"Suggestions are presented to assist the nontechnically trained English as a second language teacher to create a syllabus for a technical writing course for foreign students who are studying science and technology. The syllabus for the English for Science and Technology (EST) writing course is based on the format of technical writing derived from native-speaker texts on the subject. The course involves writing five short reports concerned with description (i.e., amplified description, description of a mechanism or body part, description of a process, classification, and an abstract), and one or more long reports concerned with argumentation. The types of long reports may include a feasibility study, research report, and progress report. Before any writing assignment is given, a  skeleton structure is presented to the class, along with a model of the report being studied. Grammar, as an adjunct to the writing sequence, also is taught. The article system in English is one of the most difficult grammatical points for a foreign student to master. It is also necessary to devote considerable attention to the relative clause, including subject- and object-form relative clauses and the defining (restrictive) versus nondefining (nonrestrictive) distinction. Other grammatical points are covered, including compound nouns and adjectives and the passive voice. Stylistic and rhetorical points of interest concern definitions; transitional devices; paraphrasing and quoting; wordiness; and figures, graphs, and equations. The skeleton structures of a short and long report are  included. (SW)",

        "author":["Marshall, Helaine W."],
        "description":"The writing of ESL students, while sophisticated in some respects, often contains fragments and run-ons. Because these students have no reliable, self-monitoring system for analyzing their writing and because they believe they are communicating effectively, they fail to recognize their difficulties in forming complete sentences. This paper discusses a program implemented in an advanced intermediate ESL college composition class. The program proposes that students will be able to monitor their writing for incorrectly formed sentences if given a series of exercises designed to help them analyze their work. The key concept is GLUE, a term used for all connectors, including coordinating and subordinating conjunctions and relative pronouns. Using a reference list of the GLUE words in  English, students first label those they have used and, then, identify the finite clauses or subject-verb (SV) units. The number of GLUE words and SVs used are counted up as the student determines the type of sentence unit s/he has created. A complete sentence requires one more SV than GLUE. In altering their work, students learn to remove an SV, add a GLUE, or in some other way make the sentence conform to the rule for a complete sentence. (Author/JK)",

The hypothesis suggests that readers learn literacy only once and that a lack of literacy in one's first language can be more of a barrier to accurate reading than can a lack of fluency in English. Differences were found within the following pairings of readers: native literate and semiliterate, and native literate and nonnative literate. Discourse blocking and three-system (lexical, grammatical, and rhetorical) analyses show that, generally, native literate readers tend to paragraph at significant rhetorical boundaries. When other readers disagree with this group they do so at the  following places: (1) at lower level rhetorical breaks that can often be better characterized as lexical or grammatical, (2) at rhetorical units which begin narrative illustration or \"event\" rather than expository frames, and (3) after rhetorical units that are interpreted as topic/opening units by native literate readers.

Reviewing John Searle's five categories of speech acts (1976), the directive is discussed in terms of its manifestations in various foreign languages. Examples of directives in English, German, French, and Spanish are contrasted. Teaching communicative competence presupposes for some the notion of grammatical competence. Both may be taught if teachers are sensitive to those areas of language use which require a knowledge of specific linguistic forms and an understanding of the situation appropriate for these forms. Language teachers should provide language exercises which actively require the students to consider both the grammatical forms and the  contextual information necessary to produce a correct response. It may be advantageous to postpone such an integrating exercise until the individual grammatical concepts have been presented separately. Speech act theory provides insight into the function utterances have in a given language. While the theory is not language specific, lexical items and grammatical structures are. (Author/JK)",

Two particular problems in language acquisition are examined: (1) establishing what counts as a formal relationship in a particular domain, and (2) retreating from overgeneralizations without negative data with respect to the acquisition of morphology. The \"inheritance principle\" is proposed as a principle of both adult grammar and language acquisition. This principle is understood as follows: first, a derived form inherits the full subcategorization of its base unless the relation between the two forms is distant; and secondly, if a derived form is distantly related to its base, then only the unmarked portion of the  subcategorization is inherited. The \"inheritance model\" suggests that overgeneralizations and subsequent retreat from overgeneralizations follow in a principled way from the formal relationships that learners posit between items. These two predictions of the inheritance principle were tested in a series of experiments with groups of children aged three to seven. The form of the model derived for the domain of morphology suggests parallel models for other domains of grammar and a programmatic approach to the study of overgeneralization and retreat in language acquisition.

The MDP dictates the interpretation of the logical subject of the infinitive in these structures and overrides marked lexical features such as subject control. Misinterpretations by adult second language learners and by adult prelingually deaf individuals are also shown to result from an overextension of the MDP. On a comprehension test of specific sentences, the relative order of difficulty in interpreting the logical subject of the infinitive is similar for both groups. This order reflects the same order of difficulty on sentences containing &quot;tell,&quot;&quot;ask,&quot; and &quot;promise&quot; which has been reported in the literature on  first language acquisition. The later acquisition of certain structures is explained in terms of the inherent linguistic complexity of the sentences. (Author)",

Broad-scale action is recommended, such as: a national committee or council to bring visibility to the issue and to recommend new initiatives; regional and special subject consortia to respond to opportunities and problems in  particular geographic areas; and cooperation with education, engineering, biomedical interests for improved precollege mathematics and science education for minority students. It is also recommended that minority colleges concentrate on strong basic curricula and cooperate with other institutions, and that majority institution programs increase efforts to deal with minorities and minority issues.

In addition to outlining skills and attributes needed by administrators, Elizabeth Grossman examines five basic administrative functions: planning, organizing, leading or implementing, controlling, and evaluating. Administrative concerns discussed by Patty L. Hawken include: budgeting for an entire school, determining the dividing line between administrative and faculty responsibilities, planning, facilitating, coordinating, and communicating. Nan B. Hechenberger's concept of administration of nursing education probes roles and relationships of the dean as they pertain to the organizational  functions of academic, faculty, and student affairs, development (including alumni, public, and governmental relations), and finances. Valencia N. Prock has attempted to uphold three basic concepts in her deanship: the presence of academic freedom, excellence in meeting the mission of the school through long-range planning of goals and appointment of qualified faculty, and shared authority in faculty governance. According to Mary E. Reres, the dean as an administrator should be able to predict over a three-year period the major social changes that will affect the school or college under her direction. Among the topics addressed by Doris B. Yingling are leadership style of the dean, activities pursued outside versus inside the university, risk-taking, visibility, communications, and  budgets.

        "description":"The role and attributes of deans of nursing as scholars in charge of baccalaureate or higher degree programs are considered by six deans who contributed to a continuing education workshop series. Among the topics addressed by Olga Andruskiw are: problems facing women deans, including stereotypic attitudes, difficulties in ascendancy in administration and strategies for survival; the need for research; and management of time and responsibilities. Donna Diers considers how a dean might retain some aspects of the faculty role, whether in research, teaching, scholarly work outside of empirical research, clinical practice, or community service. Peggy J. Ledbetter summarizes views expressed in the literature regarding arrangements by which the dean may teach, the dean's role in  institutional research and research activity outside the institution, the dean's responsibility for delivery of clinical services to patients, the dean as author of articles, and the dean as manager. According to Carol A. Lindeman, it is very important that a dean be a scholar not only to ensure that administrative issues are handled in a scholarly manner, but to fulfill the set of expectations regarding the dean as an academician, as a person who is known for thorough, accurate knowledge of a given field. Jannetta MacPhail considers the dean's own scholarly productivity, creating a climate to foster and support scholarship, promoting a scholarly approach to teaching and to practice, and deterrents to scholarly productivity and scholarliness. Marilyn Christian Smith's view is that she can  not be a full-time scholar and searcher for truth through research, teaching, and clinical practice, but feels that she must be a pragmatic scholar, a searcher for truth in the leadership she attempts to provide as a dean. Bibliographies are included. (SW)",

        "description":"The relationships of deans of baccalaureate or higher degree programs of nursing with faculty members, administrators, students, other professionals, and the public are considered by six deans who contributed to a continuing education workshop series. According to Edith H. Anderson, the dean is a colleague of other deans, and to students and junior faculty members the dean is a role model. Leadership and management are shared with mid-level administrators and senior faculty members while providing for progressively responsible participation of junior faculty and students. Doris A. Geitgey believes the effective collegial relationship is founded on mutual understanding, respect, and trust, and that the most important colleagues of a dean are the faculty members. Collegial  relationships with other deans, higher level administrators, nursing service personnel, physicians, and students also are addressed. Virginia R. Jarratt suggests that there are distinctions in the role of dean with different groups; the role is sometimes formal, sometimes informal, and sometimes situational. Relationships with other administrators, faculty, students, and the public are considered. Georgie C. Labadie proposes that deans can foster positive relationships with students and provide a role model for faculty to promote shared university governance. The importance of collegial relationships with other deans, and relationships with administrators and faculty are addressed. According to Marion M. Schrum, the level of collegiality varies substantively with the dean's administrative  style and is influenced by the size and structure of the school. Among the concerns addressed by Anna M. Shannon are a theory of interpersonal relations, and assessment of one's beliefs about self, others, role, and institutions. Bibliographies are included. (SW)",

Rheba de Tornyay considers qualities and personal characteristics of effective and less effective leaders, professional image, rewards and costs, and success as a dean. According to Elizabeth C. Harkins, the person who becomes a dean is usually accustomed to successes in life, which enhance the character of the individual and increase self-esteem. Identifying lines of support, personal needs, the resolution of support, and risk-taking are addressed. Julia A. Lane considers attributes that enabled her to survive and experience a measure of success as dean, with  attention to personal values, knowledge, and technical, human, and conceptual skills. Andrea R. Lindell suggests that the dean as a person must aspire to utilize self in a disciplined and knowledgeable way in a relationship with other people and must have a personal objectivity based on an awareness of self and personal needs and the ability to deal with one's own patterns of personality. She proposes that the dean has the right and responsibility to emphasize the individual, to allow self-expression, and to give respect and consideration. Fostine G. Riddick considers the dean as person in relation to human factors, leadership behavior, and the following models of governance: the constitutional, autocratic, democratic, federal, and totalitarian models. According to Carmen R. Westwick the  human dimensions of being a dean are the personality characteristics, the philosophy of life, the mode of interaction with others, and everyday behavior. Additionally, the rights of a dean as a person are identified. Bibliographies are included. (SW)",

The main purpose of the CAI project was to teach interpretive skills. The most positive results came in the logic course. The programs in the New Testament did not receive adequate testing, and the programs in an introduction to religion were not typical examples of the programs for which the project was designed. Programs were prepared in the EXBASIC language, and in 1976, with the installation of a new PDP-11 minicomputer, they were converted to BASIC-PLUS and tested with students. The so-called synoptic problem was taught both by lecture and CAI in the new testament course. Programs in  the introduction to religion course concerned Hinduism: one asked students a variety of questions about the caste system in India, while the other dealt with the four traditional stages in a man's ideal life in Hinduism. The programs in introductory religion were evaluated by unsolicited comments from students, student evaluations and comments solicited by a questionnaire, and student performance on the final examination. In evaluating the logic course, which taught the concept of generalization, it was found that many students were repeating the exercises several times until they felt that they knew the material thoroughly. It is concluded that the computer is a valuable teaching tool in the humanities, and that its applications can be extended. Descriptions of the programs and  statistical analysis of student evaluations are appended. (SW)",

The development of a psychology departmental colloquium series, the formation of a psychology club, the supervision of a field placement course, and the participation of faculty in specialty advising for pre-law and pre-health science students are considered. The colloquium series is discussed in relation to initiating, coordinating, and maintaining such a program as well as the specific objectives developed for the model series. The following objectives guided the development of the series: to illustrate the variety of activities engaged in by psychologists, to provide a public forum for psychology faculty and students to present their scholarly work, and to stimulate additional scholarly  activity among faculty and students. Topics addressed during the first four years of the series are listed. The psychology club is addressed from a social as well as an intellectual growth perspective. In addition to some social gatherings, the club has sponsored service functions (e.g., special events for hospitalized children), and has addressed the issue of learning more about the profession of psychology. The field placement course has required both classroom and on-site time. The way that this type of course can be integrated into the overall patterns of the department is considered. It is suggested that specialty advising can aid not only individual students but also can increase the effectiveness of the departmental advising process. Methods for maximizing this function are  examined. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"Due to the expansion of cooperative education programs, critical issues facing them were examined. The issues as perceived by cooperative education directors were identified, along with their relative importance as perceived by directors and their immediate supervisors. The study aimed to determine whether differences exist between directors and their supervisors, between two- and four-year college directors, and among directors in the six regions of the United States. Separate research questionnaires were used for each of the two reference groups to ascertain directors' background (title, years in position, gender, age, institutional type, and name of immediate supervisor), as well as attitudes toward issues. A panel of expert judges refined the issues list, and a Likert-type  scale was developed for the refined list of 55 issue statements. A second issues questionnaire was then administered to the supervisors and compared with the findings from the survey of directors. Conclusions include the following: a majority of directors expressed concern for maintaining the quality of cooperative education work assignments with an increasing number of institutions and students participating; the why and how of awarding and applying cooperative education credit is a very important issue; one factor scale, \"Organizational Placement and Institutional Integration,\" showed differences between the co-op directors and their supervisors; the design of the cooperative education experience and award of credit is perceived as more important on the two-year college level; and there  seem to be no discernible differences among regions. Among the suggestions for further study are: causes for the low proportion of female directors, cost effective methods, planning elements that increase the potential for success, and benefits of faculty involvement. Appendices include the director's and supervisor's issues questionnaires and a list of the panel of experts. (LC)",

        "description":"A case study of Sullins College, which in 1975 requested that the state of Virginia investigate the feasibility of incorporating the college into the state's public higher education system, is presented. This small, private, two-year college in southwest Virginia had been struggling for several years to maintain its small enrollment. Historical information about the predominantly women's college, its environment, enrollment trends, and financial conditions are briefly examined. The college's request to the state occurred at a time when the public institutions were competing actively for a diminishing share of state revenues, and state takeover of Sullins College might have prompted other private colleges facing difficulties to make similar appeals. Additionally, some  state-supported institutions already had surplus student space. The focus of the feasibility study was institutional accessibility in terms of demographic trends, accessibility to programs of study in the region, and the costs of acquiring Sullins College. The alternative to defining Sullins College's mission in terms of the traditional two-year or four-year liberal arts curriculum and regional audience was to focus on a specialized curriculum aimed at a broader potential student population than that of the greater Bristol region. Three alternative uses of Sullins College were examined: a state school of the arts, a middle college, and an early admissions college. The state decided against the acquisition of Sullins College. Wellmore Coal Corporation purchased the college and planned to  use the facilities as a cultural center and a private day school. (SW)",

        "description":"The regulation of the college merger process in New York, including its effects on a recent merger between private institutions, is examined. New York's higher education policy formation process and the laws and policies that make college mergers possible are considered. The merger of Eisenhower College and Rochester Institute of Technology provides a reference for specific recommendations to enhance the merger option and use it for controlled retrenchment within the system. Two common routes for colleges seeking mergers in New York State are the traditional consolidation of two or more institutions into one and a form using laws designed for institutional closure to dissolve one institution and transfer its assets to another. The dissolution merger of independent institutions  could be the type most frequently practiced in coming years, and it is the type illustrated by the merger of Eisenhower College and Rochester Institute. The dissolution/acquisition route is not favorable to the dissolving institution but it can provide continuity for current students and their records and may provide, in part, employment for faculty and staff, perpetuation of some goals and traditions, and continued debt service supporting the dormitory bonds. There are seven distinct policies and practices that may impinge upon a college merger before, during, and after its consummation. Five apply to all mergers and the remaining two involve special cases: monitoring, off-campus instruction, chartering, master planning, program registration, legislative override, and trustee  replacement. The time involved to phase out older academic programs and initiate new ones is discussed. It is recommended that New York should continue its policy of not requiring formal notice to the state mergers, should develop merger experts who can broker mergers, provide policy information, and negotiate the process.

Specific involvement of the private sector was provided in the preparation of the 1979-84 THEC Master Plan. Many of the planning issues identified in that plan touched on private sector concerns and interaction with public sector institutions. The master plan describes the governance and organizational structures in the state with a specific reference to the interaction of THEC with private sector institutions. The plan supplies data profiles and recent trends in such areas as enrollments, programs, faculty, finance, and facilities, and private sector institutions are represented in most of these trends. Additionally, the  role of the private sector is specifically recognized in the statement of goals and objectives. Among the more important policy statements affecting the private sector is the issue of potential merger between private institutions and public institutions. The state provides financial support for private sector institutions through student financial aid, contract programs of the Southern Regional Education Board, and direct contracts. The THEC is charged by legislative statute to consider the programs and facilities of private higher education as it assesses the needs of the state in higher education. Policy and planning are designed to accord private education full recognition in the community of higher education in the state and to maintain full respect for the independence and autonomy  of private higher education.

        "description":"Cost and expenditure developments in countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are considered. The time evolution of overall educational expenditure without reference to a particular school level is examined, using National Account statistics. This analysis involves: examining the education share in the country's national income or overall state budget; comparing education's share in the state budget or national income to the share of other sectors like health and defense; and accounting for the changes in the share of education in the national resources by considering demographic, enrollment, and cost factors. Another analysis, which involves the distribution of public expenditure by level of education, addresses the following: the  higher education share in overall educational expenditures; factors accounting for the changing share of higher education in the state budget; the allocation of resources within the tertiary education sector; and the allocation of resources within the university sector by field of study. Data are provided by country for 1965, 1970, 1975, and 1977. Additionally, aggregate expenditure and enrollment data are combined to derive unit costs per student, unit costs per graduate, unit costs by type of higher education institution, and unit costs by field of study. Nonpublic sources of university finance and the evolution of student support schemes also are addressed. It is predicted that governments will exert increased pressure on students to finance their education. This change might be  approached by giving student loans rather than grants. (SW)",

The state of research in higher education is also examined. After briefly discussing the current state of higher education in OECD countries and the relationship between higher education and working life, the reform of studies, and the particular problems of the humanities and social sciences, are examined. In most OECD countries, higher education is currently on the defensive because of such factors as economic recession, demographic changes, and graduate unemployment. It is suggested that higher education can respond to a greater emphasis on working life in  five main ways: the alternative choices of work and study, either before, during, or after studies, can be encouraged; vocational representatives can be involved in the planning or accreditation of courses: student enrollment vocational courses can be increased, and the numbers in nonvocational courses can be decreased; a compromise, such as requiring students in academic courses to spend 20 percent of their time in vocational studies can be implemented; and academic and vocational needs can be subsumed within a framework of general undergraduate education, educational policy (and demographic factors) and by science and technology policy. The way in which external funds for research projects are distributed and the consequences of decline are considered. (SW)",

A list of hypothetical problems was derived from a systematic literature search, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 faculty of history, biological science, political science, and business economics departments of a small, Eastern private college. Among the findings are the following: respondents recognized that within the academic profession research productivity is more highly valued than teaching excellence; historians and political scientists understood that they faced restricted career opportunities, but still displayed relatively high morale; members of all departments felt that their teaching loads made it difficult  for them to keep up with their fields; many professors felt that public commitments to both high standards of scholarship and teaching excellence were sometimes contradicted by personnel actions; strained collegial relationships both within and between departments existed; and the majority of respondents were displeased by the large number of poorly prepared and motivated students. None of the following hypothetical organizational problems were widely recognized at the college: professional isolation, excessive professional demands, large classes, pressure to relax standards, inadequate pay, loose-coupling, threats to academic freedom, and limited opportunities for tenure. It is suggested that virtually all of the serious problems are related to the dilemma of attracting students while  maintaining high academic standards. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"The development of a planning, budgeting, and evaluation model, referred to as an &quot;academic audit&quot; model, at the University of North Carolina, Asheville, is described. The model is essentially a model for planning resource reallocation in conjunction with redefining and reestablishing institutional goals and mission statements. Priorities for budgeting are set as a consequence or outcome of the auditing process. The model is cyclical in that an obvious outcome of the entire process would be a demonstrated need to perpetuate the model. The first phase of the model involves compiling extensive data on student enrollment patterns, grading tendencies of faculty, and other trends and merging that information with budget data such as faculty salaries and expenditures for equipment and  supplies. The academic audits of each academic program would serve as the primary information source used by a joint faculty-administrative advisory committee in the second phase of the program, academic planning. Using the university's goals and objectives as a guide, recommmendations could be made by the advisory committee as to the status of present programs, the need for any reallocation of funds, and the availability of monies for any new programs. Once their recommendations are considered and acted on, the third phase would be one of program evaluation and review. This stage essentially would entail annual updating of the initial academic audit, a review of the program's progress in achieving stated objectives, and recommending any changes in funding. A bibliography and audit  program timetable adopted from the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems are appended. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"The state of academic advisement in postsecondary education was studied through a survey of representatives of 58 colleges and universities and students who were pursuing undergraduate degrees in four-year institutions during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. About 59 percent of the institutions were public, 41 percent were private, and 22 percent had a central advisement program. Only 45 percent of the public students rated their advisement as excellent-to-good, compared to almost 59 percent of the private students. For the three time periods, there was a marked decrease in public student satisfaction with their advisement and a corresponding increase in private student satisfaction. Students in large public universities were considerably less happy with their advisement than were  students in small schools. Students viewed themselves as the most helpful resource in making decisions about majors, teachers as the most helpful external resource, and advisors tied with friends as being least helpful. Some of the data indicate that 34 percent of the freshmen were not obliged to consult an advisor. In addition to the survey findings, 20 issues that have affected postsecondary education over the last two decades are briefly considered. These include an emphasis on science, civil rights, affirmative action, women's rights, a movement that emphasized ethnic identity, community colleges, student power, financial aid from governmental sources, adult and continuing education, and Public Law 94-142. A bibliography, sample questionnaires, and sample student descriptions of an  ideal student advisement program are appended. (SW)",

The research methodology, which consisted of three mathematical models to project physician supply and requirements, is described, and 40 recommendations to solve health manpower problems of 1990-2000 are presented. Additionally, federal government private commission initiatives from 1955 through 1980 to deal with health manpower problems are considered, and the function of GMENAC technical panels are addressed. The findings indicate the following: there will be 70,000 more physicians than required in 1990; most specialties will have a surplus; some specialties will be in balance  (e.g., osteopathic general practice, family practice, general internal medicine, and general pediatrics); shortages will be experienced in psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and emergency medicine; and valid criteria for designating geographic areas as adequately served or underserved have not been developed. Among the approaches GMENAC recommends are the following: a 17 percent decrease in U.S. medical school enrollment compared to current levels; sharp restrictions of the entry into the United States of students from foreign medical schools; no further rise in the number of physician health care providers being trained; and prompt adjustments in the number of residency training positions in individual specialties to bring supply into balance with requirements in the  1990s.

Attention is directed to the history of the program, the status of the project when the General College Assembly adopted its 1981 statement, and the nature of the work to be completed during the 1981-82 year. Reference is made to the 1981 Carnegie Foundation essay (Boyer and Levine) showing that general education experienced a swing toward vocational education before the Depression, efforts to reaffirm values central in Western and American civilization after World War II, and an emphasis on science and mathematics and foreign languages after Russia orbited Sputnik in 1957. During the 1960s and early 1970s, students, minorities, feminists, and others called  for diversity and relevance in general education offerings. The goals, characteristics, and desirable outcomes of the general education program, and degree requirements of the Associate in Arts Degree of the General College are specified in the 1981 Assembly statement. Broad educational outcomes in connection with skills, liberal education, and application/problem solving have been specified. Faculty have been examining course offerings as part of an effort to refine the liberal education requirement. Boyer and Levine suggest that general education content can be presented under six broad subject categories: shared use of symbols, shared membership in groups/institutions, shared producing and consuming, shared relationship with nature, shared sense of time, and shared values and beliefs.  Two recent histories of general education, one by Roland Lincoln Guyotte, III, and the other by Gail A. Koch, are reviewed. (SW)",

Students were asked about their contact with foreign students, their experiences with other cultures, and their demographic characteristics. In the spring of 1979, 743 students responded to the mail questionnaire, and six months later, 404 students responded to the followup survey. In contrast to a majority view of the value and desirability of interaction with foreign students,  less than one-third of respondents on both surveys agreed that there was meaningful contact between U.S. students and foreign students at the university. Most students did not change their attitudes toward foreign students after the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Iran, but their responses did show increased support for funding international exchange programs. Attitudes toward foreign students were significantly related to respondents' demographic characteristics, political views, and the frequency and form of their contact with foreign students. More positive attitudes toward foreign students were associated with being female, older, enrolled in graduate school, living off campus, and having travelled abroad. The more frequent the students' reported contact with foreign students, the  more positive were their attitudes. A bibliography and questionnaire are appended. (SW)",

There are many national systems of education in Asia, though many of them derive from British or American models. Language of instruction presents a problem for international access, and in some countries the various levels of education may use different languages. Some international languages such as Chinese and English may assist educational mobility between countries. Potential use of the distance mode as a solution to various international problems is discussed in relation to vocational, general, and continuing education. Suggestions for facilitating a regional scheme of cooperation within Asia are offered that deal with matters of organization, accreditation and validation, finance, and language.  Possible models include transfer of credits, joint awards, and cooperative specialized production of subject packages. It is suggested that an international body such as the United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) would be the appropriate organizer of a regional scheme on behalf of Asian nations. It is noted that any scheme will have to consider six points: production of packaged learning resources, copyright and translation of packages, feedback between tutor and student, accreditation and validation, transfer of credits, and joint awards. It is suggested that distance education is a valid method of learning, and cooperation should ensure that the best learning facilities in Asia are available to each student. Most objections will likely be due to  difficulties in the administration of cooperative schemes, and considerable planning would have to precede the operation of a regional cooperative scheme for distance education.

        "description":"The Practice-Theory-Practice Model (PTPM), a method designed to infuse theoretical perspectives into case study materials and to serve as a guide for examining chance processes in institutions of higher education, is described. The PTPM considers the historical and experiential environment that acts upon an institution, its practices and its actors. The model shows the historical-experiential perspective to be an examination of the forces acting to reinforce and maintain a particular practice. Normative and systemic knowledge are seen as flowing from a study of this practice and comprise the major bodies of knowledge surrounding this current practice. The PTPM also requires careful analysis of research decisions and planning-based decisions made as they pertain to the practice.  These knowledge and decision analyses produce the information necessary for the study of the interactions among the different types of knowledge, and between the actors and the knowledge from a practice. The PTPM establishes the valuation process as the mediation point for these actions. Thus the PTPM provides a method not only for studying the components of an institutional change, but also for analyzing the component interactions that lead to reinforced or altered practice. The application of the practice-theory-practice model as a guide for the study of institutional change can be either reconstructive or predictive. The PTPM provides a theoretical outline of the institutional change process and also gives an enriched method for studying such changes. A bibliography is appended.  (SW)",

        "description":"Guidelines for establishing and implementing residence hall unit agreements with college students are presented, based on the experience of the University of Maryland, College Park. These agreements or social contracts are drawn up by a floor/unit of residents and are put in writing to define for that unit the acceptable range of behavior in a number of different categories. Details of the agreement are worked out by the floor residents through consensus, with support by the resident assistant and community staff. The agreement allows for: student assumption of responsibility in determining guidelines for living on their floor (e.g., quiet hours, parties, guests, cleanup); residents' discussion of desirable as well as undesirable behavior; and the role of resident assistants to  be facilitators rather than rule enforcers. Six steps involved in staff training and preparation for carrying out unit agreements are outlined, and details of pre-agreement, agreement, and post-agreement activities are covered. The pre-agreement stage, which establishes the groundwork for the actual agreement negotiation, is considered in relation to specific activities as well as the ideas and materials that would be presented prior to the agreement negotiation. The agreement stage involves discussing and filling in agreement worksheets and the negotiation process, which will take place in three steps. In the post-agreement stage, provisions to renegotiate and amend the agreement are established. A letter to introduce the student to the concept of the unit agreement, worksheets, and a  sample unit agreement are appended. (SW)",

Attention is focused on the reform of existing programs and the introduction of new ones to increase the attention given to the international aspects of education and their centrality in the undergraduate curriculum. In addition, consideration is given to the people involved in the programs, the way that the undergraduate environment can be made more global and international, and the way that undergraduate programs and the international facilities of the institution in general can better relate to the public at all  levels. The following types of American higher education institutions or arrangements are examined: the university, comprehensive institutions, the liberal arts college, community and junior colleges, professional schools, continuing education, consortia, and cooperation between school and college. Among the possible approaches for strengthening the international perspective are evaluating the traditional disciplinary major or departmental structure, broadening major offerings, internationalizing existing major programs, integrating an international dimension throughout the curriculum, integrating views of scholars of other nationalities in academic programs, and establishing institutions specifically designed to provide training in international studies. Attention also is directed to the  importance of second language instruction, study abroad and international exchanges, financing international programs, and campus activities and resources.

Information is presented on full- and part-time students, women and minority enrollments, financial support programs provided to graduate students in 1980-81, enrollments by discipline, and enrollments by schools. The trend since 1978 in graduate education in pharmacy has been one of enlarging doctoral programs; doctoral students now comprise 46 percent of the total graduate student population. Most of the growth since 1978 can be accounted for by increases in the number of full-time and part-time Ph.D. students. A large proportion of this increase has been due to the increase in the number of women enrolled in doctoral programs. Enrollments in M.S. programs has been falling off since 1978,  and the largest decrease has been in part-time M.S. students. The enrollments for minority students has remained essentially the same, and as a consequence, there has been a slight percentage decrease. It is possible that the increase in doctoral program enrollment may be related to the increase in financial support, since the availability of stipends would seem to make doctoral studies more attractive. The number of students enrolled in full-time graduate study has increased from 1,850 in 1978 to 2,028 in 1980. Women represent 30 percent of the full-time graduate student population, and the percentage of foreign students has remained constant at 29 percent for the last three years. A list of colleges by state is appended that indicates the professional degrees awarded. (SW)",

It is noted that although the predominant trend in enrollments in professional degree programs has been one of decline, the proportion of female students has continued to increase and will probably reach 50 percent in the relatively near future. The percentage of underrepresented minorities also has increased continually, in spite of a leveling off in the number of black students and American Indians enrolled.

A number of independent study courses in psychology, gerontology, and education have been offered to students who cannot come to the campus to attend regular class meetings. The approach is based on psychology of learning and individual differences. The course materials are divided into 10 to 12 relatively small units of study called instructional projects. The information provided for each instructional project includes: a descriptive title, purpose, behavioral objectives, evaluative criteria, learning resources, and competency exercises. Competency exercises provide  immediate feedback regarding their progress. After completing half of the course, students take a retention test before beginning the work on the second. The course grade is based on the competency exercises, assignments, and retention tests, which are administered by the student's supervisor or other representative. Students maintain contact with the instructor through phone calls and letters. The program has been found to be a viable mode of meeting educational needs of teachers, service providers, and other nontraditional students. This approach is appropriate for courses in which the material to be learned is structured in a definite hierarchy with well-defined objectives, is largely available from written materials, and is amenable to individual learning. Its features of self-pacing,  mastery learning, and immediate feedback make it especially attractive to nontraditional students. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"The role and function of upper-level higher education institutions, their current health, and their future prospects are considered, based on a national study. Data were gathered on nearly all of the 25 upper-level institutions in the United States, and site visits were conducted at approximately half. These schools offer work at only the junior, senior, and possibly postgraduate levels. Attention was directed to the unique philosophical and operational considerations that guide these colleges; factors surrounding the creation, planning, and opening of the institutions; the nature of the relationships with nearby two-year colleges, particularly regarding articulation of academic programs; the demographic composition of services; the academic mission and programmatic offerings of  the upper-level institutions; and budgetary and financial considerations. Over half of the schools are in Texas and Florida, with Illinois being the only other state with more than one upper-level institution. In Texas, the upper-level idea was proposed as part of a unified state plan, while in Florida they were created individually, in response to the state need for additional institutions of higher education in the heavily populated urban areas of the state. With only a few exceptions, the upper-level institutions created in the 1960s and 1970s were designed to interface with pre-existing two-year institutions. Upper-level institutions have focused their resources and energy on meeting the special needs of nontraditional students: those who are older, employed, married, part-time, and  place-bound. In addition these institutions have developed professionally-oriented curricula and well-developed placement offices. The need to articulate with other schools at both the lower division and doctoral levels is one of the more severe burdens faced by upper-level institutions. (SW)",

Survey results are used for different purposes in each institution. including program review, self-study/accreditation, and information for the Graduate Assembly. The second study surveyed 69 graduate departments at West Virginia University. Some type of formal survey and/or interview to evaluate graduate programs is conducted by 41 departments of the university, 39 (48 percent) indicated that they do not  conduct any formal type of graduate evaluation. Survey results are used for degree program and curriculum review, for department review, and self-study. A few departments use the results for faculty review. In the third study, the Graduate Student Program Evaluation test was constructed and tested. Factor analysis reduced the test to 32 items with high internal reliability. The instrument was tested with 99 graduating master's and doctoral students. The results suggest that graduate students' evaluations of their programs are unidimensional in nature, indicating that all areas of the program are considered an integral part of the whole experience.

Attention was limited to in-state undergraduate students who applied for aid during the 1979-80 academic year on the basis of need and who received some form of aid. The findings are based on a sample of over 4,600 randomly selected student financial aid records (10 percent) from 129 institutions. Unmet financial need was calculated using the College Scholarship Service's uniform methodology. On the average, the financial aid available was inadequate to cover the estimated expenses of the students, with an average unmet need of $406 per student. The total array of financial aid programs was also found to be highly vulnerable to changes in federal financial aid policies in that  73 percent of all financial aid received by students in the sample was from federal sources. There appeared to be a maldistribution of student financial aid: aid was not, in many cases, going to the most needy. With one minor exception, recipients in every type of institution had unmet need. However, the level of unmet need was much greater in some sectors than in others. Furthermore, recipients with student/family incomes over $18,000 had, on the average, overmet need while recipients from lower income families had unmet financial need. In addition, blacks had noticeably higher unmet need than did whites, and part-time recipients had much higher unmet need than did full-time recipients. Recipients over 24 years old and women had higher unmet need than did younger and male recipients,  respectively. A sample questionnaire is appended. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"Results of a recent study of attrition, retention, and transfer within the system of public higher education in Kentucky are summarized. Attrition, retention, and transfer rates are presented by class level and institution for 1979-80. For first-time full-time freshmen, the university system had an attrition rate of 27.9 percent, ranging from 20.6 percent to 43.9 percent. First-time part-time freshmen had an attrition rate of 64 percent in the university system, ranging from 58 percent to 74 percent. There was a high correlation between the attrition rate of first-time full-time freshmen at a university and its average composite score on the American College Testing (ACT) Program test. A single variate linear regression model relating attrition rate to ACT composite score  accounts for 85.2 percent of the variation in attrition among the universities. Adding a qualitative variable to the model to indicate whether a university is primarily residential or commuter produces a new model that accounts for 96.1 percent of the variation in attrition among the universities. Attrition and transfer rates as a function of sex, race, and major are presented, along with plans to extend this project into a longitudinal study that will determine the stability of the rates, the reentry rate of students withdrawing from the system, the persistence rate of each year's cohort, and the average time for program completion. The system consists of eight universities and 13 community colleges. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"Information on possible sources of funds and skills that are needed for obtaining grants from private foundations and corporations is presented to aid college administrators and faculty members. Attention is directed to private sector grants to higher education, grantsmanship within the institutions, grantsmanship as faculty development, initiating the grants process, and grantsmanship resources. It is shown that private sector support is diverse and has been targeted to almost every conceivable aspect of higher education. However, the funding sources often are interested in innovation and new programs, while colleges and universities are increasingly concerned with obtaining funding that will avoid significant cuts in existing programs. It is suggested that the skillful  combination of both the art and knowledge base aspects of grantsmanship will increase the likelihood that grant proposals will be successful. While the responsibility for such activities usually resides with an institutions' grants office and its relationship with both faculty and administrators, the college president may seek to build an incentive system to encourage staff participation in the grants process and to explain institutional priorities. Workshops for faculty and staff can help improve their grantsmanship as well as assist them in locating information about funding sources and opportunities. It is important to find funding sources that fit a proposal in terms of activity, geographic orientation, types of support, grant range, and target population. Resources representing both  bibliographic and referral sources that may be useful in developing or improving grantsmanship skills are listed under the following categories: general references, higher education references, periodicals, practical guides, organizations, and computerized databases.

        "description":"The prevalence of underprepared students attending colleges, the need to define literacy requirements of courses, the implications of research on literacy in the design of remedial programs, and the need for systematic evaluation of such programs are considered. Literacy is broadly defined as a language competence that is used to achieve both individual and societal goals. Literacy has a functional dimension, involving the specific competencies required to perform in the occupational field for which an academic program prepared students, and a symbolic dimension, which is associated with having knowledge, cognitive competence, and values established in society. It is proposed that policies involving issues of literacy and its development are adequate only when all components of  its definition are considered: (1) the nature of the language involved; (2) the way the language is processed; (3) the context in which the language is processed for use; and (4) the functions of this use in relation to specified goals. Despite the use of a variety of terms and the lack of clearly defined purposes, the emphasis of most efforts described in the literature seems to include preparing the students for regular college work. Some are comprehensive programs incorporating specific literacy skills like reading and writing and objectives like improved self-concept, while others focus on one specific skill such as the development of basic arithmetic skills. Attention is directed to teaching methods, institutions' support for organization of developmental programs, and common  practices and problems in the evaluation of developmental programs.

        "description":"Changes that higher education is experiencing and forecasting and approaches to improve higher education management are considered. In addition to declining enrollment, rising costs, and diminishing financial resources, colleges are faced with the task of managing these changes under the pressures of new constraints and new constituencies. Collective bargaining is affecting faculty participation on governance, and the influence of faculty is also being affected by its changing composition and distribution: the tenured professoriate is projected to continue to age. Additionally, students now serve on academic advisory bodies at most institutions, and most colleges have defined due process for students with regard to their rights. It is suggested that with trends toward  centralization of authority and demands for increased accountability, governing boards have increased the scope of their activities and will become an increasingly important constraint on higher education's decision-making processes. Among the external constituencies are state government, accrediting agencies, local communities, benefactors, and business interests. Each has a vehicle for exerting influence on an institution. It is suggested that the inability to measure its effectiveness is important to higher education's adaptation to the changes it is experiencing, and that criteria for evaluation must be established. Decisions must be based on specificity of goals, comprehensiveness in developing plans to achieve those goals, and innovation in measuring outcomes. Executives need an  aggressive and open-minded approach in searching for and testing new methods and need to recognize constraints that affect a decision. (SW)",

The survey was prompted by an awareness that the diversity of the student population attending community colleges results in a need for equally diverse learning resources programs if the academic objectives of students and instructors are to be achieved. General analysis of the survey data indicated that in-house use of LRC resources for assignment-specific purposes is most common among all student groups. The most important implication to be drawn from the survey  is that, for the LRC to effectively support the educational plan of the community college, there must be direct alignment between LRC services and the school's academic agenda. The survey results are presented in eight figures, a reference list is provided, and the survey instrument is appended to the study. (JL)",

Narrated videotape presentations of simulated and live jamming followed by a drill and practice session and performance test were presented to 357 trainees. The objective was to train students in electronic countermeasures (ECM) recognition in a more effective mode than can be achieved through traditional classroom lecture and textbook presentation of jamming examples. The lesson on basic jamming recognition presented training in recognizing and identifying general types of ECM. The microprocessor was programmed to (1)  present the materials in response to student input through the keyboard, (2) evaluate student performance and provide feedback when appropriate, and (3) keep a complete record of all responses and response times. The results indicated a significant improvement in posttest over pretest scores, and attitudinal surveys showed a highly positive attitude toward the type of training used. The microcomputer-based training system was effective and reliable, meeting with project expectations. Future project efforts include revisions and extension of the present system.

Subjects were 164 trainees assigned to the Basic Electricity/Electronics School in San Diego. They were randomly assigned to three experimental treatment groups (unguided learner control, guided learner control and programmed control) and a control group. Lesson materials and objectives were the same for all groups; however, experimental groups used PLATO IV student terminals, while the control group used lesson booklets. Within-lesson performance of and lesson strategies used by the experimental groups were compared as well as the performance of the  control and experimental groups on the post lesson performance tests and module examinations. Results indicate that learner control, with or without guidance, is not superior to programmed control as a CBI mode. However, the use of the learner control lesson structure may be desirable because of the possible economies to be effected. Also, since it appears that the rule-example-practice lesson strategy may prove to be optimum for all students, consideration may be given to delivering this strategy in an adaptive programmed control mode.

The first stage of the survey, which involved interviews with 64 randomly selected LaRC engineers and scientists, was intended to gather information for use in questionnaire development. The second stage involved data collection by means of a questionnaire submitted to LaRC scientific personnel assigned to the Aeronautics, Electronics, Structures, and Space Directorates. Responses were compiled and analyzed in groups corresponding to the various aspects of Langley STI services addressed by the  survey: the technical review process, the research review process, the perceived image of LaRC STI Services, LaRC publication guidelines, research support services, and scientific and technical products and services. Recommendations based on the findings are made for each topic area. Data are presented by topic areas and summarized in 22 tables. Included are a reference list and six appendices, among which are the project plan for review of LaRC services and a copy of the survey instrument. (Author/JL)",

To obtain feedback on the STI program's effectiveness, a survey questionnaire prepared jointly by the evaluation project director and Continental Research was sent to 497 academic and industrial engineers and scientists who agreed to participate in the study. Of these, 381 returned the questionnaires by the deadline, computer tabulations were performed, and the responses were summarized.  Analysis of the data revealed that NASA STI was important to the research conducted by the majority of the survey respondents, although a significant lack of familiarity with selected NASA STI products and services among the survey population was indicated. Survey data are categorized by topic and presented in 13 tables. Included are recommendations, a reference list and six appendices, among which are the project plan for the review of LaRC STI services and a copy of the survey instrument. (Author/JL)",

Such data may be found in the maintenance management data systems of the military services. It was found that non-faulty components are removed in four to 43 percent of all corrective maintenance actions and account for nine to 32 percent of all maintenance manhours. Technicians fail to find a faulty part or damage a good part in about 10 percent of all corrective maintenance actions. It was concluded that these findings may be due to inadequate test equipment, tools, and maintenance manuals, as well as to inadequate training. Conclusions  also focused on the need to collect data on the performance of maintenance technicians on the job in a way that can be related systematically to procedures used in military selection and training.

A link between these two approaches is provided by showing certain correspondences between Sato's S-P Curve Theory and item response theory. This link makes possible several extensions of Sato's caution index that take advantage of the results of item response theory. Several such indices are introduced and their use illustrated by application to a set of achievement test data. Two of the newly introduced extended indices were found to be very effective for purposes of identifying persons who consistently use an erroneous rule in attempting to solve signed number arithmetic problems.

Visual, auditory, and bimodal ERPs were recorded during the same testing session, though not concurrently, and were analyzed to derive measures of sensory interaction. These measures were then related to the paper-and-pencil tests. The subjects were divided into two types, spatial processing group or verbal processing group, based on the cognitive measures. The spatial group showed greater inhibition in the right hemisphere while the verbal group showed  greater inhibition in the left hemisphere. The spatial group showed the greatest amplitude asymmetry in response to visual stimuli, while the verbal group showed the greatest asymmetry in response to auditory stimuli. The results indicate that FRP technology holds promise for developing adaptive instructional strategies based upon accurate assessments of individual differences in cognitive processing.

The training program permitted controlled differences in instructional treatment for different groups of  students in order to explore empirical issues in dynamic skill training.

After Chapter I introduces community services instruction at NHCC, past staff development efforts, and the scope and limitations of the study, Chapter II reviews the literature on community college staff development. Chapter III examines methods of data collection (i.e., a survey of 72 instructors of noncredit courses) and analysis. Chapter IV presents the results of the survey, providing information on respondents' tenure as a community services instructor; current occupation; perceptions of NHCC orientation, evaluation, and in-service training; familiarity with instructional issues and college services and  resources; preferred learning methods; interest in sharing class experiences; and career plans. Chapter V examines the implications of the study and presents conclusions and recommendations. A model program is outlined in Chapter VI, which establishes the assumptions underlying the program and delineates its seven components: (1) pre-hiring interview; (2) contract development; (3) orientation; (4) evaluation; (5) in-service activities, such as credit courses on adult learners; (6) a recognition system; and (7) creation of a staff development committee. Appendices contain the survey instrument, instructor evaluation forms, a job description, and an application form. A selected bibliography is included. (KL)",

        "description":"A two-year project was conducted by St. Mary's Junior College to improve the science literacy of visually-impaired students (VIS) through the adaptation of instructional methods and materials. A four-step process was used: (1) learning materials were reviewed to identify problem areas; (2) preliminary adaptations were made based on the review; (3) adaptations were piloted in the science lab or classroom with a small group of VIS; and (4) the information learned was applied in further modifications. Using this process, adaptations were developed and implemented for the following courses: Human Anatomy and Physiology, Man in Nature, General Chemistry, Biochemistry, Pathology, Microbiology, Physics, and Introduction to Clinical Embryology. Science faculty expressed satisfaction with  the adapted learning experiences, and VIS were able to attain learning objectives using the adapted materials and equipment. As an outgrowth of the project, a Science Learning Center was constructed to provide all SMJC students with access to the adapted science materials in a more informal setting. The project report outlines specific course and classroom adaptations that were completed, identifying the unit, the modification needed and how it was implemented, the outcomes, evaluation activities, additional modifications suggested, and personnel involved. Extensive appendices provide detailed charts, course descriptions, a project plan, testing and taping procedures, and lists of project purchases and resources. (Author/KL)",

        "description":"The community college student population has changed radically in recent years with the influx of more part-time students, minorities, women, and those changing careers. In many cases the perceptions and skills of faculty members have not kept pace with the changing educational and job expectations of these new students. Staff development programs, initiated to remedy this situation, often do not adequately serve occupational faculty, who must draw their expertise from the work place and who in many cases have not practiced their specialty for many years. At Hagerstown Junior College, the Return to Industry program was initiated to bridge the gap between changes in industry and occupational programs in the community college. The grant-sponsored project provides the opportunity  for occupational faculty to reinforce, update, or expand the skills and knowledge required to keep current with changing technology in their professions. Since summer 1978, faculty members from 13 of the college's 14 occupational programs have returned to industry. Formative and summative evaluations of these experiences have revealed the strength of the concept and its benefits to the host industries, the participants, and the school. This descriptive report is appended by examples of the instruments used to assess faculty and industry needs, guidelines for industry-school cooperation, the faculty proposal format, criteria for evaluating faculty proposals, sample agreements, evaluation forms, and other related materials.

The following personal and academic characteristics were used in the analysis: sex, age, marital status, high school and college background, new/transfer status, full-/part-time status, educational objective, major, grade point average (GPA),  credit-completion ratio (CCR), financial aid, placement test scores, and academic status. The study revealed that of the fall 1979 entering group (N=2,005), 28% were non-persisters, 32% were stop-outs, 5% were in-outs, 29% were persisters, and 5% were graduates. Graduates were found in especially high proportions among candidates for certificates, students whose CCR's were 1.00, and students with GPA's of 3.0 to 3.4. Persisters were found in especially high proportions among students who completed 80% to 99% of the credits attempted and students with GPA's between 2.0 and 2.9. High proportions of non-persisters had no particular degree objective. Data tables and comparisons with a four-semester persistence study of fall 1975 entering students are provided. (AYC)",

The paper begins by defining MBO, differentiating its components (e.g., individual and institutional goals and mission statements), and emphasizing the need for management styles conducive to objective management. Next, the steps in implementing MBO are listed and examined in detail; these include institutional goals, individual goals, periodic performance reviews, and end-of-year appraisal sessions. Then the mechanics of management objectives are considered, including writing styles (e.g., simple sentences, qualifying paragraphs, and columnar grids); classification of objectives as routine, problem-solving, innovative, or personal; measuring  techniques; and the establishment of priorities. The section concludes with goal-setting guidelines, such as check relevant sources; be succinct and simple; make goals realistic and challenging; limit the number of goals from ten to 15; write out desired results, how they will be achieved, and the criteria of success; state criteria in ranges; set a target date; set priorities; and distribute goals. An administrative development program is then outlined, including such topics as the role of management, organizational development, decision making, delegation, creativity, and performance appraisals. Finally, a time-table for implementing MBO is elaborated. An extensive bibliography is provided. (KL)",

        "description":"Through an understanding of the historical forces that raised the community college to prominence during the past decades and that are now threatening this position, the community college trustee can contribute to the process of securing a base for future progress. The period from 1961 to 1980 saw a tripling of the number of two-year colleges and an eightfold growth in student numbers as community colleges responded to the external pressures of the baby boom, civil rights movement, and technological changes. In today's world, however, concerns about fiscal constraints are accompanied by a shift in emphasis from access to meritocracy as the guiding value in the public priorities for postsecondary education. Much confusion about the mission of the community college stems from these  opposing values. Two issues of paramount concern have arisen out of the confrontation between increasingly constrained resource allocations and aspirations for continuing growth and mission expansion. The first of these involves educational quality, while the second concerns faculty commitment, defined as the ability to recognize, agree upon, and contribute to educational priorities. In addressing these issues, trustees of Arizona's community colleges might consider several alternatives, including working with the State Board in its review of the mission of the community colleges; encouraging administrators to experiment with establishing priorities among services; and obtaining information about costs and levels of quality.

To counter the vocational-school effect of programs heavily emphasizing career training, interdisciplinary, team-taught courses were initiated. However, the time required in planning, scheduling, and grading along with other problems resulted in the disappearance of these first courses. A more innovative and successful solution was the creation of a Department of Interdisciplinary Studies (DIS) to develop, promote, and monitor interdisciplinary curricula. DIS faculty, who also represent traditional disciplines, scrutinize the content of the DIS courses to protect the academic integrity of specific disciplines. The DIS uses a variety of organizational and methodological  strategies, including team teaching, multi-discipline courses taught by one instructor, thematic courses, and discipline combinations. Some of the DIS courses are &quot;Artistic Vision: An Introduction to Art, Music, and Literature,&quot;&quot;The Business of Energy: Crisis and Opportunity,&quot;&quot;Introduction to the Study of the Future,&quot;&quot;The Arts: Pathways to Perception,&quot;&quot;Your Lifestyle through Food and Nutrition,&quot;&quot;The Future of Sex: Crisis in Roles and Identities,&quot;&quot;American Studies: Literature and Arts in New England,&quot;&quot;Search for Self: Beliefs and Images,&quot;&quot;The Sporting Life,&quot; and &quot;The Philosophy of Science.&quot; The DIS offers many benefits for faculty and for students, who are frequently motivated to further study.

After an executive summary, introductory material reviews the issues of adult literacy and literacy development in the community college. The first of the report's two sections describes methodological assumptions and procedures and presents findings regarding literacy development, factors affecting student progress, instructional organization, and student coping strategies and expectations. It also discusses the study's implications for admissions, curricular decisions, assessment, articulation, grading, and staffing. The report's second section presents detailed findings. Chapter I discusses the selection of the two community  college sites involved in the study, Chapter II considers student services, and Chapter III examines attrition from the perspective of student paths through the program. In Chapter IV, developmental programs are reviewed, with emphasis on reading skills and instruction. Mathematics assessment and instruction and math anxiety are examined in Chapter V, while Chapter VI considers English assessment and instruction, tutoring, technical writing, and general issues related to transfer courses. Chapters VII, VIII, and IX study literacy demands; text use; and job preparation in three vocational programs. The learning resources center is considered in Chapter X. A readability analysis of commonly-used texts and instructor comments are included in the appendices. (KL)",

The report looks back over four years of the AB 3059, reviews the goals of that legislation, and measures the program's accomplishments against those goals. In early 1976, the Governor's office set forth its proposal for the growth of child development programs in the state. At the same time, parents and providers indicated the need to broaden the system delivering those services. The results of these efforts was AB 3059, which included a $10 million appropriation for new child care programs. The purposes of AB 3059 were to (1) test cost-reducing features and delivery methods, (2) promote parental choice, (3) address unmet  geographic needs, (4) encourage community level coordination, and (5) offer replicable features. The $10 million was devoted to the following areas: family day care homes and networks, center-based group care and innovative programs, vendor payments, resource and referral programs, minor capital outlay, support to the Governor's Advisory Committee on Child Development Programs, program administration, and an independent comparative evaluation of the AB 3059. Following an assessment of the strengths and the unanticipated rewards in each of the above areas, the report details the many ways in which the AB 3059 experience informed and shaped Senator Sieroty's SB 863.

        "author":["Sponseller, Doris Bergen"],
        "description":"This document examines how societal values regarding child care provision in the United States have influenced past and present child care policies and discusses how these values may affect future policy formation. In Part I, the development of child care policy is outlined in terms of five historical periods, each of which is analyzed along the dimensions of responsibility, control, scope, and quality. Pre-1909 is characterized as a period in which national recognition of public child care needs was minimal. During the period 1909 to 1932 attention paid to the welfare of children and families led to the enactment of modest national legislation which affected child care. From 1933 to 1946, child care programs were established for specific purposes of limited duration. The years  1947 to 1960 witnessed no national support for public funding of child care. From 1960 to 1980 national responsibility and control of child care programs increased, and enactment of policies for specific groups influenced legislative attempts to extend child care support to a broad group of children. In Part II, the question of whether government should assume a long-term responsibility for child care provision is addressed in terms of potential policy directions, the policy-making process, and those individuals and groups who are influential in directing policy formation. In conclusion, directions which child care policy might take during the 1980s are suggested. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"This report presents an evaluation study of the Recorded Telephone Message Project which used teacher-recorded telephone messages as a means of encouraging parents to help their children learn basic skills. Each week for 31 weeks, three third grade and three fourth grade teachers from an elementary school recorded a 2- to 3-minute telephone message which recapped the week's classroom work on basic skills. The message also gave parents suggestions for home activities as well as a telephone number to call if they wished to arrange a meeting with the teacher or procure supplementary teaching materials. Data for the evaluation were collected through a questionnaire mailed to parents, 47 per cent of whom returned it. Evaluation results included the following: the project was  implemented consistently and with a relatively high level of use; most of the parents who returned questionnaires reported using the telephone service with some frequency, and using at least five activities to improve children's basic skills; nearly all of these parents were satisfied with the project; achievement scores of students in the telephone classes did not differ from students' scores in non-telephone classes; and of the students in the telephone classes, a direct relationship between students' achievement scores and frequency of telephone usage was found for third graders only. Recommendations are given to strengthen teacher-parent links in a telephone message project. Appendices include the parent questionnaire and a list of parents' comments about the project.

Twenty-four preschool children participated in the experiment. The stimuli used in these problems consisted of planometric geometric forms with seven values on each of the visual dimensions of color and form. Children were first overtrained on a two-choice simultaneous discrimination problem and subsequently were tested on a series of new problems. Prior to testing, trials of the previously overlearned problem were interpolated between the training and test trials. Also, to maintain attention to the originally trained cue and to test for its maintenance, three  trials of the overlearned problem were presented between new problems. The new problems used in the test trials were of two types: those in which the correct cue value was on the same dimension as the original problem, necessitating an intradimensional shift in attention, and those in which the correct cue was on a different dimension from the original, thus involving an extradimensional shift. Each child received a total of eight, two-trial problems: four intradimensional and four extradimensional and interpolations in between, for a total of 54 trials. Results indicate that preschool children performed better when an extradimensional shift was called for than when an intradimensional shift was required. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Discriminant analysis was used to explore the influence of the relative ages of siblings on their dyadic interactions, and to explore which interaction behaviors might discriminate among families and among interaction situations. Six dyadic interaction situations of 30 minutes duration were observed among members of 12 normal families. The observations took place in the families' homes once a week for five consecutive weeks. The interaction situations consisted of (1) child-directed interaction with mother, (2) child-directed interaction with father, (3) child-directed interaction with older sibling, (4) mother-directed interaction, (5) father-directed interaction, or (6) sibling-directed interaction. The Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System was modified in order to  record the interactions of the target child with mother, father, or older sibling. This modified coding system provided a frequency count of 34 discrete positive and negative behaviors which may occur between parent/sibling and target child during play. Observations were made by two researchers who independently and unobtrusively recorded behaviors at 1-minute intervals while subjects played with a standard set of toys. Results of the discriminant analysis indicated that interaction situations could be correctly classified 89 per cent of the time based on the linear combination of six behaviors: three parent/sibling behaviors (identified as Acknowledge, Unlabeled Praise, Descriptive/Reflective Question) and three child behaviors (identified as Compliance to Direct Command, Whine, and  Child Change Activity). A combination of five behaviors correctly classified family groups 87 per cent of the time (Child Change Activity, Child Whine, Descriptive/Reflective Question, Unlabeled Praise and Child Laugh). Implications for future normative studies are discussed. (Author/RH)",

Finding time to communicate with parents is difficult for most educators. The telephone provides a form of communication which is effective, requires minimal expenditures of time and energy, and allows certain kinds of information to be communicated well. Access to and availability of phones characterizes telephone communication in the United States. As such, phone communication can be established practically instantaneously with a parent. Telephone communications allow teachers to receive immediate feedback from parents and to engage in two-way interaction. Many adults are at ease over the phone but not with other forms of interpersonal communication. In the early  part of the school year when parent-teacher relationships are beginning to develop, telephone contact reduces tension. Telephone limitations include such features as parents' expectations to hear bad news, lack of parent time to prepare, phone calls made at inconvenient times for the parent, and language barriers which hinder phone communication. Homework discussions and emotional issues are better discussed through means other than telephone conversations. (The document concludes with ten guidelines for telephone communication with parents.)

        "description":"Information about children's behavior in preschool and about the preschool program interests parents and provides them with useful information. Preschool teachers should make every effort to share their knowledge with parents whenever possible. How to communicate various types of information presents a major difficulty for teachers. Some information is personal (e.g., a child's misbehavior), whereas other information is public (e.g., the highlights of the week's activities). The use of a variety of written communications provides effective techniques for sharing these different types of information with parents. Written communications frequently take less teacher time and energy than do other methods of communication. Some teachers express themselves more clearly in writing than  through other modes of communication, and thus often find writing a more effective method of communication. Parents benefit from written communication for various reasons. For example, they are better able to reflect on what is being said and they are able to schedule a time to read when they will not be distracted by their children. Types of written communication include notices, notes, letters, newsletters, pamphlets, and brochures. Each technique possesses strengths and limitations. For example, their one strength is that teachers can employ individual styles when using these techniques. When carefully planned, written communications help build more meaningful parent-teacher relationships. (Author/DB)",

Assessment findings are given in this document. Overall, provider practices exceeded state licensing standards and compared favorably with or exceeded the proposed federal requirements. Many centers permitted parent participation in general program policy making, informed parents about their children, and allowed unlimited observation. For all but children under 2 years of age, Title XX funded centers maintained average group sizes smaller than federal maximum limits and state licensing standards. Most centers provided orientation to caregivers.  Nearly all provided snacks and lunches, and around 75 per cent provided breakfasts. Centers required immunizations and health assessments even in states without such requirements. All states had fire and sanitation codes for centers and most states had codes for homes. Nearly all centers provided social services information and assistance. Continued assistance is suggested regarding training, health and social services information systems, parent involvement, and group size. (Author/DB)",

The investigation of the family day care systems was based on interviews conducted with staff of 22 systems, both in the National Day Care Home Study sites and elsewhere. Chapter I discusses federal and state involvement in family day care. Regulations and funding at sites in California, Pennsylvania,  Texas, Massachusetts, and Arkansas are described. Chapter II describes the operation of a family day care system from its inception to the selection of child care providers and delivery of special services to children and parents. The responsibilities of providers, services to providers, exclusive use agreements and the status of sponsored providers are discussed. Chapter III presents descriptive data on program and cost characteristics. Functional cost allocations, supplemental services and in-kind contributions as well as direct child care costs versus administrative costs are reported.

        "description":"A review of existing stress and coping models and an analysis of the distress caused by childhood cancer suggest that a broader conceptualization of coping that includes &quot;pleasure management&quot; is needed. Presently, successful coping is identified as the employment of strategies which allow the individual to adapt to stress. Traditional stress management models appear to be exclusively concerned with adjustment to high levels of negative affect and ignore the dimension of positive affect. Research findings, however, reveal an additional, distinct and independent dimension of the coping process that can be called &quot;pleasure management.&quot; This dimension consists of parents' attempts to counteract the depression and anxiety evident in the stressful situation of their severely ill  children. Such attempts enable parents to continue functioning in their caregiving and associated roles. This conceptualization of stress management and pleasure management as independent dimensions rests on empirical work which investigates the structure of mood and psychological well-being. Results of these investigations indicate that positive and negative affect is related to mood, anxiety, depression, and major dimensions of personality. (Author/RH)",

A total of 374 companies participated in the corporate survey by answering four-page questionnaires. Additionally, two-career couples were recruited for participation in a survey through announcements in selected magazines and through a nationally syndicated United Press International column. Of the more than 2,000 couples who volunteered, 815 qualified for the couples survey. (To qualify for participation the wife had to have a career in the business community.)  Wives and husbands answered virtually identical sets of questions, each of which was six pages in length. Results of the surveys and implications for corporations and couples are discussed.

Twenty-four male and 24 female 12-month-old infants and their mothers were videotaped at a laboratory in the Ainsworth-Wittig strange situation and in a series of subsequent situations designed to provide opportunities for distinguishing between levels of maternal responsiveness. In the last of these, a questionnaire situation designed to measure maternal responsiveness, each mother-infant dyad was filmed for 3 minutes in the same room where the mother was asked to fill out the questionnaire and the infant was allowed to explore the room. The room did not contain toys and as such the children could not occupy themselves with  toys. Each mother was also told to feel free to interact with her child in any way she liked during this situation. Before leaving the laboratory mothers were asked to complete a toddler temperament scale. Strange situation behavior was scored for proximity and contact seeking, contact maintaining, resistance, and avoidance behavior in accordance with guidelines provided by Ainsworth. Measures of maternal responsiveness to infant behavior in the questionnaire situation were based upon maternal vocalization and touch following infant attentional demands. Results are discussed. It is concluded that the measures designed to assess maternal responsiveness developed in this study, while needing further refinement, appear to be a promising tool for the study of maternal behaviors related to  attachment.

The questions addressed were: (1) What cognitive processes do students use during direct instruction? (2) How are students' aptitudes, including ability and attitudes, related to their reported cognitive processes during direct instruction? and (3) How are students' cognitive processes during direct instruction related to later achievement and attitudes? Videotapes of teacher and student behavior and classroom observations were made while each class of 12 students was taught a  two-day lesson on probability. The teaching followed the direct instruction model and included review, development, controlled practice, and seatwork segments. After the lesson, students were interviewed about their thought processes using a &quot;simulated-recall&quot; procedure, and tested to assess their achievement of the basic concepts and skills taught in the lesson as well as their attitudes toward mathematics. Results showed that, independent of student ability, students' reports of their understanding of the lesson were significantly related to achievement. Moreover, students who reported using specific cognitive strategies did better on the achievement test than students who did not report using such strategies. (Author/RH)",

Section II provides demographic data from each of the three PCDC sites and brief descriptions of the locus of each program. The demographic data includes the ethnic characteristics, family structure, education and economic levels, age ranges, and recruitment procedures of program participants. Section III highlights the overarching goal for the three projects as well as the specific program goals of each project. Common across the projects were the goals for mothers to improve their  self-concepts, improve their efficacy as teachers and parents, and increase their knowledge of child development, behaviors, and discipline. The theoretical constructs implemented in the three projects and the assumptions underlying these constructs are presented in Section IV. Consistent across the three projects were the development of a set of assumptions related to child development, the mother-child relationship, the family, and the surrounding community. Finally, Section V provides an overview of the three projects in terms of their content focus and delivery, support systems, defining features, parameters of intervention, patterns of staffing, methods of program delivery, evaluative measures, and curriculum materials.

        "description":"Cherokee students at the Qualla Boundary started a student organization in 1973 to improve educational prospects among Native Americans attending non-Indian colleges and universities. Because cultural conflict was perceived as playing a crucial role in the failure of Cherokee students in higher education, a major objective of the group was to research their own Cherokee culture. Students talked with traditional elders, corroborating all information. Special classes were set up to encourage additional student involvement. Many of the articles in this book are a direct consequence of that self-initiated search for traditional roots. Part One centers on historical and contemporary views of the Cherokee people, with emphasis on education, tradition and change, and contemporary social  issues. Part Two features stories on Cherokee Heritage and Folklore by Carl Lambert (Cherokee historian); provides sections on Cherokee poetry, arts and crafts, and excerpts from the &quot;Cherokee One Feather&quot; (official Tribal newspaper); and concludes with profiles of the Cherokee researchers, many of whom now have their degrees and are teaching in the reservation schools or working in the areas of law, health, and social welfare.

        "description":"As late as 1938 there were 200,000 one-room schools scattered throughout the United States. By 1978 there were little more than 1,000 in operation. Primary-source research on rural education has now been conducted by 23 researchers in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming, sponsored by the Mountain Plains Library Association and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Using information from oral histories, treasured mementoes, speeches, newspapers and other published sources, school records, songs, and photographs, this volume presents historical vignettes of many aspects of rural education from the late 1800's to 1980. Chapters focus on: country school architecture; elements of country school success (sample diploma,  examination questions, games, class pictures); teachers (their role, rules, restrictions, salaries, training, certificates); the major role played by rural schools in imparting American culture to immigrants; the multi-purpose role of country schools as community centers used for voting, dancing, card-playing, socializing, debating, church, weddings, funerals, and civic meetings; and present day contributions, implications, and trends for the country school. The addresses of Country School Legacy Archive Repositories where additional materials may be sent are listed. (NEC)",

Phase II involves gathering documentation on the  topics of: country schools as historic sites; country schools as community centers; country schools and the Americanization of ethnic groups; reading, writing, 'rithmetic, and recitation; teachers: their roles, rules, and restrictions; and country schools today. Phase III concentrates on completion of oral histories and production of booklets, brochures, discussion guides, slide-tape shows, and a movie to create a traveling exhibit for each state. The project culminates in Phase IV with the presentation of the project's efforts in the form of public programming and discussion-seminars at the 188 participating libraries. (NEC)",

The report concludes that &quot;until recently, the country school has been too  close to recent events to be viewed as 'historic' by most people.&quot; It is difficult to make sweeping statements about country schools today. They vary in size, enrollment, type of community, and financial resources. Country teachers are better educated than their predecessors and somewhat better paid; however, they still perform duties ranging from janitor work to snake killing. Country schools still serve as community centers, but that function is less important than in the days of poorer transportation. (Author/NEC)",

Data and anecdotes obtained through interviews, school records, published accounts, and visits to abandoned and existing school sites are presented under six chapter headings: Nebraska country schools as historic sites; Nebraska country schools as community centers; teachers; the 3 Rs (curriculum); early ethnic education (the role of the school in the Americanization process); and Nebraska country schools today. The first school in Nebraska is identified as a log  structure built outside the walls of Fort Atkinson in 1822. For over a century Nebraska's schools have provided rural neighborhoods with a sense of community because they were the one place where all could gather for meetings, school programs, and social occasions. According to the feelings of one person interviewed, the present administrative policy of reorganizing country schools with city schools, rather than consolidating them into larger, but still rural, schools is responsible for the diminished role of the country school today.

The two groups were studied by comparing known aspects of the educational system which might be indicative of differing national attitudes, aspirations, and achievements: the variance in physical plants, teacher and school personnel, school classifications, outside observer assessments, parental support, and student performance. A small school composed of both Germans and Norwegians was analyzed. Reports of more recent educational records were  assessed. An historical survey of the background in Russia and Norway prior to emigration was made. Analysis of the varying educational attitudes and achievements of North Dakota's two largest ethnic groups, the Germans from Russia and the Norwegians, indicated that, when seen as a whole, the German-Russians in the counties and schools studied were decidedly less interested, less supportive, and less involved in the state's educational enterprises until after World War II.

        "description":"To most settlers in rural North Dakota, the community was the universe, and the rural school served as a community center. The Christmas program was a universal favorite in rural schools, but it was only one of several programs for the public. Local customs, ethnic backgrounds, and a particular teacher's fondness for a holiday or season gave individual schools some unique programs. School picnics were a feature of the last day of school in many rural communities, and basket socials were a favorite form of social entertainment and fund raising. In addition to school functions that attracted the community members, the country school served as a meeting place for a variety of gatherings unrelated to the school. Dances were a favorite form of community entertainment held at the  school. Political parties and farm organizations also met there. Religious services were common in the schools in the years before various denominations had constructed their own churches. Although almost all of the country schools had been eliminated by the 1960s, the sense of community in many of those old rural school districts remains alive, part of the country school legacy.

        "description":"In North Dakota, the schools played the major role in imparting American culture to the immigrants who by 1920 numbered 67% of North Dakota's population, but rural schools were not ideally suited to the task. The immigrants tended to cluster in nationality groups in geographic areas of the state, giving communities distinct ethnic identities. The largest ethnic groups were comprised of Germans from Russia and Norwegians. The inability of teacher and immigrant student to communicate led to humorous, and occasionally traumatic, incidents. Although children struggled to use English in school lessons, they reverted to their native language when out of school. Some county superintendents, recognizing that students would learn English more rapidly if forced to use it on the playground,  instructed teachers to forbid the speaking of any foreign language at school. Memorization and repetition were commonly used to teach English. Some schools also offered classes in English to adults. In addition to teaching English, the schools were charged with the responsibility of inspiring patriotism in the immigrants. Some immigrants retained strong cultural ties with the old country and viewed Americanization as corruption of traditional values. Many did not value education for their children. However, in time, the rural school Americanized the immigrants' children. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"Teacher duties and curriculum developed by North Dakota, in deciding what role teachers would play in the community and what standards of conformity and propriety would be applied to teachers, mirrored certain aspects of the local culture and reflected a wider national culture. The inclusion of health studies reflected the local majority concern about the use and abuse of alcohol and other narcotics. The teacher was obligated to keep a Teacher's Register which contained the teacher's lesson plans, student records, and a visitor's log, among other things. A number of restrictions were placed on teachers' private lives by the communities which hired them. In general, women teachers received lower salaries than men. The extent of the difference was often determined by the attitude  of the ethnic community in which the teachers worked. Teachers also subsidized education, especially during the Depression, by accepting warrants (promises by a school board to pay a stated amount when money became available); they often had to wait for some of their salary even if money was available. Teachers were required to &quot;up-grade&quot; their academic training by attending Teacher's Institutes. Sometimes, salaries were affected by how many additional tasks the teacher was willing to perform, especially janitorial work. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"Country schools were important in the growth and development of North Dakota. While most of the early schools were constructed of wood, some were constructed of stone, sod, or logs. Standardization was established by 1915, and the white framed one-room school was duplicated in every township of the state until the end of World War II. A former student described his school as a simple frame structure about 20 by 30 feet; a barn and outhouses were on the schoolgrounds; inside, the school was equipped with desks for the children and teacher, a pot-bellied stove, and a bucket of water and dipper. The number of one-room schools dramatically decreased between 1945 and 1961, from 3,043 to 817 actually in session. Although consolidation of rural schools in North Dakota was largely  postponed between the World Wars, its basic thrust was established by 1918. Neil Macdonald, with 25 years' public school experience, was consolidation's foremost advocate. Recommendations made in 1912 by a newly formed Rural School Commission formed the basis of much state legislation over the next two decades. William Langer, a state's attorney, provided leadership in educational law enforcement. The one-room school and the consolidated country school served North Dakota's educational needs for decades.

        "description":"The state superintendent, the county superintendent, and the one-room school teacher each contributed to classroom instruction in North Dakota. In 1895, the &quot;School Text Book Law&quot; provided for free text books and school supplies for all pupils; however, the law was not mandatory. Specific courses of study and elaborate handbooks on all subjects became common publications of the State Department of Public Instruction by the 1920s. Long periods of adjustment were necessary to balance grades, classes, and time when students in one-room schools were divided into classes one through eight (daily programs for 1901, 1908, 1918, and 1928 are included). Efforts of county superintendents of schools like Mattie Davis (1896) to initiate programs for teachers and students resulted in improved  education. Teaching of patriotism and moral values was integral to the curriculum. In 1927, the state legislature passed a law requiring the conspicuous posting of the Ten Commandments where classes convened. Great emphasis was placed on phonics and penmanship. A former student, Ross Bloomquist, recalled that teaching materials he remembered from his school days included a dictionary, a globe, and a case of maps. Leila Ewen, a former teacher, recalled some unexpected teaching aids derived from the farm character of the land. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"As revealed in personal interviews, periodicals, published and unpublished manuscripts, and school records, the teachers were the key factor in bringing education and culture to the frontier that was western South Dakota. Many teachers were girls of 16 or 17, inexperienced, hired from states to the east (Minnesota and Iowa), sight unseen. Beginning in 1862, teachers were required to be certified by taking examinations in reading, writing, geography, grammar, spelling, and arithmetic. Supplies and equipment were limited; there was usually a blackboard, a recitation desk, desks for children, a teacher's desk and chair, maps, sometimes a globe and piano or organ, and always a water pail and dipper. School books were furnished by the pupils so there was no uniformity in textbooks. At  school the teacher was janitor, superintendent, principal, playground supervisor, office girl, producer and director of programs, and organizer of community picnics and social events. Social restrictions required that teachers observe a nightly 11:00 P.M. curfew. Living conditions provided little privacy or comfort; many teachers boarded with school families, sharing rooms with one or more of their pupils. Some teachers stayed in the schoolhouse, living out of a suitcase and sleeping on a fold-up cot. (NEC)",

Rural school buildings are discussed in the broad social and historical context that shaped their form and style. Both national trends in rural school design and the state's economic and political environment are considered. The use of the schoolhouse for activities other than teaching is described as it varied according to the size of the community it served, its remoteness from a village or town, the existence of a church, and the standards of the community as to what was acceptable social activity in a schoolhouse. The origin, age, sex, education, experience, wages, and  conditions of employment of teachers in country schools and their methods of maintaining discipline are traced. Aspects of the rural school curriculum, typical teaching methodologies, time spent in school, and the Young Citizens League are outlined. Aspects of the rural schools' role in the assimilation of the children of immigrant ethnic groups into the majority culture (English as the language of instruction, efforts following World War I, and Hutterites) are explored.

Samples of curriculum, courses of study, daily schedules, tests, textbook accession records, and rules of spelling are included. Descriptions of dedicated teachers, community spirit, drive and determination of  immigrants, and an atmosphere of friendship and caring are used to illustrate how the schools participated in the Americanization of ethnic groups. Information about the 39 rural schools still operating in southeastern South Dakota during the 1980-81 school year is summarized.

        "description":"With the goal of improving citizenship and character education in the elementary school child through learning by doing in the form of a school-based club, the Young Citizens League (YCL) appeared in rural South Dakota early in the twentieth century, introduced by Michael M. Guhin and developed by E.C. Giffen. By 1930, at its peak, it had an estimated 75,000 members in 4,000 chapters. Following its motto &quot;Help Uncle Sam&quot; and through its standing committees for Information and Programs, Health and Sanitation, Physical Training, and Patriotic Aid, the YCL focused on patriotism, personal health, and doing things each day to help the country. Beginning in 1926-27, state-wide projects were recommended to local chapters and included endeavors such as beautifying school grounds;  recataloging, reconditioning, and building up school libraries; music appreciation and the purchase of musical instruments; art appreciation and placing good pictures in classrooms. Beginning in 1926-27, the YCL became an official state program, supported by budget appropriations. However, most project money was raised through club efforts such as traditional box socials. Annual student speech and essay contests offered trips to county and state conventions for winners. Although officially prohibited, YCL members were often enlisted by teachers for janitorial work.

        "description":"As an examination of the role played by rural schools in the history of the Wyoming frontier and the result of an effort to locate and preserve information related to country schools, this report is part of an eight-state research effort. Periodicals, unpublished manuscripts, school records and interviews with 19 Wyoming residents reveal details about Wyoming country schools as community centers, as historical sites, as part of the Americanization effort for ethnic groups, and as part of the current educational system. These sources also provide accounts of country school teachers (their training, roles, rules, and restrictions) and rural school curriculum, focusing on reading, writing, arithmetic, and recitation. &quot;The most impressive thing about the interviews and documents  gathered for this report is the sense of accomplishment these early teachers felt. They believed their schools belonged to them and that their dedication and work was repaid by the community in a kind of respect and trust that is lacking in the profession today. They are remembered with love and respect by both student and community. Nostalgia can dim the harsher aspects of rural school life in Wyoming, but the claims made for it by its former students appear to be sincere.&quot; (Author/NEC)",

The report focuses on six aspects of the country school experience: schools as historical sites, schools as community centers, teachers (their roles, rules and regulations), curriculum (reading, writing, arithmetic, and recitation), the school's role in the Americanization of ethnic groups, and the country school today. Two examples illustrate the continuing challenges of rural education in southern Wyoming. From the Laramie county superintendent in 1883: &quot;Found School ...  held in a tent with board placed on nail keg for seat. The teacher is supplied with a good table, globe, dictionary and fractural supplies. Mr. J.W. McClure is a faithful teacher though working under difficulties.&quot; In 1981 the State Department of Education believes several techniques must be &quot;considered for continuing and strengthening rural education. These include ... increasing community involvement in rural schools; developing strong pre-service and in-service programs; conducting research on the stress of rural teaching and how to stem the high rate of turnover.&quot; (NEC)",

The report addresses six aspects of rural education: country schools as community centers, country schools as historical sites, country schools and the Americanization of ethnic groups, the country school curriculum (reading, writing, and arithmetic), teachers (their roles, rules, and restrictions), and the country school today. Because northwestern Wyoming was settled in the early part of the twentieth  century primarily by people who were second or third generation Americans, naturalization of immigrants took place in the home, influenced by the children and the home visits of teachers. Although the early schools had many shortcomings, individuals today attest that the curriculum was as good as the teacher and the student, and that teachers managed to pass on a love of learning which was more important than the subject itself.

        "description":"The country school legacy of Wyoming is rich in history, folklore, and tradition. Materials (many anecdotal) gathered from school records, oral histories, autobiographies, and memoirs provide glimpses into the diverse and demanding role of frontier teachers (who were mostly female and, by contract requirement, usually single) and the work and leisure centered around the country schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. An accurate look at Wyoming reveals a frontier that ended by 1890 with the widespread presence of country schools providing roots and a sense of community. The 1890 Wyoming school census lists 16,291 students, aged 5 to 20. A 1915 survey records 63 brick or stone schools, 141 log or sod schools, 331 frame schools, and 22 teachers who did not answer the  question. Recollections indicate teachers were involved not only in instruction but in janitorial work, rounding up stray cattle, extinguishing prairie fires, and assisting with haying. Tales show the school buildings, centrally located to keep travel distance equal for students, becoming the natural center for community life, serving as voting centers, town halls, churches, dance halls, and even the place in which to perform an autopsy.

During August 1979, questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 120 university extension personnel and 14 Black Land Grant (1890) college and university extension personnel. Each subject was asked to select 10 persons outside of extension who were knowledgeable about CRD work, and to include on the list one person each from banking, local government, local media, and the County Extension Council. Different questionnaires were mailed  to the extension personnel and to the knowledgeable persons. Field staff provided evidence of community changes resulting in part from projects and also provided estimates of the likelihood of positive and negative consequences for client/audiences. Knowledgeable citizens also provided an evaluation of projects and of the extent to which citizens had been involved in co-producing projects. External data obtained from knowledgeable citizens clearly complemented the data obtained from CRD field staff. Appended tables summarized the findings. (CM)",

The respondents were: young (averaging 27 years old), poorly educated (averaging 7.43 years of schooling), low socio-economic status ($666 average monthly household income), married (66%), mostly of Mexican origin (80%), and recent immigrants (85% being first generation Hispanics, i.e. born in Latin America). Results indicated the younger the women at the birth of their first child, the more children they had and desired. Those with fewer years of schooling had larger families. The best predictor of a woman's  desired family size was her perception of her spouse's desired family size, indicating the powerful influence men appear to have and suggesting that men should be involved more actively by family planning providers. Being born in Latin America was positively associated with larger desired family size. The value placed on children by these Hispanic women and their husbands appeared to be a major factor in their higher fertility rate, a value formed by their culture, yet subject to acculturative influences.

The program included a seven-unit course syllabus to be taught in two 2-week sessions, with a 2-week career education work session between them. Each senior student was given a career education experience with someone whose work corresponded to the student's tested and self-identified occupational interests. Of the 30 statements/objectives targeted for positive, statistically significant growth following the 1980-81 LCEM classes in rural and  occupational experiences, 24 were significant at one of three confidence levels; 23 of the 24 statistically significant statements/objectives displayed positive growth. During the project's three years, 49 of the 90 statements/objectives targeted for positive attitudinal growth were significantly positive at one of the three levels of statistical confidence; four displayed statistically significant negative growth. Comments from participating students, their photographs, and senior year work experiences are included.

Information was gathered on 10 &quot;significant others&quot; grouped into 5 types: (1) ego--influence of self; (2) family--parents and relatives; (3) friends; (4) educators--guidance counselors, teachers, and principal; and (5) others--clergymen, state employment officers, and &quot;other&quot; adults. Respondents were asked to indicate the degree of influence that each significant other exercised on choice of high school curriculum and post-high school plans. Data indicated that students perceived teachers, guidance counselors, and school principals as having less impact on curriculum and post-high school  plans than parents and friends. Family influences were the most salient. Status differences among farm youth did not explain most of the variation in the relatively small influence of school personnel on curriculum choice and future plans. Variations were only weakly predicted by ability. However, some variation by status did appear for specific post-high school activities. Farm youth of higher status backgrounds were more highly encouraged to continue college studies while those of lower status were more highly encouraged to take vocational/technical courses.

The 1959 novel &quot;Pocho&quot; contained one reference to a belief. In the 1967 poem &quot;I Am Joaquin&quot; were references which suggested the influence of legend. Two folk beliefs appeared in the novel &quot;Chicano&quot; (1970). One selection in the anthology &quot;The Chicanos&quot; (1971) featured four folk beliefs. The 1972 novel &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; presented the reader with the greatest number and most skillful use of folkloric motifs, as well as witchcraft, curses and a legend from the Indian heritage of New Mexico. The anthology &quot;Aztlan&quot; (1972) contained references to legends about Joaquin  Murrieta and la Llorona, a ghost. Another anthology, &quot;Mexican-American Authors&quot; (1972), contained only two examples of legends. Two legends appeared in another anthology, &quot;Songs &amp; Dreams&quot; (1972). Three beliefs and legends were found in &quot;Yearnings,&quot; a companion anthology. Some excellent beliefs and legends appeared in the anthology &quot;We Are Chicanos&quot; (1973). The novel &quot;Heart of Aztlan&quot; (1976) was an excellent source of New Mexican folklore. The novel &quot;Tortuga&quot; (1979) contained several beliefs and mentioned la Llorona. (Author/CM)",

A pre-workshop survey identified topics and issues to be addressed and resource speakers, panel presenters, and materials. Keynote speaker Dr. Jerry Fletcher recommended political advocacy as an effective method for focusing attention on the need for early childhood special education in rural areas. Concurrent sessions offered a variety of topics including: successful practices in securing funding; stress on rural service providers; establishing community communication and awareness; securing funding for rural programs;  assessing parent needs and planning intervention programs; influencing decision makers; cost-effective delivery strategies; recruiting staff for rural areas; interagency coordination; interagency troubleshooting; transportation problems. Issues generated during the concurrent small group presentations fell into six categories: direct service delivery; interagency coordination; funding and policy decisions; training and staff-related concerns; parent/family involvement; and working in the rural community. Workshop evaluation results indicated purposes were met. Appended are: Rural Workshop Interest Survey, Rural Workshop Agenda, List of Participants, List of Congressional Rural Caucus, HCEEP Rural Resource Directory, and Rural Workshop Evaluation Questionnaire.

        "description":"Farmers and their families continue to provide the largest proportion of agricultural labor, but hired farmworkers are increasingly supplying a greater part of farm employment. This trend is expected to continue in the eighties with the hired labor proportion gradually increasing. Better information, including crucial individual state data on numbers of farmworkers, duration of employment, and key characteristics of workers, will be needed to assess current policies and legislation. The most significant hired farm labor issues of the eighties will be: improved employee benefits and workplace protections, such as farm safety regulations, workers' compensation, social security and unemployment insurance; stability of employment and income for hired farmworkers, possibly through  agricultural worker placement programs; programs to show farm employers how to use hiring and personnel management techniques to improve labor-management relations and increase production efficiency; and the impact of technology on hired farmworkers. Currently, minority hired farmworkers, especially Hispanics, are more dependent on farmwork for income than other hired laborers in the agricultural sector. Less education and fewer marketable skills, combined with larger families, have aggravated minority farmworkers' social and economic problems. (Author)",

Data were collected from three field surveys made in the five counties. Two of the surveys described the employment-unemployment picture in those communities and included information on training and skills, both possessed and desired. The third survey determined the composition of the existing  labor force, of industries in the area, and of the opportunities for jobs and training provided by those firms. Data indicated that a large percentage of the unemployed were 25 years of age or less. That group and the early thirties age group were willing to undergo occupational training for job entry or occupational upgrading. It was recommended that the Maryland Cooperative Extension Service work with community groups to develop a career development continuum and to improve community quality of life. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"Rural sociology confronts a continuing crisis of identity because of its failure to develop a sociology of agriculture. Historically, despite an initial focus on agriculture, rural sociology became deflected to the analysis of rurality. Recent emphasis of rural sociologists on the turnaround phenomenon is symptomatic, but fails to deal with the fact that such turnaround represents the penetration of previously rural space by urban-based economic functions. Rural sociology has increased its irrelevance by failing to locate itself appropriately in the productionist oriented land grant system. It could resolve its problems, as has agricultural economics, by providing ideological justification for productionism. It could also seek to develop a new constituency for its production.  This would probably jeopardize its location in the land grant system, but probably represents the only way out of a closed and limited paradigm.

Similarly, such forecasts in the 1970s failed to anticipate shifts in the economy and in the values of the young. The current conservative mood of the country, censorship and the back-to-basics movements, civil rights and women's movements, and the reductions in federal funding are also factors beyond most English educator's foresight. Nevertheless, teacher educators must continue to help teachers anticipate and responsibly direct the  course of educational change, much of which will occur due to the increasing accessibility of microcomputers. The traditional classroom will, of necessity, give way to more flexible, individualized instructional environments, and will include electronic media and improved printed materials. All of these changes are dependent on a healthy economy, the willingness of citizens to give financial and moral support to public education, and the quality of teacher preservice and inservice programs. If teacher educators continue to ignore the potential enrichment of English teaching offered by electronic media, they will assist in making more irrelevant to public school students a subject too many already consider irrelevant.

After the students had read or viewed the excerpt they answered questions designed to test their comprehension and also the emotional impact of the two kinds of presentations. The students were also given a preliminary set of questions intended to insure that the two groups did not vary significantly in their attitudes toward viewing and reading or toward the subject matter of the script. Both groups of students received  instructions to pay attention to detail because they would be questioned afterwards. Results showed that students seemed to have stronger emotional reactions to visual presentations than to the printed word. The viewers of the videotape seemed to find the play more interesting and emotionally affecting, and a higher percentage of students actually changed opinions of the play as a result of viewing the excerpt. The findings suggest that regardless of how a teacher may respond to visual presentations, students generally find various machines to be entertaining enhancers of the written word. (HOD)",

They also learn how the editing function is handled in various work settings. As the semester progresses, the students continue to use their editing skills on one another's work. By engaging in the editing process, the students achieve the first course objective--better writing. Students also read about and write several kinds of professional documents, such as a set of specifications for bidding and a proposal. A simulated  public notice is prepared providing the students with an opportunity to learn more about layout, type selection, and copyfitting. Students also attend a demonstration of computerized literature searching and do some on-line searches with the terminal operator. The class project involves the production of an actual document for a campus department. Ethics in technical communication is handled by an ethics specialist of the philosophy department and interaction with members of the technical community is provided during a social evening, giving the students a chance to ask questions.

During the semester, four students were asked to react on tape to the comments the instructor wrote on the second drafts of their compositions and then to use those comments to write a final draft of their papers. The comments were intended to stimulate revisions that would improve the quality of the texts. However, in many cases, there were few changes and the major effect of the comments was to create dissonance in the students' minds between their perceptions of what they had written and the teacher's perceptions as a reader of the texts. The students responded to this  dissonance in a variety of ways: one attempted to resolve it by trying to follow the suggestions, some attempted to defend what they had written, while others avoided dealing with the comments by deleting the sentence, word, or section of the text in question. These responses indicated that inexperienced writers do not have the strategies with which to resolve the dissonance such teacher comments create. If teacher comments are to be helpful, they should not only indicate the problems a reader is having with a text, but also suggest strategies to help the student writer solve these problems. (HTH)",

        "description":"Departments of English and English education need to integrate concepts of career education that are based on the theory that people are constantly in the process of developing ideas about themselves in relation to their careers. Although institutions of higher education have been slow to implement career education, in recent years English educators have become concerned about career guidance for their students. In response to these concerns, their major professional associations have funded studies, produced publications, and initiated services that deal with the career-related problems of English majors. Career education programs can incorporate into existing departments of English, with the collaboration of departments of English education, both career information and career  guidance. To implement such a program, a department of English or English education would have to make modifications in administrative policies and procedures in program, community relations, and faculty development. It would also need to modify existing student personnel services, including introductory services, continuing services (such as a certified counselor, a career resource library, an internship program, or a job service), and closing services. Modifications in curriculum and instruction should include experiences that put students in touch with those people whose work is directly related to English and the communication arts. (AEA)",

The paper notes that the first two years of the project, sponsored by internal university grants and state funding, consisted of (1) workshops and training sessions of small numbers of non-English faculty in designing and evaluating writing assignments and in investigating the theory and teaching of writing, (2) a discussion series on &quot;solving the writing crisis,&quot; and (3) the establishment of a writing center. The paper also shows how the beginning of a two-year federal grant has allowed for release time for three English faculty members to work closely with faculty in other disciplines to develop writing components in content area courses. Other components of the university-wide project that are  described include summer workshops for faculty development, the training of English faculty to work on collaborative learning, peer tutor training, and writing assignment design involving reasoning and cognitive skill development.

The first chapter of the work places contemporary realistic fiction about Afro-Americans in a sociocultural and historical context, while the second chapter discusses the \"social conscience\" books that are written primarily to help whites know the condition of blacks in the United States. The third chapter reviews \"melting pot\" books that were written for both blacks and whites on the assumption that both groups need to be informed that nonwhite children are exactly like other American children--except for their skin color.  The fourth chapter examines \"culturally conscious\" books that were written for Afro-American readers and that attempt to reflect both the uniqueness and the universal humaneness of the Afro-American experience from the perspective of an Afro-American child or family. The fifth chapter presents a brief overview of the work of five Afro-American writers who have made significant contributions to children's fiction since 1965, and the final chapter summarizes the current status of children's fiction about Afro-Americans and suggests some areas yet to be covered in fictional works.

        "description":"Dreams can be used to draw students into an authentic expression of their creativity and to give them some validation for what they are as persons. A &quot;dream seminar&quot; in a writing course could have students read and discuss Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;; log, report, and discuss their dreams during the course; and explore other forms of expressive writing. The dreams would serve as a personal and cultural touchstone for the imaginative and the authentic. The public sharing of these private experiences reveals the commonality of those experiences while respecting the authenticity of the individual. There are four functions of the dream seminar: (1) it is a self-governed and self-driven class; (2) it taps creativity directly in two supportive ways, psychological and rhetorical; (3) it  yokes together the rhetorical polarity of public versus private writing; and (4) it provides student writing with validation and authenticity. Some possible problems with the dream seminar include avoidence behavior among the students, a tendency on the part of the students to consider the course &quot;silly,&quot; and the responsiblity of the teacher to balance the self-growth aspects with academic evaluations. Used properly, a dream seminar can produce a continual laboratory for examination of rhetorical responsibility and personal interaction within the context of creativity and writing that engages in the evaluation of literary culture.

        "description":"While attempting to refine and redefine the composing process, rhetoric teachers have overlooked research showing how the brain's visual and verbal components interrelate. Recognition of the brain's visual potential can mean more than the use of media with the written word--it also has implications for the writing process itself. For example, outlining is a linear, left-hemispheric, and limiting activity that may not allow a student the kind of inventive richness of right hemispheric activities such as flow charts, arrows, boxes, parentheses, Venn diagrams, and story boards. Unfortunately, many students come to class visually inhibited. One step toward teaching students the value of visuals is to present them regularly with information in a two-dimensional form. Summarizing the  data in a numerical table can be a useful exercise in abstracting information and can reveal one virtue of illustrations. Teachers should also take advantage of the similarities between the process of writing and the processes of drawing or painting. A full recognition of the brain's dual capacities not only could lead to an expanded view of composition as a visual and verbal skill but also could help to explain phenomena already recognized, such as invention and style being more right hemispheric, while arrangement may draw more on the orderly, logical left hemisphere.

        "description":"Fantasy Theme Analysis was used to examine the rhetorical clash of incongruent world views during the 1978 controversy over a gay rights ordinance in St. Paul, Minnesota. Fantasy Theme Analysis considers the individual and collective dramatizations of a group's goals, scope, and activities--the group's conceptualized reality, or fantasy theme--in evaluating the rhetorical effectiveness of the group. The three groups examined in this study and involved in the issue of gay rights in St. Paul were Citizens Alert for Morality (CAM), an antigay-rights group; St. Paul Citizens for Human Rights (SPCHR), a moderate group arguing in favor of gay rights; and the Target City Coalition, a &quot;militant&quot; gay rights group. Analysis of newspaper accounts, brochures, newsletters, broadcast  materials, and advertisements during the controversies revealed the success of CAM over the other two groups. One of the strengths of the CAM rhetoric was the extent to which positions were justified within the assumptions of the vision. In the CAM vision, allowing civil rights for gays was a fault that could have led to total destruction of the vision. To fail to show how assertions fit within the context of the proffered perspective is to fail to show how the perspective can explain reality, hence to fail to create that alternative conception in an acceptable manner. It is in this arena that both Target City and SPCHR fell short. (RL)",

All workers, 3,600 union members and 625 nonunion members, in a metropolitan postal district were surveyed. Data gathered from the more than 700 returned questionnaires revealed that affiliation behavior was the primary determinant of perceived trust in the labor union and its messages. Gender differences were also demonstrated to have a significant effect on attributions of trustworthiness, with union member males  trusting the union on all dimensions to a significantly greater degree than union member females. These findings, however, were found to vary significantly according to affiliation behavior, with no significant differences in attributions of trustworthiness for male or female nonunion members. Finally, workers' attributions of trustworthiness toward the labor union were consistently higher than their attributions of trustworthiness toward labor unions' messages.

        "description":"Listening is a crucial element in the communication process. To date, however, research efforts have been unsuccessful in identifying the proper role that listening should play in the building of communication theory. To be a legitimate part of the communication process, listening must be placed in a conceptual framework similar to those found in the human information processing literature. Such a framework divides auditory perception and message comprehension (listening) into three parts: signal processing, literal processing, and reflective processing. Signal processing in human listening begins the language processing task, in which listeners engage their language competence to understand the phonetic, syntactic and semantic characteristics of the message. This process is  brought to fruition during the next two phases of comprehension. During literal processing the listener is attempting to understand the basic meaning of the utterance while during reflective processing the listener thinks about the message, makes more extensive inferences, and evaluates and judges the speaker and the message. The way these components are activated is a function of the listening strategies employed. There is no one fixed listening strategy because listening is primarily a problem solving task (&quot;What does the speaker mean?&quot;) Future research needs to focus on the three phases of the human information processing model and on the kinds of listening strategies that people naturally employ.

Results showed that perceptions of interpersonal competence were positively related to the use of constructive message strategies in situations of interpersonal conflict. Constructive behavior was positively associated with perceptions of self-competence, other-competence, and relational competence.

        "description":"Although many women presently reject traditional roles, they continue to serve as advocates for various cultural groups that lack power. The phenomenon of &quot;new volunteerism&quot; may be an example of the advocacy that is emerging from the rejection of the caretaker role. The &quot;new&quot; volunteer may serve as board member, committee chair, and so on for nonprofit organizations such as the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). The recognition of a conflict between feminism and racism prompted the YWCA adoption of &quot;The One Imperative,&quot; which reveals a militancy that intimates a recent attitudinal change and may well reflect a change in role identification and advocacy motive. A dramatistic analysis bounded by Kenneth Burke's pentad technique (what, how, when, who, and why) is a means of  providing insights into the motive for the advocacy expressed in the Imperative. It reveals that the traditional role of caretaker, rooted in mystical philosophy, could no longer serve in its social capacity as a &quot;higher&quot; purpose for whites or for women. The demands of the transition to a new pragmatic philosophy called forth a role that better suited the identifications women were choosing and minorities were demanding. Advocacy, backed by power sharing, was the method demanded by the situation and responded to in the rhetoric of a new philosophy. The YWCA, as an organization uniquely capable of responding to the needs of women and minorities, was the only agency of its kind to do so. Its effectiveness was ensured at inception by the public nature of the act, its militant style, and its  systemized audit process. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the degree to which teachers and students share perceptions of the use of power in the classroom. The study defined five bases of power: coercive (implied or explicit punishment), reward, legitimate (assigned), referent (identification with the person in power), and expert (perceived competence). A total of 156 teachers and 2,698 of their students from grade seven through college filled out a perceived power measure, in which the teachers completed the statement &quot;I use (blank) power&quot; and the students completed the statement &quot;My teacher uses (blank) power&quot; with one of the five defined power bases. A second measure asked the subjects to rate the percentage of each of the five power bases they or their teachers used. The resulting data indicated  that both the students and the teachers felt that coercive power was less likely to be used than power from other bases. The teachers and students did not differ in their perceptions of how likely either coercive or legitimate power are to be employed; however, teachers saw themselves as more likely to use more reward, referent, and expert power than did the students. In relative terms, both teachers and students reported greater use of expert, referent, and reward power than coercive power. Students saw coercive power as accounting for a higher proportion of power use than did teachers, while teachers saw a significantly higher proportion of expert power than did the students. (HTH)",

The funding proposal calls for a new local education block grant, totalling $127 million, in the state budget. The funds are to be distributed to school districts for basic education. The regulatory changes proposed involve reducing the number of state mandates that school district officials have to follow. According to the authors, surveys of local education officials have identified 21 of the state's 50 education mandates as burdensome. The pamphlet lists the 21 items, giving for each the mandate on which it is based, the problems caused, and the recommended change. For eight mandates the authors propose  legislative changes, covering such areas as student suspensions, employee relations, and special students. Regulatory changes are suggested for four mandates, involving intramural physical education, teacher inservice training, and plans for student services and records. The authors recommend administrative changes for the final nine mandates, including planning requirements, employee certification, teacher assignment, programs for exceptional children, and curriculum guidelines.

Data were gathered through one-week site visits that included program observation, data and recordkeeping reviews, and interviews with 92 central office staffers and 199 school staff members. The 15 schools covered grade levels 5-12 and represented a variety of geographic regions, socioeconomic levels, enrollment patterns, and minority groups.  Variables examined included the percentage of minority students and staff, residential location, disciplinary code, administrative methods, and staff development activities as well as ESAA programs' duration, conceptual models, facilities, staffing, and services. The researchers identified fifteen conclusions and made four recommendations, including defining disproportionate minority disciplinary actions, developing a national system for classifying and recording disciplinary actions and a model for eliminating disciplinary discrimination, and establishing requirements for federally funded disciplinary programs.

        "description":"Principals are expected to be instructional leaders but generally lack the time and training to assume such a role. Several theories and research studies suggest alternative views of the principal's role in providing instructional leadership. Ethnographic studies of principals show that principals spend little time on evaluation, instruction, and curriculum. One researcher found that administrators at the secondary level are almost wholly concerned with discipline and leave instructional matters to the discretion of teachers. The theory of substitutes for leadership might be used to strengthen the potential for leadership in positions other than that of principal. Substitutes for leadership, as applied to education, are those factors that influence the instructional process and  render formal leadership problematic. Another approach to leadership emphasizes the provision of support functions (such as supervision and technical assistance, incentives, commitment to an innovation, or monitoring of student progress) rather than the principal's role. Some researchers envision the principal as a buffer who provides resources and maintains an orderly atmosphere. They see attempts by administrators to directly supervise teaching techniques as counterproductive. Personal characteristics give few clues to leadership ability, though some studies have found that a principal's gender may have an effect on leadership style. (WD)",

The 13 characteristics relate to the role of the principal, conventional school activities, school environment, orientation to students, causes of discipline problems, school ties to parent and community, and staff enthusiasm. Drawing further on the survey results, the third chapter summarizes 100 activities for improving school discipline, organized around eight goals: improving  problem-solving, reducing status and authority differences, increasing students' sense of belonging, promoting self-discipline, reaching more students, strengthening school-home interactions, and improving school organization and facilities. Chapter 4 provides a 110-item rating scale, the \"discipline context inventory,\" to help schools identify ways to better their discipline practices.

The author first discusses the factors leading to educational unionism, including changes in teachers' and administrators' attitudes and desires, increases in the number of educators, concentration in larger work units, decisions by teacher and administrator organizations to bargain collectively, and legal support from state laws. Economic, political, and moral arguments for and against educator strikes are considered in the second section, which examines the rational and  irrational reasons for strikes and recommends strike prevention rather than strike prohibition. In the last section the author surveys research on collective bargaining's effect on educational costs. He finds that researchers agree that unionism increases teacher salaries but disagree about its effects on salary structures, program cuts, taxes, and educational quality. The author recommends further research on unionism's causes and consequences, especially on the effects of the current educational retrenchment on unions. (Author/RW)",

The authors consider nine models grouped into two sets: goal-centered models and systems-oriented models. The goal-centered group comprises the rational-goal, management-by-objectives, functional, and cost-benefit models. The systems-oriented concepts include the systems-resources, functional-structural, managerial process, organizational development, and Likert-ISR models. The authors discuss each model's applicability to education, problems in applying the model, and the outcome variables the model uses to measure school effectiveness. Four problems in the models  are identified: (1) preoccupation with outcome instead of process variables, (2) use of deficient criteria of effectiveness, (3) lack of empirical support, and (4) lack of clarity regarding major variables. The authors propose a process-based model of effectiveness that includes variables related to organizational climate and human resources. After discussing past research designs for investigating school effectiveness, they suggest a research design that considers issues of data aggregation, sample size, and the validity of outcome criteria.

He asserts that changes must be made regarding the goal of assessment, the role of the assessors, the process of assessment, the criterion for validity, and the preparation of assessors. He further suggests that the problem with testing is neither bias, nor fairness, nor discrimination; rather, it is a problem of validity. Valid tests must be developed, he states, which are also culturally sensitive to identify the actual problems of African American children and provide them appropriate services. He singles out the System of Multicultural Pluralistic Assessment (SOMPA) as an example of testing alternatives which do not actually address the major flaws of standardized  tests. (CL)",

Each S was provided with forms containing information on 41 test or subtest scores of 9 school identified LD and 9 nonLD fourth grade students and was instructed to indicate which he/she believed were LD and which were nonLD. Accuracy and interjudge agreement confirmed the difficulty of differentially diagnosing students with learning disabilities and suggested that having information from a battery of tests does not increase  the decision maker's ability to discriminate between LD and nonLD students.

The first study established a baseline rate of teacher efficiency; the next three studies examined the effect of alternative measurement strategies on that efficiency; a final study followed up the efficiency of these teachers 1 year after training and contrasted their efficiency with the efficiency of a group of teachers who had been trained differently. Single case experimental designs and descriptive statistics were employed. Results indicated that measurement activities were time consuming for teachers at first, but that systematic procedural  changes did improve the teachers' efficiency. Additionally, the followup study revealed that teachers who were trained directly had improved their efficiency by the end of the year, while teachers trained primarily by means of manuals had reduced their efficiency. This suggested that face to face training procedures might affect initial teacher efficiency as well as improvement in efficiency over time. (Author)",

The next section, the main part of the document, examines five major questions (sample subtopics in parentheses): Should there be a mandate for special education? (arguments concerning costs and benefits, uncontrollable programs, and social consciousness); Who should be served by special education? (ages, categories, expulsion, and suspension); What special education  services should be provided? (continuum of program options, least restrictive environment); Who should be responsible for providing special education services? (joint agreements, state board of education); and How should the state regulate its interest in special education? (class size, age range groupings, due process, individualized education programs). Findings and conclusions offered include that the mandate for special education reflects a compelling state interest in equal opportunity; that clarification is needed for the concept of related services; and that the State Board of Education's current regulations and procedures are in need of immediate simplification.

Distinctions are made between suspension and expulsion, and applicable federal legislation (including P.L. 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973) is reviewed in terms of implications for free appropriate public education, least restrictive environment, due process, change of placement, and placement during proceedings. Four main issues surrounding disciplinary exclusion are considered: the relationship of the child's behavior to his/her identification as handicapped; limits to a school's responsibility to provide a free public education to handicapped students; decision making in disciplinary matters involving  handicapped students; and procedural safeguards to be used if exclusion is elected. Court cases are cited which suggest that emergency exclusion of handicapped children is permitted so long as due process is followed, but that nonemergency (or permanent) exclusion may violate the mandates for free appropriate public education. Issues not yet addressed include whether individualized education programs should regularly include disciplinary consequences and possible effects of changes in the laws or regulations.

Among the 42 areas investigated were the following: existence of policy regarding education of emotonally disturbed children, definition, student assessment, personnel, support services, special classes, teaching methods, liaison between school and other agencies, financing, and students at the Learning Assistance Centre. Recommendations from 1969 were reviewed in light of the 1981 findings. Cited among charges were that more school districts in 1981 addressed themselves to establishing policy guidelines, there is a significant increase in supervisors of special  education, over one third of the classes use behavioral methods of teaching in 1981, and more school districts assume financial responsibility for students placed in treatment centers. Appended materials, which make up one-half the document, include procedures for identification of students with special needs, policy for programs for emotionally disturbed children, descriptions of 12 programs, and a copy of the questionnaire and letter sent to each school district.

Bilingualism is defined as the production and/or comprehension of two languages by the same individual. The phrase \"minority-language children\" refers to children whose first language is different from the language of the wider community. The topic is discussed under five headings: (1) issues dealing with bilingual and bicultural education, providing for instruction in a variety of languages, psychological and educational ramifications, and a case study; (2) the historical perspective and the context for bilingualism and bilingual education at present in Canada and  in other countries; (3) a presentation of research findings and a consideration of the patterns of bilingualism and cultural identity typically developed by minority children; (4) a review of theories related to learning two languages and a formulation of a cognitive \"think tank model\" for language learning; and (5) a consideration of the practical implications of the research findings for \"heritage-language\" teachers and minority parents who are eager to promote a high level of first language proficiency. The book concludes with a summary of what is known about bilingualism and children's development. (AMH)",

The basis of the study is considered in the chapter on children as early learners, which provides accounts of children being taught to read from the age of 6 months to 4 years. The next part of the study is presented in the chapter on preschool reading and the bilingual child. Here accounts are given of how three families taught their children to read in two languages before the children entered kindergarten. It is noted that generally the parent-teacher's task consists of reading the child's wishes, inventing games to stimulate this interest, and including the child in their conversations and activities. It is also observed that  early reading seems to be related to establishing a sense of personal and social values. The final chapter uses these accounts to develop specific methods and techniques for parents who wish to guide their children to early reading in two languages. (AMH)",

It seeks to establish whether: (1) marker deletion in the noun phrase and marker deletion in the verb phrase specifically constrain each other, or (2) the system of local concord noted for the noun phrase extends to the verb phrase as well, or (3) the noun phrase and the verb phrase act independently. In addition, the study investigates whether Spanish plural marking patterns are affected by long-term contact with English. The data consist of 2,426 sentences extracted from the recorded speech of 21 Puerto Rican residents of East Harlem, New York. About half the subjects were judged to be Spanish-dominant, and the others, balanced bilinguals.  A variability of plural marking was found in conjunction with a tendency toward concord. It was also found that whether the noun phrase is inflected, uninflected or deleted has little effect on marker deletion from the verb, aside from the tendency toward concord when the noun phrase precedes the verb. With regard to bilinguals, generalization of the deletion rule to environments where its application had been comparatively infrequent was found to have an intra-systemic cause. It was not due to contact with English. (AMH)",

        "description":"This paper contends that children's failure to demonstrate predictable gains in reading ability may be attributable to the failure of the teaching program to focus on strategies involving larger and larger chunking of the language accesses. Teaching programs in reading should be constructed to develop middle-level reading skills. Such programs would call on a child's knowledge of syntax and pragmatics--a knowledge about how language is used. Incorporating pragmatics into a theory of reading aids the child's acquisition of the ability to spot implicatures, to understand what is left unsaid, to skip over redundancies, to spot the important, to skim over the unimportant, and to accomplish many other highly important cognitive processes. The development of functional language  competence is essential to reading. Functional language includes reference to context, discourse, conversation, and language use over language form. When constructing reading materials it is necessary to attend to some common misconceptions about clarity and simplicity. Among these are that (1) a limited vocabulary or limited sentence patterns yield clarity, (2) short items are better than long items, (3) repetition contributes to clarity, (4) simplicity is equivalent to clarity, and (5) Latinate vocabulary is more complex than Anglo-Saxon words.

The factors discussed are: open entry-open exit programs, the grouping of literate and non-literate students in the same class, wide age differences in the same class, and the mixing of different cultural groups. The second section outlines six sets of approaches, techniques, and activities and  describes how and when they can be used to best advantage. The approaches discussed are: (1) ice-breakers to help decrease possible feelings of inferiority or insecurity on the part of weaker students; (2) grouping according to skill abilities; (3) using aides and volunteers effectively; (4) treating each class session as an independent unit or module; (5) organizing the classroom as a resource lab; and (6) a variety of class exercises under the headings of language experience stories, strip stories, and cloze procedure. A list of selected readings and resources for activities and games completes the guide. (AMH)",

First, a plan for defining needs is outlined, which involves discussion of numbers and types of students, ways to group them, scheduling, location of the course, financing, and materials. The needs analysis also involves: (1) observing the work-site; (2) conversing with workers, noting language functions, various methods of assessing English language levels, and reading and writing skills; and (3) establishing a profile of ways in which English serves the learner/worker on the job. The second area discussed is program design, that is, a  step-by-step process for setting up the program, defining the objectives and working out activities and approaches to evaluation. The final section outlines the steps taken to develop one successful ESP course and describes methods and materials in the course as it progressed. (AMH)",

English language comprehension skills, particularly verbal comprehension, of a cross-section of new recruits were assessed at three training centers--Orlando, Great Lakes, and San Diego. In addition, relevant biographical information was gathered and used to identify the type of recruit likely to have deficiencies in verbal English comprehension. The variables considered included race and/or ethnic background, educational background, place of birth, and first language. In addition to an explanatory introduction, the report describes the testing procedures, the kinds of biographical data collected,  the results of the testing effort, and conclusions and recommendations.

        "description":"This discussion is based on the results of an earlier experiment in which four groups of deaf subjects, ranging in age of first exposure to signing from birth to over eighteen, were given lists of sentences in American Sign Language to shadow and recall immediately after presentation. It was found that in terms of overall accuracy, early learners outperformed late learners, that sentences were recalled and shadowed more accurately than scrambled sentences, and that shadowing was more accurate than immediate recall. This paper concentrates on an analysis of the errors in that experiment, since patterns of errors can give more clues as to how people process language. Three main categories of errors were classified--deletion, addition, and substitution. Addition and substitution  errors were further classified into whether they were random, repetitions, semantic, phonological, or simultaneously semantic and phonological. Groups I (native) and II (5-7) pattern very similarly in both the number of errors and in the proportion of errors in the various categories. Those in group IV (18 plus) seem lost while those in group III (13-15) pattern similarly. Sentencehood has an effect on the performance of only the first two groups. The specific task leads to differential error patterns across the same groupings. (Author/JK)",

        "description":"This paper explores the influence of field independent-dependent cognitive style on second language test performance, especially as it relates to performance on the integrative type of measure known as the cloze test. Approximately 250 college students enrolled in a first semester Spanish course formed the sample group for this correlational study. Students were administered the Group Embedded Figures Test of field dependence-independence along with several measures of linguistic, communicative, and integrative competence. The results showed student field independence to be related consistently in a positive albeit modest fashion to second language test performance. Most notable was the correlation between field independence and cloze test performance (r=.43, p. .001). The  relationship was less marked on other measures such as final course grade (r=.21, p. .001). This suggests there may be a cognitive style bias operating in conjunction with cloze test performance. That is, such measures may call forth cognitive restructuring abilities more readily available to more field independent individuals. In turn, it implies the need to use some caution when employing or interpreting cloze tests for placement or achievement purposes. (Author)",

Medium- and long-term policy issues concerning the demand for and access of British residents to higher education at the undergraduate level are reviewed by Oliver Fulton, who also outlines policies to increase demand and improve access, along with research and information needs. Recent trends in the number and characteristics of people qualifying for and beginning courses of higher education in England and Wales are examined by John H. Farrant. Martin Trow considers access from a comparative perspective, considering in particular Great Britain, which has high standards and constrained access, and the United States, which has easy access and problematic achievement. Alan Gordon  examines the range of factors influencing the educational choices of young people between the ages of 15 and 18, including social factors, the influence of school-related factors, and the effects of economic variables. Geoffrey Squires reviews factors affecting educational demand by mature students, and examines the role of policy on the demand equation. After introductory comments by Oliver Fulton, Ernest Rudd considers demand for and access to postgraduate study, full-time and part-time study, reasons for postgraduate study, and student selection. Additionally, after an introduction by Oliver Fulton, Maureen Woodhall addresses demand and access to higher education by overseas students. Bibliographies are included for the individual papers.

        "description":"The California State University and Colleges' (CSUC) Early Retirement Incentive (ERI) Program is described, and information is presented of those who retire during a three-month period with an incentive bonus of two additional years of (unearned) retirement service credit. During the eligibility period 1,047 CSUC employees retired, and it appears that from 865 to 925 of these retirements would not have occurred in the absence of the ERI program. Of the 1,047 employees who retired under the ERI program, faculty members constituted the single largest occupational group, with 416 retirees. The 169 secretarial employee retirees were the next largest group, followed by service employees and technical employees. While white males represented 49.1 percent of all full-time CSUC employees  in 1979, they comprised 59.9 percent of the ERI program participants. Most of those who retired under the ERI program indicated that the two years' additional service credit bonus was significant factor in their decisions to retire. A statistical model of retirement behavior identified four factors as the primary determinants of retirement on 1978-79 and 1979-80: age, final compensation, the value of the retirement annuity, and whether the ERI program was in effect. The total cost of funding the two years' additional service credit bonuses was $11.1 million, with $6.6 million attributable to faculty and $4.5 million to nonfaculty retirements.

        "description":"Two essays and two commentaries on leadership in higher education in the 1980s are presented. In &quot;Education Administrators and Professionals,&quot; Chris Argyris considers the decline of public confidence in institutions and professionals by elaborating the concepts of single-loop (detecting and correcting error without altering underlying values or policies) and double-loop (detection/correction accompanied by changed values or policies) learning. He proposes ways by which academic leaders may unfreeze the predisposition for the status quo that exists in single-loop learning in order to make way for double-loop detection and correction of error that involves the changing of underlying values and policies. In &quot;Managing Universities in the 1980s,&quot; Richard M. Cyert focuses on the major  problem facing academic administrators. He suggests that it is difficult for faculty to concentrate on maintaining excellence because of the struggle for institutional survival. Uncertainty will prevail with regard to how institutions will reduce their scales of operation, and university presidents will be involved to a greater degree than in the past with conflict resolution at a level of individual problems. Cyert offers strategies indicating how administrators may best manage the complex deescalation problems facing them. In &quot;Leadership: An Attempt to Look at the Future,&quot; Gene I. Maeroff summarizes the essays and analyzes discussion by participants in the 1979 Symposium on Leadership, which was sponsored by the Institute for Educational Management. A preface by Stephen K. Bailey  assesses the challenges to educational leadership in the past several decades and poses an optimistic argument for the 1980s. (SW)",

Usable responses were obtained from 546 colleges and universities, and data from responding institutions were statistically adjusted to represent the eligible national population of higher education institutions with full-time humanities faculty. In academic year 1979-80, 83,500 full-time faculty members taught in the humanities in the nation's institutions. Findings include the following: the sabbaticals awarded in 1979-80 numbered just over 5,300, approximately three percent fewer than those awarded two  years earlier; 6 to 6.6 percent of the full-time humanities faculty took sabbaticals during the three-year period; leaves without pay were granted to about half as many humanities faculty members as were sabbaticals; full-year awards accounted for slightly more than one-quarter of all the sabbaticals awarded to humanities faculty in 1979-80; full-year awards accounted for more than half of the leaves without pay granted humanities faculty in the same year; nearly all universities, 84 percent of four-year colleges, and 60 percent of the two-year colleges offered sabbaticals as of winter 1981; nearly half of the institutions that offered sabbaticals awarded them competitively; full-time tenured faculty were eligible for sabbaticals at nearly all of the institutions awarding sabbaticals;  administrative staff were eligible at about two-fifths of the institutions, and full-time nontenured faculty could receive them at 38 percent of the institutions. The questionnaire is appended. (SW)",

A total of 683 surveys were distributed and 214 usable surveys were returned, representing 202 agencies. The overall impressions created by policy leaders' responses are that the quality of education will be the leading issue for the next few years, funding for higher education is losing ground to inflation, and families will be expected to shoulder an increasing proportion of college costs. Additional findings include: overall, 72 percent of postsecondary education policy leaders expect the lag in appropriations to result in tuition increases, 71 percent anticipate maintenance deferral,  71 percent anticipate staff reductions, and 69 percent expect reduced capital outlays; state response to federal student aid cuts will be to pass along the federal cutbacks to families by requiring greater family contributions to the cost of postsecondary education; tuition levels are expected to rise roughly at the rate of inflation; and the five most important issues (not specifically tied to the next budget cycle) were identified as education quality, basic skills and remedial/development programs, physical plant update/replacement, public tuition levels, and the impact of federal student grant policy changes. The distribution of survey respondents by type of position and region is indicated, and samples of survey questions with highlights of responses to these questions are presented.  (SW)",

Contents are as follows: (1) Introduction (overview, methodology, and sample); (2) Comparisons by Disability Status, Gender, and by Disability Area (demographic characteristics, family background, high school background, college choice and freshman residence, college finances, college plans and expectations, and attitudes and values); (3) Comparisons by Disability Status, and by Level and Control of Institution (demographic characteristics and family background, high school background, college choice and freshman residence, college  finances, college plans and expectations, and attitudes and values); (4) Summary of Findings (disabled and nondisabled freshmen, profiles of the eight disability groups, and profiles of disabled and nondisabled entrants to the six institutional types, and implications). Among the findings are: disabled freshmen were somewhat more likely to register at 2 year colleges, but were represented at all types of higher education institutions; men slightly outnumbered women in the disabled group; disabled students were at a slight disadvantage vis-a-vis nondisabled students with respect to educational preparation; disabled students were more likely to possess the characteristics of \"nontraditional college students\" and to evidence less financial dependence on their parents; politically, the  disabled were less likely than the nondisabled to characterize themselves as middle-of-the-road; the disabled were more likely to live in private housing; and the disabled, despite their slight socioeconomic and educational disadvantages, had high aspirations, and tended to prefer more traditional academic fields.

        "description":"The application of constitutional principles of desegregation, derived from the context of primary and secondary education, to the postsecondary education setting, is addressed in the second of eight reports from the Postsecondary Desegregation Project at Vanderbilt University. The role of the U.S. Department of Education in enforcing the nondiscrimination provisions of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act is also examined. Attention is directed to the major Supreme Court desegregation decisions, and the controlling principles of liability in non-southern contexts are identified. A rationale to explain the Court's approach to the problem of remedying the effects of governmentally imposed segregation is developed, and postsecondary desegregation cases that have arisen in the  states of Alabama, Tennessee, and Virginia are considered. While the case law with respect to desegregation of public primary and secondary schools is rather well developed, case law with respect to desegregation of postsecondary education is rather sparse. The development of the equal protection doctrine in higher education and the federal role in assuring equality of educational opportunity under Title VI and under new program authorizations are analyzed. The three most prominent desegregation cases, which came before the courts in Alabama, Tennessee, and Virginia, involved similar factual situations: the proposed construction or expansion of an identifiably white institution within the geographical zone of competition of an existing predominantly black institution. In all three cases  the courts found that dual systems had not been fully dismantled. Federal affirmative action possibilities under properly constructed new legislation authorization (Board of Education v. Harris and Fullilove v. Klutznick) is also discussed. (SW)",

The primary data source is the \"Yearbook of Higher Education Law\"; the secondary data source was a sample of 97 college and university officials from the southeast United States. Court decisions reported in four \"Yearbooks\" were classified according to the outcome of the case, status of the plaintiff, action by the institution, and legal basis of the suit. The 97 officials, who attended a 1981 conference on Higher Education and the Law, were administered an awareness questionnaire concerning judicial developments. Contrary to the common expectation  of the administrator respondents, there has not been a dramatic growth of faculty employment decisions during the past five years. The overall level of cases has remained approximately the same. The total number of decisions averages about 40 to 45 per year. When the 40 inconclusive decisions are not considered, the overall results favor the defendant-institutions over the faculty-plaintiffs by over a 4-to-1 ratio. The respondents were evenly divided between those perceiving that the faculty had won and those perceiving that the institution had won the majority of cases. Approximately 40 percent of the decisions were based on nonrenewal and termination. The most frequent basis was procedural due process, based on the Fourteenth Amendment.

        "description":"The relationship between research productivity and teaching effectiveness was studied in 1979 and 1980 by considering faculty members at different career stages and in different academic fields. Two samples of faculty members were evaluated: 2,973 from 61 four-year institutions and 1,623 at 10 four-year colleges and universities that emphasized research productivity. Faculty administered the Student Instructional Report, which includes student ratings of teachers with regard to: course organization and planning, faculty/student interaction, communication, course difficulty and workload, textbooks and readings, tests and exams, the value of the course to the students, and the overall effectiveness of the teacher. These factors were correlated with the self-reported number of  publications for each faculty member during the most recent five-year period. For both samples, teachers of social science courses were the only group for which there were consistent though modest relationships between the number of published articles and student ratings of instructor effectiveness. Findings did not support a &quot;spill-over&quot; effect of research on teaching, or a general ability and energy factor. It is concluded that the relationship between performance in teaching and research is either nonexistent or, where it appears, too modest to indicate that one necessarily enhances the other.

        "description":"The application and impact of marketing techniques in higher education are considered, based primarily on a literature review. Literature concerning marketing in higher education, primarily in the 1970s, focused on three major themes: discussions concerning the general need to adopt marketing techniques, marketing as part of the recruitment process and academic program development, and the use of marketing in promoting the institution and its programs. Each of these major themes provided academic planners with a broad spectrum of concepts to build increasingly viable programs that in turn reinforced the institutional recruitment. Increased use of marketing strategies has had a significant impact on postsecondary institutions. The adoption of the marketing process has demanded  changes in the organizational structure of admission, registration, planning, and research offices, thus affecting administrators and staff members. In addition, marketing requires a unified approach to planning. Another impact of marketing strategies is increased awareness by institutional leaders of the true nature of \"business\" of an institution. Marketing can be viewed as a useful planning tool for postsecondary institutions. The research and analysis components, as well as the promotional aspects, provide institutional leaders with guides for planning and developing new services for students, encouraging higher student enrollment rates, and reducing attrition among the existing student populations. The costs involved in adopting a marketing process and negative reactions by  accrediting associations to hard-sell techniques used by colleges are also addressed. (SW)",

Findings include the following: whereas 41 percent of the senior class enrolled in academic programs in college in 1972, 10 percent more entered sometime between 1973 and 1976; although only 3 out of 10 of those enrolled in 1972 entered two-year colleges, 5 out of 10 delayed entrants entered two-year institutions; independent of social class, race, or ability, students who entered two-year colleges were substantially more likely to leave college without receiving a bachelor's degree by 1976 then  were those who began at four-year colleges; men were somewhat more likely to go to college than women; however, women were more likely to graduate on schedule; men were more likely to return if they had dropped out; one out of four students between 1972 and 1976 had attended college only part-time; the number of part-time students increased over time and was much higher each year in two-year colleges than in four-year colleges; among those who entered college in 1972, 46 percent had dropped out at some point by 1976, 34 percent within the first 2 years, but only 12 percent thereafter; 30 percent of all college dropouts between 1973 and 1975 had returned by 1976; and only 15 percent of the 1972 cohort had received a bachelor's degree by 1976.

The bill would provide grants to the 1890 land-grant colleges, including Tuskegee Institute, for the purpose of assisting these institutions in the purchase of equipment and land, and the planning, construction, alteration, or renovation of buildings to strengthen their capacity for research in the food and agricultural sciences. The legislation would authorize grants of $10 million in each of the five fiscal years beginning with 1981. According to testimony, the bill would help the 17 affected colleges to build a more effective capacity for agricultural  research. The 1890 institutions are historically black colleges and universities generally located in the South. Four percent of the funds to be appropriated will be used by the Department of Agriculture to administer the program. The lack of sufficient research facilities has forced the institutions to use the space provided for instruction and other campus programs, and the research capability of these institutions is not comparable to that of the original land grant institutions of 1862. The 1890 institutions have received limited state construction funds for research facilities and they were not eligible to participate in a federal facilities program in the late 1960s and early 1970s for the 1862 land-grant institutions under the Research Facilities Act of 1963.

First-year university achievement was compared for students from Ontario's Grade 13 and for students from the final matriculation year or equivalent of other Canadian provinces. University admission procedures were also studied to determine to what extent special requirements or adjustments were made for students who completed their secondary school education in different provinces. Additionally, the university achievement of the better students and the adjustment problems of all students in the first and second years of the university were examined. Four Ontario universities and two out-of-province universities that enrolled a significant number of students from Ontario were  evaluated. Findings include the following: where secondary school grades were either specified or implied as admission requirements, Ontario students were typically allowed to gain entry into Ontario universities with the lowest grades of all students, followed by students from Quebec, Western Canada, and Atlantic Canada; in the Quebec university admission requirements to the arts, science, and commerce programs equate Ontario Grade 13 graduates with year of College d'enseignements generale et professional graduates and require students from other provinces to take a qualifying year; in comparison with students from other provinces, Ontario students in Ontario universities tend to receive higher marks in engineering and do as well or better in arts, science, and commerce; Ontario students  tended to enter the university at a later age than students from all other provinces except Quebec.

        "description":"The organizational and working relationships between postsecondary education and economic development in selected states were investigated, with emphasis on identifying state-level coordinated programs in 12 geographically diverse states known to be active in linking education to economic development (Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, and Wisconsin). States neighboring Arizona (California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah) were also evaluated. Letters requesting information from state agencies preceded telephone follow-ups. It was found that most of the states utilize postsecondary education to some extent in their state-level development strategies. Only two states (Nevada and Oregon) seem  to rely chiefly on local efforts to link postsecondary education to economic development. The remaining states offer state-level coordinated programs that are discussed under the following headings: title, history, program description, administrative structure, staff size, funding, average cost per trainee, agency links, and the comparative role of Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs. None of the states had a comprehensive program linking economic development with all sectors of postsecondary education. Typically, state-sponsored training was provided by the public sub-baccalaureate sectors for entry-level jobs. Only three states made use of their public colleges and universities and in only one was private postsecondary trade and technical schools utilized. No truly  comprehensive program was identified and no state had designated a single source of occupational training information. For each of the 16 states, information is presented on program history, services, structure, and other program areas. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"The financial aspects of college loan burden are analyzed, based on the view that loan burden is a function of a borrower's capacity to repay the debt obligation. The following components of a financial model of indebtness are addressed: the stock of education loans at the time repayment begins, the repayment flow associated with each stock of loans, the borrower's earnings throughout the repayment period, and the borrower's expenditure patterns throughout the repayment period. According to the proposed model, the measure of loan burden is equal to the ratio of repayments to discretionary earnings during the repayment period. The principal determinants of the amount of debt that students incur to finance their school are the cost of schooling, financial assistance, and personal  and market risk. Consumption expenditures and their associated standards of living are used in the model to derive estimates of discretionary, or residual, earnings available to borrowers from which they can repay their loans. New empirical evidence on student indebtedness and earnings is presented as an example of what is required to compute loan burdens for various subpopulations with the model. Attention is directed to: debt data sources, earnings data sources, selection of student categories, and mathematical form of the model. Possible applications of the model to current policy issues are also examined. Suggestions to expand the model's capacity and data base and to allow it to better explore effects of federal policy changes are offered. Results of three surveys on student debt are  appended: National Longitudinal Survey of High School Seniors, Survey of Recent College Graduates, and Graduate and Professional Student Financial Aid Survey.

Input was gathered from 40 national organizations and 29 federal agencies; 20 organizations and agencies provided field test sites. The guide's chapters include (1) an introduction, (2) student information items, and (3) data management and confidentiality of postsecondary student data. Its objective is to encourage standardization in the use of terms and definitions by the numerous agencies, institutions, and organizations that provide, set policy for, support, and/or regulate postsecondary education. Postsecondary data elements are organized according to three major classification  divisions: demographic and biographical characteristics, student's educational experience, and student's employment experience. These divisions contain the information items most needed at various levels of postsecondary education organization for purposes of policy-making, or for planning, managing, operating, and evaluating postsecondary programs and/or institutions. The main divisions of the classification are also subdivided, and data elements within these subdivisions are combined with personal qualifiers to form information items that may be used to identify a person (e.g., student and family characteristics) and to describe various personal characteristics of that individual, for example. Additionally, general technical principles and procedures for safeguarding the confidentiality  of student data are considered. The 14 appendices include: information item tables, information about uses of data elements about postsecondary students, codes for states and countries, fields of study and languages, standard occupational classification system, and information about relevant legislation.

Twenty-eight faculty members, two from each department, were asked to identify evaluative dimensions for assessing chairperson performance and to provide critical/behavioral incidents that would demonstrate poor, adequate, and good performance on each of the 11 dimensions. After review by a panel, 236 incidents were identified and were rewritten into an expectations format. Forty-two faculty were asked to make two judgments for the list of items. The first judgment required categorization of the 245 items into 11 performance dimensions. The second judgment required placement of each  item on a seven-point scale based on the level of performance indicated. Seven scales that were generated were distributed to all faculty of 14 academic departments to generate primary information for a chairperson performance assessment. System application and examination of behaviorally anchored rating scale results, interviews with faculty and key administrative staff, and self-reports of chairpersons will be components of the chairperson performance assessment. Perspectives on administrative performance evaluation and features of BARS are also considered. It is suggested that the generation of BARS itself helps to clarify goals, and that its participative and collaborative characteristics help to ensure that values of the collegial body are being considered.

        "description":"The estimated fiscal impact of four federal cost reduction options for the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) Program was studied. Income and other financial strength data on current New York State recipients of guaranteed loans during the 1981-82 academic year were collected in order to assess the impact of the cost reduction proposals. Two major findings of the survey were that the GSL program serves students from a wide range of income levels, and that the financial dependency status of the typical loan recipient is the same for all institutional sectors. Findings regarding family size and structure, which affect the calculation of financial need and loan eligibility, include: the average financially dependent (two parent) loan recipient comes from a family of 4.7 members, with 1.7  members in college; and family size and the number of family members in college increase as income increases. A computer model assessed the impact of proposed policy options, using the income profiles and actual loan approval volumes for the 1981-82 academic year. A simulation of the GSL recipient population was constructed, and need analysis formulas were applied to the simulation to assess loss of loan eligibility by such characteristics as income level, financial dependency, institutional sector, and level of study. Each of the following four policy options was found to reduce the total dollar value of loans available to students: need analysis requirement for students with incomes over $30,000, need analysis requirement for all students, denial of loan eligibility for students with  incomes over $40,000, and need analysis requirement for all students and denial of graduate loans. A questionnaire is appended. (SW)",

The text of the document first sets forth a definition of team training which is meant to be a frame of reference for the authoring features later discussed. After this, several specific authoring strategies are presented which enabled the kind of lesson presentation desired by the authors. A demonstration lesson is described which was developed to quickly show PLANIT team training concepts. The rationale for  the lesson is described in the text and the lesson itself is appended as well as two other products of the effort: a set of recommended modifications to the PLANIT language designed to simplify the team authoring process, and a detailed set of authoring guidelines to help conventional PLANIT authors become &quot;team&quot; authors.

The Functional Description of the proposed AIMS was examined to identify the hardware and software packages intended for development. Stufflebeam's CIPP Model (Context, Input, Process, Product) served as the theoretical framework for the evaluation. Evaluation questions were formulated to guide the examination of the AIMS hardware/software, training management, courseware, training effectiveness, cost, and implementation/organization factors. A Milestone Chart was  prepared to indicate deadlines for the evaluation activities, and a description of the staff required to implement the evaluation plan was prepared. Draft data collection instruments were devised with the caveat that revisions would be required to tailor them to the specific software packages operational at each AIMS site. A reduced version of this plan has been prepared to evaluate the AIMS test site at the U.S. Army Field Artillery School, Ft. Sill, Oklahoma. Six references are listed, and copies of the data collection instruments are attached. (Author/LLS)",

Essentially, the algorithm searches the authority file for a record whose primary key exactly matches the test key. If an exact match is not found, the algorithm identifies records in the authority file, first with the same initial characters, or if that is unsuccessful, with similar endings. The heading is then examined to see if by making simple changes, it can be modified to match a valid record in the authority file. If no match can be found, even after modification, it is then assumed that the heading is one of questionable validity--being either a valid  heading with no corresponding record in the author file or an invalid heading containing extensive errors. The algorithm separates the subject headings into groups of valid headings, corrected headings, and questionable headings that require manual examination. Provided are one table, five figures, and 21 references. (Author/RBF)",

To determine whether slide library systems at other institutions could be adapted to the History of Art Department's needs, five systems were examined: (1) the International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House; (2) the Smithsonian Institution's National Collection of Fine Arts (NCFA) Slide and Photographic Archives; (3) the Santa Cruz Classification System; (4) the slide library of Cornell University's College of Architecture, Art, and Planning; and (5) the slide classification scheme of Stanford University's Art Department.  Based on such criteria as adaptability to machine-readable classification and the subject terminology used, the NCFA system was selected to test a sample of approximately 250 slides by assigning them to subject categories. It was found that NCFA is applicable, with some modifications, to the History of Art Department's slides of paintings, graphic arts, and sculpture. Recommendations for reorganizing the slide library include adapting general filing procedures and indexing the slides by subject.

Four online searches on topics solicited from chemistry professors in small colleges--the target group for the prompting system--were conducted by each of the 12 participants, who were divided into three groups on the basis of their prior experience. Each participant received a packet of materials introducing the project, searching, and search aids, and SDC's chemistry manual, and a slide/tape presentation was shown at the time of the test. It was found that, for novice searchers, problems in interacting with the  computer overshadowed all other concerns; semi-experienced searchers relied heavily on natural language searching; and experienced searchers focused on exploiting the structure of Chemical Abstracts within the capabilities of ORBIT. Problems with the search requests are discussed, as well as searching constraints and items peculiar to each searcher.

        "description":"In the fall semester of 1981, librarians at the Sims Memorial Library of Southeastern Louisiana University (SLU) surveyed the faculty of the university to ascertain their perceptions of the status and professional contributions of librarians. Of the 264 questionnaires sent out to faculty at the four major colleges (Business, Education, Humanities, and Science and Technology), 137 were returned completed, representing a response rate of 51.9 percent. Responses were analyzed for each major college according to the rank of the respondents (i.e., professor, associate professor, assistant professor, or instructor). The questionnaire was modeled after an instrument developed at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale (SIU-C), covered such topics as the frequency of library use by  faculty members, the importance of library collections for faculty research, the importance of librarians as assistants in research and teaching, whether or not librarians should conduct research, what type(s) of research librarians should conduct, and whether librarians should be granted full faculty status. It was found that a majority of faculty view librarians as professionals and that most of those surveyed felt that librarians should be granted faculty status. Data are presented in 12 tables, and a reference list and 1 25-item bibliography are attached. (JL)",

After introductory material outlining the history of collective bargaining in New Jersey, Section II discusses the negotiating structure which results from the bargaining autonomy of local colleges and the altered composition of bargaining teams. In Section III, substantial and increasing variations in faculty salaries are noted, as are the institutional and regional characteristics positively correlated with high faculty salary. Salaries of community college faculty are then compared to those of other educational  faculty. Section IV discusses variations in contract content among colleges and the relationship between the extensiveness of contract provisions and the level of faculty salaries. Section V reviews the administration of contracts with specific reference to grievance procedures and arbitration. Section VI examines faculty participation in college governance and notes an unstable and interdependent relationship between traditional governance mechanisms and collective bargaining. The report concludes with recommendations for stronger coordination between the colleges, counties, and state to provide broader input to local bargaining strategies.

Several alternative delivery systems are currently available to help educators and broadcasters expand their clientele and lay the basis for alliances among broadcast facilities, government agencies, and educational institutions. These include: (1) Instructional Television Fixed Services, a special type of narrowcast television which can transmit up to four channels to predetermined reception points; (2) cable television, which has potential for in-school instruction, professional accreditation courses, and two-way capabilities; (3)  slow-scan or compressed video, which involves the one-way transmission of still pictures with two-way audio; (4) Subsidiary Communications Authority subcarriers, which require specially tuned receivers; and (5) home video and audio systems, which are used by many schools as primary educational vehicles. While offering new opportunities, these alternative systems require educational institutions to address questions related to target audiences, course content, costs, materials availability, programming, and selection of courseware and materials. Most importantly, the question of operational support must be addressed before considering the use of these systems. (HB)",

Specifically, the study sought to determine the services, clientele, and purposes of specific college activities; the relation of these activities to specific missions; the value and priorities accorded to these missions and activities by various constituency groups; and the differences between urban and rural populations in their perceptions of college missions. A Community College Activities Survey, consisting of 60 items identifying specific activities and missions, was administered to state legislators, members of community college district  governing boards, faculty and administrators, evening students, and a random sample of registered voters in one rural and one urban county. The study revealed a general consensus among all major constituency groups that instruction in transfer, occupational, and general education should have top priority, with the second highest priority given to basic skills instruction. There was a strong public perception that one of the functions of the community college is to serve special and deserving clientele. Rural respondents were somewhat more likely to perceive the community college as a multi-purpose institution. The study report includes data tables, a technical appendix, and the survey instrument.

For each period, significant world, national, local, and institutional events are highlighted, and research activities and findings relevant to the period are discussed. Parts I and II, covering the years 1947-1952 and 1952-1957, review the growth of LACC and early institutional research conducted through the Counseling Center. Certain research concerns are common to the next five periods, 1957-62, 1962-67, 1967-72, 1972-77, and 1977-82, allowing a look at trends in enrollment, student characteristics, remedial programs, transfer success, and student follow-up. Other research projects were more characteristic of  the period during which they were undertaken. For example, during 1957-62, 19 studies were related to testing and placement; during 1962-67, when the number of LACC inner city students increased dramatically, the Research Office was called upon to evaluate new approaches to preparing high risk students; during 1967-72, much of the research effort was directed toward the problem of campus unrest; during 1972-77, special populations, including veterans, handicapped, and displaced homemakers, received much attention; and during 1977-82, research focused largely on &quot;new populations&quot; in the college.

        "description":"A two-year project was undertaken at Shelby State Community College to revise the school's faculty annual evaluation system. The first step in the development of the system was the identification and definition of five teacher roles; i.e., instruction, service to the college, professional growth, professional activities within the faculty member's area of expertise, and community or public service activities. The second step was the identification of sources of information on instructor performance in each of the roles, including student, peer, self, and supervisor evaluations. The third step was the determination of the weight or value to be placed on the information provided by each of the sources. After determining the kind of information to be gathered from each source, the  final step was the development of forms, procedures, and protocol. The revised evaluation system, which is intended to support promotion and tenure considerations and to determine the need for faculty development, consists of four stages: (1) the determination by the faculty member and his/her supervisor of the emphasis he/she will place on each of the five roles; (2) the fulfillment of the agreed upon roles and responsibilities; (3) the collection by the faculty member of the necessary documents for evaluation; and (4) the evaluation itself. The bulk of this document is composed of samples of the various forms used in the evaluation process. (KL)",

The Job Search Skills module covers topics such as warm and cold behaviors, identifying job skills, job interviews, and application forms. The Career Planning module focuses on topics including body positions signifying openness or control, setting short- and long-term career goals, the difference between a career and an occupation, training programs, and finding and analyzing information about careers. The last module, Interpersonal Communications, considers topics such as territory, non-verbal interaction, and facial cues to emotion. Each of these modules includes the  following materials: a five-hour lesson plan; vocabulary, definitions, and sentences using the vocabulary; information on body language cues and two-sentence micro-dialogues calling for the use of these cues; related grammar and sentence patterns; four-sentence mini-dialogues; a complete videoscript which students are to rehearse and perform, if possible before a videocamera; supplemental information and exercises; and an annotated bibliography.

        "description":"The pressures engendered by the scarce resources of the 1980s demand the development of new organizational designs that respond to local cultural, economic, and social needs. In the Cumberland and Shenandoah Valleys, a four-state region containing 12 postsecondary institutions, a voluntary association of colleges was formed to solve mutual and recurring problems and derive the maximum benefit from scarce funding. Initial meetings among college representatives confirmed the benefits of institutional communication and cooperation and confronted a number of important issues, including the articulation of student transfer among institutions, mutual concerns related to academic advising and educational quality, declining resources for staff development, and the special needs of older,  part-time students. From these discussions solutions emerged and were implemented. For example, articulation agreements were developed to remove barriers to student transfer; a seminar on academic advising at Frostburg State College was opened to other association members; members shared information on honors programs as a response to the question of general education quality; an informal agreement was made to include personnel from member colleges in staff development activities; and the viability of residential baccalaureate programs was investigated. Plans for further joint activity exist in the areas of program review and community needs assessment. (HB)",

        "description":"The evaluation of a behavioral screening procedure for the detection of both conduct disordered and withdrawn children was implemented in two phases among children enrolled in a rural Head Start program. The first phase focused on preliminary identification, through teacher rankings and classroom observation, of a population of the most withdrawn and the most conduct disordered children within individual preschool classrooms. The second phase involved standardized classroom observations of identified children by trained observers. Different behaviors were targeted for each group of children, either conduct disordered or withdrawn. Children who exhibited the highest frequencies of maladaptive behaviors were selected to participate in a group social skills intervention program.  Three groups were selected, two conduct disordered and one withdrawn. Each group consisted of five children. A control group of non-referred children from the same classroom was also established. Validation of the screening procedure was carried out during the baseline phase of the social skills program by trained observers who were blind to the purpose of the study and to the nature of the groups. Thirteen sessions of observations of each group were taken during two 10-minute table tasks which involved coloring a picture. Behaviors observed included on-task, out-of-chair, and disruptive activities. Teachers' rankings proved to be the most important component of the screening process. Results, which suggest that the screening procedure successfully discriminated between withdrawn children  and conduct disordered children as well as between these children and non-referred controls, are discussed.

        "description":"The purposes of this study were to assess the attitudes of preschoolers toward two types of handicapping conditions (mental retardation and physical disabilities), and to explore the underlying social reasoning used by young children to formulate/support their perceptions. Sixteen 3- and 4-year-old boys and girls were presented with two 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; photographs. One photograph pictured a physically handicapped young boy (age 7 years) using crutches and leg braces, and the other photograph pictured a 9-year-old girl with Tuberous Sclerosis, a condition frequently associated with mental retardation. Each subject was then individually asked a series of questions constructed to elicit his/her social understanding and attitudes towards handicapping conditions. Statistical and content  analysis indicated that only two subjects (both girls in the older age group) with prior exposure to handicapped people identified the children in the photographs as handicapped. Most subjects failed to notice anything different about either handicapped child. Those who identified the handicapped boy as &quot;different&quot; responded to the crutches as signifying a broken leg or other resolvable problem rather than a permanently disabling condition. Those who identified the retarded girl as &quot;different&quot; responded to the facial tubercles and general unkempt appearance by describing her as &quot;dirty&quot;, but attributing this to a temporary situation correctable by cleanliness. These results suggest that the egocentric thought patterns of young children may make them unaware of handicapping conditions, and  that perceptions of handicapped people may first be learned from adult attitudes and behaviors. Suggestions for further research in this area are discussed, and a copy of the questionnaire used to elicit subjects' perceptions of handicapping conditions is attached. (Author/MP)",

Audio- and video-taped language data were obtained in a laboratory playroom setting during 15-minute sessions of free play with the mother present. Neonatal and postnatal neurological examination records were obtained to establish neonatal activity levels. Infants' scores at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months on the MCC Baby Test (a modification of an instrument by Cattell) were obtained to provide developmental data on search behavior. Of particular interest were (1) the relationship between the time of emergence of the first meaningful word and  the emergence of two-word utterances, (2) the relationship between cognitive and language variables, (3) the influence of neonatal activity level upon cognitive and language development, and (4) the relationship of maternal verbal functions at 12 months with cognitive and language development up to 24 months. A correlational analysis was made of 39 variables of language and cognitive development, neonatal activity level, and maternal verbal functions at 12 months. Results are discussed in relationship to previous studies and the need for further research is indicated. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"To investigate the development of symbolic play, 18 Japanese normal boys and girls were individually tested once every even-numbered month from when they were 12 to 24 months of age. Symbolic play was generally defined as behavior which represents actual or imagined experience by using objects, gesture or language alone or in combination. The symbolic play behavior was further specified in terms of three types of representation (material, gestural, verbal), three types of agent use (self, passive other, active other), and three types of elaborated acts (unordered, combination, and organized multi-scheme combinations). Testing took place in laboratory settings with materials composed of three sets of miniature toys, a doll, and junk materials. Each set was presented for 5 minutes  and the subject's spontaneous behavior was videotaped. Additionally, a trained observer took notes when there was difficulty in interpreting the subject's pretend behavior, especially when substitute use of the materials or gestural representation occurred. After each session, the observer asked the mother about these behaviors as well as the subject's pretend use of real objects in everyday life. Seven items of data were selected as measures of the development of symbolic play such as percentage of occurrence of symbolic play, substitute object use, and other agent use; and total number of different acts and different referents in substitute object use.

However, no study based on long-term observation is presently available that deals with the appearance and development of pointing as an interaction between mothers and their children. Therefore, this longitudinal study was initiated to observe the development of pointing in infants during their first two years. Four Japanese infants (two males and two females) and their mothers were videotaped while playing with certain toys commonly given to Japanese infants. These videotaped sessions took place 15 minutes once a month from the time the infants were 3 to 24 months of age. (In order to provide supplementary data, play interaction  between two of the infants and their mothers was also videotaped when the infants were 1 and 2 months old.) Results are reported and discussed in terms of (1) the development, emergence, and function of pointing behavior and (2) behavior related to the emergence of pointing. Specifically examined were the relationship between pointing and emergence of searching behavior with interposed visual representation, eye pointing and the development of infants' capacity to approach interesting objects, and the conditions necessary for the emergence of pointing behavior. Tables and figures summarizing and illustrating the study's results conclude the document. (MP)",

In particular, the study sought to answer the following questions: (1) When both mothers and peers are available to the child, with whom does he/she prefer to play? and (2) Are there differences in the types of social behaviors directed to peers and mothers? Subjects, 5 girls and 11 boys, were observed while interacting in both a group and a dyadic setting. To assess interaction in a group, toddlers and their mothers were observed during a regular free play session for a period of one hour over two or three days. To assess interaction in a dyad, each pair of children and their mothers were observed for 15 minutes while interacting in a nursery  school classroom. (Mothers were asked not to initiate interaction with their children.) Subjects' positive and negative behaviors (e.g., giving an object versus struggling over an object) and whether the behaviors were directed toward another child or an adult were recorded. Results indicated that size of group had no effect on the frequency or type of behavior directed towards peers. Whether in dyads or groups, the children interacted with peers very infrequently. However, size of group did have an effect on the frequency of behaviors directed towards adults. The children interacted much more with their mothers in the group setting then they did in the dyad setting. For example, the children talked to their mothers 28 times in the group setting and 21 times in the dyad setting. The  children also played together with their mothers nine times in the group setting and less than once (i.e., less than 15 seconds) in the dyad setting. (Author/MP)",

The role of the school principal in identifying, screening and assessing the exceptional children within his/her community is discussed in Chapter II. Names, descriptions, and prices of instruments commonly used in preschool  screening and assessment programs are also included in Chapter II, along with sample forms for identification, screening, and assessment of the exceptional child. Chapter III includes activities and materials designed to strengthen the handicapped child in seven developmental areas: gross motor, fine motor, cognitive development, auditory/visual perception, language/speech development, social behavior, and self-help. Also included in this chapter are special materials to be used with severely and profoundly handicapped children. Chapter IV discusses the kind of facilities that should be included in a school with a preschool special education program, and suggests ways of organizing the classroom setting so that each child has as much room for development as possible. Guidelines for  involving volunteers in the program, and the role of volunteers in meeting the child's instructional needs are provided in Chapter V. Chapter VI specifies the importance of parent participation in the planning, organization, and development of the program. Finally, Chapter VII provides resources and materials (such as books, magazines, newsletters, and pamphlets) useful for helping teachers work with parents, and parents work with their children.
