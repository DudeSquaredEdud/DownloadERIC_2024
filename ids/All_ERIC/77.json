        "description":"Recent reports on the state of American education are reviewed, along with the historical context of these reports. Common threads that run through the reports include: schools lack consensus regarding educational goals and priorities; the academic curriculum of the high school must be strengthened; ways must be devised to improve the performance of teachers; there is a need for cooperation with other institutions; and both equity and excellence are important goals. It is suggested that these issues are important at the postsecondary level as well. Similarities and differences between the present concern with education and that of the post-Sputnik period are discussed. In both the 1950's and 1980's, perceived international competition triggered the public interest in education.  Preeminent among the differences is the current emphasis upon improving the education of all the children, not just the college bound or technically talented. Other major differences between the past and the present are as follows: we now know a great deal more about educational practice, and the current criticism of American education comes at a time of concern about may of the basic societal structures. Reasons that educators have lost unified leadership during the 1970s and 1980s are also identified. (SW)",

        "description":"The productivity of selected Georgia state universities is compared as measured by total degrees conferred for fiscal years 1974-1983. The number of degrees conferred in the university system has been stable over the 10-year period, but trends can be seen for groups of institutions within the system. Degree output by the universities and senior colleges has been relatively stable, with the senior colleges showing slightly more variation. The number of degrees conferred by traditionally black colleges has declined sharply. Degree output from junior colleges appears to fluctuate, with output from the larger southern junior colleges showing more stability than output from junior colleges in the northern region of the state. Graphs illustrate the trends. In addition, data are  provided on total degrees for each year by institution. (SW)",

        "description":"Factors that 1983 National Merit and National Achievement Semifinalists in Maryland felt influenced their college choice were studied. The 143 survey respondents were asked to indicate how important 22 factors were in the selection of a college. The factors covered items dealing with the characteristics of the college, efforts by the institution to contact students, and influential persons in the lives of the students. Respondents were also asked to estimate the proportion of first-year college costs (tuition and fees, room and board) that would be covered by the financial aid package offered by their college. The reasons that appeared to be instrumental in attracting the greatest number of students were related to perceived strengths of the institution and how well the  institution serves its graduates. The following reasons were cited most frequently (in ascending order of frequency): the overall reputation of the school, the attractiveness of the program in the students's major, the success of the graduates in finding a job or getting into graduate or professional school, and the quality of the student body at the institution. Data are included on the responses of students who chose public and private colleges and those of students who went to out-of-state schools. In addition, students' reasons were compared by sex and race. (SW)",

        "author":["Brier, Ellen M."],
        "description":"The presence of academically underprepared students at Vassar College from 1865 to 1890 and at Cornell University from 1868 to 1890 was a source of controversy in both institutions. Vassar took on the burden of providing for comprehensive preparatory education for academically-deficient students within the context of the college. Cornell, although publicly stressing that it was not a preparatory institution, did provide some opportunities for remedying academic inadequacies. Rather than creating a separate class of students and distinct preparatory course as Vassar did, Cornell offered subsections of college courses as well as tutoring. In addition, Cornell referred its underprepared students elsewhere for preparatory work. Complaints and protests regarding students' deficiencies  in the basic skill areas are prevalent in the records of both colleges. The controversial presence of underprepared students led to a nineteenth century high school/college connection: the colleges worked to elevate the quality of secondary school curricula. However, the colleges viewed the presence of underprepared students as reflecting negatively on their public images, and underprepared students presented instructional as well as administrative problems.

        "description":"Two case studies of states that illustrate innovations in higher education budgeting are presented, based on a project of the Education Commission of the States. The two states, Colorado and Minnesota, took different approaches. In Colorado, the impetus for change came from key legislative members interested in providing greater autonomy to the higher education governing boards. Five key conditions provided the impetus for change: legislative leadership, governing board readiness, fiscal austerity, the presence of a mediator, and the success of more modest changes. The governing boards were given greater financial autonomy and responsibility for conducting their own business affairs. In Minnesota, the state coordinating board realized that the incremental approach appropriate in  a growth environment was not well suited to an era of fiscal constraint. The board initiated a study of new approaches to budgeting and tapped a reservoir of support in the governor's office, legislature, and among the institutions. The results in both cases were similar: greater decision-making authority for those with more direct responsibility for running the institutions. (SW)",

The RAND Case Survey Method guided the development of the instrument and data collection. One of five reviewers read each of 1,189 articles and completed a questionnaire to analyze the article. The primary data gathering tool was the College Student Research Case Study Questionnaire. Topics were classified into five categories: behavior (e.g., achievement, extracurricular activities); selected student characteristics (e.g., career interests, ethnic group); student development (e.g., moral/ethical); instruction (remedial), and miscellaneous (e.g., finances). Notes were also made on sample characteristics, the kinds of data collection methods  and sources of data employed in each article, and design and analytical techniques that were used. The primary and secondary thrusts of the article were also identified, and the reviewer attempted to determine whether a theory base had been used. Conclusions included the following: most studies employed pencil and paper instruments administered to relatively large combined gender samples, and most articles were about students attending public, doctoral-granting institutions.

Nine characteristics of organizational structure were operationalized for the college setting: institutional autonomy, centralized decision making, functional specialization, effective participation, formalized procedures, and four measures of organizational configuration, including hierarchy of control and division of labor. A second set of characteristics consisted of 23 institutional attributes that are commonly used to describe the diversity of colleges, including such items as control and faculty and student size. Data were collected from 150 colleges. Factor analytic techniques were employed, and 16 taxonomic clusters were identified  as representing optimally homogeneous groups of institutions. The phyletic approach based on decision-making authority and functional responsibilities developed a classification scheme, composed of four institutional types: bureaucratic, bureaucratic/academic, academic/bureaucratic, and academic. A numerical phenetic analysis identified four factors: decision-making authority, functional differentiation, administrative configuration, and operational procedures. A questionnaire is appended.

It is suggested that general education and core curricula have been the areas influenced most by the professionalism of professors. It is claimed that faculty members who teach undergraduates are distracted from teaching by the demand of research and publication necessary for professional advancement and tenure. Furthermore, the training for a Ph.D.  is tightly restricted to isolating and competitive research concerns. Few graduate schools offer any instruction in university teaching. It is concluded that deprofessionalization of university faculty is not a sensible option, since the production and utilization of knowledge, public belief, and academic freedom and autonomy are essential. The challenge for universities is to overcome the segmentalism of professional specialization. (SW)",

Of the 21, 16 demonstrated a strengthened/expanded faculty role, while four showed no change in faculty governance roles and structures, and one institution showed a diminished faculty role. The faculty governance role was formalized at the 16 institutions in one or more of the following ways: the development of new, representative structures of faculty governance; the independence of  faculty governance structures from the central administration; formalization of the budgetary role; formalization of the faculty role in promotion and tenure; and the initiation and formalization of faculty-board of trustees relations.

Factors that affect the extent to which administrators employed across-the-board cuts versus selective cuts were also assessed. Attention was focused on the effects of the severity of revenue decline, the duration of the decline episode, the institution's recent history in managing decline, institutional control, and the effect of the type of institution on the reallocation of institutional resources. Data were obtained from the Higher Education General Information Survey finance and enrollments questionnaires. Reallocation was defined as the percentage of constant dollar expenditures across functional areas in  time that differed from what would be expected in an across-the-board cutback. It was found that the majority of the cuts tended toward minimal reallocation. The results supported the hypothesis that reallocation: increases as the severity of decline increases, decreases as the length of a decline episode increases, is more likely in private institutions, and is more likely in two-year institutions. Additional findings and implications are discussed. Types of expenditures for 10 functional areas are also outlined. (SW)",

College administrators are faced with the need to respond to several groups, each of which provides financial or other resources to the institution and each of which has some different expectations. Budgets are constructed of two basic components--a multipurpose, general component, and varied numbers of single-purpose (categorical, special) components. The multipurpose component provides  support for the basic operations and programs of the institution. Since the state has to treat institutions differently, single-purpose resource allocation approaches help to achieve this objective. It is suggested that states should make explicit that they are allocating funds for specific services, and institutions should understand the expectations as a condition of receiving money. Since accountability mechanisms are not inherent in the resource allocation method, they must be constructed separately. (SW)",

Papers supporting the use of qualitative methodologies were also analyzed. The papers were from the 1983 conferences of the American Educational Research Association and the Association for the Study of Higher Education. The underlying assumptions of organizational constructs such as &quot;loose coupling&quot; were analyzed and contrasted with older and more traditional constructions of organizations. The results show that assumptions grow typically out of the same, or a very similar, value framework; that effective methods of inquiry are those that  match assumptions about organizations; and that methods that present reductionist pictures of organizations fail to inform the change process because they produce necessarily limited and nonholistic views of organizational functioning. It is suggested that increased interaction between organizational theorists and methodologists should insure that methods fit newer constructs to create a descriptive science of organizations. A list of the 11 conference papers and authors is included. (Author/SW)",

Seven broad topics were covered: general trends and the economics of higher education; governmental fiscal support to higher education; external funding and institutional development; student financial aid; institutional financial management; fiscal planning and budgeting; and reduction, retrenchment, and reallocation. Three patterns of publications activity were identified. Early in the 1970s, an initial publications peak was coincident with the public debate over funding higher education, supporting  institutions versus students, questions about the value and the economic return of higher education, and increasing concerns about sustaining higher education. Institutional financial management showed a variation in emphasis and content in the 1970s. Continuing areas of concern, and thus publications activity, will include the topics of planning, budgeting, and student aid. The cyclic pattern will likely continue and be represented by governmental concerns about higher education. (SW)",

        "description":"The commitment of administrators to the work role, the institution, and the career was studied using data from a survey and interviews of mid-level administrators at a large research university. A total of 256 administrators responded to the survey, and 6 participated in followup interviews. Approximately 80 percent of the respondents were found to be primarily committed to the university where employed or the position held. The nature and intensity of reasons for commitment to the work role, the institution, and the career were examined. The mid-level administrators rated their commitment to the university and to their positions more highly than their commitment to a career in higher education. Important reasons for commitment were autonomy, pride, recognition and prestige, and  interesting people and colleagues. The interviews provided additional insight into these reasons. It was found that many of the mid-level administrators apparently did not work closely or interact frequently with either faculty members or students. Three orientation groups--university-oriented, career-oriented, and position-oriented--differed in the patterns of linkages contributing to their commitment to their work. (SW)",

Nine dimensions of effectiveness were analyzed: student educational satisfaction, student academic development, student career development, student personal development, faculty and administrator employment satisfaction, professional development and quality of the faculty, system openness and community interaction, ability to acquire resources, and organizational health. In 1976, 41 institutions participated; in 1980, 20 of the same institutions participated; and in 1983, 26 of the institutions participated. Eighteen of the schools were common to all three studies. The  number of respondents was 1,317 in 1976, 1,240 in 1980, and 246 in 1983. Respondents consisted of academic, financial, student affairs, and general administrators, faculty department heads, and trustees.

Emphasis is placed on the validity and usefulness of an approach to postsecondary pricing increasingly being employed in the public sector. This approach, which is labeled the targeted subsidy approach, stresses that greater equity and fiscal efficiency result from moves away from low tuition policies toward higher tuition levels and higher levels of student aid funding. The evidence suggests that responsible movement toward a targeted subsidization financing scheme should not appreciably affect enrollment rates in the long run. The view that significant tuition rises necessarily threaten equality of educational opportunity is labeled as myth. Although the value of the targeted subsidy approach is  generally upheld by the review, caveats are suggested regarding three of its central assumptions: the rational actor assumption, the \"ceteris paribus\" assumption, and the \"efficient delivery\" assumption. Suggestions for further research focus on the need for greater knowledge regarding individuals' processing of information as they make their college-going decisions.

The late returners were those 9-15 years beyond the baccalaureate, and those 16 or more years beyond the degree. Average verbal scores were about the same for all test takers regardless of age group or recency of undergraduate study; average quantitative scores were progressively lower across groups of increasing age or distance from the baccalaureate. Correlations between verbal and quantitative scores and first-year graduate school grades were about the same across age groups of enrolled  students, suggesting that the scores were equally useful in predicting the first-year graduate school grades of younger and older applicants. Undergraduate grade averages were lower for older than for younger students, and were less closely related to graduate school grades among the older student groups. Differences in fields of study, background characteristics, and attitudes toward test taking also are reported. Supplementary tables and the study questionnaire are included. (Author/SW)",

Separate analyses were conducted for the 190 males and the 214 females who attended either a large, rural, public institution or a smaller, urban, church-related college. It was found that both men's and women's aspirations rose between the freshman and senior years, although men's aspirations were higher at each time. Causal analysis of these patterns suggests that academic performance, parental supportiveness, and major department context played significant roles in the attainment-related outcomes of graduating college men, beyond the role played by the men's freshman year background characteristics. Among the graduating women, the roles of academic performance and the  major department context were less significant than among the males, but the role of parental supportiveness was more significant. It is suggested that the large differences found for men and women argue strongly for greater attention to gender differences in post-college educational attainment processes.

Copyright violation is examined as a reason some software producers may be abandoning the school software market. An explanation of what the copyright allows and prohibits in terms of computer software is followed by a list of five legal principles for assessing legality of software use. The remainder of the paper addresses questions of whether controlling piracy would automatically improve software quality; whether the home market will really be sufficiently more lucrative than the educational market to cause software producers to abandon the school market; whether illegal copying is really widespread in the schools; and  whether piracy alone is a major cause of poor software. Also examined are the current quality and perceptions of quality of educational software, why so much copyright violation exists, and what can be done to assure quality courseware for the schools.

Emphasis was on how teachers construe their classroom influence in relation to the actual use of microcomputers and to idealizations of their use. A version of the Kelly (1955) repgrid was used with two teachers who, in interviews, completed a projective-type test using their own constructions. Constructs were elicited by having teachers group 30 microcomputer situations and evaluate each situation in relation to each construct. Five constructs were provided and approximately five elicted to obtain a grid which was analyzed as a basis for developing a follow-up interview protocol. This report includes a review of related  literature, a description of the general research methodology and specific strategies, examples of data collected from one teacher, a description of data analysis techniques, and preliminary results. Figures and tables include a list of events used as elements in construct elicitation, an example of a completed grid, an interview protocol, and a transcript of a conversation with a teacher regarding the situations. Examples illustrate the kind of data that emerge from the interview protocols based on grid analysis. Seventeen references are listed. (LMM)",

The person-environment congruence concept of Holland's model of vocational behavior was used to predict class performance. The model uses a classification system which arranges six vocational types in a hexagonal configuration of invariant order (realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional) and uses the relative proximity of types on the hexagon to determine the degree of congruence between a person and an environment. It was predicted, for example, that educators of the investigative type would experience more satisfaction in the course than would those of the social type. The virtual absence of individuals of the  investigative type in the courses precluded a direct test of the prediction. However, correlational relationships among relevant variables were pursued. Course attendance data provided some support for the satisfaction prediction. Course grades were not differentiated by Holland type, a finding which was attributed to the predominance of Social types in the samples, and the seemingly successful efforts of the professors to tailor the courses to the non-Investigative characteristics of the students.

It begins by arguing that, since a library reflects the goals and objectives of the institution it services, a library serving a community college has to provide a wider range of learning resources than a library at a traditional four-year college or university. This is because the community college seeks to provide not only a comprehensive curriculum of transferable academic programs, but also remedial programs, continuing education, guidance and counseling, vocational/technical training, and  community service. Results of library research indicate that: the organization and scope of services in a community college library vary significantly from one institution to another, depending largely on the priorities and resources of each institution; a good working relationship with the faculty is the most effective way of increasing library use; most directors had a library science background according to a nationwide survey conducted in 1972, but some professionals suggest this is not necessary; and a revised \"Guidelines for Two-Year Learning Resources Programs\" published in 1982 has not met with total agreement, but the review process provided an opportunity for reaffirmation of the basic tenets of community college librarianship by a large number of the professionals involved.

The results of the study indicate that expenditures and head librarians' salaries are: (1) greater for libraries in the Chicago area than for libraries elsewhere in the state; (2) greater for libraries serving larger clienteles than for those serving smaller clienteles; (3) greater for nonmedical libraries than for medical libraries; (4)  greater for libraries serving profit-seeking organizations than for those in not-for-profit organizations; and (5) greater for libraries with male head librarians than for libraries with female head librarians.

        "description":"Established by Executive Order 12369 on June 30, 1982, the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control (PPSSCC) carried out its mandate through an executive committee of 161 high-level private sector executives. The committee set up a management office and 36 task forces with 1,300 members. The task forces were co-chaired by members of the executive committee. The PPSSCC was directed to go into the various departments and agencies and look at them as if they were considering a takeover or a merger. The project team found that key information that would be needed to make a decision on such actions was often not available, and when available, was frequently out of date, inaccurate, or incomplete. This information gap, a collapse in the communication or reception of knowledge,  causes a lack of data translated into critical information, needed for accurate, timely, and perceptive decision making. Individual task forces made recommendations for the departments they investigated, and an overall program was recommended that would include: an agency-by-agency needs assessment; establishment of data collection standards; adoption of a systems approach to information processing; improved utilization of existing data; and implementation of a structure to facilitate the information management process. This preliminary report includes an executive summary, issue and recommendation summaries, and a summary list of recommendations and savings. A compendium of information gaps reported by the task forces and one page summaries of their findings are appended, as well as  discussions of several selected issues. (DMC)",

A point-of-exit questionnaire was used to determine user status, department, how the document to be circulated was identified, and reasons for use. Due to the recent segregation of documents, the study was conducted on a small subset of UIUC's entire documents collection. An additional limitation involved the reliability of personnel administering the questionnaire. Analysis of the 150 usable responses received indicated that the majority of users were undergraduates; Congressional documents accounted for the  greatest use; most undergraduate use of documents was related to coursework; and the provision of full bibliographic control for documents at UIUC had an observable impact on the sharing of documents resources. The study provided data for future research on the impact of the introduction of an online public catalog on documents use and patterns of access.

On September 21, 1981, three NCLIS commissioners, Clara Jones, Frances Naftalin, and Joan Gross, received notices from the White House that their 5-year commission appointments, due to expire in July 1982, were being terminated immediately. This action was considered to be of questionable constitutionality, since while the commissioners are appointed by the President, the length of the terms they are to serve is mandated by the law that established the commission. At the conclusion of the hearing, Chairman Simon stated that, as an initial step,  he would write to the Justice Department. If this action did not settle the matter, he suggested that the subcommittee had basically two options; either a resolution by the House, or a temporary injunction against the removal of the commissioners from NCLIS. This document includes the opening statement of the Hon. Paul Simon, chairman of the subcommittee, and the statements of Frederick Burkhardt, chairman emeritus of NCLIS, and Clara Jones and Frances Naftalin. (DMC)",

This draft which contains a number of modifications from the current law, would expand the role of libraries as information centers for the community. While the original Library Services Act of 1957 focused on the need for geographic access to libraries, the proposed bill emphasizes access by a wide range of populations who may require special assistance and materials in order to fully utilize public libraries. On the first day, witnesses representing Native Americans told the committee how badly library services are needed for Indian people. Urban librarians, testifying on the second day, explained how the draft bill  would affect libraries in the country's largest cities, and state librarians voiced their concerns about implementing a new LSCA. On the final day, the Administration's position on LSCA was given by the Assistant Secretary for Educational Research and Improvement, and a panel of witnesses presented testimony on the expanded role of libraries as community information centers, library services for the elderly, resource sharing among libraries, and the role of libraries in combating adult illiteracy.

Each group was charged with identifying research questions in information and technology that lie outside the more established disciplines, but could contribute to the understanding of fundamental questions that might foster the development of new knowledge. Taken together the three reports provide an overview of information science and technology which shows its relationship to its neighboring disciplines while also clarifying  the essential ingredients that distinguish its thematic scientific problems from theirs. The first report suggests that fundamental questions relating the phenomena of learning and memory in animals to a theory of &quot;cognitive processes&quot; may create future bridges to the fields of automata theory and artificial intelligence. The second report confirms that the technology that has raised many questions because of its rapid and pervasive development is itself in need of more intense basic research in eight general areas, each of which is discussed in turn. The third report recognizes that economists are only beginning to develop theory with respect to the cost and distribution of information viewed as a commodity. (DMC)",

First, technological developments, especially in the computer sciences, are reviewed, and retraining needs are examined in the areas of content, curriculum, methodology, and attitudes, including the need for math faculty to develop an awareness of computing and the mathematical implications of computers and the need for improving the quality and usefulness of the math curriculum. After arguing that the retraining of current mathematics staff is feasible, the paper suggests that commitment on the part of planners and faculty  be the underlying theme for all continuing education endeavors. Next, some traditional continuing education formats, such as release time, sabbatical leaves, and tuition reimbursements, are discussed as possible guides in formulating plans for the future. Then, a series of recommendations for continuing education programs are presented including: (1) expansion of government funding for teacher training programs; (2) faculty training efforts by professional mathematics societies; (3) support from business and industry for math faculty through in-plant training programs, research funding, and faculty employment during vacations; and (4) active and coordinated efforts by colleges and faculty to develop new skills. Finally, some consequences of lack of action are projected. (HB)",

First, sources are cited in evidence of the strong support among educators for statistics as one of the most useful topics that can be taught. Next, research findings are presented showing that statistics course enrollments represent a small percent of total mathematics enrollments in two-year colleges (3%); that the percentage of colleges offering a course in statistics is declining (from 41% in 1970 to 28% in 1980); and that there has been an increase in the enrollments in math courses taught outside of the mathematics department. The lack of teachers qualified to teach statistics and the lack of students prepared to take college-level  statistics courses are cited as two reasons why statistics is not being taught. The next section focuses on the high school curriculum, looking at the percentage of students who take statistics in high school, problems confronting the high school teacher who wants to offer a statistics course, the amount of probability and statistics covered in other math courses, what students know about the subject, and prerequisites for college-level courses. The next sections look at what material is covered in elementary statistics courses and what should be covered, indicating that new approaches to the subject focus on statistical concepts, the use of real data, and data analysis. Finally, a series of recommendations are presented for improving the curricular position of statistics.  (AYC)",

        "description":"In August 1983, when the second largest employer in Washington County, Maryland, closed its plant, the local unemployment rate was 13%. The following month, Hagerstown Junior College (HJC) received $50,000 in state funds to initiate a dislocated worker (DLW) program. The program included orientation by a counselor, diagnostic testing, and enrollment by the workers in credit or non-credit vocational programs. The displaced workers experienced a number of problems following their enrollment, including feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, difficulty in adapting to student life, and the constant need to look out for job opportunities. In recognition that it was not possible to develop the services this population needed through traditional college resources, the program was  expanded later that fall. A 7-week &quot;mini-mester&quot; was developed for workers who were not able to enroll in the regular fall semester; a grant proposal sought funding for a DLW center to provide counseling, job survival skills, and a general support system; and a referral system among area service providers was developed. In spring 1984, 164 dislocated workers enrolled at HJC in vocational courses, regular credit programs, and specially designed short-term training programs. Some students were unable to complete the term as unemployment benefits ran out, and they were forced to take any available job. Lessons learned from the HJC experience underscored the importance of recruitment, support systems, program structure, and staff development. (HB)",

The literature suggests that the challenges posed by new technologies and new clients, and a lack of effective problem-solving and decision-making strategies for managing change toward desired ends may be responsible for vocational educators' failure to achieve their objectives. A planning process which begins at the action-level and is responsible to local situations might serve as a strategy for realizing the potential of vocational education. The components of such a process would include the following: (1) define and prioritize  the opportunities and challenges faced by the organizational unit over the next 6 to 18 months; (2) develop specific action plans to engage high-priority challenges and pursue high-priority opportunities; (3) set up controls in the form of periodic progress reviews to keep action plans on track; and (4) submit a financial summary as a cost-benefit analysis tool. This process, though demanding a new and unique approach to decision making, fits comfortably into existing institutional structures. (AYC)",

This absence of a discussion of quality teaching indicates a serious weakness in community college education that could be remedied by taking some lessons from the corporate sector. Three characteristics have been found to contribute significantly to the success of major corporations: (1) concern for the needs of their customers; (2) productivity through people, that is, treating people as adults and partners, with respect and dignity; and (3) being driven by a set of fundamental values or beliefs. Applying these characteristics to community colleges would require an analysis of the composition of the student population and their needs, with  special attention to the needs of women, minority, part-time, and older students; a definition of quality in terms of student needs; greater concern for the well-being of faculty; and the development of programs and services within the guidelines of an overarching set of beliefs guiding the activities of the institution. Though some may feel that the colleges are too far along in their development to instill a new corporate value, the goal of making excellence in teaching the predominant value in the community college can and must be adopted.

A five-page questionnaire was mailed to 312 former LCC students, requesting information on student characteristics, curriculum and articulation, and the availability of information on transfer and student personnel services. Study findings, based on responses from 54.6% of the students, included the following: (1) 77% of the former students were attending the university full-time; (2) over half were enrolled in a program related to their major at LCC; (3) the two main reasons for enrolling at LCC were financial (75.2%) and preference for a community college for lower division  work (51.6%); (4) of those students earning more than 90 credits at LCC, 80% had all of their credits accepted at the university; (5) while 60.6% of the students had a grade point average of at least 3.25 at LCC, only 39.5% maintained this average at the university; (6) 79.4% of the students were at least somewhat aware of the university requirements prior to transfer; and (7) the main suggestion for improving the transfer process was more individual contact with LCC counselors.

Previous research conducted in a large, urban, multi-campus community college district revealed four district goals: serving new clientele, strengthening developmental education, retaining students, and preparing students for entry-level jobs or improving job skills. In addition, seven administrative actions directed toward goal achievement were identified: planning, staff development programs, reorganization, reassigning staff, hiring new staff, evaluation, and resource allocation. A 62-item questionnaire, the Attitude Toward District Priority Inventory, was completed by 34% of the faculty members in the district (N=235), revealing  their attitudes toward the four district goals, their perceptions of the administrative actions, and their self-reported participation in organizational activities. Study findings included the following: (1) faculty members who demonstrated the highest commitment to any of the four goals were involved in organizational activities and attended district staff development activities; (2) for three of the four goals (i.e., commitment to serving new clientele, developmental education, and occupational education), committed faculty members were more likely to be female than male; and (3) faculty members committed to developmental education, student retention, and occupational education perceived progress toward achieving these goals in the district.

After providing a rationale for a comprehensive faculty evaluation system and reviewing current practices, the elements of the proposed system are explored. These include: (1) methods of assessing instructional effectiveness, e.g., student evaluation of teacher performance, instructor self-evaluation, assessment of students' achievement rates, and peer evaluation; (2) methods of providing results to instructors in a manner that allows the easy and accurate identification of  instructional problems as well as suggestions for solving such problems; (3) options the instructor should consider based on whether the evaluations are positive or negative, ranging from the placement of positive assessments in departmental files for use in rank, pay, or tenure considerations to the development of instructional improvement plans and strategies; (4) implementation of the instructional improvement proposals for rectifying weaknesses identified during the assessment process; and (5) adminstrative procedures for considering instruction in the institutional reward system with evidence of teaching effectiveness weighted accordingly in a \"teaching + research + service\" equation for arriving at rank, pay, and tenure recommendations.

        "description":"Building on previous research on the future skill needs of workers in southeastern Wisconsin, a study was conducted at Milwaukee Area Technical College (MATC) to gather information on the machine tool industry in the Milwaukee area. Interviews were conducted by MATC Machine Shop and Tool and Die faculty with representatives from 135 machine shops, ranging in size from those employing less than 10 operators to those employing over 100 operators. The interviews focused on the nature of the machine tools currently used and projected to be used in 5 years, current and projected employment figures, and the skills that MATC students should have to prepare them for work in machine shops in l989. Study findings included the following: (1) machine shops of all sizes were evolving toward  greater use of computer-controlled machines, with the larger shops currently using more of these machines and projecting greater needs for employees with skills in operating this equipment; (2) the smaller shops appeared to be more optimistic about growth, projecting an increase of 43% in the number of machine tool operators on conventional machines in the next 5 years and an increase of 363% in operators on computer-controlled machines; and (3) respondents indicated a need for employees who could operate multiple machine tools and who had some exposure to computerized operations. Recommendations for program development and information on specific skill needs of employers are included in the report. (HB)",

        "description":"A study was conducted in which negative affective states were induced in children by one of several different types of cognition or experience. Subjects were 150 second-grade children, evenly divided by sex, from suburban elementary schools. In particular, cognitive induction procedures involved children's thinking about negative events that might happen to them or to others; experiential induction procedures provided children with an actual aversive social experience or with an occasion to observe another child undergoing a similar aversive experience. Induction procedures were followed by positive remedial inductions, in which the content was social acceptance and the process either did or did not match that of the negative induction. To assess effects of negative inductions  and positive remediations, measures were taken of children's subsequent altruistic behavior and of their cognitive abilities as measured by performance on a block-design task. In addition, self-reports of affective social experience were recorded, and videotapes were made of children's facial expressions during the procedures. Except for negative self-cognitions, results indicated that behavioral and cognitive consequences of negative emotion were alleviated when the positive remediation was of the same type as the original induction. Emotional expressions were consistently positive following remediation. Results were considered in terms of differing processes for maintaining negative emotion as a function of the character of induction, and implications for understanding clinical  depression in children were noted.

The development process included participation in workshops, assistance of a staff developer, observations of children and classrooms, discussions, and feedback. Topics selected for staff development training were chosen because of their importance in developing a program for early childhood. In the area of teaching management, these activities included child study and observation, room arrangement, scheduling, planning, selecting and using materials, teacher-made materials, and parent involvement. In the area of teaching strategies,  the topics included learning centers, group meetings, flannel boards, and block building. Subject area topics focused on developing responsibility, language experience, mathematics, drama, art, movement, and science. In many topic area sections, discussion of the topic is followed by suggestions for kindergarten learning activities.

Introductory remarks offer recommendations for developing New Follow Through models for culturally and linguistically integrated settings and for developing tests for English-proficient and limited-English-proficiency children. The first major section describes the state of the art in assessing language minority students. Several ways tests are misused are pointed out and language proficiency assessment, testing school achievement, and teacher assessments are discussed. The second major section examines variables  thought to be important in describing programs for language minority students and in studying the relationships of such programs to various student characteristics and local conditions. Model, program, classroom, and student variables are specified and discussed in terms of problems associated with instrumentation and measurement and with respect to measuring variables of interest. The final section identifies problem areas associated with the evaluation of bilingual programs. It is concluded that the inclusion of language minority students in the New Follow Through Program poses challenges and opportunities for curricular, psychometric, and evaluative innovation. (RH)",

The first section of the discussion indicates the significance of Follow Through; explores discrepancies between perceptions of the value and impact of the program; points out three illusions of the public concerning education; and discusses three paradoxes concerning belief systems, models, and program evaluation. The second section reviews  old concepts reaffirmed and new concepts attained concerning children, adults, school systems, and sponsorship. It is recommended that, in the future, Follow Through include provisions for studying belief systems and for building in resources for documentation and dissemination, and foster inquiry into processes. In addition, it is suggested that the limitations of evaluation be acknowledged and the service component of the program be legitimized.

        "description":"After a brief introduction indicating the value of the first Follow Through evaluation, this document offers ideas about how a new wave of Follow Through approaches should be evaluated. The discussion is based on the premise that the form of an evaluation must be derived from the questions for which answers are sought, the audience(s) to whom the results are directed, what is known about the treatment under investigation, and the size and shape of the treatment. It is asserted that local decisionmakers are the primary audience of interest, that their information needs justify the need to understand the process of implementation and change, and that such contextual information is relevant to federal program designers. Considerations pertinent to the design of a pilot intervention  program are addressed. Subsequent discussion indicates limitations of experimental and ethnographic approaches in producing evaluation information and proposes a multiple case study approach as a way of minimizing weaknesses of traditional approaches. Specific attention is given to (1) building a conceptual framework that establishes the topics on which data will be collected and that presents the context in which data should be interpreted; (2) sample selection strategies; (3) the data collection strategy; and (4) stages of data analysis. In conclusion, recommendations are offered for the design of a pilot Follow Through program implementation and evaluation. (RH)",

First, the discussion explores philosophical and theoretical assumptions regarding (1) the nature of implementation and evaluation; (2) realities of implementation as a unique form of socialization; and (3) approaches to evaluation that are compatible with the specified realities of implementation. Non-mechanistic, non-reductionistic philosophical assumptions and consonant theoretical positions are favored. Next, a discussion of realities of implementation provides a perspective on Follow Through evaluation efforts, analyzes implementation as socialization, and offers  recommendations concerning the future of Follow Through. The concluding discussion of evaluation offers a concrete proposal for the evaluation of implementation. While many compatible evaluation stategies are listed, the judicial evaluation model is seen as the single approach most compatible with implementation realities, and a combined documenting and judicial evaluation approach is recommended. Briefly addressed are the inferential dimension of educational measures and the importance of Follow Through model sponsors. Appended is a rationale for a national Follow Through database that specifies needed categories of information and evaluation/research strategies.

Investigation also attempted to ascertain how the factors were operationalized at these centers. Specifically, the five factors were (1) an instructional emphasis on basic skills; (2) ongoing diagnosis and assessment of pupil progress; (3) strong administrative leadership; (4) a safe, orderly school climate conducive to instruction; and (5) high teacher expectations for pupil achievement. Data collection took place over a period of 10 weeks and included questionnaires, interviews, reviews of records, and observations. It was found that the five factors identified as being  characteristic of effective schools also seemed to be present at the children's centers. The factors were found to have been operationalized in numerous ways; some were common to three or four centers, while others were unique to one or two. A variety of specific organizational and instructional practices were related to the five factors and seemed to contribute to the quality of centers.

A third major development is the appreciation of the teacher as essential to education, an orientation that has arisen from the awareness that prospective teachers may be less competent than their predecessors. Recent reports indicating ways America's schools can be improved bring educators very powerful and needed allies who can make a real difference. We members of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) must show a willingness to move cooperatively in the direction of these reports. In a time of sweeping changes, organizations and individuals willing to participate, to  compromise, and to talk will not be swept away. We should support entry level tests for future teachers, higher teacher salaries, and strong student discipline. While we should oppose traditional merit pay, we should be open to certain master teacher plans and measures eliminating traditional types of authority and teacher supervision in schools. The AFT continues to support efforts to reinvigorate compensatory education. This organization should show America that we support reform efforts on the national agenda; the stakes are not just education or the union, but the future of the nation. (RH)",

President Reagan has responded inadequately to the crisis in education, and Americans will not accept Reagan administration initiatives that do not continue and expand existing successful programs, such as those involving students targeted by Title I (now Chapter 1) and Head Start. Ninety-nine percent of the changes in education proposed in recent reports critical of the present system should not be proposed at all, for most concern matters of common sense that should always inform educational practices. But, because we have moved far away from where we should be, educational reforms are needed, especially as concern proposals of merit pay  and differential pay for teachers, the Minnesota Supreme Court's approval of a form of tuition tax credit or deductions, and the issue of teacher quality. With regard to acquiring talented teachers, schools must offer competitive salaries and remove violent, disturbed, or disruptive students from classrooms. In addition, they must allow teachers to teach subjects in which they have training, reduce excessive workloads, and modernize the administrative structure of schools.

This program offered educational support for very young handicapped children and their families. The monitoring team had a formative role in providing the services of consultants to advise teachers in certain areas of program development and a research role in documenting the development of four specific preschool programs over the 2-year pilot period. Questionnaires, interviews, observations, written submissions, workshops, seminars, consultations, and formal assessments were employed. Central attention was paid to the children, their families, the staff most closely associated with children and families, and the program that was developed to  meet existing needs. Attention was also directed toward examinations of the roles of guidance officers, school medical officers, other professionals, teachers in regular preschools and kindergartens, and, finally, other organizations and agencies. Discussion of the data begins with a description of the contexts of early educational intervention and then progresses to an overview of the four programs, the support services available to them, and programs beyond those undertaken in the special preschools. The final chapter summarizes key issues and makes specific recommendations for future program development. (RH)",

Subjects were 114 Caucasian middle class children, 57 girls and 57 boys, ranging approximately from age 7 to 9. Subjects, sampled from 10 second-grade classrooms, participated in two experimental sessions spaced 1 week apart. During the first session, they were shown a 2-minute videotaped film of a group of six children planning a party. After viewing, subjects were asked free-recall and  memory-probe questions about four of the six children they saw in the film. During the second experimental session, subjects rated themselves on a modified version of the Children's Personal Attributes Questionnaire. Preliminary results indicated that sex-role orientation influences memory for film characters as a function of their congruence level. Also, differences in group composition significantly influenced memory; as set size within a group increases (i.e. the number of males or females within the group) memory significantly decreases.

Women who are family day care providers can be empowered when they operate within a network of providers; when they are affiliated with a professional sponsoring organization; and when they deploy personal, professional, familial, and social resources. Providers must understand the reasons for networking and the advantages of professional affiliation. These ideas are relatively easy to grasp; more difficult is understanding multiple roles, in which are invested not only personal and professional expectations but also familial and societal assumptions and demands. Through the aegis of the professional organization, family day care providers  should expand beyond local horizons and develop statewide and nationwide associations in order to have an impact on legislative and administrative regulations affecting child care in general and family day care in particular. The New Jersey Family Day Care Organization is one such group developed to influence legislation and meet additional needs of family day care providers. (RH)",

Two groups of questions were addressed: (1) Are there significant statistical differences as well as qualitative descriptive differences between teenage parents and trained educarers in ratings of their ideal images of children, in ratings of temperament, or in interactions with children? (2) Regardless of membership in one or the other adult group, do significant relationships exist between adults' and children's interactive styles? and, Which interactional patterns are positive in terms of facilitating development? Participants were 15 teenage parent/child dyads  and 12 trained primary-care educarer/child dyads. The average age of the teenage parents was almost 17; that of caregivers was nearly 26. Educarers had been previously trained in the philosophy of Magda Gerber; teen parents had received earlier counseling and information about child development and parenting skills. Findings revealed that, while similar temperament ratings between groups existed, groups differed in interaction styles. Additionally, adult and child interactive styles were significantly related; sensitive caregiver styles were related to cooperative child styles. (Appended are toddler temperament scale/profile sheets for 1- and 2-year-old children and coding devices for adult and child interaction.) (RH)",

Field note data were obtained from classrooms located in separate large urban school districts in the Southeastern United States. One classroom was located in a middle-income, predominately white neighborhood; the other was in a working class neighborhood gradually being integrated racially. In the first classroom, 7 of 21 children were black. In the second, 4 of 24 were black. Eight girls were  included in the first classroom; 13 were included in the second. Both classes were organized so that children had opportunities to interact away from adult intervention. Analytical questions included the following: Do children participate in face-work as they interact with their peers? Do children use avoidance processes in defensive and protective ways? Do children participate in corrective interchanges to restore spoiled interactive order? and, Do children aggressively take advantage of face-work rules to &quot;make points&quot; in classroom interactions? The results indicated that children did take corrective or remedial action when the images they projected were threatened. They also practiced aggressive uses of face-work principles to improve their relative status among peers. (RH)",

Participants were interviewed for 60 to 90 minutes on three general topics: (1) teaching history and plans, (2) satisfactions and frustrations in early childhood, and (3) beliefs about men entering the field. Findings indicated similarities and differences between male and female teachers. Men and women both expressed a liking for children, but men reported more complex career plans and more frequent experiences that led to discussion of alternative careers. Men also reported incidents of negative discrimination as a result of their gender, but the content of these incidents obscured their  significance. Altogether, results suggested that positive career distractions, more than negative discrimination, account for the scarcity of men in early childhood education. (Author/BJD)",

Two interventions were developed to train teachers in more equitable instructional behaviors. In the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, teachers from fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-grade classrooms were trained according to an intervention based on a microteaching model. In New England, teachers of the same grades participated in a training intervention based on a collegial problem-solving model. A comparable group of teachers composed the control group. Overall, the sample consisted of 102 classrooms located in six school districts. All  classrooms were observed for 45-minute periods of active interaction by raters trained in the Interactions for Sex Equity in Classroom Teaching Observation System (INTERSECT). Primary analysis of observational data focused on the nature of interaction patterns and the distribution of interaction between male and female students. In the second phase, differences in teacher interaction with boys and girls across treatment groups were examined. Statistically significant differences among conditions and between male and female students were consistent across all approaches to data analysis. (A summary describes selected findings about general characteristics of classroom interaction and about bias reflected in classroom interaction and treatment and control differences.

        "description":"Social comparison is an important influence on motivation, capability self-evaluations (self-efficacy), and skillful performance. In addition, social comparative information provides a standard against which students can judge their present performance level. Students may experience an initial sense of self-efficacy in attaining a given standard; this sense may in turn enhance motivation. As students observe their progress, self-efficacy is substantiated, and this substantiation helps to sustain motivation and promote skills. Young children's social comparisons focus on practical concerns, but by the fourth grade, students regularly use social comparative information for self-evaluative purposes. Comparisons with similar others are especially informative of one's own  capabilities. Research shows that, although social comparative information indicating average achievement enhances motivation, it exerts only modest effects on self-efficacy. Self-evaluations seem to be more strongly influenced by performance outcomes and educational practices such as teacher evaluations and goal setting. Preservice teachers need to realize that educational practices such as reward structures, modeling, and tutoring also can affect students' social comparisons; these effects should be taken into account when designing instructional activities. (Concluding notes indicate ways social comparison is used in the classroom and suggest effective uses of social comparison.) (Author/RH)",

Tools that have implications for rural education include computer managed instruction (CMI), computer assisted instruction (CAI), interactive videotex, noninteractive videotex, and interactive videodisc instruction. Development of CMI systems requires defining curriculum in terms of specific objectives, developing placement testing systems, implementing monitoring processes, and revising instructional programs on the basis of pupil achievement data. The adaptation potential  of small business data-base-management programs to CMI academic applications offers access to powerful management programs at modest cost. The portability, cost, and flexibility of CAI using microcomputers may provide the means to offer an urban equivalent delivery system to rural students, but the diversity of alternatives in products and implementation practices requires well trained teachers to apply available technology. Universal excellence obtained through CAI still appears to be more vision than substance. Videotex technology, already a major vehicle for information flow between farmers and the public and private sectors, should be present in rural schools, if only for the vocational training involved.

MERLIN's objective is to improve overall efficiency while providing a continuity of educational experience for the mobile child. MERLIN's major resource categories are a human resource file of migrant education experts, a programs file of projects specifically geared to migrant  needs, and a special curricular methods and materials file. Current scopes of interest are the Migrant Student Record Transfer System, administrative needs, identification and recruitment, parent and community involvement, basic skills, culture, English as a second language, early childhood, special education, dropout prevention, credit accrual and graduation, career education, vocational education, and health and human services. Full implementation of MERLIN will provide administrators, teachers, educational researchers, support staff, and operating agencies with a current list of resources available from across the United States and Puerto Rico.

Goals of visiting and interviewing 50% of the target population were realized, with 220 home visits made. Materials and curriculum development continued, with progress made on Shinnecock curriculum. Instruction in Native history and culture was given during a 10-session mini-course in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens and during numerous in-school presentations. Tutoring was provided at the resource center. A workshop and resource center materials offered information on education opportunities. Special activities, with student and parent participation, included  trips to the Shinnecock and Ward/Pound Ridge Delaware Reservations, Black Bear Trading Post, Ramapough Indians, and Phildelphia Pow Wow. A first annual Native American Education Day Celebration featured traditional music, crafts, games, storytelling, foods, and speakers. Recommendations included: finding more accessible quarters or concentrating efforts in reaching students in their homes, schools, and communities; prioritizing objectives and determining if staffing permits the carrying out of proposed activities; listing the program telephone number in the New York City directory; and developing a flyer to encourage parents to submit certification statements needed for student participation.

        "description":"The 1981 enactment of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act Chapter 2 (ECIA-Chapter 2), which consolidated 28 separate categorical federal aid programs into a single block grant, has had policy and fiscal impacts in Michigan. Policy debate centers on the inherent tension between equity, particularly equity defined as equal treatment of equals, and the value of choice, leaving to states and local districts the decisions on where and how to spend ECIA-Chapter 2 funds. This debate establishes the frame for more specific policy issues: the funding shifts that have occurred under ECIA-Chapter 2 and the extent to which these shifts are consistent with legislative intent. As a result of ECIA-Chapter 2, funding in Michigan has shifted away from urban core areas, from public to  non-public schools, and from &quot;innovative and creative&quot; suburban districts. Although increases in absolute dollars is small, smaller and rural Michigan school districts (451 of 529 K-12 districts are below 5,000 in enrollment) received substantial percentage increases. ECIA-Chapter 2 also caused a four-fold increase in the dollar value of services available to non-public schools. Additionally, non-public schools located in public school districts qualifying for desegregation and low achievement factors under the formula received an additional windfall. (NEC)",

        "description":"Until the quantity, quality, and utility for policy development of research literature on rural education is improved, the potential for furthering the current national momentum of interest in rural education cannot be realized. Explanations for the limited research literature include a lack of appreciation for differences between rural and urban schools, rural education's limited appeal in the academic community, the small number of professionals who devote careers to continuous rural education study, little networking in professional and research communities, no perceived crisis in rural education, no consensus concerning foci of rural research, and limited research support from the National Institute of Education. Essential steps in constructing a research agenda are  developing paradigms to guide future inquiry, and developing initial consensus concerning substantive centers of needed work. Themes suggested for concentration are problems of minority and special populations; characteristics of effective rural schools; characteristics of effective leadership; determinants and consequences of interorganizational collaboration; and support for claims that rural schools are superior because of greater individualized instruction, greater community involvement, and local control. Initiatives that would elevate the current status of research include developing a meaningful taxonomy of rural schools, supporting university research centers and journals specializing in reporting rural education research, and establishing a process to promote vital initiatives.

The second story is a Blackfeet creation tale that describes how, after the Old Man created the world and the first people, a man and his sons set out to find better hunting and discovered the plains and the buffalo. The tale explains how the father rubbed magic black medicine on the feet of his first son so that he could move close to the buffalo to hunt them and how that son and his descendents were the Blackfeet Indians. The story also explains that the other two sons and their  descendents settled in areas nearby and became the South Blackfeet and the Blood Indians. (SB)",

The lack of educational attainment among large segments of the Hispanic population is the primary factor determining income. Research has also documented several health problems particular to Hispanic women: difficulty of obtaining health care, underuse by medical professionals of family and friend networks, and barriers to adequate prenatal care. In addition, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent  among Hispanic American women. Studies have revealed significant differences between Anglo Americans and Mexican Americans in health attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge and have shown that many Hispanics rely on the mass media as a source of health information. Despite existing research gains, more research is needed that conceptualizes Hispanic women as a heterogeneous group. More rigorous descriptive studies are also needed, as is research in the areas of pregnancy, obesity, hypertension, and family dynamics. (SB)",

By limiting their objectives and using parent volunteers, the programs kept their commitment to improving educational opportunities for Native American children and resulted in a generally steady academic gain, despite reduced funding. Johnson O'Malley funding for the projects provided $237,000 (down $27,000 from 1981-82) plus $28,690 from 1982 funding for 1,695 students. The programs focused on cultural reinforcement (leadership development, career  awareness, life skills) and on positive interaction among parent committees, staff, and local education agency officials. The programs had several difficulties during the year. Despite increased counseling efforts, high school dropout rates rose. Also, budget reductions restricted inservice opportunities. Further problems involved improving staff-Native community relations, increasing parent committee participation, and encouraging student participation in school activities. The objectives and evaluations of the 19 programs are included. The report includes a directory of the Johnson O'Malley programs and describes other state and federal programs providing benefits to American Indian public school students. (SB)",

        "description":"This paper proposes a semantic analysis in which meanings of word problems are structures that include class and order relations, and suggests a hypothesis of developmental levels that can account for children's performance of these problems at various ages. The different kinds of problems vary in the complexity of semantic structures and the operations required to derive the meaning structures from the problem texts. A representational process in children's understanding of problems corresponding to the derivations in the semantic analysis is postulated which explains the relative difficulty of different kinds of word problems. The meaning structures can also be viewed as semantic interpretations of formal arithmetic sentences; this provides an analysis of children's  achievements of more sophisticated understanding of arithmetic concepts and relationships. The first section reviews and presents empirical data for different categories of addition and subtraction word problems. The second section proposes developmental levels of word problem-solving ability that relate to growth in empirical, mathematical, and logical knowledge structures. The third section demonstrates how these developmental levels account for the accumulated data on children's performances of the arithmetic word problems presented earlier. (JN)",

Prior to these studies it was believed that errors in procedural skills such as multi-digit subtraction could be accurately modelled with two mechanisms: bugs (&quot;competence&quot; phenomena reflecting mistaken beliefs about subtraction which are stable over time) and slips (&quot;performance&quot; phenomena loosely related to subtraction which are unstable over time). A computational descriptive framework, the &quot;Buggy&quot; model and a diagnostic program (DEBUGGY) were developed wherein bugs and slips modelled performance, describing the content of wrong answers and the steps taken in producing them. Students (N=925) studying subtraction were tested using the diagnostic tests developed by DEBUGGY. Some students were retested two days  later to measure short-term stability of bugs, while others were retested several months later to study long-term stability. All tests were analyzed by DEBUGGY, and by expert diagnosticians to assess DEBUGGY's diagnostic abilities. Findings indicate DEBUGGY was as good as or better than human diagnosticians at discovering bugs that explain students' errors. Other findings challenge the belief that bugs and slips alone account for procedural error data. In addition, predictions of Repair Theory (a theory that predicted which bugs would exist for a given procedural skill) were verified. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"This assessment continues the Office of Technology Assessment's (OTA) exploration of the meaning of industrial policy in the United States context, while also examining the industrial policies of several U.S. economic rivals. The major focus is on electronics, an area which virtually defines &quot;high technology&quot; of the 1980's. The assessment sets the characteristics of the technology itself alongside other forces that exert major influences over international competitiveness. Specific areas addressed include: electronics technology; structure, trade, and competitiveness in the international electronics industry; quality, reliability, and automation in manufacturing; role of financing in competitiveness and electronics; human resources (education, training, management); employment  effects; national industrial policies; and U.S. trade policies and their effects. The report concludes by outlining five options for a U.S. industrial policy, drawing on electronics for examples of past and prospective impacts, as well as on OTA's previous studies of the steel and automotive industries. A detailed summary and introductory comments are included. Also included in appendices are case studies in the development and marketing of electronics products, a discussion of offshore manufacturing, and a glossary of terms used in the assessment. (JN)",

Because of this large cost variance, GAO was requested to assess how well past studies have defined the nationwide deficiency in university research equipment and to suggest what other work is needed to better determine equipment needs. GAO first identified 18 studies and then selected 5 completed and 2 on-going studies for closer scrutiny. Although the completed studies stated that universities have had a substantial need for equipment, none of these studies can be used to determine current needs for one or more of these reasons: the study focused on only one discipline; significant changes have occurred in  the type and cost of equipment needed since the study was completed; the study's results could not be extrapolated to nationwide need; and the study is still in progress. One on-going study being conducted for the National Science Foundation by Westat, Inc. is discussed in detail since it may provide more thorough information than any study to date.

This report provides a summary of local project evaluations and an assessment of the extent of program implementation and progress toward achieving project goals. In addition, the report seeks to establish the basis for evaluating project effectiveness in 1987 by clarifying the role of in-service teacher training in the improvement of students' mathematics competence and its relationship to issues of program evaluation. The report includes comments on: the decline in and efforts to improve students' mathematics competence; enactment of the CMP; implementation of the project; the nine  local California projects; goals and objectives of the projects; progress to date on local project activities; and local project evaluations. A summary and conclusions are also included. It is pointed out that the project has made reasonable progress in implementing its mandated goals and objectives and that successful achievement of the goals is likely to hinge on issues related to the geographic distribution of mathematics skills training; attention to the needs of females, minority, and low-income students; and project evaluation.

In addition, learning in the sciences is enhanced by systematically organizing content, by attending to the lecture and textbook, and by practicing or reviewing material in an organized fashion. The guide is divided into three parts. Topic areas in these parts are: (1) basic mechanics of notetaking (considering briefhand, concept headings and words, organizers, and the schedule plan); (2) lecture notetaking (focusing on the  notetaking process, outlining techniques, and the key word and summary method for taking and reviewing lecture notes); and (3) text notetaking (considering the process of taking text notes and the seven commonly agreed on approaches).

The two story elements studied were (1) context (descriptions of observable circumstances and observable actions) and (2) substance (descriptions of the internal character, feelings, desires, and beliefs of the actor). A total of 59 students were asked to read various versions of stories and rate (1) how impressed they were with the account, (2) how they perceived the main character in the story, and (3) how much the account made them feel inclined to be more virtuous. Latin squares and matched sample designs were used in the research design. Findings include the following. Substance alone and context alone produced perceptions of similar levels of human virtues in main  characters. However, the addition of context to substance increased story receivers' ability to perceive virtue in a character more than the addition of substance to context. Accounts containing only context were more impressive than those containing only substance. Making both elements explicit in the same story improved its impressiveness as well as its motivating power. (Author/RM)",

Following the program description (part 1), part 2 focuses on the purpose of the program, which was to discover the conditions necessary for a successful campus-based effort. Part 3 describes previous efforts in this region to integrate women's studies into the curriculum and presents demographic characteristics of the participating campuses. Part 4 identifies four categories of program goals: (1) to integrate the study of women into core or departmental curricula, (2) to conduct faculty development  programs aimed at general course revision, (3) to build networks of faculty interested in research on women and in transformation of the traditional curriculum, and (4) to expand educational options for women students in nontraditional curricula. Part 5 describes short-term outcomes concerning faculty/administrator cooperation, network development, faculty awareness, resource development, policies affecting women students, visibility of women's studies, student awareness, and professional development. The final part concludes that support from the local administration, women's studies expertise, a core group of committed individuals, and an impetus for reform are essential to program success.

The first article, by Ronald Cohen, considers questions pertinent to anthropological diplomacy, including the impact of diverse cultures on the diplomatic process, the importance of cultural symbols in negotiation, and the supranational character of international agencies. Next, Vivian J. Rohrl addresses the anthropological study of international law. Comparison is made between the international community of states and a tribal society. The Fulbright Program's effect on Philippine-American cultural and educational exchanges is discussed by J. R. Francisco in the third  article. Next, Marc S. Micozzi focuses on the diplomacy of international medical assistance. The importance of cultural context to effective medical care and the medical drawbacks of currently offered health care programs to underdeveloped nations are discussed. The impact of ethnicity on politics within and between states is considered in the fifth article, by Paul J. Magnarella. The pro-Israel lobby's effect on U.S.-Middle East policy is cited as an example. In the final paper the use of coercion in international affairs is addressed by Walter L.

First, the opening speech discusses the importance of the free flow of information, the historical growth and current dominance of information flow by Northern hemisphere countries, the roles of the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) and UNESCO in the controversy, and the conference goals of encouraging cooperation between Northern and Southern hemisphere blocs on this issue. The remainder of the text contains the rapporteurs' report on conference proceedings, subdivided into three parts. The first part places the conceptual conflict over information policy into historical context and examines the role of national  governments in media regulation, the conduct of journalists, and the potential impact of NWICO on information policy. The next part reviews practical programs to strengthen information systems in developing countries; UNESCO, the International Programme for the Development of Communication, United Nations activities, public and private sector efforts, journalist training programs, editor training programs, and tecnology transfer. The final part of this section cites eight recommendations formulated at the conference.

Part 2 focuses on problems facing today's working women including inequity in pay; climbing poverty rates among female-headed households; a high and growing incidence of poverty among elderly women; a lack of support services, most notably child care and care for the elderly; lack of flexibility in work arrangements to accommodate family responsibilities; low pay rates and absence of fringe  benefits for part-time workers; and inequities in tax laws, social security, and pension plans. Part 3, policy agenda for working women, presents specific policy recommendations supporting increases in full employment; employment opportunities; pay equity; child care and other support services; alternative work schedules; tax, social security, and pension equity; and a restructuring of the welfare system. Tables showing labor force participation rates of women from 1950-1982, probability of labor force entry and exit by females 16 years of age and older, and percentage rates of employed workers on part-time schedules are also included.

        "description":"A secondary analysis of survey data obtained from 331 Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, residents shortly after the 1980 presidential election showed that self-interest exerts a strong influence on voting behavior. Self-interest is the degree to which an issue impinges immediately and tangibly upon an individual's private life. Respondents were asked to list the top two political issues of most importance to them. The survey also included 10 items which objectively assessed the respondents' self-interest on economic matters, making it possible to determine the respondents personal agendas, i.e., how they ranked the issues in terms of importance for practical purposes. For example, respondents were asked about the frequency with which they compared prices for groceries, their  satisfaction with their take-home pay, and similar types of questions. Using these items to form an index of self-interest, it was hypothesized that for those respondents who indicated a primary concern with economic issues and who were personally involved with these issues, a stronger relationship would be found between their self-interest index and their vote choice. The hypothesis was supported. (RM)",

Subjects were 166 males and 68 females, ages 12-15 years, enrolled in a summer residential program for talented youth. Mean SATM scores for the experimental population were 605 (males) and 575 (females). Students completed a battery of self-report personality tests, including the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which ascertains a person's preference for thinking or feeling and for introverted or extroverted activity; the Adjective Check List (ACL); the Self-Esteem Checklist; and the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI). A large number of these math-gifted boys and girls had significantly different  preferences for taking in, evaluating, and using information. A connection between thinking preferences and math ability and between social activities and math ability was indicated for girls. High math ability girls tended to be socially introverted and \"thinking\" types when compared to normal ability girls of the same age. The question is raised of whether these social tendencies may widen the gap between males and females in the use of their abilities, i.e., whether the tendencies may affect the decision to pursue math careers. Tables provide information on several of the tests performed. (LP)",

Following a summarization of world hunger problems, the report addresses specific ways to deal with world hunger. Short-term goals include taking immediate action to ensure that poor people are not hungry, assuring that infants and children are adequately nourished, eliminating diseases resulting from specific nutritional deficiencies, and providing disaster relief. Long-term goals involve the provision of equitable growth, redistribution of existing wealth, production of enough food, and development of a system of world food security. Recommendations for U.S. action involve commitment and action in the following areas: (1) developing more equitable trade and  debt policies, (2) ensuring that corporate investments made by private U.S. companies do not harm, but aid the fight against hunger and poverty, (3) ensuring that there are adequate food supplies even during times when production is low, (4) ensuring that development assistance goes to the countries and people who need it most and that it is as effective as possible, (4) overcoming domestic hunger, and (5) establishing an organization to educate and inform the American public about hunger and malnutrition.

        "description":"A feminist critique of development literature, with specific sub-Saharan examples, shows that development studies and projects are rooted in Western male world views. Researchers, guided by prevailing theory, ask questions about power, control, work, and social life from the point of view of the powerful, i.e., the men. Male research subjects tell their side of the story and interpret female behavior from their perspective. Development studies generally lack appropriate technical and conceptual tools with which to study women's positions in society. It is crucial to the advancement of women and of feminist scholarship and to the successful outcome of development that the question of the subordination of women be considered by researchers and that feminist scholars be familiar  with the development literature. By teaching about women in development, educators can make students aware of the complexity and variety as well as the universality that characterize humanity and force them to reevaluate assumptions, models, and paradigms.

The battery was given to 1,003 female soldiers and 980 male soldiers before they had begun Army Basic Training. Criterion measures which represented physical competency in Basic Training (physical proficiency tests, sick call, profiles, and separation data) as well as on the job (lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling activities) were correlated with the soldiers' scores on the physical ability tests. The performance measures (criterion performance tasks) were designed to evaluate proficiency in the performance of tasks determined to be important in physically demanding Army jobs (Lift, Carry, Push and Torque). The criterion performance tasks were administered to the 951 soldiers who  had completed Advanced Individual Training (AIT). Results indicated that test validity was high (R=.84). The Lift to 60 inches exercise accounted for 67 percent of the variance in criterion performance, while Lean Body Mass (LBM) and the Upright Pull test accounted for an additional 3 percent and 1 percent respectively. The fairness analysis showed that there were nonsignificant slope differences and only slight intercept differences which suggested minimal overprediction for women. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"Although the research base on teaching, learning, and effective schools has expanded, the results of that research have been implemented only to a limited degree, either in the classroom or in the training of teachers. One of the accusations that have frequently been made against teacher education is that it does not use a theoretical, research-based body of knowledge in its training programs, thus perpetuating the practice of teaching as a craft rather than as a profession. In June 1983, the 15 Nebraska institutions of higher education with teacher education programs formed the Nebraska Consortium for the Improvement of Teacher Education, with the goal of improving teacher education by facilitating the introduction of research findings into their programs. As a first major  activity, the Consortium decided to hold a workshop on the utilization of research on teaching and learning in teacher education programs. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln agreed to organize and manage the workshop; each of the 15 institutions agreed to establish a team which would attend the workshop and develop a plan of action based on the workshop sessions. This monograph's 11 papers are drawn from that workshop, held in Lincoln, Nebraska in November 1983. (JMK)",

The definition of classroom management is limited in this discussion to those managerial behaviors related to maintenance of on-task student behaviors and the reduction of off-task or disruptive behaviors. Classroom management is viewed from the perspectives of preparation for the school year, in-class activities, and teacher monitoring behaviors. Specific teacher behaviors and techniques are discussed within each of these categories. Recent research concerning classroom management by Jacob Kounin (1970) and Anderson, Evertson, and Emmer (1979) forms the basis for most of the discussion. Four alternative classroom management models (Redl's Model  (1959), Canter's Assertive Discipline Model (1976), Dreikurs' Model (1980), Glasser's Model (1969)) are briefly described and implications for teacher education are discussed.

Thirty-eight of the respondents taught in a large inner-city junior high school composed of equal percentages of White, Black, and Hispanic students. The remaining 33 respondents taught in a small, suburban school in an affluent district with a predominantly white student population. The first section of the questionnaire dealt with classroom management techniques, characteristics of students viewed as discipline problems, and corrective measures employed in the schools. The second section asked for rank ordering in importance of the major causes of discipline problems, the most frequently occurring problems, and ways to improve discipline.  Results showed that a majority of the teachers agreed with over half of the statements presented in the first section, and that they were in solid agreement that discipline problems were greater in the inner-city school. When teachers ranked in order of importance the major causes of discipline problems, problem frequency, and ways to improve discipline, few rankings were found statistically different. Analysis of responses indicated that teachers recognize the need for competence in classroom management, feel a need for administrative support in handling problems, and are receptive to more training in classroom management. Several suggested guidelines for inservice planning are discussed. (JD)",

On the basis of observations, logs, interviews, and introductory questionnaire data, life age/cycle profiles of each of 10 middle and junior high school teachers were constructed. Each teacher completed questionnaires to describe character-related personality stages of development. Three test instruments were used to determine teachers' levels of moral reasoning, ego maturity, conceptual complexity, and interpersonal sensitivity. The teachers' stages of development were then related to their perceptions of the change process and the process of collaboration during  the Action Research Project. Developmental stage profiles of the teachers were then constructed. The data suggested themes on the relationships of individual dimensions of teachers' stages of development, issues in the teaching-schooling profession, and the process of collaborative research.

Fourteen first through fourth grade teachers in two elementary schools participated. The Instructional Skills Observation Instrument was used to measure the teachers' ability to apply four instructional skills: anticipatory set, instruction, guided practice, and independent practice. Each teacher was observed four times, twice teaching reading and twice teaching mathematics. The teachers then participated in three full-day inservice sessions, scheduled once a month, to be trained in the Hunter scientific teaching model. The training  consisted of presentation of theory, modeling of the skills, practice with feedback, and on-site coaching. Subsequent observations indicated that the teachers as a whole were able to appropriately apply the skills and strategies they had been taught. Interviews, inservice evaluations, classroom observations, and field notes identified several intervening and school context variables that appeared to influence the application of the skills in the classroom.

Proposals for innovation in teacher education are not in short supply. What is most problematic is incorporating such changes into the institutional life of faculties of education. A study identified how changes occurred in 10 Canadian Faculties of Education and how various influences, such as government policy and faculty governance, interacted with and influenced those changes. Changes were analyzed using Bryden's notion of policy spirals and Chinn and Benne's classification of change strategies. The faculties were found to be far more immune to external pressures than other institutions. In terms of  change strategies, both power coercive and normative re-educative strategies were in evidence, but rational empirical strategies were not. Study results contribute both toward the information about how program and organizational change should be managed in higher education as well as the more theoretical questions of governance and organization.

Results from an analysis of the data reflect the need for using paraplegics as subjects when conducting research designed to elucidate specific exercise prescription regimens for paraplegics. The American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for exercise prescriptions are probably not valid for this population during arm work because the assumption cannot be made that the heart rate and oxygen uptake relationships of paraplegics and able-bodied subjects are similar.

The model was developed as a computer program. It was designed in a similar manner to that of various problem solving simulations that use the &quot;production system&quot; approach. The program has been used to simulate results from choice reaction time, stimulus repetition, dual channel monitoring, and conflicting stimulus (Stroop) paradigms. Several questions arose during development of the model concerning human performance in situations requiring attention allocation. Experiments were conducted that indicated the mediation of attention allocation by stimulus frequency occurred through the automatic processing system. However,  attention allocation mediated by warning signals occurred through the controlled processing system. Further studies suggested that individual differences in the ability to control attention were specific to a stimulus modality, rather than to a generalized ability to control attention. The theoretical framework developed and described here has been used as an integrative device to order the literature on individual differences in cognition, verbal comprehension, and techniques for assessing an individual's ability to memorize and recall information.

The following research questions were addressed: (1) Do the Ebel and Angoff methods result in the establishment of different competency standards? (2) Do vocational evaluation field personnel and vocational evaluation educators establish different standards? and (3) Are the standards determined by the different methods moderated by group membership? The raters were 19 vocational evaluation field personnel and 24 vocational evaluation educators from university settings. Significant  differences were found between rating methods across groups; the Ebel method resulted in a higher mean competency standard. The groups of raters also set significantly different competency standards across methods; the field personnel established a higher mean competency standard. The importance of this group difference was minimized due to the significant interaction between group and method; here, the group difference was greater using the Angoff method.

        "description":"The study examines the relationship between success upon leaving an alternative school program and immediate measures of program effect. The strength of the relationship was used to determine the degree to which the program effected its long term goals of preparing students for future academic or vocational success. Student success was defined as behavior reflecting adequate academic skills and attitudes toward education. It was measured by ranking three outcomes in descending order: return to formal education; securing employment or a general educational development (GED) diploma; not returning to school, not working, or not pursuing the GED. The immediate measures of program effect were reading achievement, mathematics achievement, absenteeism rate, disciplinary referral rate,  change in absenteeism of disciplinary referral rates, and attitude toward school. Students assessed were between the ages of 13 and 20 who had participated in an alternative school program stressing small group instruction and vocational/prevocational training sponsored by five Louisiana school systems. The regression model accounted for 25 percent of the variance in student outcomes. Age, mathematics achievement, and absenteeism rate were the only variables which had a probability level of less than .05. The relationship was positive for mathematics achievement and negative for age and absenteeism. (Author/DWH)",

Three characteristics of anchor tests were under consideration: the number of anchor items, and the range and average of difficulties of the anchor items. The data were taken from the nation-wide norming data of the Otis-Lennon School Ability Test, Form R, Intermediate Level. Anchor test characteristics did not show systematic effects on final calibration results. The removal of misfitting persons was detrimental to calibration results.  Further studies are needed to clarify the effects of anchor test designs and person fit on linkings. (BW)",

        "description":"The relevance of testing to curriculum is measured by the closeness of fit between test items and major program objectives. In this paper two procedures for analyzing the curriculum/test overlap are compared. The first method obtains a detailed analysis of a priority area of the curriculum. The process brings the curriculum into alignment with the test. It is a structured, sequential, rational, and objective method to be conducted by the classroom teacher. However, without structured available time and guidance from district administration, the analysis will probably not be accomplished. The process requires a long period of time to achieve a comprehensive appraisal of the match between the district assessment tool and curriculum. The second method involves an independent  consultant who assesses the degree to which the district assessment tool measures objectives across content area and grades. The results are presented by subject area and grade level along with a statement of recommendations. This method results in a comprehensive assessment of the overlap between curriculum objectives and test items. The process is subjective and prone to inconsistencies. Achievement of changes in classroom practice by teachers is primarily dependent upon the district leadership's ability to see that innovations are implemented. (DWH)",

These include systematic development, quality, user orientation, strategic distribution, multiple channels, widespread distribution, sequential implementation, support systems, cost feasibility, multiple patterns of use, time on task, integrated use, user satisfaction, individual growth, organizational change, and societal contributions. The assessment should be done after a product has been in use for a  period of time. The logical continuation of this research would be to quantify the dimensions and criteria.

The Louisiana SPUR (Special Plan Upgrading Reading) Project was evaluated by the Louisiana Department of Education Bureau of Evaluation. SPUR involves 63 of the state's 66 public school systems and is implemented by a field-based staff of approximately 60 technical assistants. The size and geographic dispersion of the program led to several problems in data collection and evaluation use. The SPUR field staff often acted as data collectors for the evaluation, a procedure that demanded careful quality assurance of instruments and activities. With potential audiences ranging from state legislators to classroom teachers, no single  report could meet all needs for evaluative information. In the first year of the evaluation, data collection methods were developed that could be easily used by SPUR field staff and would have utility beyond the evaluation itself. Examples were developed cooperatively by the evaluators and program staff members. The instruments serve management and program improvement needs as well as providing evaluation information. Although the data collection systems described are specific to the SPUR evaluation, their development and use is applicable to other large scale evaluations. (Author/DWH)",

Because the media help shape public opinion, educators need to carefully plan a comprehensive reporting campaign which quickly and accurately gets information on MEAP test results to media representatives. Preliminary steps include: deciding the purposes of communication; selecting goals; and determining the person in the school district primarily responsible for coordinating the communications program, writing news releases, and working with media representatives. This coordinator should establish personal contact at each newspaper, radio, and television station in the school district area. Two types of communications  should be made to reporters: (1) a background report before test results are released, focusing on the purpose of MEAP tests and how the results will be used; and (2) a report on actual test results, carefully organized and including other measures of school district achievement. The communications program should be evaluated and modified annually. Any program must be accompanied by appropriate efforts to use MEAP results to review and revise curriculum and instruction. Appendixes contain a MEAP fact sheet, a sample news release, sample data charts, suggested reporting topics, and a reporting campaign planning chart. (BS)",

        "description":"Using qualitative and quantitative methods in a single research project has been the subject of controversy. Purists argue that qualitative and quantitative approaches derive from different, mutually exclusive epistemologic and ontologic assumptions, and cannot be combined. Situationalists focus on methodology and assume that data collection and types of evidence flow logically from a particular methodology. Although both approaches may be used in a single study, quantitative and qualitative data cannot be combined. Pragmatists argue for the integration of methods in a single study. The authors agree with the pragmatic view, and further argue that both methods can be used fruitfully for corroboration, elaboration, or initiation, and that neither necessarily takes precedence over  the other. To illustrate this point, specific examples of the contributions of qualitative and quantitative methods to corroboration, elaboration, and initiation are presented. They are taken from a large scale, three-year study of regional educational service agencies. The data collection methods included surveys as sources of quantitative data and open-ended interviews and reviews of documents as the primary sources of qualitative information. (BW)",

Chapter I describes the establishment of the program in order to relieve overcrowding in schools and provides a history of the larger study, which began in 1980. It also provides an overview of the sub-study design and objectives  (to compare YRS student achievement levels with students on traditional schedules, and to define the nature of instruction in year-round schools). Chapter II presents the sub-study methodology, which targeted fifth graders, and Chapter III consists of findings and recommendations. It is reported that no systematic achievement differences between YRS and traditional students exist, and that the performance of YRS students tended to improve after beginning the program. Appendix A, Section B, assesses the attitudes of parents at YRS schools. Using a revised questionnaire, this study reports parent/student attitudes that are more favorable than those documented in earlier years. Section B concludes with a collection of supplementary tables containing response statistics. (KH)",

        "description":"In a study of academic attribution patterns, teachers were asked to suggest causes for the successes and failures of students whose backgrounds had been manipulated to provide various combinations of social class (middle, lower), race (White, Asian American), and gender. It was found that teachers cited causes internal to the student more often for success than failure, and teacher-related causes more frequently for failure than success. It was also found that the more similar the student's background to the teacher's, the more likely the teacher was to \"count\" the student's successes and \"discount\" the failures. Middle class White successes were more likely to be attributed to internal stable causes than were Asian and lower class successes. White female successes were more  likely than failures to be attributed to stable effort causes, while White male and Asian student data did not reveal this difference. Also, teachers took more responsibility for Asian females' failures than successes and for Asian females' failures than Asian males' failures. Overall, student background results provided ambiguous evidence concerning whether prior expectations or outgroup prejudice, or both, influence attributions. Lower class students, a low expectation outgroup, showed the least favorable attribution pattern. Asians, a high expectation outgroup, showed more favorable attributions than lower class students but less favorable patterns, relative to middle class Whites, than prior expectations might have predicted.

In terms of fiscal effects and patterns, it was found that: (1) the 28 districts studied experienced smaller cuts in the two years after implementation than in the year before it, (2) substantial funding cuts did occur in some of the districts, and (3) second year block grant funding levels showed considerable stability (with some exceptions). In the area of desegregation, 16 of the 24 districts that had Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA) funds in fiscal year 1981 spent at least part of their Chapter 2 funds on desegregation-related activities in 1983-84. Overall,  desegregation-related projects accounted for 19 percent of Chapter 2 funding. The money spent on such projects in 1983-84 was, however, only approximately one-quarter of the amount spent two years earlier with ESAA funding. Finally, approximately 14.3 percent of the total Chapter 2 allocations in 1983-84 provided services for private school students; it appears that this was proportionately more than under under the antecedent programs.

        "description":"The California Roundtable (CRT) played a critical role in the shaping and passage of California's Senate Bill 813 (SB 813), the State's major education reform legislation enacted in July 1983. This working paper analyzes the content of the legislation, assesses its likely impact on student performance, and recommends steps the CRT (a consortium of business executives) might take to support improved student preparation in California. It is predicted that the new law will have a measurable effect on performance. And although student preparation for college and work may thus improve somewhat, additional legislative and non-legislative steps, the report holds, must be taken to bring the State's students up to an acceptable level. If the Roundtable chooses to remain active in helping  to improve student performance, it should--according to this assessment--support legislation that: funds SB 813's reforms for 1984-85 and beyond; establishes essential personnel reforms omitted from SB 813; and strengthens measures that are included in SB 813 in incomplete or weakened form. Moreover, the Roundtable should actively seek long term solutions to the problem of providing adequate and stable financing for the public schools. Finally, in the non-legislative area, the Roundtable is encouraged to support the current plans of the Joint Business-Education Task Force on Mathematics and Science Education, and the establishment of a network of effective business/community/education programs. Extensive appendices to this report include (A) Reform provisions of SB 813; (B) Comparison of  CRT legislative agenda with SB 813; and (C) the authors' recommendations for a new teacher certification process and a new principal selection and evaluation process.

Part I explains the study's focus on language diversity and how it is addressed within the educational systems of the countries studied. It is assumed that the role ascribed to language is a key one to a better understanding of the position of various cultural groups in a society. The study methodology and content are described. (A set of simultaneous case studies were taken, each developed according to a common frame of reference.) Part II discusses the distinctions drawn between  each country for the purpose of analysis: historical and ecological considerations; geographical boundedness versus dispersal; time the special population has been within the national boundaries; government policy on culture and language; the permanence/impermanence of the language/cultural minority group; and governmental policymaking (centralized versus decentralized). In Part III, the data from all five countries are analyzed collectively in relation to three themes--organization, finance, and governance. A postscript reiterates that language and literacy policies accurately reflect social and political conditions. A concluding section recommends areas for further study. (KH)",

        "description":"This statement paper presents the Department of Justice views on S.2568, the &quot;Civil Rights Act of 1984.&quot; It begins with an affirmation of the administration's equal resistance to discrimination and intrusive expansion of Federal power, but asserts that recent legislation has created unnecessary conflict between these objectives. The paper then argues that the Supreme Court's decision in &quot;Grove City College v. Bell,&quot; which held Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to be program-specific in its coverage, was correct. There then follows an explanation of why the wording of S.2568, which was conceived as an attempt to broaden Title IX's coverage, is poorly drafted. It is argued (1) that the term &quot;recipient,&quot; as used in the bill, is open to the broadest possible  interpretation, (2) that the bill would expand coverage without adequately explaining how the statutes are to be enforced, and (3) that S.2568, as worded, would create serious administrative complexities for Federal agencies that are already over-burdened with paperwork. It is also held that enforcement, implementation, and probable litigation costs would be staggering to the Federal government. (KH)",

The report is based upon a 1983 survey of 150 &quot;Krome Haitians&quot;; intensive anthropological fieldwork results are also included. The socioeconomic and cultural adjustment conditions affecting this population are described. These include background in Haiti, experiences in the United States, past and present employment status, experience with discrimination, and adaptation to American society. The report notes that neither the Krome Haitians nor earlier arriving Haitian entrants conform to the common negative stereotypes (unskilled, uneducated, and rural). Nevertheless, the Krome Haitians are  found to be less skilled, less educated, and more rural than the Haitian entrants who arrived before 1981. The social isolation and employment problems that result from the changing characteristics of Haitian immigrants are discussed. Particularly emphasized is the relatively high proportion of Krome Haitians that has been forced into the &quot;secondary sector&quot; of the economy--with 48 percent of the Krome group earning less than the minimum wage. The report concludes with some specific policy recommendations to State and local agencies and individuals that will assist the Haitians' integration into American society. Also included are 27 statistical tables. (Author/KH)",

        "description":"This paper details the factors contributing to the wage structure of Hispanic men and compares the wages of Black and Anglo men. The major finding is that controlling for differences in observable personal characteristics--such as education and work experience--substantially reduces the wage differences between Hispanics and Anglos. For example, among Mexicans the observed wage differential for men is about 30 percent. Yet once the differences in personal characteristics are controlled for, the differential drops to 6 percent. This remaining 6 percent differential is attributed to labor market discrimination. After controlling for differences, the differential attributable to discrimination for Puerto Rican males is 18 percent, for Black males 14 percent, and for &quot;other Hispanic&quot;  males 12 percent. The Cuban-Anglo differential can be completely explained by differences in observable personal characteristics, especially recency of arrival in the United States and language handicaps. These factors, along with low education and discrimination, also seriously handicap Puerto Rican men. Other findings include the following: (1) Mexican and &quot;other Hispanic&quot; men have significantly lower wages in States where Hispanics are a large fraction of the population; and (2) minority men (except U.S. Mexican-Americans) have lower wage returns to education than Anglos.

After a discussion of economic theory underlying the statistical models employed, the 1976 Survey of Income and Education are subjected to direct, reverse, and structural regression analysis. In addition, data from the Federal Government Central Personnel Data File are subjected to direct and reverse regression analysis. Overall, the results of the three analysis techniques support the following findings: (1) minority women do not generally suffer substantial wage  discrimination relative to comparable Whites; (2) minority men may suffer discrimination in terms of both wage offers and actual average wages, and estimates of the magnitude of both kinds of discrimination may be subject to serious measurement error bias; and (3) wage discrimination against minority males (particularly Blacks) is greater in the Federal than in the non-Federal sector, while earnings discrimination against minority males (particularly Blacks) is smaller in the Federal than in the non-Federal sector.

Two fundamental measures of labor market success--average hourly earnings and salary earnings over a year--are employed as dependent variables in the analysis. Before adjusting for differences in observable characteristics among the groups, Hispanics fell between Whites and Blacks in terms of earnings. After adjusting for differences, Hispanics were closer to Whites. A major difference among the groups was education, an important determinant of earnings; among employed Hispanic youth, however, almost three-fifths of the males and over a third of the females were  dropouts. Post-school experience was also an important determinant of earnings. In-school experience has positive effects on yearly earnings, while post-school training was a significant determinant of hourly earnings for men (except Mexican-origin men). Hispanics living in the South or in high unemployment areas did worse than the older groups, while married Hispanic men had higher hourly and yearly earnings than unmarried men. Finally, although the analysis shows no more labor market discrimination against Hispanic women than against White women, it suggests that Hispanic males would earn 7 percent more hourly if they were not discriminated against.

There were substantial differences in unemployment among Hispanic ethnic groups: Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban men had a higher incidence and longer average duration of unemployment than Central and South Americans and &quot;other Hispanics.&quot; For Mexicans, lower schooling levels were the single most important factor. For Puerto Ricans, the large inflow of recent,  increasingly rural, and unskilled Puerto Rican migrants contributed to their higher unemployment rate. Low education levels played an influential but secondary role. Cuban men were especially vulnerable, with higher probabilities of unemployment and multiple jobless spells than the other Hispanics.

Hispanic youth joblessness rates are found to be quite high, between 30 percent and 40 percent, due primarily to relatively long spells of nonwork after a job loss.

Findings show that, among Whites, the general factor of family background--especially parental education--appears to be the major determinant of educational attainment. Also, those White students with foreign-born fathers finish high school more frequently and those with either parent foreign born enter college more frequently. Positive school effects in this group include higher teacher-student ratios and private school attendance, with the latter affecting college attendance as well as high school completion. On  the negative side, Whites stay in school a shorter time and finish high school less often when Blacks and Hispanics are present. For Mexican Americans, general family background factors are also important: large family size and low parental education are related to poor school attendance and to delay, while mother's education significantly increases the likelihood of high school completion. The foreign-born are less likely to be in school and more likely to be delayed. However, having a foreign-born mother has a positive effect on educational attainment among Mexican American youth. No patterns emerge from school and social environment measures. (CMG)",

The study shows that considerable separation and insularity characterize the settlement process. Undocumented workers maintain a certain social distance even from the Mexican-Americans in the community. This both indicates some containment of their labor market mobility and suggests that national origin per se is not the sole dimension of ethnicity determining how workers fare in the U.S. occupational structure. Undocumented workers do not attain status  through occupational mobility, but rather by financial accumulation. Their prospects for mobility in the U.S. occupational structure are largely intergenerational; few undocumented workers themselves escape the exploitation of low-skilled, low-paying jobs. (CMG)",

(5) Doesn't the use of the home language in school become a crutch that can slow down children's transition into English? (6) The rationale for bilingual education seems sound enough, but why does it also have to be bicultural? Why do the schools have to teach  anything other than the mainstream American culture? (7) Isn't there a greater danger of segregation in bilingual education than in monolingual education because of the language grouping practices that are used? (8) Why is the research evidence on the effectiveness of bilingual education so inconclusive? It seems uncertain whether bilingual education really \"works.\" (9) Quebec has had major problems with bilingualism. Isn't bilingual education going to create the same problems here? (KH)",

        "description":"During 1982-83, the first of three projected program cycles, the Title VII English as a Second Language, Special Education Developmental Approach Curriculum Project (ESL-SEDAC) provided direct instruction to 246 handicapped limited English proficient students in schools throughout New York City. Resource assistance, staff development, and parent training activities were also part of the program. Despite some delays in implementation, the project was initiated successfully, and all program objectives were fully or partially attained. The proposed criteria for student achievement were met in English language listening, speaking, reading, and writing; and responses on participant questionnaires indicated that the staff development workshops were effective and well received. The  program also made progress toward full attainment of its parent involvement objective. Finally, the program compiled and field-tested a comprehensive curriculum, &quot;Day by Day in English: An ESL-SEDAC Daily Living Skills Curriculum Guide,&quot; which will be printed and ready for distribution early in the 1983-84 cycle. The following recommendations are offered for continued program effectiveness: (1) continue to provide services to students, parents, and classroom teachers; and (2) consider conducting an assessment of training needs of staff, depending on their prior training, experience, and the language backgrounds of their students.

These services included an instructional and non-instructional component, development of curriculum materials, personal and academic counseling, referrals to outside agencies, family contacts, staff development, and  parent involvement activities. Quantitative analysis of student achievement indicated that, with few exceptions, the performance of program students met or surpassed most of the program's criteria.

Originally implemented in two community school districts at four school sites, the project focused on parents of Spanish-, French/Creole-, Greek -and Italian-speaking primary level students with limited English language skills. Parents participated in classes in ESL and in high school equivalency test preparation. In addition, program staff offered workshops designed to increase parent understanding of New York City school system operations and role-playing workshops designed to increase parents' self-confidence in being advocates for their children. Also taking place as part of Project Parents was the ongoing evaluation and acquisition of curriculum materials, the  development of materials for those language groups for which commercial items were scarce, and staff development activities. Participating parents were assessed in high school equivalency and attendance. Their children were assessed in English and Spanish language ability, English reading, and mathematics. Quantitative analysis of parent and student achievement indicated that (1) gains made by program students in listening/speaking and reading/writing were statistically significant; (2) in Spanish, students demonstrated no significant change in listening/speaking (due to high pre-test performance), but improved their reading/writing test scores; (3) moderate to large gains were made on the California Achievement Test; (4) third graders made large gains in mathematics; and (5) l9  participating parents passed the General Equivalency Diploma examination.

        "description":"This study focused on the identification and description of environmental characteristics and their relationship to basic skills exposure. The objectives of the study were to identify the major factors that characterize environments in which learning is intended to occur, and to delineate patterns of co-exposure to basic skills and environmental factors in secondary classrooms and work-site settings. Four programs were studied, including two different models of experience-based career education, one of cooperative distributive education, and a traditional academic program that included part-time work. All programs had a work site as well as a classroom component. Observations were recorded live in the form of comprehensive field notes; overall, 193 observations of 45 students  were obtained. Six basic skills were identified: psychomotor, reading, computing, speaking, reasoning, and writing, while 12 environmental factors were defined, including simultaneous tasks, self-initiation, working cooperatively and other work site features. The findings of the study included the following: (1) the programs and settings exhibited different patterns of environmental factors; (2) the relationship between exposure to basic skills and programs and settings was not the same for all programs and settings, i.e., classrooms were significantly higher on exposure to reading and writing skills, while psychomotor and reasoning skills were more frequently used in the work site; (3) the environmental factors, when combined into the six factors of importance, support, control,  complexity, feedback, and relational, affected the use of different basic skills. The study concluded that career and vocational education programs can provide students with as much exposure to basic skills as they would have in a traditional classroom. Further research is needed to clarify these issues and to establish causal relationships. (KC)",

In each program five persons were interviewed: two mentors, two students, and one program staff person. Students were in eleventh or twelfth grade or recently out of high school. The interviews collected from the three types of informants parallel information of their perceptions of (1) what occurred in the mentorship that was related to employability development; (2) the value of the mentorship experiences, and (3) factors that affected the mentorship. Activities that were indicated as important to employability development included learning about a particular job, skills in talking and listening to others, learning about rules and how people behave at work,  and exhibiting mature workplace behavior. Almost all students felt the mentorship had an effect on their future plans; for some the mentor had been the most important influence. Staff and mentors saw the mentorships as positively and significantly helpful in preparing the young person for work. Students and staff most often cited the strengthening of personal and interpersonal skills growing out of the mentor relationship as proof of a successful mentorship.

Areas of study have included adults' existing experience and needs, information and advisory services and the use of them, the nature of current adult participation, barriers to access, and educational alternatives. Four other interrelated questions have been studied to meet the needs of adult students, expressed as  follows: &quot;What kinds of structures and organization meet the needs of what kinds of students for what kinds of courses, at what level of costs?&quot; An information survey was commissioned to provide information on estimates of expenditure on continuing education and fees for different types of courses and students. Other reports have focused on needs of priority groups. Indications of the Council's impact have been acceptance of the term &quot;continuing education&quot; and educators' raised awareness.

Fifty percent of this sample (596 participants) returned questionnaires. The survey results showed that the majority of the participants were younger married men, while married females constituted the second largest group. Most of the sample population were under 50, while a third were under 25. Most of the learners had graduated from high school, and many had some  college education. The primary motivation of those who participated voluntarily in non-credit adult learning experiences was that they wanted to learn more, expand their minds, and develop special skills. Most of the reasons for enrolling were for perceived non-economic benefits as compared to economic benefits. The highest perceived benefit of the learners was &quot;improving interest or skill in learning more,&quot; followed by &quot;becoming better informed about some knowledge area or subject.&quot; The four groups reported different perceived benefits. The level of satisfaction with the learning experiences increased with the number of learning experiences completed. The questionnaire is appended. (KC)",

        "description":"Prior to 1960 vocational and technical education in Singapore received little attention. After Singapore attained self-government in 1959, a policy of diversification to accelerate economic growth through industrialization was adopted. The emphasis then shifted to technical education and training. In 1964 there was a significant move towards the establishment of secondary vocational schools and the first vocational institute was initiated; the secondary vocational schools were later phased out in favor of vocational institutes. The Industrial Training Board (ITB) was created in 1973 to centralize, coordinate, and intensify industrial training. The ITB and the Adult Education Board established in 1960 were merged into a single national authority responsible for vocational  training--the Vocational and Industrial Training Board. The significant factors that have impinged upon the trend of vocational training have been the limited human resources, the New Education System of 1980, and the strategy of high economic growth based on industrial restructuring. Recent developments and major efforts to consolidate the training system have been the expansion of training capacity, refinement of the training system, and upgrading of the existing work force. Four tables and four figures are appended that depict full- and part-time enrollment, apprentice registration, and organizational structures in the educational system. (YLB)",

        "description":"In this paper the system of coordination within the broader framework of education and technical manpower training is examined. The development of technical education in the schools and of programs offered by the public institutions is first described. A discussion follows regarding technical manpower training, the responsibility for which lies outside the school system and which is undertaken by different public institutions. Coordination of technical manpower development is considered. The closely linked system of progression between the schools and vocational training is then elaborated upon by focusing attention on the joint efforts of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB) in introducing a mechanism of automatic registration  and a Pre-Vocational Training (PVT) program. Two tables and three figures are attached that depict areas of study in the technical education program, proposed PVT projects, the system of automatic registration, and features of the MOE-VITB system of progression.

        "author":["Wendling, Wayne R."],
        "description":"In 1982 plant closings in the United States affected approximately 1 percent of the country's manufacturing facilities and 1 percent of its manufacturing labor force. Included among the reasons cited for plant closings were low productivity, high wages, and inflexible work rules. Given the nature of the reasons for plant closings and the magnitude of the problem, collective bargaining may be the most appropriate institution to solve the problem. Collective bargaining can address the specific issues in a plant and may lead to a solution to meet the needs of both management and labor. An examination of the case law that has evolved in the formulation of judicial interpretations of the duty to bargain and the actual contract provisions negotiated in major collective bargaining  agreements helps to place into perspective the role that collective bargaining can play in averting plant closings. Assuming that plant closure is a mandatory topic of bargaining, it is recommended that bargaining occur in, and only in, those instances in which there is a real probability that bargaining could lead to a solution. In no instance, however, should more than 90 days be permitted to elapse between the notice of closure and the resolution of the problem, be it a new agreement permitting continued operations or closure of the plant. (Appended to this report is a discussion of the special impact of plant closings on older adults.) (MN)",

Descriptive data showing the extent to which men and women have experienced work interruptions are presented, followed by an analysis of the impact of work interruptions on earnings. The tables in the report show the proportion of persons with work interruptions and the proportion of potential work years spent away from work for the reasons surveyed. Work interruptions were reported by sex; by race and Spanish origin; by years of school completed; by occupation; and by life-cycle status. The data were gathered by a panel survey of approximately 9,000 households that were visited at three-month  intervals over a period of a year and a half beginning in February, 1979. The data were then inflated to represent the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States and members of the armed forces living off post or with their families on post. The data presented cover persons 21 to 64 years of age who ever worked. (The study concludes that work interruptions explain only a small proportion of the earnings differential between men and women.) (KC)",

The study was conducted in four phases. During the first phase, the requirements for an effective OJT system were defined. This phase was followed by a feasibility analysis of computer-based Integrated Training System (ITS) design alternatives. In the third phase, ITS specifications were developed, while ITS development and demonstration alternatives were analyzed in the final phase. The study concluded that there is great potential for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of  mission-oriented training by the application of computer technology to the functions of instructional management, scheduling, reporting, external evaluation, and recordkeeping.

Some of the issues raised in the testimony and prepared statements submitted by the witnesses included the disincentives that retirement plans and forced retirement create for older workers, the earnings test of Social Security that makes it less desirable for older persons to work, and the stereotypes many employers entertain in refusing to hire older workers. On the other hand,  some employers who have hired older workers testified that the seniors make extremely reliable, dedicated, and able employees, and that they often surpass younger workers in knowledge and devotion to the job. Suggestions were made for legislation that would increase the age discrimination prohibition age, and provide financial incentives to private sector employers to hire older persons. (KC)",

In 9 of the 12 samples studies, a mathematics subtest (either arithmetic reasoning or mathematics knowledge) had the highest single-predictor validity correlation with course grade criteria. When the subsamples were combined, a composite of arithmetic reasoning, paragraph comprehension, and mathematics knowledge test scores had the highest multiple R with the criterion, significantly higher  than the correlation obtained for the composite of subtests currently used.

Although women's employment is clearly related in part to their increasing recognition of the importance of self-development and some measure of independence, two-thirds of America's employed women have a very clear and present economic need. In addition, increasing numbers of women are recognizing that they will, in all probability, be both homemakers and wage earners. Nevertheless, women's paid employment creates pressure for changes in the internal dynamics and organization of family life. With  increasing frequency, men must assume tasks traditionally thought of as women's responsibility, a process that is not without problems for families. To help alleviate these problems, policymakers must develop policies to provide for adequate child care, sufficient wages to permit families to afford child care, stronger safety nets to support families in crisis, and continuing preventive services for families.

This new role for women has led to dramatic and rapid changes in attitudes, as well as in the institutions and laws relating to women's work roles and conditions of employment. Despite the rapid change in women's work roles associated with the transformation of the household, a significant gap still exists between the pay received by men and that received by women. One consequence of this gap has been the feminization of poverty, a problem that affects younger and older women alike. Included among the many needs created by the transformation of the household are the need  for social services for families, for flexible working arrangements and increased part-time employment opportunities, and for eliminating existing inequalities in the tax laws and in Social Security. A policy agenda for working women must begin by rejecting outmoded stereotypes about women's work and by recognizing the needs of women as providers. Particularly needed are provisions guaranteeing equal pay, adequate child care and support services, and equal employment opportunity for members of both sexes. (MN)",

In addition, these women of color face higher unemployment rates than do white women. Whereas the entry of large numbers of white women into the work force is a fairly recent phenomenon, black women have had a high and steady rate of employment dating back to the 1800s. Hispanic women share many labor market similarities with black women. In the period from 1960 to 1980, the number of black private household workers began to decline as the proportion of black, female clerical workers increased; however, black women were still more heavily represented in blue-collar women's jobs than were white women. Like their  black counterparts, Hispanic and Asian women tend to be overrepresented in certain low-paying, low-status jobs. Despite the fact that women of color generally receive substantially lower wages than do white women, more of them are likely to be employed full time and to be working for economic reasons than are white women. The wage gap that exists between white and nonwhite women has many implications for the family, a situation that must be addressed by policymakers. (Appended to this report are 11 tables detailing employment and wage patterns of white and minority group women.) (MN)",

The curriculum materials, which are suitable for reproducing and handing out to students, combine basic skill development with content drawn from students' experiences and daily concerns. Topics covered in the reading lessons include finding out about one's past, women and the world of work, nontraditional work, working conditions, solutions to the problem of illiteracy, and balancing work, home, and self. Each lesson consists of a short story written in the first person, discussion questions, and language activities, such as phonics.  The guide also contains information about the Women and the World of Work project, the theory and methodology of teaching the adult non-reader, the mechanics of reading, and how to use the language activities.

        "description":"This report summarizes the findings and implications of a study that examined the potential for expanded use of satellite-related telecommunications in vocational education, focusing on the short-term potential of satellites in the areas of instruction, training, administration, and governance. The investigation found that a variety of education-oriented experiments with satellite telecommunications have been conducted since the 1960s. These have shown that satellite systems require strong commitment among sponsors and participants and clear incentives for use, including a careful match of technology to educational needs. Today, state educational telecommunications networks are found to be at varying developmental stages, with Alaska's system using satellites pervasively. With  vocational education's need to keep current and reach widely dispersed audiences and new clientele, satellite applications are envisioned as beneficial in a number of ways, with great potential for instruction, training, and professional development. Increasingly, video teleconferencing and other programs such as telecourses afford interactivity so that training and instructional purposes can be met more readily. A number of specialized satellite-based projects currently underway should be monitored by vocational educators for their adaptation in program improvement work. Before any satellite-based solutions to vocational educational needs can be implemented, however, issues related to software, &quot;peopleware,&quot; and hardware must be confronted, and more intense study must be made of the  needs of potential users. The appendix includes several substantive reports by technical experts, telecommunications providers, and educational &quot;adopters.&quot; A glossary and extensive references complete the document.

        "description":"This project was designed to provide a model for secondary and postsecondary educators in planning and developing a well-articulated competency-based delivery system focusing on high-technology training. The model was to be implemented in several vocational-technical programs so that secondary students would acquire the necessary competencies to enter comparable high-technology programs at the community college level. The project involved the cooperative efforts of the Jo Daviess-Carroll Area Vocational Center, the Stephenson Area Career Center, and Highland Community College, all in northwestern Illinois. Staff members from each institution cooperated in writing a transportable model of a well-articulated competency-based secondary-postsecondary high-technology curriculum  adaptable in any Illinois setting. The model outlines the procedures for analyzing the components of such a program, constructing the program, coordinating the program with business and industry, implementing the program within the existing curriculum, and recording the participating students' progress through the program. The competency-based task lists developed as a part of the project, as well as more detailed information about the task listing procedures and task transcript, are included as appendixes to this report. They cover the following topics: communications, mathematics, mechanical drafting, electronics core, hydraulics-pneumatics, and computer BASIC. (KC)",

The study was conducted through telephone interviews with special needs coordinators of 38 of the 39 colleges. The results of the study indicated that special needs services are usually under the direction of a full-time mid-level college administrator who has duties in other areas. Types of services offered by the community colleges include traditional support services, course alternatives, and equipment-related resources. Most coordinators expressed a  desire for more information about all possible services such as adaptive coursework, diagnostic testing, and radio, television, or telephone courses for the homebound, along with additional information on personal assistance. The study also found that relatively few colleges offered specialized transitional planning and job placement services to special needs students beyond those provided to all students, but that the colleges appeared to respond to the transitional needs of special needs students on an individual basis. Recommendations stemming from the study included hiring full-time special needs coordinators at each college and providing them with inservice training, providing more special needs services, and conducting an assessment to determine the need for school-to-work  transition services.",

The study attempted to validate program components that have previously been associated with retentive capacity. Seventy-six exemplary programs for dropouts were selected to participate in the study. Directors of the 76 programs were mailed a survey that included a list of 18 program descriptors that they were asked to rank in order of importance for dropout prevention program success. Surveys were returned from 44 of the 76 programs, and represented 26,052 dropout students. The four program descriptors that were ranked as the most effective in working with dropouts were self-concept development, work attitudes/habits,  interpersonal/life skills, and motivation. The four program descriptors that were ranked as the least necessary were interagency cooperation, job development, staff upgrading, and community service. The teaching factors considered to be extremely important to retaining dropouts reflected those skills that are part of fundamental classroom management: rules are established and clearly communicated, and performance standards are clearly communicated. Respondents also indicated that it was extremely important that the teacher was considered approachable. In addition, respondents rated counseling services as important. Based on the results of this survey, recommendations were made for improving dropout prevention programs. (KC)",

        "description":"A statewide survey was conducted to determine the availability of a career development course at the high school level in Illinois. The participants in the study were the directors of vocational education in the 597 high school districts that submitted Local Plans for Vocational Education to the Illinois State Board of Education in FY 1984. They received a questionnaire at an annual meeting, and 80 percent returned them. The study found that career development courses are not available to students in the majority of districts in Illinois, even though most districts reported that the course would be helpful to students. The major barrier to the development of the course is the limited amount of time available in a student's schedule. Several alternatives could be explored to  ensure that students are systematically exposed to career development activities: (1) the course could be required in the freshman or sophomore year, even if the school day had to be lengthened or study halls eliminated; (2) the content of the career development course could be infused into various required subject areas--an option favored by many career educators; or (3) a teacher advisement system could be adopted, involving the training of teachers to conduct a systematic series of activities during a daily advisement period. Survey respondents also expressed a need for inservice training for persons teaching career development and for a set of curriculum guidelines and related materials. The study recommended that districts should investigate the alternatives and move forward on  career development activities for their high school students. (KC)",

Data on a comprehensive set of occupations were obtained from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) job ratings and from the archive of Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) research. Factor analyses of these data indicated that jobs can be characterized by three major competency dimensions: academic aptitudes, psychomotor aptitudes, and dealing with people. Occupations were classified into 36 groups according to their demands for each of these general competencies. The specific skills, activities, and working conditions of individual occupations were  examined to show to what extent the jobs within the occupational groups vary in their more specific demands. Academic aptitude was found to be only one dimension distinguishing jobs; different jobs required very different combinations of abilities. Implications were derived for designing high school programs to further the employability of youth with only low to moderate academic skills.

The data on which it was based were the ratings of required worker traits as given by the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT). The practical and theoretical usefulness of the classification was examined according to seven criteria: valid job descriptors, comprehensive occupational coverage, comprehensive aptitude coverage, a comprehensible map of job differences, parallel assessment of people and jobs, a link to demographic data, and multiple levels of analysis. Data for job descriptor validity were positive but inadequate. The DOT ratings provided  quite comprehensive coverage of jobs and reasonable coverage of academic and motor, but not interpersonal, aptitudes. Map structure was readily comprehensible. A way to assess jobs and people in parallel ways was not provided. The Skills Map was readily linked to demographic data available according to the Census Bureau's 1970 classification of occupations. It provided a global classification of occupations according to their general differences and additional detail about the aptitudes and activities that individual occupations require.

Areas of emphasis were the apprenticeable trades and other blue-collar work. The goal of the project was to assist 50 disadvantaged women through two six-week instructional programs, career information, counseling, and individualized tutoring. A comprehensive outreach and recruitment effort involved newspaper and television coverage, radio public service announcements, announcements on campus, brochures, and staff visits to various agencies. Individual counseling and support services began almost simultaneously with recruitment efforts. Tutorial  services were offered at no cost. Two workshops focusing on blue-collar work and the trades were offered. Classes featured role models/speakers, and a career survival skills class for individuals considering the trades was offered. Field trips to nontraditional job sites and College of Marin shops were conducted. Activities for non-native English speakers included small classes, field trips to nontraditional job sites, and compilation of career resource materials.

It was found that project participants experienced a grade point average less, but not significantly less, than their college-wide counterparts. An analysis of student course selection, by division, clearly showed that enrollees had jobs in mind when they made their choices. Responses to a participant post-survey indicated that the unemployed were not likely to return to former employers and needed  to consider how best to market themselves; 16 participants indicated that the program aided them in securing work, although only 10 had secured work; and almost 60 percent felt the program added a skill or ability to their resume that will aid their reemployment.

The average number of total credits earned in vocational education was greatest among graduates of schools that are located in the North Central region of the country; located in rural, as opposed to urban or suburban areas; and small (less than 600 students). The extent of student participation in vocational education was found to be related to race/ethnicity, cognitive test performance, socioeconomic status (SES), and high school program. Students who earned the most credits in  vocational education were Hispanic, scored in the lowest quartile on the cognitive test battery, had a comparatively low SES, and were in a vocational program.

        "description":"Three keynote addresses from the W. Arthur Cullman Symposium are presented in this booklet. The first address, \"Global Productivity: New and Renewed Perspectives,\" was delivered by John G. Keane, Director of the United States Bureau of Census. In his address, Dr. Keane proposed five guideline perspectives: recognizing emerging global unification forces, enhancing globalization perspectives, extending the productivity-planning time horizon, adopting zero-based thinking, and realizing government's role. He also stressed that the opportunity for global productivity continues to improve as its need escalates. In the second address, Hans B. Thorelli, E.W. Kelley Professor of Business Administration at Indiana University, explored \"Productivity, Multinationality, and the  Business-University Network.\" Dr. Thorelli said that a new focus is needed on the holistic and qualitative aspects of productivity, whether in business or in academia. Productivity also calls for multinationality and a revamping of the school-business relationship to encompass global concerns. Finally, Billy C. Christensen, Vice President and General Manager of IBM World Trade Corporation, spoke on \"Global Productivity: Society's Goal, Business' Imperative.\" In his address, Mr. Christensen noted the need to think about the U.S. economy as part of the world economy rather than a self-contained unit and the need for increased productivity to compete in that world economy.

An executive summary provides an overview of the contents: background, highlights of findings related to consequences, interpretations, and implications for the future. Following an introduction, chapter 2 discusses extension in terms of its development, organization, roles, relationships, and resources. The next four chapters describe the four program areas: agriculture and natural resources, home economics and nutrition, 4-H youth, and community and rural development. The following program consequences are identified for each program area: agricultural extension programs have contributed significantly to growth in agricultural productivity and efficiency and have  increased average net income per farm; participants in extension home economics and nutrition programs report savings from home gardening, food preservation, home repair, sewing, and upholstery refinishing; the most visible consequence of 4-H was participation itself; and community and rural development programs have taken an initiating role in addressing needs of disadvantaged citizens. Chapter 7 summarizes the economic and social consequences of the extension programs. An epilogue reviews and interprets issues highlighted during the evaluation as they related to questions concerning institutional support, role, programs, objectives, clients, funding, and other aspects of the Cooperative Extension Service.

An evaluation of the report by the citizens' review panel critiques the objectivity and thoroughness of the evaluation report. It finds that the evaluation would be more accurately described as an in-house report and that the data are insufficient and sometimes misleading, especially regarding adequacy of funding levels. A short history of the cooperative extension system provides a general analysis of how and why extension has functioned as it has over the years. Extension history is divided into seven eras, each representing a significantly different set of environing circumstances from that which preceded it. An  attempt is made for each era considered to define the most important elements in the social, economic, and political milieu; to indicate the typical and significant programming and program planning trends; and to note how the cooperative organizational structure responded to and supported certain of the institution's thrusts. A report of visits to several county extension programs provides general observations and discusses variation and flexibility. Specific observations are made about four individual programs and about black land-grant colleges in the South. (YLB)",

Safe, efficient use of the body in performing finishing tasks is stressed in the procedures. Besides procedures, the manual also deals with knowledge related to drywall finishing. The manual consists of 11 modules covering the following topics: filling compounds, safety, applying bead, taping and wiping tapes, filling, texturing, repairs and  corrections, factors affecting drywall finishing, working efficiently, maintenance of tools and machines, and estimating. Each module contains an introduction that describes the contents of the module; an information section illustrated with tables, line drawings, and photographs; a summary; and exercises. An answer key completes the manual. (KC)",

The connection is illustrated in a model that includes the components of aspects of the family, aspects of careers, family functions, trends, and career development interventions. The family-career connection is further explored in a chapter defining basic concepts about the family (family membership, individual needs, coordination patterns, life-cycle stages, and relationship to the outside world) and about individual careers (salience, developmental stages, decision making, and occupational opportunities). The next chapter charts trends in the emerging career roles of women, the emerging child care and household roles of men, and the  effects of parental employment on children. The final chapter reviews the implications of this information about families and careers for the improvement of career development and family life education. Six goals for strengthening the family-career connection are outlined. Examples of existing program strategies and recommendations for program development are provided.

        "description":"To clarify and examine conventional wisdom and stereotypes about adult literacy, this paper focuses on the approaches of individually oriented and community-oriented programs. An examination of the literature base (encompassing research reports, informal accounts, manuals and handbooks, and theoretical, philosophical, and policy articles) leads to the conclusion that these different approaches work successfully with different segments of the illiterate adult population. The underlying issues of conflicting definitions of illiteracy, the nature of the reading process, characteristics of illiterate adults, and the purposes of literacy education are elaborated. A discussion follows of the implications of these issues for the choice of program models and of approaches to such program  aspects as planning and evaluation, instructor preparation, curriculum, and instructional methods and materials, from the standpoints of the individual orientation and the community-based orientation. This information is synthesized in a concluding chapter that presents a series of recommendations for the improvement of literacy education: a wider range of program models, greater emphasis on community-oriented efforts, more leadership from literacy educators, a state and national context for literacy programs, new models of teaching-learning interaction, increased input from illiterate adults, and additional research on reading processes, competency-based education, volunteers, student characteristics, and educational technology.

The first section discusses the nature of adult development, its definition, and key concepts. Sequential patterns of change in adulthood are examined in section 2, focusing on models formulated by Jung, Buhler, Erikson, Havighurst, Levinson, Gould, Sheehy, Loevinger, Perry, Kohlberg, and Fowler. Questions about the existence and nature of sequential models and the universality and generalizability of stage theories are aired. The next section provides a sampling of other approaches to development: the issue of personality change, the themes of work and love in adulthood, and the concept of life events and  transitions. The second half of the paper explores the interrelationship between adult development and adult education, suggesting that an adult's motivation and need for education are most likely propelled by life-stage concerns and tasks. The paper concludes with practical applications of adult developmental research to adult education in the areas of program development, instruction, and counseling. (SK)",

The implications of the recent national study reports on education are examined for each level, and standards of excellence and recommendations for action are suggested. First, Joel H. Magisos considers how secondary vocational education will be affected by the national report recommendations. Describing what constitutes excellence at this level, he lists an agenda for action to influence policy at state and local levels. Next, Madge L. Attwood reviews implications for postsecondary vocational education curriculum, teachers, and teaching, focusing on the need for balance between excellence and equity.  The increasing importance of adult vocational education in an era of demographic change is emphasized by Susan Imel, who discusses factors affecting quality in the diverse programs at this level. Finally, Ruth Pierce Hughes reports on the recommendations of the national studies as well as extant research on teacher preparation, especially the education of beginning teachers, and makes specific suggestions for vocational teacher education.

To investigate the masculinity-femininity construct using the BSRI under standard self-description instructions and under self-description instructions in one of two specific sex roles, two studies were conducted. In the first study, 41 pairs of parents of 4- to 9-month-old infants twice completed the BSRI, the Carey Infant Temperament Questionnaire, a survey of infant behavior, and a description of themselves in the mother/father role. In the second study, 79 college students (47 males, 32 females) completed the BSRI and described themselves as a college student and then in the boyfriend/girlfriend,  spousal role. An analysis of the results of both studies showed that self-descriptions on the BSRI were not stable across social roles. In 75% of the cases, when subjects described themselves in the roles of mother or father, student, or boyfriend or girlfriend, their scores on masculinity and femininity changed significantly from their descriptions under standard instructions. Both studies also showed that adopting specific sex roles, such as parent or romantic partner, did not increase sex role traditionalism. The findings support a multidimensional conception of sex roles. Future research should focus on the relationship of specific sex role characteristics to global sex role stereotypes. (BL)",

To investigate the experience of actual test anxiety (TA) compared to its anticipation and recollection, 502 college students completed 10-item alternate forms (A and B) of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), developed from the 20-item form X. Form A was administered one day before an examination, under either &quot;imagine&quot; instructions or standard (&quot;now&quot;) instructions. Form B was administered either: (1) before the examination, with standard instructions; (2) one day after the examination but before examination feedback, with recall instructions; or (3) after feedback, with recall instructions. An analysis of the results showed  that imagined TA was higher than actual TA. Subjects receiving imagine instructions at first testing later demonstrated higher TA than those receiving now instructions at the first testing, reflecting lower performance associated with higher TA. Anticipated TA was higher than actual TA. No significant effect of feedback on the recollection of TA was found. Females were higher in recalled TA than were males. These findings offer further support for the validity of the STAI. (BL)",

        "description":"Several self-report studies of mood and activity have produced evidence of culturally biased theories which people share about the relationship between affect and behavior. In these studies, biased reporting may have been increased by taking mood and activity ratings concurrently rather than employing lagged independent ratings. To identify activities which are associated with mood, and to determine whether these associations are a function of private self-consciousness (PSC) and internality, 71 college students completed the Self Consciousness Scale, the Internal-External Scale, and 3 self-report mood and activity scales. The first self-report scale was completed before bed, the second scale the next morning, and the third scale before bed the following night. An analysis of the  results showed that subjects who were highly aware of their internal states (as indicated by the Self-Consciousness Scale) and who possessed a strong internal locus of control were more likely to demonstrate relationships between self-reported mood and daily activities. Activities associated with mood were exercising, complaining, socializing, and studying. The findings suggest that a population of accurate reporters would be a prime target for the study of the self-regulation of mood. (Author/BL)",

Prior to viewing the vignette, the counselor was introduced with either high or low status information. Subjects also completed counselor evaluation measures. An analysis of the results showed that subjects given the high status introductions held more positive help-seeking attitudes; but under the control vignette, subjects who  observed the low status counselor ascribed to more positive attitudes toward seeking help. The low status counselor was perceived as more expert, attractive, trustworthy, and more willing to help than the high status counselor. The cigarette-smoking counselor was evaluated lower than the non-smoking counselor on all dimensions, with the pipe-smoking counselor falling in between.

Subjects were selected on the basis of their responses to the Ethics Position Questionnaire. After rating the confederate, subjects were asked to give him negative feedback suggesting that he had a low IQ (clearly a lie). Subjects were told that the information was simply feedback (nonsalient moral norm) or was a lie (salient moral norm). In addition, one half of the  subjects were offered money for giving the information, while the other half were told the feedback would improve the test-taker's later performance. Subjects' compliance with the request was measured and self-evaluations were taken. An analysis of the results showed that, although positive consequences for self and salient moral norms led to decreased lying, highly idealistic subjects unexpectedly behaved the most immorally. Situationists and absolutists usually lied no matter what the consequences or the salience of moral norms. Exceptionists were less likely to lie if they would benefit personally. Subjectivists were less likely to lie if they stood to gain from the lie and the action was labelled a lie. (Author/BL)",

To explore the relevance to drinking of the need for social approval in social situations, 36 male college students were asked to predict how much they would drink in several situations varying in how certain they were of their social standing in a group and whether or not drinking was a behavior approved of by that group (uncertain-drinking valued, uncertain-drinking not valued, and certain-drinking valued). Subjects were divided into high and low need for approval groups based on a median split of their scores on the Marlow-Crowne Social Desirability Scale. Results showed the nature of the situation and the subject's need for approval were both significantly  related to predicted drinking behavior, with a certain social situation and a low need for approval leading to the most drinking. Contrary to expectations, there was no interaction between situational factors and the need for social approval. (Author/JAC)",

Subjects, with either a stereotyped (conservative attitude) or a nonstereotyped (liberal attitude) toward women, as measured by the Attitude Towards Women Scale, worked under the guidance of a female leader, who adopted either a task-oriented or a relationship leadership style. After working on the tasks, subjects completed questionnaire measures of the leader's abilities,  their perceptions of the leader, and a checklist adapted from the SYMLOG method of group observation (Bales, 1980). An analysis of the results showed that biases against female leaders based on subordinates' intuitive prescriptive \"theories\" about leadership and their stereotyped expectations concerning men and women do exist. In general, more conservative group members rejected the task-oriented female leader, while more liberal group members preferred a leader with a strong focus on the task. (BL)",

In the first study, 54 college students answered questions about the passage either with or without reading the material. Results confirmed that recognition was dependent upon exposure to the text rather than upon knowledge of dreaming. In the second study, students (N=64) completed the EPPS achievement scale, and then read the text while a taped voice read the material. Subjects received the recognition task under one of four instructional sets: semantic focus (concepts and ideas); nonsemantic focus (specific words and phrases); irrelevent focus; or control-no instruction. There were no  effects for instructional set on either semantic or nonsemantic recognition items. Both high and low achieving males scored low on the recognition task, while moderate achievers scored higher. Females showed no relationship between achievement motivation and performance. The third study (N=135) manipulated presentation rate (slow or fast) and expectancy (anticipated task difficulty). Slow presentation facilitated males' performance but did not affect females' performance. Achievement motivation facilitated recognition regardless of situation; expectancy affected only performance on the semantic items. (MCF)",

To examine loneliness among elderly widowers, 24 adult males (participants in a more comprehensive study of widowed men, aged 63 to 93 years) were interviewed and completed the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale, and Townsend's Index of Incapactiy. Twelve of the men said they were seldom lonely. An analysis of factors relating to loneliness showed that those who were not lonely were more positive about their life situations, more autonomous, and more independent than those who were lonely. Car ownership, amount of driving, going for walks, and having a hobby were  inversely related to loneliness. Those who could manage daily activities without difficulty or aid from another person were less likely to profess loneliness. Loneliness was statistically unrelated to frequency of contact with children, to self-reported feelings of closeness to children, or to being a father at all. Performing services for others and participating in volunteer activities decreased loneliness. Only two of the men reported having male confidants. The findings suggest that elderly widowers can overcome loneliness through activity and motivation. (BL)",

The themes of the CASE Groups (i.e., self-disclosure, trust, communication, anxiety, self-esteem, self-fulfilling prophecy, and small group behavior) are highlighted. Results are presented which suggest that after the  program some students reject education and teaching as a career choice, others change their major or focus, many intend to add to their areas of competency, and most continue with a renewed commitment to their career choice.

Following a statement of the proposed new direction in delinquency prevention, which focuses on the serious, violent, chronic delinquent, the four major findings of the committee are discussed: (1) a small number of youths account for a large proportion of serious juvenile crime; (2) since 1974 very little federal money has been directed at controlling the chronic, serious delinquent; (3) the wording of the Juvenile Justice Act diverts federal money to noncriminal aspects of delinquency; and (4) the 1974 act implemented a view of delinquency  prevention not consistent with what is now known. The principle recommendations of the committee are detailed including the establishment of a new federal policy focusing on serious juvenile offenders by providing research, dissemination, and training; encouraging innovation and diversity; assisting states and local governments in dealing with delinquency problems; and including all juvenile offenders in the federal initiative, even those tried as adults.

One dyad member was randomly chosen as the perceiver and the other member as the target. Perceivers received information concerning the client status of the target, and rated their impressions of the target on the Impression Formation Questionnaire (IFQ). After completing the IFQ subjects participated in a 10-minute tape recorded conversation. Following the conversation, targets completed a questionnaire on their impressions of the interaction. The behaviors of the dyad members  were rated from the tapes by judges blind to the experimental conditions. An analysis of the results showed that subjects formed more negative initial impressions of &quot;clients&quot; than of &quot;non-clients&quot; and acted more negatively towards them. Furthermore, these perceptions and reactions influenced dyadic interactions in ways that led to their behavioral confirmation. The findings suggest that social interactions should be structured in a manner that will break down stereotypic conceptions, thereby interrupting the behavioral confirmation sequence. (BL)",

        "description":"Both urine alarms and dry bed training (DBT) have been used in the treatment of enuresis. To investigate the acceptability of the most recent version of DBT and urine alarm training, two studies were conducted. In the first study, the evaluation of 42 parents, who had participated in an 8-week program of either DBT or urine alarm training, were compared. In the second study, 84 nonpsychology undergraduate students evaluated the two treatment approaches independently of their implementation. The students also evaluated the source of the program, i.e., self-help manual or professional counselor. In both studies subjects completed the Treatment Evaluation Inventory and the Semantic Differential Scales. An analysis of the results showed no support for the view that DBT is a more  acceptable or more effective treatment for enuresis than the traditional urine alarm. On the contrary, parents who had actually implemented the treatments rated the urine alarm procedure more favorably than DBT on both the Treatment Evaluaton Inventory and the Evaluative dimension of the Semantic Differential. Further, the two treatments were considered equally acceptable by those who had not implemented them. Finally, both treatments were considered to be more acceptable when offered by a clinic then when presented as self-help manuals. These findings suggest that dry bed training may not be the best treatment for enuresis. (Author/BL)",

        "description":"Exploratory research has indicated that interpersonal dominance is one of the strongest correlates of Type A behavior, although little effort has been made to demonstrate a link between the behavioral manifestation of interpersonal dominance and Pattern A responding. To establish such a link two studies were conducted. In the first study, extreme A (N=12) and extreme B (N=11) subjects, as determined by the Jenkins Activity Survey, judged differences in stimuli following an Asch conformity paradigm. The results, which were significant, showed that Type B subjects conformed twice as much as Type A subjects. The same task administered to a subset of the sample and a larger normative sample indicated that social pressure to conform was responsible for differences in judgmental  accuracy of stimuli (conformity measure). In the second study, all possible combinations of extreme As (N=42) and Bs (N=42) were matched in dyads to negotiate extreme bi-polar opposite positions on a &quot;teacher dismissal&quot; issue. Analysis of the process and outcome behaviors suggested that Type A individuals were unilaterally more dominant than their Type B counterparts. Future research is needed to define the situational parameters of the Type A individual's dominance behavior and the physiological concomitants of dominance struggles. (Author/BL)",

To examine the relationship between occupational status, marital status, and number of children among working women, a telephone survey of 1,232 Los Angeles adults (827 females, 405 males) was conducted. An analysis of the results showed that the largest proportion of women workers were married (49.9%), were in the 26- 35-year-old age group (29.4%), and had no children (61.7%). The majority of women in professional and managerial jobs were married or cohabiting. However, a larger than expected proportion of women with managerial jobs were widowed, divorced, or separated. A greater proportion of professional and managerial workers compared to  semi-skilled, unskilled, and service workers were childless. The percentage of women workers without spouses who were parents was similar to the percentage of married women who had children. (BL)",

        "description":"The reason that people think women and men differ in their general qualities may be that the two sexes tend to be observed in different social roles. To explore the sources of stereotypes about men and women several experiments were conducted. Most of the studies involved randomly selected college students who were presented with a description of a male or female stimulus person and asked to rate that person. Each experiment varied the aspect of social role that might account for gender stereotypes, including job status or designation as employee or homemaker, dual role, freedom of role choice, and part-time employment. In general the studies provided strong support for the social structural analysis of gender stereotypes. Beliefs that women are especially communal and men are  especially agentic reflect observations that women and men are differently distributed into homemaker and employee roles, which are thought to require different personal qualities. Perceivers formed their concept of women on the basis of observing a fairly high proportion of individuals committed to the domestic role, while men were observed primarily committed to the employee role. The fact that subjects judged personality attributes suggests that homemakers and employees differ not just in role behavior but also in their underlying dispositions. Efforts to remove gender stereotypes educationally may have relatively little impact compared with actual changes in the distribution of the sexes into social roles. (JAC)",

To address practical as well as theoretical concerns, two related sets of videotapes were prepared. The first set was designed to provide a stimulus for discussions of common supervisory problems. A role player presented a difficult supervisee role to each of three doctoral level supervisors, who illustrated one of three supervisory methods: skill development (teaching), personal growth (counseling), or integration (collaboration). Three short videotapes were made to illustrate each supervisory model. The second set of tapes recorded participating students' discussion of the videotaped role plays and their responses to the exercise. Although the  learning of those who participated in the filming may be the most dramatic, supervisory trainees who observe the videotapes and discuss their own reactions should also be better able to handle such situations in actual practice.

        "description":"This paper presents a flowsheet model describing the interpersonal process of adolescent identity formation in relation to peers and peer groups within a social-psychological context. The model describes a primary route, a secondary route, and a vicious circle as pathways toward identity formation in relation to peers and peer groups. In the primary route, individuals associate with a peer group. If accepted by the group and satisfied with their role in the group they will either comply with, identify with, or internalize the group's values, beliefs, and behaviors, and will possess an identity. Any route other than the primary route is a secondary route, and is assumed to involve more conflicts, frustrations, and trials. These are cases where the individual is either unsatisfied  or not accepted and will seek a new group or try a new strategy with the same group. In the case of the vicious circle the individual is not accepted after many frustrating attempts, and will either (1) keep trying, (2) become an internally-motivatived prosocial loner or (3) become an antisocial &quot;lone wolf&quot;. The model is likened to a production line with the final product being identity. The process is considered to be the same for female and male adolescents. (LLL)",

Counselors of Hasidic and Orthodox Jews should be aware of the special characteristics of these populations which separate them from other subcultures and subgroups, and which may play an important part in the psychotherapeutic process. A major problem in counseling both these groups stems from the Holocaust. Conditions such as postpartum reactions, symbiotic illnesses, and masochistic behavior may be encountered alone or in combination with other symptoms. Prior to treatment several issues must be addressed, including obtaining permission from the local Rebbe. Brief and highly dramatic therapy is often effective. Follow-up assignments may be helpful in channeling  guilt feelings. The therapist must be aware of his/her own feelings about the Holocaust and be prepared to deal with the anger clients feel toward others. Children of Holocaust survivors also are a vulnerable group; therapists should ignore the survivor syndrome and examine the extent of loss felt by their parents. (JAC)",

A comprehensive group treatment program was developed to increase the bulimic's comfort with herself and her body. Subjects were five single females (four college students and a nurse) who participated in 7 weekly sessions and a follow-up session 10 weeks later. Goals of the program were to help the women gain control over their lives and to identify and modify eating habits. Bulimia was presented as a learned habit rather than an incurable disease. Sessions dealt with coping, self-esteem, anger and assertiveness, cultural expectations, body image, and self-expectation. Preliminary results indicated that by the end of the treatment,  binging and purging were reduced by over two-thirds. The women also showed improvement in body image and self-esteem, and decreased depression, suggesting that bulimia may be more than a circumscribed eating disorder and that treatment of other areas may be necessary. Changes were maintained at follow-up with continued improvement in four subjects. One atypical subject became worse during the course of treatment, suggesting that all bulimics may not benefit from group treatment. Better screening procedures are needed to identify those persons.

The passages included two from grade-level social students selected on the studies texts and several from previous research efforts. Subjects were seen individually for 55 minutes by a teacher-examiner who read instructions aloud and recorded the subjects' nonverbal behavior. The open-ended test  questions were scored by two independent judges with a .94 agreement rate. The results suggest that self-perceived low ability comprehenders may be differentially helped by an adjunct aid, such as the graphic organizer. Inducement of lookback behaviors resulted in superior performance for that group when compared to the group of low ability comprehenders that was left on its own. (CRH)",

The four procedures were (1) reciprocal teaching/corrective feedback, which requires that initially the teacher do a considerable amount of instruction about and modeling of the four strategies using dialogue with the students; as the days of instruction proceed, the students are given more responsibility for initiating and sustaining the dialogue while the teacher guides this practice, using modeling and corrective feedback specific to each student; (2) reciprocal teaching/practice, identical to the procedure just described, with the exception that after the first four days, students continue to practice the  strategies by writing summaries, questions, points to be clarified, and predictions on assigned segments of text, while teacher feedback is minimal; (3) demonstration, which requires the teacher to demonstrate each strategy; and (4) treated control, in which the students are given worksheet activities regarding the four strategies. Subjects were seventh grade students in developmental reading classes. All groups used the same materials. Results indicated that the most effective of the four instructional procedures was reciprocal teaching with corrective feedback, followed by reciprocal teaching with practice, and the control treatment. The findings suggest the importance of such instructional components as the need to work within the zone of proximal development (the &quot;region of  sensitivity to instruction&quot;) and to use a scaffolded and proleptic approach (transfer of responsibility for learning from teacher to student).

        "description":"To explore how readers create textual meanings or interpretations from written materials, a study that investigated reading from a semiotic perspective was conducted. The study's design was based on the principle of prior ethnography and employed data collection techniques common to field studies: participant/intervention and interviewing. Fieldwork was conducted over a seven-month period in one fourth grade classroom. The primary heuristic was an instructional strategy lesson, introduced after a three-month period of prior ethnography, that called on readers to sketch their interpretations of materials read. The lessons and interviews were audio and video taped, detailed field notes were kept, and all sketches were collected. Data analysis was focused on three dimensions: the  interrelationship of fieldworker and respondents, the contextual constraints and resources in operation during the lessons, and the drawings that were created. Findings suggested that the children's interpretations were influenced by their embedded theories of the social situation, their skills as artists, and the nature of the activity of sketching. Within-class friendships and interest also played major roles in the process of constructing meaning. Overall, results suggested that from the theoretical and methodological perspective of semiotics it is more efficacious to view reading as more than mere representation, that models of direct instruction be reconsidered, and that the potential that transmediation across sign systems holds for curriculum development be explored.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine whether voice support helps children learn to read. Voice support involves reading to children while they follow the text, either informally as in bedtime reading, or formally, as in teacher or audiotaped readings of stories in the classroom. Subjects, 64 children just entering school, were unfamiliar with the 12 books used in the 24 instructional sessions. During each session the children had copies of the story, and some listened to an audiotape of the story, while some did not; some were encouraged to read each page while others only looked at the book; some heard up to six readings of a story; some heard only two. Each child had similar exposure time to the texts, even though the number of repetitions varied. Pre-instruction tasks assessed  prior reading knowledge. Post-instruction tasks included high frequency word lists, writing vocabulary, and &quot;spot&quot; and oral cloze games. The results indicated that voice support did produce an improvement in children's reading behaviors but only on the instructional materials. The differences failed to appear with unfamiliar books. The improvement in reading may have reflected only the increased memorability of texts provided by the voice support. (HTH)",

The subjects read a 1,000 word expository or narrative text. After reading, subjects completed two vocabulary assessment tasks on 15 target words from each passage, an individual interview, and a multiple choice test, both designed to test partial knowledge of word meanings. Results of within-subject, hierarchical regression analyses showed small but statistically reliable gains in word knowledge from context. Tentative extrapolations from the results and current estimates of the volume of children's reading resulted in the conclusion that  incidental learning from context accounts for a substantial proportion of the vocabulary growth that occurs during the school years.

Arguing that schools should help children learn social responsibility and prosocial behavior and attitudes, the paper provides a rationale for, and a perspective from which, school activities may be viewed according to a social orientation. The paper uses the work of 20th century philosopher Martin Buber as the basis of this rationale and perspective. Drawing upon the Buberian perspective, the paper describes three literacy learning classrooms, representing three different pedagogical orientations to literacy learning: (1) a traditional-eclectic literacy learning approach, (2) a mastery  learning approach, and (3) an open-informal approach to learning to read and write. The paper describes specific settings and events from each classroom in terms of Buber's notion of community building. (Author/FL)",

One approach is to give students a study sheet on the elements of the short story. The students should be led through the elements listed and given an opportunity to express their opinions about the importance or significance of the title; the type of story; and the theme, mood, tone, point of view, and techniques used by the authors. Having modeled, by working together with the class, an analysis of the elements of one short story, students can work together in small groups to discuss a second story, using their notes as a guide for discussion. A third story can be used to introduce the technique of webbing, a graphic means of  presenting related information. The individual assignment is to produce a webbing of a story of the student's choice. Another activity involves having the students create original short story awards, establishing the criteria for the award and choosing one of their short stories to be the recipient. Such activities can help students approach the tasks of analyzing what they are reading; defining important and supporting elements; and evaluating, interpreting, and supporting those evaluations. Appended are a study sheet, &quot;Guide to the Elements of the Short Story&quot; and several examples of the webbing technique. (HOD)",

For each task, the subjects began with prewriting activities involving selecting and exploring an event, then completed a first draft. On the third day of the assignment, they divided their drafts into thirds and completed a guided self-assessing form asking them to infer intentions, problems in fulfilling those intentions, and predicted revisions for each of the three sections. Next,  they revised the draft. All drafts and self-assessing forms were read and rated by three trained evaluators.

Results of the interviews reinforced the overall findings of research: proportionally little oral language instruction took place in the classrooms, and teachers used teacher guides to materials primarily as sources for vocabulary instruction. The following are among suggestions based on the findings: (1) educators  need to be convinced of students' need for instruction in written language and listening opportunities at all levels, (2) classrooms need reorganization to encourage authentic discussions, and (3) teacher training needs overhauling to include emphasis on the importance of oral language.

Subjects were told that -ment was the target and that they were to push a button when they found the letters -ment in a sentence. Reaction times were measured at all points. Results showed that the deaf subjects stored word  boundary items as base word plus ending (for example, payment as pay ment) but that they did not do the same with morpheme boundary items. It was further found that deaf subjects were sensitive to spelling changes. The findings suggest that deaf readers engage in visual word analysis while reading, doing so predominantly for the productive word boundary endings that do not cause spelling or sound changes.

Each cycle included DRTA instruction, mapping, discussion, and the writing of an essay based on an expository text. Students in the control group read the same assignments and wrote essays on the same topics under the same time restrictions, but did not have DRTA or mapping instruction. Rather, the control students were taught brain storming and clustering of ideas as a planning technique for writing. Results revealed that the experimental students used significantly more main ideas in their  essays than did control students, but that the experimental group of poor ability writers used slightly fewer subordinate ideas than did control group students.

In so doing, it may be possible to avoid some of the hazards that have plagued the field, such as unsubstantiated assumptions about beginning reading and how it should be taught, erroneous beliefs that maturation plays an overriding role in learning to read, and shortsighted approaches to assessment of young children's knowledge of and progress in early reading. Two case studies of young children demonstrated how to avoid these hazards. First, they showed that young children are learning about reading before they read, and that if researchers study children's attempts, they will be in a firmer position to offer reading instruction. Second, looking at  children's responses with contrasting tasks and with the same task over a period of time helped to demonstrate how reading experiences play a more substantial role in learning to read than does maturation. Third, studying children's patterns and attempts to participate in reading tasks gives richer information about what they are learning than does tabulation of their correct responses. (FL)",

Second, jargon is fun. It creates an in-group of the informed, a comfortable place to be, especially for a student writer. A final advantage is that speech act theory terms can be clearly defined and demonstrated in ways the student understands.

        "description":"Differences between reporting and classificatory functions in writing were examined in the responses of grade 10 and grade 12 students: 60 who were successful English students, and 60 on the borderline of passing in each of the grades. The reporting tasks required students to write compositions describing their first day in a high school or some similar event and to report on the most interesting television show they had recently watched. The classificatory tasks required students to write compositions on the problems of old age and of crime. Thus 480 compositions were analyzed in terms of five cognitive and four stylistic linguistic features. The analyses found that, as compared with reporting, the classificatory writing called for more abstraction, more tentativeness, more  clauses of condition and concession, and greater syntactical complexity. Classificatory writing discouraged students from prefacing, interrupting, and adding loosely to their core statements since it called for less free modification before the subject or between the subject and main verb, and for less modification set off by points after the main verb. In addition, there seemed to be a correlation (not investigated statistically) between the uses of the features characteristic of older and superior students and writing used to develop thoughts rather than merely to state opinions.

        "description":"Members of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication Public Relations Division were asked to nominate alumni, who were not full-time educators but who appeared to be excellent prospects for academic careers, for a study of attitudes of potential communication instructors toward teaching as a career move. The 27 nominees, most of them white, female graduate students or public relations practitioners, rated each of 10 factors as an advantage or disadvantage to public relations education. Overall, the results suggested a rather favorable view of public relations teaching as a job experience. However, most respondents believed salaries to be low and advancement opportunities limited considering the job experience and training required for academic work. Other  findings include the following: (1) those with substantial graduate education tended more than others to rate academic careers favorably in terms of opportunities for creativity and genuine service, (2) those with more public relations work experience saw less opportunity for advancement in an academic career, (3) almost none of the respondents expressed concern about direct or &quot;de facto&quot; discrimination about women or minorities in academe, and (4) several respondents expressed interest in adjunct-faculty positions, which they felt required limited commitment, without appearing to recognize the rather restricted role and lack of security attached to such jobs.

        "description":"Developing countries have addressed the problem of unequal world information flow by proposing the New World Information Order (NWIO), a set of guidelines suggesting a framework for the establishment of more equitable flow of information. Although the unanimous adoption of the 1980 NWIO resolution by Unesco has done much to legitimize Third World demands, the resolution has no legally binding force and it is unlikely that the developed countries will readily give up their superior position in the flow of information. Incorporating the NWIO principles into the body of international law would be one way to compel the developed nations to cooperate with Third World countries in establishing the NWIO. The resolution could become international law if (1) its principles become the  actual practice of states over a period of time, (2) bilateral treaties based on the resolution are created between nations, or (3) a convention--an intergovernmental treaty based on the resolution--is passed and ratified by member states. Developed countries are likely to benefit whether they obey or disobey future NWIO laws, but by broadening their perception of self-interest (i.e., by recognizing those concerns in which the good of lesser nations is also the good of developed nations) they may become willing to observe NWIO principles. Strategies for Third World countries to gain strength in information-related resources might make a crack in the existing information flow, at which time developed nations may be more ready to cooperate in establishing an equitable flow of information.

        "description":"A study was done to describe the typical new consumer magazine that was published in the United States between 1979 and 1983 and to determine the relationships between those magazines still being published (as of 1984) and those that ceased publication. A content analysis of 234 new magazines utilized circulation figures, commonalities of first issue, cover price, subscription price, publication date, magazine location, and frequency of publication, among other variables to discover the construction of a typical magazine for the period under study. It was found that the typical product could be considered as a fact sheet on the status of the new American magazines of the 1980s: a cover price of $2.00 and a subscription price of $14.00 per year, initially published bimonthly and  later shifting to a monthly frequency, and carrying 21 pages of advertising and 69 pages of editorial material. In studying the 26 most common variables that existed among the new magazines and their relationships to survival or death of the magazines, it was found that only two have a significant effect on the survival of the new magazine: the cover price and the frequency of publication.

        "author":["Hansen, Kathleen A."],
        "description":"To explore whether there is a recognizable point (a terminology-setting event, e.g., a scholarly conference, a special issue of a journal, or a particularly influential journal article) in the development of a new branch of knowledge that serves to codify a vocabulary for the researchers of that field, electronic and manual searches were conducted for materials published before and after a terminology-setting event in three areas: the agenda setting function of the press, the New World Information Order, and critical viewing skills. It was hypothesized that the number of items found would increase after a terminology-setting event. For each research area, the appropriate combination of manual indexes and electronic information systems was used. Results showed that the percentage  of items found both electronically and manually went from 8% before the terminology-setting event to 19% after. However, the percentage of items located only electronically actually fell from 55% before the terminology-setting event to 43% after. These results suggest that electronic information retrieval systems do not necessarily lead to an increase in the number of identified items, and that terminology-setting events have a much greater effect on the researchers in a field than on the information retrieval systems serving them. Producers of these systems may have trained incapacities to respond to the events and thus may systematically exclude new terms, since they are not in the &quot;speech communities&quot; that determine the language of a field.

        "description":"Genevieve Forbes Herrick was one of the foremost women reporters of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; during the 1920s and 1930s. Noted for her particular and consistent attention to women in national politics, her earliest political articles appeared in 1922, when she covered the Cook County primaries with an eye toward women contenders running against the Chicago political machine. She then covered the campaign of Ruth Hannah McCormick for the House of Representatives, and the succession of Hattie Caraway to her husband's United States Senate seat. Herrick occasionally used her own reactions and responses as a way of dramatizing the status of women involved in politics, and she often took a critical, even mocking, view of the political process. In her coverage of both parties' presidential  conventions in 1928 and in 1932, her analyses hinged on contrasting the parties' treatment of women, and in dispelling the myth of a women's voting bloc. She was greatly concerned when women in politics refused to be interviewed, and delighted in reporting the weekly press conferences of Eleanor Roosevelt. Mrs. Herrick's close friendship with Mrs. Roosevelt annoyed the &quot;Tribune&quot; publisher, who was opposed to Roosevelt and the New Deal, and ultimately caused Herrick to resign. Well after her resignation, the &quot;Tribune&quot; continued to report on her exploits, her visits to Chicago, and her speeches as president of the Women's National Press Club. Her reporting shrewdly analyzed the evolving role and status of women, and offered instructive models for women entering the political arena.  (HTH)",

        "description":"Although Eleanor Roosevelt's career as a magazine journalist has been all but forgotten, it was an important part of her public activity while she was First Lady from 1933 to 1945. In contrast to ideas then current, Mrs. Roosevelt insisted on her right to earn money from her magazine work while in the White House. There is also evidence that her magazine career was based more on her status than on the substance of her output. An analysis of the more than 60 articles she placed in general-interest magazines with national circulation was based on two criteria: (1) the degree to which they served as political propaganda for the administration of her husband, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and (2) the kind of advice and guidance they offered American women as they sought to cope with social  change. Her articles contained an important political dimension either through obvious partisan advocacy or by humanizing her husband's administration through use of human interest material. Her advice to women was conservative by today's standards--chiefly to define themselves in terms of their families. Yet she served as a liberating force for women by upholding the right of married women to engage in paid work and by popularizing the right of women to speak out on current issues, in contrast to the previous ideology that upper class women should remain apart from public life.

Like many women in the news, she was noteworthy because of her satellite status in relation to a man. Exercising some control over her public portrayal--if only to refuse to see the press to the extent it desired--she deliberately chose to present herself within the framework of sex-role stereotyping instead of presenting herself as a flesh-and-blood human being. The degree to which the press joined with her to present her in stereotypical terms raises the question of whether it was held captive by its own assumptions concerning the role of women.

        "description":"A cohort analysis of data gathered in three national election surveys (1956, 1968, 1980) was used to study the effect of media use on political knowledge, which was divided into knowledge of issues, personalities, and political parties. Knowledge levels were calculated by creating indices from open-ended questions about why a person liked or disliked a candidate. Since the number of questions varied in each study, Z scores were calculated and crosstabulated with each age group. The subjects were divided into five age groups (18-29, 30-41, 42-53, 54-65, and 66 and older), and the data analyzed for age, period, and cohort effects. Results indicated that all age groups declined steadily in media use from 1956 to 1980. The youngest cohort showed a stronger increase in personality  related knowledge than older cohorts; the youngest cohort also showed increased issue knowledge and political knowledge in general, while the older cohorts declined in both areas. The findings suggest that (1) the ability of the youngest cohort to increase in political knowledge while declining in media use may be explained by the existence of a &quot;media generation,&quot; rather than a television generation; and (2) the youngest group is more efficient in its use of media than the older groups.

(2) Will the amount of contact with journalists be related to the number of years in research, research productivity, or type of field? and (3) Will the amount of contact scientists have with the media be related to their attitudes toward popularization of science news or to the number of media contacts initiated by the scientists themselves? Findings showed that of the 153 scientists who reported interacting with journalists, 39% said that all of their interviews dealt only with their own research, but 61%  indicated that at least a portion of their interviews with journalists dealt with topics other than their own research. Scientists called upon to discuss non-research topics are somewhat less productive than scientists who are asked to discuss only their research. As their level of &quot;spokesperson&quot; activity increased, so did their feelings that the scientific community rewarded scientists for engaging in the popularization of science. Furthermore, scientists who served as &quot;spokespersons&quot; with some frequency were more likely to initiate contacts with journalists than scientists who do not serve as spokespersons.

        "author":["Beam, Randal A."],
        "description":"A secondary analysis of data collected by Thomas Patterson during the 1976 presidential campaign was made to test three hypotheses: (1) respondents in a media-rich environment will show higher levels of political information holding than respondents in a media-poor environment, (2) differences in information holding levels between a media-rich community and a media-poor community will be greatest at the lower levels of political interest and smallest at the highest levels of political interest, and (3) differences in political information holding between a media-rich community and a media-poor community will be greatest at the lowest education levels and smallest at the highest education levels. The original data were collected in Erie, Pennsylvania, and Los Angeles, California,  beginning in February 1976 and ending in November of that year, following the election. For each hypothesis, an incremental F test was used to assess whether the final term entered into the regression equation was responsible for a significant increase in the variance accounted for in information holding. The results suggest an interaction effect between media richness/media poorness and education, though it is small. It would seem that although effects were made to control for other factors believed to contribute to variance in the dependent variable, the study design could not directly take into account all potentially important variables that may contribute to the apparently higher levels of political information holding in Los Angeles.

        "author":["Yule, Valerie"],
        "description":"Spelling, a basic component of information technology, has been investigated for its efficiency as a means of communication, with some researchers claiming that English spelling is close to ideal for really literate people to read fast and efficiently. Evidence about human abilities to obtain meaning from the printed word has come from studies of how beginners tend to spell, lists of the most common spelling errors, trends in popular choice of spelling, international vocabularies, and educational research. In reading, literate adults switch spelling sets automatically according to changes in the medium--print or handwriting, upper or lower case, and if bilingual, different sets of sound-symbol relationships. Studies have explored a variety of hypotheses about how present spelling  might be made more accessible to a wider range of users. For example, experiments in surplus spelling have explored the notion of identifying and removing &quot;clutter&quot; in words--finding by experiment the letters that are not missed and that serve no purpose. Investigations have also revealed how few algorithms might be sufficient to modify present English spelling without effectively disguising it; only a few consistent rules might be needed to show morphemes and grammatical markers more clearly, while enhancing accurate phonological representation at the same time. Such studies can help to determine the &quot;optimum&quot; features of an orthography to match a particular language and suit the varied needs and abilities of its users. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study investigated the possibility that news sources account for the pattern of journalistic topic selection. It was hypothesized that the proportions of content in raw news materials made available to reporters by sources would be similar to the proportion of content found in published stories, and that the proportions of sources for these raw materials would be dissimilar to the proportion of sources found in published stories. The study focused on sources and media coverage for a midwestern statehouse. Press materials from the statehouse were analyzed and coded for a six-week period, as were statehouse stories published in the state's four major newspapers for a four-week period. The analyses indicated that proportions of content were similar across the raw materials and the  published stories, supporting the first hypothesis. The results also showed that the proportion of specific sources for raw materials was different from the proportion of sources in the published stories, supporting the second hypothesis. The data suggest that journalists and their sources share notions about what aspects of a state bureaucracy are worth paying attention to. The disproportionate use of sources outside the statehouses cited in the published stories may represent journalistic attempts to achieve balance in reporting. (HTH)",

        "author":["Thiesmeyer, John"],
        "description":"Computerized spelling programs or &quot;spelling checkers&quot; can be a wonderful tool for writers at any level of competence. However, they should not be used as adjuncts to the teaching of writing unless they meet two boundary conditions, one of size and one of design. The problem with design of the programs is that they allow for the correction of typographical errors and misspellings without human intervention, thus reducing the student to a passive key-pusher. The problem with size is that most of the spelling dictionaries have a limited working vocabulary. Other writing programs known as &quot;grammar-&quot; or &quot;style-checkers&quot; call attention to incorrect usages, redundancies, wordiness, meaningless intensifiers, gender-specific terms, split compounds, cliches, and other solecisms common in  bad writing. Unfortunately, these programs are unregenerately prescriptive, offering substitutions for nearly every phrase they store. Better suited to the needs of a writer would be a software package that analyzes text. However, the high number of computations such a program would require renders such an idea impractical. Writing software packages, if properly designed and applied, can provide extensive text analysis. Unfortunately, much of the software originates with commercial programers rather than with experienced classroom teachers. As such, they may, in fact, produce worse rather than better writers.

It examines the history and folklore of alcohol and community; the role of alcohol in journalism, humor, language, music, films and television, politics, and advertising; and the relationship of sports, media, and alcohol. In addition, the paper discusses alcohol and the newer minority cultures (the aged, women, gays, the handicapped), as well as those cultures of race and ethnicity. It directs attention toward the \"alcohol minority\" community and to the media coverage of the problems of alcohol.  In conclusion, the paper suggests a more appropriate agenda for social action and research and notes how drinking is interwoven with the nature of urban culture. (Author/FL)",

        "author":["Overbeck, Lois More"],
        "description":"The William Perry model of learning is directly parallel to what has been learned about writing processes. He observed that the student is essentially a dualist who sees everything as right or wrong. This stance of absolute acceptance wavers when the student encounters varieties of or disagreements among truths, thus gradually evolving into the cognitive position of &quot;relativism.&quot; Two correctives to this scheme help make its applicability to remedial writing more evident. The first is the suggestion that the Perry scheme also operates on a horizontal axis and that the process of inventing the self (or personna) in writing is constantly recursive. The other is the suggestion of the necessity of recursiveness to the learning process. Remedial students tend to be dualists about their  writing skills, substituting self-consciousness for self-awareness. Central to the pedagogy of the author's remedial writing classes at Agnes Scott College is the students' shift from negative and dualistic notions about writing to a positive and relativistic awareness of writing processes. After writing spontaneously on what they perceive to be their writing problems, students complete a protocol analysis on previous writing experiences in order to set goals and objectives. They then learn writing strategies such as free writing, revision, and purpose and audience considerations. This self-awareness of writing processes creates a more positive attitude toward writing, and gives students a tool for learning and developing intellectual maturity in other areas. (HTH)",

        "description":"\"Practical rhetoric\" is a narrowing of classical rhetoric because it no longer shapes public opinion but is increasingly shaped by it, specifically by special interest groups formed around and geared to what a selected audience wants to hear. In the teaching of composition, this pluralism of rhetoric leads to fragmentation and specialization, and ultimately to a state of entropy, which in thermodynamics is the measure between heat and energy and the movement of both toward chaos or nothingness. English departments are moving toward nothingness because of their emphasis on literary studies. However, the trend is being in part reversed by new studies in rhetoric and composition. The danger is in the growing complexity of these studies and their fragmentation into specialized areas,  including theory, practice, writing in two-year colleges, writing in four-year colleges, basic writing, technical writing, and computer writing, with specializations in each of these areas. One solution lies in having writing be the center of liberal studies and in moving it back to the public arena as a shaper of thought and the world. (CRH)",

This paper is a critical study of that idea, and uses Schopenhauer's little known essay &quot;The Art of Controversy&quot; as a text because of its realistic and slightly ironic approach to philosophical discussion. The body of the essay is several dozen strategems that Schopenhauer recommends to dialecticians, especially those who find themselves on the wrong end of an argument. In understanding &quot;The Art of Controversy,&quot; more informed decisions can be made on several  issues. Once the normal features of marketplace argumentation are accounted for, does anything distinctive still inhere in philosophical argument? Or, do the formal and informal rules of dialectic, debate and discussion restrain or change the nature of argument? These questions promote a return to the initial idea of argument-as-procedure. If procedure still seems attractive after Schopenhauer, it is possible to be confident of the perspective's value. (CRH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to present a general research model for the study of interpersonal communication competence. The paper summarizes the research background for the model and covers considerations for a general theory of competence. It notes that recently the communication field has shifted in emphasis from concerns of public speaking competence to research and theory about competence in small groups, organizational settings, the family, and interpersonal settings. It explains that there is a lack of consensus about a general theory of competence, and therefore, little to guide researchers in selecting and evaluating dimensions of communicative competence. The paper finds that the literature consists of numerous proposed dimensions, but that few of these have undergone  rigorous assessment and evaluation. In noting considerations for a general theory, it advocates combining knowledge of how to behave with actual performance in order to distinguish competence, and argues that competence also implies standards of appropriateness and effectiveness. The paper then describes a study that used the model to collect data on interaction involvement, concluding that the model reveals the utility of pursuing such studies. (CRH)",

        "description":"The best art experience has often been characterized as a kind of balance between the familiar and the unfamiliar, the expected and the unexpected, the easy and the hard. Good directors and actors have the artistry to be able to play on the orientation reactions of the audience. They know how to structure a production or performance so that it alternately creates and reduces tension--surprising or confusing audience members, then allowing them to relax and reflect. The principle of flow occurs when a participant's skills are matched evenly to challenges; if skill exceeds challenge, boredom results. If challenge exceeds skill, anxiety results. The theatre experience presents challenges in the form of great quantities of sensory data. To meet these challenges, audience members  bring skills of perception and, especially, organization. If these skills are unbalanced, they have the same effect on the theatre experience that they have on other activities; i.e., they produce boredom or anxiety. Ideal playgoers learn to overcome these undesirable results by symbolically restructuring the situation, either by narrowing their focus to avoid overload of sensory data and anxiety or by broadening their perspective and setting new problems for themselves to increase the challenge.

        "description":"Supporters of a policy of intervention on the part of debate judges argue that nonintervention (1) reduces consensus on objectives of the activity, (2) limits theoretical innovation, (3) creates confusion, (4) inhibits &quot;real world&quot; skills, and (5) promotes irrational behavior. On the other hand, a policy of nonintervention can be justified on two grounds: intervention is counter to the educational ends that it seeks to promote, and intervention interferes with the competitive aspect of debate, which is fully as important as the educational goals. The distinction between the judge and the critic embodies the dual ends of debate. Representing the educational ends, the critic functions as an educator, concerned with the overall quality of debate, in relation to other debates. The  judge, representing the competitive ends, determines which team has done the better job of debating. Taken together, these roles embody the judge's proper role. This duality requires the judge to moderate his or her involvement in adjudicating the debate, treating all participants in a fair and equitable manner. In the final analysis, the case for judge intervention fails because such intervention does not further the goals of debate. (HTH)",

        "description":"Because the skills needed for organizational effectiveness are typically communication based, many methods are available for communication trainers, including techniques originally designed to identify other cognitive and behavioral skills. The successful communication trainer can use these methods and measures, along with those directly aimed at improving communication abilities, to increase organizational participants' skills in perspective taking, self-monitoring, listening, and designing appropriate messages. Self-generated case studies and inventories are effective in organizations like juvenile court staffs, county government administration, insurance and manufacturing companies, and engineering firms, and are more effective with groups of members and longer-term training  projects. Role playing and coaching can be used to develop listening and perception skills, and are more useful in shorter training programs, although the coaching method demands a longer investment of time and money. Because of a lack of evaluative methodology and because many programs are tailored to specific organizations, the effectiveness of each method is difficult to ascertain. (CRH)",

The remainder of the paper explains the philosophy and objectives of the senior practicum, which includes familiarizing students with organizational processes in a real organization, enabling students to assume organizational roles that mirror actual experience, providing students with the means to demonstrate the extent to which they understand organizational concepts, helping them progress in the application of the skills and knowledge learned in other courses, and providing the capstone experience in the organizational communication major's career.

Case analysis involves the identification and examination of salient issues causing the problems that organizational members are experiencing, as well as the development of strategies for addressing those issues. The case method, which is particularly well suited for aiding students in learning about complex organizational phenomena, helps students both recognize the role of communication in effective organizational functioning and expand their knowledge of organizational research and theory, fostering their analytical insight into the nature of organizational processes. It also helps instructors to  generate class discussion and to illustrate and clarify important organizational concepts. The most important prerequisite for case analysis is the instructor's ability to set a conducive atmosphere. The quality of case analysis is largely dependent on the quality of the case history presented. The case must be carefully selected or prepared to reflect course information and demonstrate important theories in organizational communication, to enable students to apply their knowledge to the analysis.

The 30-second \"How To Watch TV\" (HTWTV) segments were designed for broadcast on Saturday mornings by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) to convey to children some information and values about television (e.g., animals do not really die in television filming). On the first two days of the study, children viewed two different episodes of a half-hour prosocial children's program, with two different HTWTV \"drop-ins.\" On the third day, they viewed a different program, with no drop-ins. Questionnaires and interviews were completed on the fourth day, when no viewing occurred, and on the fifth day, immediately after viewing a final episode of the first program,  with another drop-in. The results indicated that the HTWTV drop-ins were clearly a positive contribution to children's television viewing experience. Slightly more than 80% of the children tested were aware of having seen one or more drop-ins, and nearly two-thirds of those were able to recall correct information from a drop-in and to recognize from among three alternatives a summary of the main point. Results suggest that the television industry itself can develop and distribute television literacy materials. (Tables of findings are appended.) (HTH)",

In total, 17.8% of the departments offered at least one course they described as intercultural communication. The course was primarily offered at the junior level, with no prerequisites. Most  instructors give at least two examinations during the course and require a term paper and an oral report. The most commonly used teaching method was the lecture, followed by small group participation. Most of the instructors held professional rank and had taught the course less than five semesters. Cultural differences, and their effect on communication, was ranked as the most important course topic. The number of institutions offering such courses has rapidly increased during the last six years, suggesting that intercultural communication may be an important feature of upper-level undergraduate coursework in the future.

        "description":"To examine the rhetorical vision of nuclear war presented in the television show &quot;The Day After,&quot; it is necessary to consider (1) the motives of those involved in producing the film, (2) the debate over the film that preceded its presentation, (3) the effect of the film's message, and (4) how the film's rhetorical structure contributed to those consequences. An examination of public statements made by network executives and others connected with the production of the film reveals a number of motives for airing it. These include ABC's desire to boost its ratings during a critical period and the wish to provide a national dialogue. Critics viewed the film as a free advertisement for a nuclear arms freeze, and faulted it--despite the debate and warnings preceding its showing--for  its cursory treatment of reality and as a drama in which the viewer's only motive for watching was to wait for the bombs to drop. Surveys of viewers revealed that the film changed few opinions about nuclear war, as the percentage of viewers who thought that nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union was not likely rose slightly, as did the percentage of those who thought the United States was doing all it could to prevent war. Finally, an analysis of the enthymematic structure of the film, in which the rhetor (the film) makes maximum use of what the audience already knows or believes, reveals that the film was so open-ended it allowed viewers to regard the film as pro- or anti-nuclear freeze, depending on their personal frame of reference. The lack of drama in which agents  are included was also determined to contribute to the film's distortion of reality. (CRH)",

Data were collected through extensive observations of bargaining and caucus sessions that occurred during negotiations between a school board and teachers' union, and from interviews, questionnaires, and document analysis. Although the reasoning process differed across subissues, some general conclusions emerging from the  study were as follows: (1) the most prevalent types of claim used in bargaining were evaluative and definitive; (2) both sides employed reasoning from analogy, cause, and hypothetical example more frequently than they did other types of reasoning; (3) the reasoning process appeared more complete with the use of evaluative claims than with definitive, factual, and policy ones; and (4) proposals and subissues changed, not through adding more information, but through shifting types and adding qualifiers.

More than 2,000 elementary schools in 25 states use the IGE system. The Evaluation Project was designed to gain a comprehensive view of the system's operation and effectiveness. Phase IV investigated pupil outcomes, instructional time, and means of instruction. It focused on two IGE curriculum programs designed for compatibility with instructional programming for the individual student: (1) the Wisconsin Design for Reading Skills Development (WDRSD); and (2) Developing Mathematical Processes (DMP). Second and fifth grade students and their teachers in three types of schools were studied: (1) IGE schools using DMP or WDRSD; (2) Non-IGE schools using  DMP or WDRSD; and (3) IGE schools using neither program. Data were collected during the 1978-79 school year from achievement monitoring and domain referenced tests, teacher logs, classroom observations, and questionnaires which served as the basis for structured interviews with school staff. Pupil attainment of specified program objectives was contrasted in IGE schools using different programs and in IGE and non-IGE schools using WDRSD or DMP. Regression analyses were performed using the residual gain score as the dependant variable and instructional time, means of instruction, and school variables as the independent variables. (BS)",

The studies were part of a project to develop computerized adaptive testing for the language arts with software to diagnose student errors. The domain-referenced test on pronoun usage featured matched pairs of test items. To diagnose errors it was assumed that: (1) a misconception could only lead to an incorrect response; and (2) matched items would get the same incorrect response. The test was administered to three samples of inner-city sixth graders, in groups, and individually with students asked to explain the reasons for their responses. Results indicated that neither students' wrong  answer choices nor the rationale for their answers were consistent enough to warrant analyzing student response patterns in the classroom. Student inconsistency in test answering strategies may have important implications for measurement models and theories that assume a systematic and analytic approach to test taking. (BS)",

A methodology is presented for designing diagnostic tests which assess the extent of student learning and are sensitive to sources of difficulty within a skill or context area.

Several methods are available for administering and evaluating a test in real-time, towards optimizing the examiner's chances of isolating a persistent pattern of erroneous performance by a student. Under ideal circumstances, a student who misunderstands the test content would be identified early in a testing sequence; from this point the test could be tailored to estimates not only of ability but also (or instead) to the relative likelihoods of a set of competing diagnostic hypotheses that could account for the student's behavior (ability). Items which could discriminate among these hypotheses  could be administered in increasingly well-bounded subsets until a specified stopping rule is met. The following models for this procedure are described and compared: Wald's sequential probability ratio test, Sixtl's modified binomial method, Choppin's catenating Bayesian method, Fink and Galen's decision path method, Shortliffe and Buchanan's inexact reasoning method, Kmietowicz and Pearson's ranked probability method, and Schum's cascaded inference method.

The problems with several methods of evaluating teacher coopetency are discussed: the observational approach; outcomes approaches (student achievement); and teacher readiness. It is suggested that both technical and professional approaches using multiple criteria for judging teacher competency be pursued. The second study summarizes the views of prominent scholars at a meeting on  educational testing and evaluation research priorities. Research is needed on the concept of validity; new kinds of testing (higher order skills, school curriculum, and diagnostic testing); comprehensive information systems; the effects of current testing; and cost-efficient analyses for educational decision-making.

Researchers conducted a literature review and completed data analysis to determine the reasons for this decrease, assessing trends for the period from 1965 to 1983. The kinds of tests most commonly used are aptitude, achievement, and tests of personal and social characteristics. Score trends vary from test to test. The reasons for the declining student scores include changes in the composition of test-takers, decreases in the quantity of schooling which students experience, curriculum changes, declines in student motivation, and deterioration of the family system and social environment. These factors, in combination, have contributed to the test score decline for more than the past fifteen years. Efforts to  end the decreases must address the curricular and school climate factors identified. (DWH)",

The values of cadets at entrance and throughout their four years at the United States Military Academy were assessed. The basic research evaluated how cadets become socialized into the military profession. Three measures of values were used: the Rokeach Value Scales, the Scott Value Scales, and the Importance Inventory. The final assessment instrument, Rest Defining Issues Test, reflects the process of moral judgment. The results of the study identified some values which are characteristically strong and persistent throughout the four years, some which are characteristically given very low priority, some which cadets held strongly  at entrance but which were eroded, and others which increased in importance. The highlights and main findings from the different value instruments are summarized. Interpretations of the results, as well as conclusions and recommendations for future research, are presented.

It is designed to measure academic preparation in four domains: communication skills, general education, professional education, and subject field specialization, and should be used, if at all, only as one part of the initial teacher selection process. The Dallas Independent School District has found that the Wesman Personnel Classification Test, a measure of verbal and quantitative ability, is at least as good a predictor of rated teaching effectiveness as the NTE. Other factors which a school district must consider in planning a testing requirement are legal issues, minorities' scores, and state requirements  for teacher certification. The Teacher Perceiver, a structured interview, and psychological testing have been considered as posible components of the teacher selection process. It is concluded that no single method of teacher selection is a panacea. All sources of information have some merit in the selection process. However, no single source should be relied upon to the exclusion of others. (DWH)",

A questionnaire was developed and administered. The results indicated that Wyoming teachers' testing practices are consistent with results in other states. On the average, Wyoming teachers spend six hours a week constructing and giving classroom tests. They use tests to measure student achievement, evaluate their own teaching. determine grades, identify weaknesses, review material, and for ongoing assessment. Over 90 percent of Wyoming teachers believe that standardized tests are not the best way to evaluate a teacher's effectiveness. Almost  60 percent believe that teachers understand standardized test results. Over 60 percent believe that a competency test requirement for students would raise educational standards. Attitudes toward classroom tests were, on the average, slightly favorable, while attitudes toward standardized tests tended to be unfavorable. The survey instrument is appended. (DWH)",

The functions performed in the review of the NTE Core Battery and Specialty Area tests were conceptualized as panel activities. The number of panels required for the study was determined by the number of tests and the functions to be performed. The size of each panel was based on the scope of the test content and panel's functions. Separate panels were utilized to perform the knowledge estimation function for each objective test or test section. A separate panel was employed to conduct these functions for the Essay section of the Test of Communication Skills. The Standards  Committee was responsible for developing recommendations on minimum qualifying scores for the valid NTE tests. The Standards Committee recommended a four-step progression of minimum qualifying scores on the NTE Core Battery and Specialty Area tests over a five year period. In the fifth year, the required scores would be three standard errors of measurement below the estimated scaled scores for minimally qualified certification and endorsement applicants. (DWH)",

The external team consists of a dentist with oncological background and an educational evaluation specialist. The evaluation is conducted in three phases: previsit preparation, on-site visit, and report preparation. This method provides feedback on the process as well as on program outcomes. It focuses on improvement of the program, rather than success of the project. It gives appropriate attention to all stages of program activity. It costs about the same to implement an internal evaluation,  but maintains the integrity of an external evaluation approach. The model has been used successfully for four years at the Louisiana State University School of Dentistry Clinical Cancer Education Program with several different evaluators.

The overall pattern of Hispanic LEP pupil achievement was up from last year's levels in reading, language and mathematics computation, but still dramatically below their English-monolingual peers. Vietnamese LEP students' performance was progressing toward or exceeding the national norm. Lowest LEP student achievement gains were in reading. Except for students at Allison and Becker in the Schoolwide Project (low  pupil-to-teacher ratios), Chapter l programs showed no achievement benefits for LEP students. The District's new exit criteria for kindergarteners and first graders helped stabilize the previous &quot;entry-exit-reentry&quot; problem.

Student overall ethnic percentages have changed little from 1982.  Percentages of minority professionals and administrators have increased. AISD is getting closer to matching Black ethnic percentages, but is not close to matching Hispanic percentages. The percentages of Black or Hispanic student teachers and teachers newly certified are still small, although there was a noticeable increase from 1982 to 1983 in the case of Hispanics.

        "description":"In 1983 first graders who had not attended Austin Independent School District (AISD) kindergarten were studied to identify the number and characteristics of kindergarten nonattenders. Data were collected during parent/teacher conferences and by telephone interviews. Of 4550 first graders, 83 (2 percent) were kindergarten nonattenders and 473 (10 percent) attended other kindergartens. The nonattenders came from low income families scattered throughout the district. Over half were in day care while the rest stayed home. There were more blacks and fewer Anglos proportionally among nonattenders than among first graders as a whole. Of the nonattenders who are in Chapter 1 schools, 70% are being served by the Chapter 1 Program for low achievers. First grade retention rates are 13  percent for nonattenders and 9 percent for students who attended AISD kindergarten. Kindergarten nonattenders are at high risk for failure. More effective recruiting could improve the chances for students who might otherwise not attend kindergarten. (BS)",

In 18 elementary schools, 16 full-time and one half-time SCE teachers provided assistance to students at or below the 30th percentile in either language arts/reading or math. Thirty-nine counselors provided counseling services to students at 51 elementary schools. The Secondary Component included writing labs (eight writing lab instructors and a writing lab project specialist) and Transitional Bilingual Education instruction (four teachers served limited-English-proficient junior high students). Elementary reading achievement gains were higher than predicted. Elementary counselors met their goals to increase  consultation meetings with parents and contacts with low-achieving students, but did not meet their goal to increase contacts for curriculum activities. The assignment of bilingual teachers was not optimal. Writing lab instructors served a large number of non-low-achieving students while serving less than half of the identified low achievers. (BW)",

        "description":"Public opinion polls show that most Americans (including a majority of teachers) favor merit pay for teachers. Teachers' and administrators' organizations generally oppose merit pay because there is no fair way to evaluate teachers and because the merit pay issue diverts attention from the fact that all teachers are underpaid. A review of recent literature and of successful merit pay programs revealed the following widely shared beliefs and general conclusions: (1) merit awards should be added to, not substituted for, reasonable increases based on seniority, academic credit, cost-of-living, etc.; (2) most merit pay programs that fail (and most do) do so because the evaluation procedures and/or instruments are inadequate; and (3) if a merit pay plan is adopted, it must be  adequately financed. The awards must be large enough to be a real incentive, and must be available to all teachers who meet predetermined criteria. Incentive pay plans, which do not presume to judge the quality of teachers but provide more pay for more work or for filling assignments deemed to be of greater importance to the district, avoid the problem of valid evaluation and may be easier to implement than merit pay.

The retention rate doubled after publication of the new policy in 1981, but has declined since then. Retainees' success was judged by the opinions of parents, the opinions of teachers, and gains in reading scores on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills.

Second, since one of the better-established findings is that verbal and spatial abilities tend to reside in different hemispheres, the possibility of incorporating spatial ability into admissions testing is explored. Third, the calls for curricular reform based on brain research are examined. (Author)",

A factor analysis of responses clearly identified the seven facets of self-concept which the SDQ is designed to measure: physical ability, physical appearance, peer relations, parent relations, reading, math, and general-school. Significant age and/or sex effects were found in each of the SDQ scales, but the size and direction of the effects varied with the scale. The largest sex effects were for physical abilities (favoring boys) and reading (favoring girls), but the sex difference was small for the sum of all scales. For every scale there was a linear decline in self-concept with increasing age. This  decline is explained by cognitive development. Very young children have unrealistically high self-concepts due to their egocentrism. Self-concepts decline or become more realistic as children incorporate more external information. (Author/BS)",

In fact, television and radio use by blacks exceeds that of whites and research shows the broadcast media to be particularly important sources of information for blacks on consumer and political affairs. But many writers feel that blacks, often either ignored altogether or portrayed negatively, are damaged by their treatment in the media and as viewers, readers, and listeners may learn negative self-concepts. They see this as being particularly true for black children--the nonpresentation of blacks, many say, is destructive to black children's self-concept because it denies the importance of their existence. Research on black children reveals that they  are especially susceptible to the effects of television: they watch more of it, are more likely to believe in the &quot;reality&quot; of television, and are more likely than other children to say that they identify with and imitate television characters. Television has the potential to play a major role in their socialization. But presently the media must be criticized for their failure to affect the lives of blacks by continuously reporting on issues germane to the survival of blacks.

It was found that students in the study entered college with established histories of academic achievement, came from majority-black schools, and now found themselves in the unfamiliar situation of being in a decided minority, with little contact with black faculty staff. The students reported relatively good relations with their peers in the classroom, but little contact outside the classroom. They also reported frequent exposure to racial discrimination, on the part of students, staff, and faculty. Most students believed white professors to be concerned about their  success, but felt that the professors sometimes evaluated black academic performance unfairly. Socially, the black students felt at a severe disadvantage. Though most were reasonably satisfied with their financial aid, over a third felt that other support services were unsatisfactory. Finally, despite obvious problems, the students clearly possessed high perceptions of self. Overall, the study revealed a tremendous gap between black student needs on white campuses and the currently existing policies and programs of those campuses. (RDN)",

        "description":"This report discusses the results of a survey of the characteristics and the social and academic experiences of black undergraduates at eight predominantly white and regionally diverse State college campuses. The majority of the students sampled were freshmen. Major findings are that: (1) black undergraduates did not report markedly unpleasant or decidedly pleasant experiences; overall, students reported on the quality of interaction with white faculty, staff, and students as being slightly better than neutral; (2) most black students encountered some form of racial discrimination on these campuses. These data suggest that the students felt a certain tenuousness in their position on campus. Evidence of this feeling can be found in the fact that the students evaluated interactions  with blacks on campus extremely positively, felt that there were not enough blacks in any role on campus, and felt that blacks were not fully a part of campus life. This feeling of their tenuous status no doubt partially accounts for the just above average academic performance of a student group that survey results showed to be ambitious, committed, and equipped with sound college preparation. It could also help account for their sense of alienation from campus life. To alleviate this situation, universities must expand efforts to bring in black faculty, staff, and students, and take more steps to address black students' experience of estrangement. (RDN)",

        "description":"This preliminary report summarizes findings from a study of over 400 black graduate and professional students on eight, majority white, state-supported university campuses nationally. Students reported high professional achievement goals and self-concepts, generally came from families displaying high levels of academic and occupational achievement, and reported above average undergraduate grades and rankings. The findings suggest that the experiences of black students in graduate and higher education are less than optimal. On measures of academic performance, social adjustment, campus race relations, and interactions with faculty, student responses were at best ambivalent--more often negative. Such findings should be seen in relation to the national decline in black student  enrollments in advanced study degree programs since the mid-70s and the effect of this trend on the black community. Strategies for ameliorating the campus experiences of black graduate and professional students include: (1) attempts to achieve greater involvement of black students in the informal networks of training programs; (2) increasing the presence of students with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints, resulting in a more open institution sensitive to the special needs of black and other nontraditional student populations; (3) the creation of mechanisms facilitating their right to appeal unfair actions or decisions; and (4) ensuring equal access to important professional information and resources.

        "description":"An investigation of Federal funding for Afro-American related projects for 1978 through 1983 shows that, during this period, research in the areas where Afro-American research is overwhelmingly concentrated--the social sciences and the humanities--has not kept pace with the substantial increases apparent in the funding of research in the &quot;hard sciences.&quot; In terms of overall Federal support, the total available funding in 1984 for psychology and social science is probably less in real terms (given inflation) than the amount available in 1978; humanities support through the National Endowment for the Humanities has also declined dramatically. More specifically, Afro-American research has suffered from the shift in Federal priorities toward the &quot;hard sciences.&quot; The investigation  shows that only the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has continued to emphasize Afro-American-related research, and even within this agency the number of studies of major relevance has decreased. Furthermore, the NIMH total budget represents a very small proportion of the total Federal research budget. Given this discouraging state of affairs, scholars in the field must work concertedly to counter these shifts and influence funding policies--as the fate of Afro-American Studies is very much a function of research funding, the destiny of the field itself is at stake.

The findings suggest that much  of the research that has been done is descriptive, exploratory, and atheoretical.

Although most reports uphold a commitment to equity, this is overshadowed by the emphasis placed on excellence (as in the Sputnik era) and the raising of academic standards. The new reform reports generally agree that the purposes of education have become too diffuse: literacy, they say, should become a priority, with personal growth skills, work skills, and social and civic skills as secondary goals. Most of the 1983 reports call for a common curriculum, and are unanimous in condemning tracking  (insofar as it precludes equal access to knowledge and discriminates against minority children) and most ignore or criticize vocational education. The reports agree that computer literacy must have a place in basic education, but disagree on questions concerning time spent in school. Most blame the crisis in education on the teaching profession, but vary in their recommendations for solving current problems affecting teachers. Finally, the reports tend to advocate decrease in federal and an increase in state and local responsibility. (KH)",

        "description":"Demographically, mainland Hispanic Americans constitute a population that is economically and educationally diverse. Nonetheless, a cluster of related findings indicates that Hispanic students are more poorly prepared for college than non-Hispanic White students. More Hispanic high school seniors than White non-Hispanics are enrolled in vocational or general programs than academic programs, and fewer take the standardized college admissions tests. Lack of interest in the courses offered by high schools, alienation, poor teaching, and differences in family life are among the reasons for the lesser tendency of Hispanic students to be adequately prepared for or interested in applying to college. Studies suggest that teachers' cultural stereotypes act negatively on their expectations  for Hispanic students, and that language, ethnicity, and social-class factors contribute to a lower classroom experience for the Hispanic student. Because of these and other factors, some researchers have suggested that college officials look beyond high school grades and admissions test scores when considering acceptance of Hispanic students. Following the narrative, the paper concludes with a list of guidelines for use by high schools in developing strategies to better prepare the Hispanic student for college, and a list of organizations that specifically address the educational needs of Hispanics.

The results of a case study of what happens to the attitudes of six experts in the field of school desegregation and black achievement when they interactively review the relevant research literature are presented. The impact of these subjects' resulting reviews on the attitudes of a less expert audience (i.e. graduate students) is also examined. It is concluded that the attitude-relevant aspects of research reviewing are probably best understood by noting the special characteristics of the people and circumstances involved and by applying established principles to this unique situation. Attitudes are less likely to change if (as in the case of the research reviewers) there is a high degree of prior knowledge. In  addition, the diversity of results often found in a set of empirical studies will inhibit attitude change in its consumers, further impeding consensus. And finally, even when there is agreement on the objective outcome of a set of studies, there may still be discrepancies resulting from subjective interpretations of what the measurements mean. Broader philosophic debates within the social sciences which are helping to define the limits of objectivity are considered and further studies based on the premise that knowledge synthesis is more meaningful if accompanied by descriptions of the process that brought the synthesis about are urged.

The development and meaning of the concept of recurrent education are addressed through discussion of the antecedents of the concept, international developments in recurrent education, the concept's relationship with lifelong learning and permanent education, the concept in Australia, and the parameters of recurrent education. Each of the five major economic questions raised by the recurrent education concept are then considered separately. They are (1) the internal efficiency of the education sector, (2) the operations of the labor market, (3) the distribution of educational opportunities between individuals and  groups, (4) the share of community resources allocated to education, and (5) the mechanisms through which educational activities are financed. Each issue is approached in a similar manner. First, the principal arguments advanced through the recurrent education debate are presented. Second, the closeness of fit between these arguments and developments in the Australian education sector and economy are assessed.

The guide contains four main parts. The first part of the guide presents an overview of the JTPA and its provisions regarding services to older workers. This part of the handbook also describes the work of the National Commission for Employment Policy and its role under the new legislation. Part 2 discusses four steps in the design of a training program for older workers, first from the perspective of the older workers, and then from the perspective of employers. This part also reviews some of the administrative issues of program development. The third part of the guide outlines the various components  of JTPA programs for recruiting, training, and placing older workers. Finally, part 4 discusses the ways that program evaluation can improve program operations and the data needed to assess a program's effectiveness. Program evaluation is also examined from the perspective of older participants, employers, and the community that the program serves. Appendixes to the document include (1) abstracts of the National Commission for Employment Policy research studies, (2) lists of research papers abstracted and other references, (3) lists of organizations focusing on older workers, and (4) a synopsis of a study on older workers in industry.

        "description":"A study investigated the relationship between teaching style and group conflict within the small instructional group. The conjecture was that the transactional teaching style is associated with more positive resolutions to group conflict than either the nomothetic or idiographic style. Research was conducted on 10 instructional groups within the Wisconsin Group Dynamic Traffic Safety School program. Teaching styles were identified and described as nomothetic, idiographic, or transactional. Group conflict was identified and described, using the focal conflict/group solution theoretical framework as a model and the Eriksonian theoretical framework as content. Data were collected on teaching style, group conflict and resolution, and how they occurred in relation to each other. The  study supplied a more adequate conceptualization and methodology to analyze and understand focal conflict/group solution. It also provided a conceptual framework to analyze and understand teaching styles, a methodological procedure for using the model, and an analysis of teaching style. Data indicated the limitations of the &quot;directive,&quot; i.e., the idiographic and nomothetic, teaching styles to such an extent as to indicate that the transactional style deserved a further test of its merits.

        "description":"Continuing professional education has proven to be an acceptable control mechanism to assure professional competence. Officially recognized first under the Engineering, Science, Management War Training Act of World War II, the continuing education movement is still gaining attention in the United States with 16 professions in the 50 states requiring continuing education as proof of professional competency. At present, the question is whether continuing education of professionals should be mandatory or voluntary. The supposition that continuing professional education improves competence has led professionals, professional organizations, and governing bodies to the concept of mandatory continuing professional education (MCPE). Arguments for MCPE include the tremendous knowledge  explosion, consumer demand for competency and accountability, increased number and quality of continuing education offerings, and professionals' failure to engage in continuing education. Supporters of voluntary continuing professional education have expressed seven broad concerns related to the mandatory stance that deal with participant and teacher motivation, performance and competency, program relevance, costs and resources, work and family constraints, quality of educational offerings, and program content. The prevalent philosophy of adult educators is that continuing education is a voluntary, self-directed learning experience sought for personal development and social progress. (YLB)",

The proposed model contained four prescriptive steps that address the events of instruction to be provided or supported and the locations, content, and learning cues for each illustration. Usefulness of the illustration design model was evaluated by using the model to illustrate a CBVE procedure and by then comparing the learning effects of use of different versions of the procedure. Three sets of illustration for the same CBVE automotive mechanics assembly procedure were developed: 7 \"learner-based\" illustrations using the complete model, 10 \"developer-based\" illustrations using the model without learner data, and 1 \"typical\"  illustration. Random assignments of 173 students to one of three treatments were made; 37 students also performed the assembly procedure. Posttest results indicated few differential effects among the three treatments. Analysis of covariance suggested that students studying the developer-based illustrations performed the assembly significantly better. Results indicated the model seems useful and relevant to designing illustrations, but use of learner input is not necessary. (Appendixes include decision, perception, and memory principles and the three sets of illustrations.) (YLB)",

        "description":"A project was undertaken to establish a cooperative work experience program in building trades entrepreneurship. The first phase of the program, which was implemented in Baltimore, Maryland, involved the formation of a task force that included representatives of the school, business, industry, and public sectors. Eventually, two Baltimore contractors each agreed to hire four economically disadvantaged students for a two-year work experience program. In order to alleviate the employers' fears that the students might not be able to meet strict contract deadlines and might thereby jeopardize their employers' business concerns, the City agreed to allow the employers to deduct up to 85 percent of a program participant's salary for the first year and up to 25 percent provided the  student was retained for a second year. Because the contractors eventually lost some of their bids, the number of program participants was reduced to four for the second year. Despite the somewhat limited scope of the project, it was deemed a success in that it provided the students with an exposure to the advantages and disadvantages of self-employment and afforded them the opportunity to be coached by a seasoned professional in this area. Student interest in entrepreneurship in the building trades appeared to increase after participation in the project. (Two flow charts are appended.) (MN)",

The next digest, which examines time on task in vocational education, discusses the nature, importance, and use of time on task in secondary  and postsecondary vocational education as well as factors related to efficient use of time and strategies teachers can use to improve time spent on task. Included in the digest on employers' expectations of vocational education are discussions of the following: how employers grade vocational education, why they hire vocational graduates, what vocational programs should emphasize, what are some barriers to cooperating with vocational education, and how these barriers can be overcome. The final digest addresses the nature and importance of the new basics; acceptable basic skills attainment levels for vocational students; and strategies, resources, and models available for use in teaching the new basics through vocational education.

        "description":"This study examined the variables that affect vocational teachers' implementation of an educational innovation--peer tutors for mainstreamed special education students. The researchers explored teachers' perceptions of the peer tutoring program prior to the inservice session, at the completion of a pilot test, and prior to the second year of implementation. The subjects for the study were 16 vocational and academic teachers employed at the Arnold R. Burton Vocational Technical Center in Virginia. They provided data through written surveys and interviews. During the inservice session, teachers were provided with strategies for using peer tutors, and the teachers made suggestions for training and selecting the tutors. Training was provided for 36 peer tutors, who then worked in the  pilot program for one semester with the teachers. About half of the tutors continued in the following semester. The data gathered before the inservice program showed that more than half the teachers had used peer tutors informally and most were favorably disposed toward them. Data gathered at the conclusion of the pilot study and at the end of the next semester showed that teachers felt there were benefits from the peer tutoring program. They especially liked the training provided to the peer tutors (called \"teacher assistants\"). The teachers also cited support from a school-based coordinator and participation by an outside consultant as contributing to the success of the program. Program improvements wanted by the teachers included more stress on responsibility and commitment for the  teacher assistants. Based on the results of the study, the program is continuing and being expanded with the inclusion of new teachers. (KC)",

The study concluded that mandatory retirement of competent law enforcement officers and firefighters is unnecessary and wasteful and that the Federal Government's failure to recognize this problem should not be compounded by allowing the States and their political subdivisions also to discriminate against their employees based on age. It was recommended that the States and their political subdivisions should, in accordance with the goals of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, test their public safety officers for fitness rather than make stereotyped assumptions of incapacity due to age.

The new Federal system would be built on the base of Social Security and would take into account the Social Security program's taxes and benefits. The current Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) was analyzed and was found to cost more than representative private sector pension plans (Social Security plus a pension plan), largely because the CSRS is tied to the consumer price index and because Federal employees can retire with immediate and unreduced benefits at age 55 provided they have accrued 30 years of service. Five alternative retirement plans were formulated and analyzed. It was determined that if cost-of-living  adjustments and the retirement age provisions of the CSRS are replicated, benefits at retirement under the proposed systems would be smaller than at present. However, new Federal ancillary benefits could be higher, at least initially, particularly if employees participated in capital accumulation plans. The higher benefits would require a higher employee cost than the current system.

While some see little or no value in the practice, others view early field experience programs as a means of improving the self-concept of prospective teachers and as a way of enhancing their acquisition of the skills that will subsequently be addressed in methods courses. The University of Hawaii Early Field Experience Program, which is based on linking methods courses with field experience in the secondary schools, is conducted in two areas of the preservice program: the first experience occurs during the generic methods course early in the student's professional education core, and the second takes place during the content methods course later  in the student's professional education core. The first phase of the program, which lasts for 12 weeks, involves at least one class period per week, and optimally may involve one half-day observation session per week. The experiences include three stages: orientation, involvement, and evaluation.

        "description":"From 1910 to 1935 a campaign was waged in the southern United States to eradicate adult illiteracy. This program was primarily based on volunteers, and it revolved around night, summer, or cotton mill schools that were often termed Opportunity Schools. Many parallels can be drawn to current efforts to address the problem of functional illiteracy among adults living in rural areas. These parallels can be readily illustrated by a comparison of the Alabama literacy campaign, which lasted from approximately 1915 to 1935, and current efforts to reduce functional illiteracy in rural Clay and Jackson counties in Tennessee. Like its counterpart in the early 20th century, the Tennessee campaign is one in which the scope of the problem far exceeds the resources committed to the problem. A  second element of commonality between the two campaigns rests in the realm of the commitment and almost evangelical zeal of those providing financial support for and volunteering to tutor in the programs. It would seem, however, that as long as the reduction of adult illiteracy remains a peripheral enterprise rather than a central mission of the educational system, efforts to eliminate adult illiteracy will remain in the last two decades of the 20th century what they became in the first two decades--a lofty goal beyond the grasp of those who sought to reach it.

        "description":"Analysis of the costs of employing older workers indicates that some types of employment costs do vary by age and that overall compensation costs increase with age, largely because of increasing employee benefit costs. There is, however, no statistical evidence that direct salary costs increase by age on an economy-wide basis. The belief that older workers cost more seems generally related to feelings about performance and productivity; however, statistical evidence does not indicate generally poorer performance or productivity by age, and the limited statistical data available refute the basic notion that older workers are less capable. One problem that needs to be addressed when discussing an aging work force is the problem of skill obsolescence; if older workers are to remain  cost effective, their skills must be continuously updated through training and education to assure continued productivity. Policymakers must recognize the need for lifelong education, but must take care that legislative and regulatory requirements affecting employment costs for older workers do not place undue cost or administrative problems on employers. Such costs would discourage the employment of older workers. (MN)",

        "description":"The Adult School for Cuban Refugees, operated by the Central Susquehanna Intermediate Unit in 1980, supplied services to approximately 1,200 Cuban refugees in the six weeks of its operation at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania. The program offered basic oral English classes to adults ranging in age from 18 to 81 years. The classes were conducted in the World War II Army barracks at the military installation. The mostly male students, who volunteered to attend classes, had a wide range of proficiency ranging from no English to an advanced understanding. The goals for this short-term educational project consisted of teaching oral English and providing for the acculturation of the Cuban students to the American way of life. Classes were conducted twice a day for three hours at a  time, six days a week. Teachers used time before and after classes for additional preparation or tutoring. Students were recruited throughout the program, and a high percentage attended. Students were provided with textbooks, a dictionary, and supplies. An independent evaluator termed the program a success, since pre- and posttests showed a large gain in student English proficiency. The goal of teaching basic life skills for acculturation was also met. Teachers and students also felt that the program had been successful. Following evaluation of the project, recommendations were made for improving such programs if they are conducted again. (This report contains numerous appendixes covering facets of program operation such as planning, scheduling, student reports, attendance, service  contracts for teachers, support personnel, and administrators, staff training, suggested lesson plans, use of teacher aides, and newspaper coverage.)

Three basic approaches to a partnership between science and industrial arts departments are a simple tool lending process, a laboratory loan system, and interdepartmental cooperation.

Findings indicated differences among the five programs in all aspects of the nursing programs that were compared: philosophies of the educational institutions, philosophies of the nursing programs, admission criteria, behavioral objectives, evaluation of learning, learning experiences, and learning resources and teaching/learning resources. UBC's program prepared graduates to work independently in acute care, long-term care, and community settings, while the college diploma programs prepared graduates to work primarily in acute care settings under supervision  of a registered nurse. Admission criteria for the baccalaureate program were primarily academic, while colleges' nursing programs had fewer academic requirements but more diversified criteria. UBC's objectives encompassed a greater ranqe of expected behaviors. UBC had the lonqest program duration. UBC's program had almost twice the amount of theory compared to practice; colleges had a closer balance. UBC's program had proportionally more community practice experience.

        "description":"Research on attrition of university students has recently examined \"dropping out\" as the culmination of a complex interactive process. In order to examine differences between successful students (persisters) and students who officially withdrew from a major university, and to examine the accuracy of faculty and staff perceptions of students' experiences, a questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 1,000 currently enrolled undergraduates and 1,200 faculty and staff at the University of Kansas. Students withdrawing from the university during the following academic year were mailed the survey along with demographic questions. The response rates were 53.7% from the persisting students, 32.0% from faculty and staff, and 13.7% from withdrawing students. Analysis of results indicated  that withdrawing students had more adjustment difficulties than persisters. Withdrawing students compared to persisters reported experiencing less development of creative potential, coping less well with exams, having poorer study habits, and spending more energy in enhancing social relationships. They also reported feeling lonelier, having more financial difficulties, and expecting greater than realized academic success than persisters. The disparate factor structure of faculty and staff responses and the thematically unrelated items within each factor supported the conclusion that faculty and staff were not consistent in perceiving student needs. Recommendations for enhancing student retention include establishing realistic expectations in college-bound high school students, providing  academic skills programs, and educating administrators, faculty, and students about each others' expectations.

        "description":"Coding systems have become popular methods of cataloging the verbal and nonverbal interaction occurring during marital and family therapy. One such system, Pinsof's (1981) Family Therapist Coding System (FTCS), was the first designed explicitly to identify and differentiate specific verbal behaviors of family therapists independent of their theoretical orientation. To test the system's interrater and intrarater reliability, data were coded from typed manuscripts of six audio-taped marital therapy sessions. Coders were two undergraduate students trained for about seven hours each. The code consisted of three categories (for verb, phrase, and speech clause); the codes are ranked hierarchically such that only one code is assigned to each of the nine scales within the categories. The  results indicated low observer agreement for overall session reliability and for category reliability. The low reliability did not appear to be due to observer drift or actual therapy sessions, but to the expertise and experience of the coders. The primary contributor to low reliability appeared to be the individual codes. Most of the codes with lower percentage of agreement values appeared to be less clearly defined and more difficult to apply to the data. The FTCS does not appear to be a reliable or practical assessment tool for determining the effectiveness of the therapist's statements during ongoing marital therapy sessions. (LLL)",

        "description":"Both the career model and the decision model have been proposed to explain patterns of contraceptive use in teenagers. The career model views contraceptive use as a symbol of a woman's sexuality and implies a clear decision to be sexually active. The decision model is based on the subjective expected utility (SEU) theory which holds that people weigh the perceived costs and benefits of the expected outcomes of various behaviors and select the behavior which maximizes benefits and minimizes costs. In order to test these models, a review of research was conducted. The studies included in the review were those which assesed actual contraceptive use (and nonuse) of sexually active adolescents. Meta-analysis indicated that both models received good support for women, but little  support for men. A major variable in the career model for women was sexual role self-acceptance. This model was less applicable to men, possibly because acceptance of their sexuality may be less problematic. In the decision model, women's contraceptive use was positively related to the perceived risk of pregnancy. Research suggests that there is only a little overlap in the sets of variables which affect male and female contraceptive use. (LLL)",

Half of the questionnaires for each group referred to a female target person and half referred to a male. The results indicated that the psychologists and social workers were the most accepting in their attitudes, and generally most knowledgeable about suicide. The community group appeared to be the least accepting of suicidal behavior, and were least aware of high risk factors. Among the professional groups, clear differences emerged in the seriousness accorded certain suicidal behaviors, and in the perceived character and motivation of  the suicidal person. Differences also emerged in the perceptions of male and female suicide. Suicide was viewed as a viable option for males as an escape from life's problems. The suicidal behavior of females was seen as less sincere, more manipulative, less serious, and in some sense less important than that of males. An ultimate goal would be to ensure that service providers from various disciplines do not function at cross-purposes, either among themselves or in conjunction with attitudes held by non-professionals in the community.

        "description":"The assessment of brain impairment is important in the vocational rehabilitation of persons with neuropsychological dysfunction. To determine the sensitivity of the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) to lateralized cerebral dysfunction compared to neuropsychological evaluation, 79 epileptic subjects were assigned to one of three groups (generalized impairment, right hemisphere impairment, or left hemisphere impairment). Subjects had previously been administered neuropsychological evaluations and GATBs. Group status was used as the dependent variable, and GATB-V (verbal aptitude) scores were compared with GATB-S (spatial aptitude) scores as an independent variable. It was found that the derived variable, the GATB-V score minus the GATB-S score, used as an additional independent  variable, differentiated the right-impaired from the left-impaired and the generalized groups at statistically significant levels. It was not possible to distinguish the left from the generalized impaired group. No significant findings were observed on the other GATB scales. Results suggest that the comparison of the GATB-V with the GATB-S has some value in identifying persons who have demonstrated a lateralization of neuropsychological difficulties to the right cerebral hemisphere. While the differences between GATB scores for the right and left impaired groups were not statistically significant, the possibility that these groups may respond in a differential manner to the GATB on the whole suggests that vocational aptitude batteries may help rehabilitation counselors identify  individuals with possible brain impairment.

        "description":"Interbehavioral psychology represents an important innovation for clinical psychology in general, and for behavior modification in particular. Most theories of deviance acknowledge the role of a person's past history in the determination of behavior. Unfortunately, this history is often transformed into the supposed effects of current and continuous mental processes or entities. Interbehavioral psychology rejects this mentalism, yet retains the important place of a person's history. Three types of mentalistic explanations of deviance involve: (1) mental and biological processes; (2) mental and biological traits; and (3) situationism. These ahistorical approaches to deviance divert attention from the continuous process of person/environment interactions. When behavior is analyzed  in terms of an interbehavioral history of confrontable events, concrete moves can be made in the description, prediction, and control of behavior. Some of these concrete moves involve &quot;setting factors,&quot; i.e., contextual conditions (such as drug use) that influence which stimulus-response functions, previously established through an interbehavioral history, will occur at a particular time. Interbehavioral psychology offers an integrated-field or systems theory that conceptualizes interactions among the various factors in the field as mutual, reciprocal, and dynamic. Interbehavioral psychology rejects the assumption that causes can be reduced to a single, discrete agent. (JAC)",

        "description":"Uniqueness theory suggests that individuals are most comfortable with the thought that they are moderately different or unique from others. To test whether individuals with a high need for uniqueness are perceived as being different from those with a low need for uniqueness, 144 college students participated in a two-part study. In part one, subjects completed an attitude survey and several personality scales including Snyder and Fromkin's Need for Uniqueness Scale (NUS). They were then scheduled for one of 48 three-person discussion groups and assigned to one of three conditions: (1) no-feedback; (2) uniqueness-depriving feedback; or (3) uniqueness-enhancing feedback. In part two of the study, subjects reviewed their responses to the attitude survey (which for subjects in  feedback groups now contained the uniqueness-relevant feedback), and then completed a manipulation check questionnaire. Subjects then participated in a 20-minute discussion of issues from the attitude survey. They then rated the behavior and personality of each participant including their own. An analysis of results indicated that false feedback altered subjects' perceptions of their similiarity to the average college student, but not their group behaviors, as rated by group participants. No-feedback subjects maintained the perception of their own difference. Persons with high NUS scores tended to be low in public self-consciousness and social anxiety, and to be rated as more extraverted, talkative, persuasive, and dissimilar from other students. The findings suggest that need for  uniqueness influences individual behavior in group settings. (JAC)",

The model includes derivation of problematic, on-the-job situations and effective responses from a target sample of trainees and builds an evaluation measure based on this derivation. The target population consists of entry level practicum students in their second year of doctoral training. The model contains five steps. In the first step, \"situational analysis,\" a survey of the relevant characteristics of the environment is conducted with a sample of subjects currently performing in that setting. These subjects generate a detailed list of problematic situations that they have encountered  while performing on the job. The next step, \"response enumeration,\" is a sampling of the target population's common responses to these situations. The following phase, \"response evaluation,\" uses a panel of experts to evaluate the effectiveness of the various responses to the problematic situations generated in the preceding phase. These first three steps in the process are the \"criterion analysis.\" The next step is to construct a format (such as the Practicum Evaluation Measure) for presenting the selected situations (plus possible responses) to successive samples. The final step is to evaluate the measure using standard psychometric procedures. Details of ongoing research with this model at a psychology department training site are presented. Several program evaluation designs are  recommended, to assess the effectiveness of a program for trainees with different characteristics, different supervisory formats, or different training components.

A system called Re-Creative Psychology (originally conceived by Paul Frisch) addresses one way to frame anger in order to create constructive change. It is an organized system of behavior management which deals with three broad categories: self-actualization, social relationships, and spiritual well-being. Each category has a paired dimension which is the actual tool for managing anger and change effectively. In the self-actualization category, the paired dimension that leads to change is between social roles and feelings. For social relationships the paired dimension is between power and intimacy. The paired dimension for spiritual well-being is between responsibility and freedom. Anger  can be a useful force to change a bad situation, but it needs a great deal of guidance to make sure it is carefully directed to reach the desired goal. (LLL)",

To examine the effectiveness of a group psychotherapy program in assisting women prisoners to make the transition to the community and their families, 16 institutionalized women participated in a workshop. The program involved both individual and group participation, and concentrated on developing socially appropriate coping skills, learning about community resources, and developing a perspective on family and community roles. The women completed pre- and post-test measures of coping skills. Outcome data indicated that these prisoners understood the efficacy of moving away from self-centered, self-relient activities which harmed their coping; they also decreased the frequency of avoidant  behaviors which they used to immediately reduce tension. Participants began to delay gratification and consider the use of social supports to develop more effective coping skills. In follow-up inquiries 18 months after the training, these women had a recidivism rate of 9 percent, a drop of one-third compared to the overall prison population. These findings suggest that families of returning women prisoners and the prisoners themselves might be psychosocially strengthened with therapeutic and educational training. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"Since classroom teachers may ask school psychologists and principals for suggestions on handling classroom behaviors, the classroom management approach of these two groups is important. To determine whether teachers, school psychologists and principals respond differently to the aggressive, dependent, and academic behaviors of elementary age students an induction-sensitization model was employed. (The sensitizing approach places emphasis on stopping specific behaviors by employing external fear of punishment, and the inductive approach places emphasis on the development of internal control by the student and the prevention of future misbehavior.) The Classroom Management Questionnaire (CMQ) was administered to 189 classroom teachers, 145 principals and 172 school psychologists  representing urban, suburban, and rural schools at the elementary level. (The response rate was approximately 79% for school psychologists and principals, and approximately 50% for teachers.) The CMQ assesses style of socialization through the use of forced choice items involving male and female students. Results indicated that school psychologists selected more inductive responses than the principals and classroom teachers, and that female teachers selected inductive responses more often than male teachers. These results indicate that principals and teachers tend to approach student behavior differently than school psychologists, and the difference seems to represent not only a difference in specific techniques but also in overall style.

To assess parental style of behavior management, the Parental Management Questionnaire (PMQ) was completed by 1,957 parents of elementary school children (50% response rate). The PMQ is based on Aronfreed's (1968) model of parental socialization, and assesses style of socialization through the use of forced-choice items. Each item is composed of a behavioral situation and two alternatives for resolving the situation: a sensitizing approach, which aims at stopping certain behaviors by emphasizing fear of external punishment; and an inductive approach, which places emphasis on the child's development of internal control. Results indicated that  single parents selected more inductive responses than parents in intact families, and mothers selected more inductive responses than fathers. Single parents with a high school education or less selected significantly fewer inductive responses than single parents with a college background. In intact families, inductive responese were selected more often by mothers and by parents with higher levels of education. There were no differences in parenting style as a function of parental employment. (Author/LLL)",

To examine how sex differences in achievement orientation vary across achievement levels, 250 fifth grade children completed a questionnaire which assessed their preference for intellectual challenge. Several weeks later, each child was individually administered a discrimination-learning task to determine whether the child maintained, improved, or showed a deterioration in problem-solving strategies when confronted with insoluble problems. Children were divided into four achievement levels, according to their grade point average. Results showed that for the &quot;A&quot; students, significant sex differences emerged  in the predicted direction. Girls were significantly less likely than boys to prefer challenging tasks; and significantly more likely than boys to show a deterioration in their performance when they confronted insoluable problems. In contrast, there were no significant sex differences within any of the other achievement levels. These findings have implications for understanding why sex differences in achievement orientations emerge in some studies, but not in others. (Author/JAC)",

In order to understand the cognitive process mediating memory organization, accuracy in intuitive personality judgments was assessed in 18 female nurses by the \"programmed case\" method. This task casts an actual life history into a series of episodes, with several alternative endings. The participants were asked to choose the correct one, based on their knowledge of the case to that point, and to explain their choices in writing, after 4 of the 21 episodes. One week later they were asked to write out as much as they could remember of the life history. Subjects were ranked by their use of distant retrieval and divided equally into high, average, and low accuracy groups;  their explanations were then coded for their use of certain categories of information. The results showed that accuracy in personality judgment was related to the use of a distant retrieval strategy, and to the explanations given for those judgments. The use of motives, especially in context was related to accuracy. The use of global traits in isolation was not as successful as using information about social roles, relationships, and emotional reactions to infer motives in each particular situation. (LLL)",

        "description":"Preadolescents are faced with a variety of pressures, but usually receive little help in stress management from the school. To examine the effects of relaxation training on rural middle school students (N = 532), researchers implemented a daily 15-minute program of relaxation training exercises on aduio tapes in the regular classroom setting. The students recorded their wrist temperatures before and after each exercise as a measure of the relaxation state. Researchers examined five dependent variables and compared the performance of students in the experimental group with a randomized control group. Absenteeism and tardiness showed no significant differences between experimental and control groups. The experimental students, however, had significantly fewer discipline problems  than the control group, indicating that relaxation training has a positive effect on problem behavior. Also, while no overall experimental/control difference was found on a measure of self-concept, females in the experimental group did appear to have higher self-concept scores than females in the control group. Finally, while there was no overall difference between the experimental and control groups in achievement, the experimental groups which excelled at relaxing, as measured by wrist temperatures, scored significantly higher than their paired control groups. Experimental groups with poor relaxation skills scored equal to or lower than their control groups. This finding suggests the existence of a threshold of relaxation, a level necessary for cognitive gains. (Author/JAC)",

Current measures of empathy, such as the Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), have been analyzed by exploratory factor analytic methods which do not allow for the testing of a developmental model of the simplex form. This study was conducted to test Hoffman's theoretical formulations of empathy. Data from the responses of 679 college students to the four subscales of the Davis IRI (personal distress, empathic concern, perspective taking, and fantasy) were analyzed by multidimensional scaling techniques (ALSCAL). Results indicated that a two-dimensional solution provides the best model. The first dimension supports a simplex model of Hoffman's theory with three of the  four Davis subscales; the inclusion of the second dimension in the structure of empathy is questioned. It was found that fantasy clusters separately from the other components and thus may not belong in definitions of empathy. (Author)",

Chapter I discusses the application to business of concepts used by the counselor in one-to-one counseling, and elaborates key HRD components, i.e., career planning and development, training and development, and employee assistance programs. Chapter II discusses organizational climate, defining factors that contribute to it, formal and informal assessment, and organizational climate and corporate readiness for HRD. In Part II, the three HRD components briefly described  previously are examined in detail as transition points to business and industry for counselors as HRD professionals. Part III examines the consequences of ineffectively maintaining or caring for the human resources in a business setting. Burnout, viewed as the long-range consequence of not implementing HRD activities, is covered from the counselor's point of view through emphasis on assessment of burnout, its causes and costs, and methods to prevent both individual and corporate burnout. The conclusion examines HRD trends and training in relation to those in the counseling profession. (MCF)",

Teachers were invited to explore reading comprehension and composition in their classrooms in a manner that supported unique teacher decision making and initiatives. Researchers helped teachers observe what they were doing, consider alternatives, and examine the potential of changes in practice. During the first year, researchers and teachers studied one of three topics: background knowledge, reading and writing relationships, and the role of discussion in reading instruction. In addition, teachers generated the equivalent of 15 mini-research projects ranging from the effects of different  modes of discussion upon pupil involvement and the quality of their arguments to the effects of visualization experiences upon the reading of selected students in a low reading group. During the second year, each teacher chose to explore a single topic area in depth over the course of the year. The goal of the third year was to engage the teacher researchers in helping other teachers become teacher researchers. Based upon this experience, it is hoped the project can serve as a useful model for nurturing teacher change as well as translating reading and writing research into practice (and practice back into research).

        "description":"In the context of whole language learning, the teaching of phonics can be approached in two different ways. In one situation, the teacher engages children in composing with a purpose and for an audience, during which time the children become aware of graphophonic relationships through their need to spell words. In the other situation, the teacher engages the children in choral reading and language play that proceeds from a carefully chosen or constructed folk rhyme to sentence investigation, to phonic investigation, and, finally, to mastery of the CVC (consonant, vowel, consonant) syllable pattern in single and multisyllabic words. In both situations, the teacher teaches the complex tasks of writing and reading by first engaging children in the task itself and then having them  experience differentiating language into its component parts. In the writing task, the differentiation proceeds from the child writing purposefully for an audience to becoming more aware of the graphophonic system through solving the problem of how to spell correctly. In the reading task, the differentiation proceeds from the teacher presenting a chant or folk rhyme chosen or constructed because of its inclusion of words that provide repetition of certain graphophonic patterns. In either situation, the instruction integrates that which is usually taught separately--phonics, spelling, and the study of sentences. This integrated approach is an example of whole language learning and it allows more time to be devoted to purposeful reading, writing, and dialoguing in all subject areas.  (HOD)",

        "description":"Resulting from a joint venture between the University of North Florida and the Duval County Public School System, homework assistance programs are available to students in the large urban public school system of Jacksonville. The homework assistance programs are committed to providing a free source of immediate aid to students and parents who encounter problems completing homework assignments. A help-with-homework telephone hotline was first installed in the county professional library. Teachers are trained to assist the callers in finding the solution on their own. Each hotline team includes two elementary school teachers and one teacher certified in secondary language arts and one in secondary math. The hotline operates three hours per night, four evenings per week. The success  of the hotline precipitated the Homework Assistance Program three months later. This program also provides teacher assistance, using school media centers as resource centers after regular school hours. The teacher teams in the resource centers also consist of math and language arts teachers. These assistance centers operate two hours a day, two days a week. Participation in both programs has shown that students and parents desire such academic assistance, but a vital component of the success of these programs has been the cooperation between the university and the public school system, a model that has received national attention.

        "author":["Lesnick, Henry"],
        "description":"There are several factors that account for the absence of college programs that adequately address students with dyslexia-related behavior, but probably none is more significant than the governmental definition regarding the condition itself. The federal law that provides for the special instruction of dyslexic students explicitly excludes those whose conditions are primarily the result of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage. While it has been demonstrated that a minority of these disorders are indeed associated with intrinsic causes such as reversed cerebral asymetry and other conditions that may be genetically influenced, it is also clear that much of the behavior presently indistinguishable from that of the so-called intrinsic disorders is determined by no  demonstrable intrinsic causes and is shaped by extrinsic factors such as inadequate developmental and educational experience. Nothing presently justifies viewing the law's exclusionary provision as actually explaining the causes of this condition, nor should it dictate the educational policy toward it. The characteristic language problems of dyslexic adults are poor decoding and encoding ability. They must be taught basic phonics and word attack skills that were never mastered and that are prerequisites for them to achieve higher levels of literacy. Through a proper program of identification and appropriate instruction, these students can achieve a degree of literacy that would otherwise elude them. (HOD)",

        "description":"As part of a larger effort to develop a test battery for diagnosing difficulties with various word recognition subskills among mainstreamed students in grades 2 through 5, four experiments were conducted to compare the abilities of good and poor readers to read a frequency-graduated series of irregularly spelled words first in isolation and then in meaningful context. In the first two experiments, 106 children in an urban public school were asked to read aloud a list of words of graduated frequency and irregular spelling-to-sound correspondences, and also to read aloud 50 sentences, each containing a test word. Results showed that word recognition was significantly aided by the presence of meaningful context for both poor and good readers. The data also indicated that context  assisted recognition most for words of intermediate familiarity, that words of greater familiarity were reliably recognized without context, and that words of lesser familiarity were not recognized even with context. The third and fourth experiments replicated the tasks with children from a suburban school district. Results, while quantitatively superior, were qualitatively similar to those obtained in the first two experiments. (The complete tests are included.) (HOD)",

        "description":"Both sentence length and sentence complexity of various kinds of newspaper prose were examined in a study to determine (1) ways newspaper prose differs from the prose of books native English speaking students chose to read and enjoy reading and (2) whether there are features of newspaper prose other than vocabulary and a lack of international news keeping advanced second language students from reading the news. A random sample of 100 sentences each was taken from two major Philadelphia newspapers, along with a sample of 100 sentences each from two of the major international wire services. In addition, a random sample of 25 sentences each was taken from a sample of 8 books chosen by community college students. These sentences were then compared for sentence length and syntactic  constructions, first to identify the differences between them, and second to formulate reading strategies to cope with the special problems presented by the newspaper prose. The analysis revealed that newspaper syntax differed from the book prose in the number rather than the kind of construction, with each construction appearing more frequently in the newspaper prose. Taken as a group, however, the constructions resulted in systematically different sentences. (The paper includes a listing of reading strategies for reading the newspaper. The appendixes list the sample methodology and the book prose samples.) (HOD)",

        "author":["Crismore, Avon"],
        "description":"Meaning does not reside in the text or the reader but results from interactions between text, reader, and the interpretive communities that the readers belong to or that influence them. These interpretive communities are those communities or authorities that influence the reader/writer in interpreting texts, with resulting ideational, interpersonal, and personal effects. The interpretive communities serve seven functions: (1) selecting (topic, book, project for performance); (2) gathering additional information/collaborating; (3) integrating reading, writing, illustrating, and performing; (4) analyzing readership/authorship; (5) interpreting (getting/giving meaning); (6) taking a stance/perspective; and (7) evaluating/questioning (self-others). For a child, the interpretive  communities consist of the intrapersonal, or the child's relationship between the self as reader and the self as writer as authorities and influences during interpretation. It also consists of the interpersonal, or the child's relationship with teachers, peers, family, and others as authorities and influences. The reading and writing logs and thinksheets of one little girl, Jill, at Atkinson Academy (New Hampshire) reveal several important roles that interpretive communities play. For Jill, a positive attitude toward herself as an author depended on her stories making sense and being considered great by her interpretive communities. Peer interpretive communities seem to play a much stronger role for writing than for reading in most areas, especially for interpreting texts.  (HOD)",

        "description":"While the look-say versus the phonics controversy has existed for years in reading instruction, a similar debate regarding spelling instruction is only now emerging out of the literature and into the hands of the classroom teacher. \"Subskill\" spelling, most frequently found in current spelling programs, presumes that good spelling is achieved by learning the 200 or more rules governing the 500 or more different ways of writing the 44 speech sounds using 26 letters. \"Holistic\" spelling, analogous to reading's look-say method and rarely found in commercial materials, basically rejects the rules approach. It views spelling as a visual processing task: each word has its own unique feature to be learned, and rules governing the spelling of one sound may not apply to other words with  identical sounds. Students in holistic spelling programs initially complete a pretest to identify words already known, then employ a look, say, write, and self-correct procedure on words they need to learn--a process repeated until mastery is achieved. Research literature projects great support for holistic spelling instruction, yet an evaluation of 11 widely used elementary commercial programs showed that only one was holistic, and five involved a mixture of holistic and subskill strategies. It is predicted that disenchantment with current spelling programs, declining achievement scores, and the trend toward holistic reading instruction will provide new impetus for a resurgence in holistic spelling instruction.

        "description":"The issue addressed in this paper is the relationship between form in fictional prose and form in other uses of language, particularly those uses important in composition theory. Form in composition theory has traditionally had two ways of identifying units of analysis: (1) the sentence and semantic units, and (2) pragmatic and rhetorical units. The focus of the paper is on pragmatics and rhetoric. The paper argues that fictional narratives have the underlying form of different types of ordinary speech events and that an understanding of this form helps explain some of the problems young readers sometimes have and some of the critical problems posed by literary critics. Distancing, processing, and modeling are examined, with emphases on the distancing dimension, the processing  characteristics, and the modeling characteristics of speech events. Three types of speech events are considered: conversational, report story, and prototype exposition (one type of formal history). The misreading of stories is discussed, with special attention given to: assimilation or the following of rules; the misreading of fact without context; misreading the narrator as unchanging; misreading distance, choice, and boredom; and accommodation, or the modification of rules.

Modes of thought, dominant paradigms, perspectives on communication and organizations, and research approaches are reviewed using organizational culture as both a basis for comparison and a point of correlation. Divided into nine sections, the paper reviews theories espoused by such researchers as Linda Putnam, George Cheney, Michael Pacanowsky, Nick O'Donnell-Trujillo, and Andrew Pettigrew. (HOD)",

        "description":"Foreign students enrolled in colleges and universities in the United States represent a broad range of cultures and could provide the intercultural experiences and wider world view that American students need. At present, however, interaction between these foreign students and their American classmates is minimal. A survey of foreign student advisors and instructors from 16 community colleges in nine states indicated that food fairs, student fairs, and international student clubs were the primary means of bringing American and international students together. Few academic programs appear to exist where American and international students can meet and exchange ideas, yet the classroom is the best place for a campus to begin to widen its horizons. Courses can be designed to focus  on intercultural communication or to take up the minority viewpoint on historical, political or social issues. Foreign students can also be invited to guest lecture in appropriate courses. A sampling of foreign students enrolled at Prince George's Community College (Maryland) indicates that the idea of using international students in the classroom gets a favorable response from international students. Some 72% of those surveyed enjoyed being asked to speak about the views and actions of their countries. Similarly, those colleges and universities that have used foreign students as teachers in various ways have reported some significant success with their programs. More campuses, however, need to involve themselves to a much greater degree with international education. (RBW)",

        "description":"To explain evidence that females receive higher grades in communication courses than males, one researcher has posed a competence/compliance paradox: either, women are more competent communicators and are only judged to be less competent in public life because of prejudice, or, women are not as competent as men in communication as demonstrated in public life and their higher grades in the classroom are an artifice created by the context and their high compliance with instruction. In an attempt to resolve this paradox, discriminant analysis and correlational procedures were used to examine the relationship between grades received by 2,083 male and female students and their communicative responsiveness, as indicated by nine responsiveness scales. The results indicated that the  communication patterns of sensitive speaker, sensitive listener, and supportive norm are female-specific patterns and the pattern of problem handler is male-specific. The sensitive speaker pattern is salient to most assignment grades in the course and offers the most likely explanation of why women get higher course grades than men. Although the pattern is a compliance pattern that focuses on the other person, it also represents the fundamental competency in a speech communication course: speaking. The results seem to favor the competence explanation for higher grades for women, but they also suggest that women are communicatively compliant and more competent than males. (HTH)",

        "author":["Metallinos, Nikos"],
        "description":"Technological advancements in television images have resulted in an increase of media imagery. One cause of people's fascination with the new media technology is the constant utilization of depth axis staging. The visual elements that make up the image are often placed within the Z-axis, moving rapidly toward or away from the viewer, often vanishing from the screen or blasting toward the viewer unexpectedly. Sometimes, entire frames fly away, flip over or retreat toward the vanishing point. The emphasis on and persistance in the use of depth composition and extraordinary special effects, coupled with the unusually fast advance and retreat of visual space, have been found to have some negative effects on viewer comprehension and understanding of visual space. The combination of  rapid inward-outward movement, distorted depth of field, and forceful direction of visual elements placed on the Z-axis disturbs viewer comprehension and diminishes the aesthetic appreciation of such images. Empirical research in the composition of the depth axis in television images would aid in the study of the psychophysiological effects of these images on viewers. Since psychophysiological measuring techniques concern themselves with the covert or hidden repsonses to communication stimuli such as detection of eye movements or changes in heart rate, they would be the most suitable for the study of such new and complex media images.

        "description":"Due to their increasing complexity, modern organizations require more effective integrating mechanisms. The conference, which can be a very positive thing for an organization as it provides rewards for members while performing a crucial communication function for the whole, is one possible mechanism. Communication is not only an inherent part of the integration process; it is, in fact, the primary means by which integration is achieved. To be successful, a conference must have clearly defined goals and an organizational climate that encourages participation. Similarly, conferees must have enough background in common to ensure a minimal level of understanding, as well as a willingness to work toward attaining conference goals. A successful conference increases understanding,  agreement, and interaction among conferees, and thus more effective integration. Increased integration, in turn, heightens coordination and control, assists in maintaining organizational cultures, and facilitates the flow of information within the organization. (RBW)",

The third secion offers suggestions on how to adjust classroom practice to take account of the range of nonverbal communication behaviors that are an essential part of prison culture, and the fourth explores the need for a flexible course structure that can be adapted to meet the expectations of class members. The fifth section looks at the heightened level of political awareness  found in the prison student population and suggests that in this unconventional setting media studies have the potential to become a powerful learning tool. The concluding section observes that the atmosphere in maximum security institutions is not conducive to learning and cautions prospective prison teachers against expecting too much from their students.

For example, some institutions are using cable capabilities to broadcast direct and inservice instruction or to provide hands-on training for broadcast students. A small private liberal arts college in Iowa successfully uses cable facilities to offer an introductory course in television production. The college also uses the public access channel to broadcast an introductory survey course of the fine arts, comprised of class discussion sessions and written evaluations, and a series of videotaped programs interviewing individuals involved in the arts. Educators should keep the following recommendations in mind as they consider implementing media programs through public  access television: (1) they must become more aware and more involved in the negotiations of local cable franchise agreements, (2) they must keep informed of regulations and legislation that could influence cable systems, and (3) they must increase their planning for and use of cable facilities before the technology is absorbed solely for entertainment purposes.

        "description":"The growth in the popularity and importance of disadvantage arguments in debate has been, in some measure, due to the growing belief that debate should be viewed from a policy-making perspective. And, with the focus of contemporary debate shifting to the consequences of policy actions, there has been a concurrent increase in the sophistication of affirmative plans. Most affirmative teams not only carefully construct plans in order to avoid disadvantage arguments, but also tend to choose case areas that seem to be least prone to disadvantages. Thus, a policy optimization model can be useful to the debater for tracing the consequences of policy action. It allows the negative to place affirmative policies into the perspective of general goals so that specific sources of policy  dysfunction may be discovered. By using the bell-shaped benefit curves and valley-shaped cost curves, a policy can be determined to be at its optimal level when the policy reaches a point that is at the greatest distance between costs and benefits. This implies that a policy designed to achieve a given objective may be adopted in varying degrees or that different policies may be adopted along a continuum of effect toward a goal. By using the model, policy actions can be compared to the desired objectives of the policy. If it can be agreed that a goal can be achieved in varying degrees and that there are desirable limits of policy effect, then the further application of this model will serve to clarify many sources of policy dysfunction.

        "description":"Effective schools have staffs that stress the importance of educational goals and have a well-defined mission. They also clearly communicate the expectation that all students can and will reach the stated goals. Reviews of studies of exemplary schools find that the principals express high expectations for both teacher and student performance, while the teachers have high expectations for their students. Effective schools have a climate conducive to student attainment, whereas declining schools project a negative climate and a belief that students cannot attain educational goals. An orderly learning environment is another important factor in effective schools and further reflects a positive school attitude and climate. The most consistent finding in school effectiveness research  is the importance of the principal's strong leadership role. The principal sets the tone for the school and reinforces the positive school climate. Since schools are distinguished by a complex set of cultural processes, the modification of this &quot;culture&quot; in ineffective schools is not a simple matter. One effective method for improvement is the use of organizational development techniques specifically designed to alter the norms of an organization. Behavior modification techniques can also be used to alter a school's norms. A body of literature geared to the &quot;cultural&quot; view of school change has recently emerged; &quot;Creating Effective Schools&quot; by Wilbur Brookover is recommended to school principals as a source of guidelines for improving a school.

The study surveyed supervisory practices in 24 local education agencies (LEA's) through a survey questionnaire and a literature search. The report identifies 18 key findings and issues relating to supervision, including the following: (1) The larger the district, the more teachers are supervised by any one supervisor. (2) More attention is paid to the &quot;means&quot; of data collection than to the &quot;end&quot; of instructional improvement. (3) In practice, assistant supervisors, central office supervisors, and school-based supervisors rarely have a common understanding of the purpose, philosophy, and process of supervision. (4) Supervisors prefer to be independent and  want to develop greater expertise in using relevant research. The study also found a wide range of perspectives, expertise, and approaches in locally developed materials for supervision and evaluation. While diversity may be appropriate, the researchers felt there should be cohesion with an LEA and stronger evidence of activity to improve instructional practice. LEA's may benefit from applying a process of interactive strategic planning, improving coordination, reducing organizational complexity, and focusing on improvement of supervision. Included are 20 tables and a 4-page bibliography. Ten appendixes provide summaries of models of supervision study. (MD)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to examine what is known about the costs and cost-effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) by presenting an appropriate cost methodology, applying it to CAI, and exploring the validity of four popular assumptions. These assumptions are: (1) that computer hardware accounts for most of the cost of delivering CAI; (2) that drastic declines in future costs of computers will create similar reductions in CAI; (3) that networks of microcomputers used for CAI are less costly than minicomputers with similar capabilities; and (4) that CAI has been found to be more cost effective than other instructional alternatives. The first three assumptions are directly contradicted by the available evidence. With respect to cost-effectiveness in raising student  achievement in mathematics and reading, CAI was found to be more cost-effective than reducing class size, increasing the length of the school day, or adult tutoring, but considerably less cost-effective than peer tutoring. A bibliography of 11 citations is appended. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"&quot;A Nation at Risk&quot; and other recent reports have focused public attention on excellence in education. During the same period, the federal government has cut aid to education by almost 20 percent and consolidated federal funding into block grant programs, which some critics have claimed are less efficient than programs before consolidation. Tax reforms in 19 states limited growth of state spending or taxation between 1976 and 1981. Given this backdrop of taxpayer revolts and cuts in federal aid, the prognosis for financing the recommended educational reforms seems grim. Campaigns to raise voter consciousness have overcome voter resistance to raise school taxes in some areas. The Ohio 1983 election is a prime example; there, tax reforms that would have drastically cut education  support were successfully defeated. A number of other states have mobilized support for education, but the trend is not uniform. Support for education has decreased in many states. Some educators question whether there is a direct correlation between spending and academic achievement. Others suggest that schools should be run like businesses for maximum savings. Some fear that the search for excellence has reduced the commitment to educational equity, while others argue for a radical restructuring of educational finance through tax credits or tuition vouchers. Perhaps the realization of America's declining position in world markets provides the best hope that the educational excellence movement will have a permanent impact on education. (MD)",

Chapter one introduces the report's methodology, limitations, and structure. Chapter two first states the purpose of ADL--to help educators use research findings to improve student achievement; then it identifies crucial variables in achievement and outlines a process for influencing these variables. Finally, the chapter describes five strategies used to build district capacity: allowing districts substantial flexibility in implementation; planning, and orienting and training personnel, from the top down; using special activities to introduce  innovations and build each district's organizational skills; providing onsite technical assistance; and directing activities toward long-term goals. Chapter three discusses the leadership plan for ADL, activities designed to sustain its implementation, and support materials. The next two chapters analyze the capacity-building process in three school districts. Chapter four discusses orientation, planning, and training; chapter five discusses implementation, evaluation, and institutionalization. Conclusions regarding each of the five strategies and conditions affecting implementation complete the report. Appendixes present a summary of data collection methods used, tables showing implementation patterns, and an interpretation on achievement gains. (MCG)",

If the school grant plan is to be successfully adopted, the following issues need immediate attention: (1) the definition of separate and public ratepayers; (2) the level of funding for grades 9 and 10 in the separate schools; (3) the adequacy and impact of grants for small schools and school boards; and (4) the short-term implementation costs as they relate to the exchange of staff, students, buildings, and other capital assets between boards. Major implications of this decision include the following points: (1) the long-term effects of the  technical details of how education is financed can be substantial; (2) policymakers should therefore act knowingly; (3) policymakers should move with restraint, evaluating the effects of decisions as change occurs; and (4) policymakers must be concerned with the extent to which the economic prosperity of the Golden Horseshoe area of Ontario is utilized, for this might endanger the area's ability to drive the economy of Ontario and Canada.

An instrument to help select professionals who reflect ethical traits is the Leadership Behavior Description Questionnaire with 12 leadership subscales (LBDQ, Form XII). Selected questions illustrate the LBDQ and the 12 subscales. Two major leadership subscales developed in relation to the LBDQ are &quot;Initiation of Structure,&quot; the more formal classical bureaucratic subscale; and &quot;Consideration,&quot; the more socially humanistically-oriented subscale. High scores on both Initiation of Structure and Consideration mean positive ethical perspectives for leadership potential. Therefore, if one were to use the LBDQ, Form XII  and its 12 subscales, one could determine who is best qualified for leadership roles. The appendixes contain a synopsis of the instrument questions pertaining to Initiation of Structure and Consideration; a chart of how these two leadership dimensions are currently related to organization cohesiveness; and a summary of the work and applied theories of the following theorists: Fredrick W.

        "description":"Recent studies at the Center for Educational Policy and Management provide insight into how collective bargaining affects the teaching profession, educational policy, and student achievement. Charles Kerchner's report links a three-stage labor relations model with an analysis of teaching as work. His case studies, besides revealing wide variations in contract interpretation, indicate that reliance on collective bargaining tends to rigidify the teaching profession. Accordingly, he categorizes teachers that may resist formalization and speculates on the consequences of resistance. Steven Goldschmidt and others have explored the extent and effects of bargaining over policy issues. An 80-contract sample contained many provisions that focused on policy; contrary to previous findings,  bargaining over many policy issues had continued to increase after 1975. Unlike Kerchner, Goldschmidt's team found contracts uniformly applied. Their study also suggests that policy bargaining may influence school effectiveness. Finally, Randall Eberts and Joe A. Stone, using input-output analysis, compared student achievement in union and nonunion school districts. They found that collective bargaining markedly affects achievement, but positive and negative effects cancel each other. Taken together, these studies suggest that common expectations for collective bargaining be reexamined. (MCG)",

Although all the schools were in a single urban district, significant differences were identified among them. The written policies of each school varied in the elaboration and emphasis of various themes in district policy, and the schools varied in the responsibilities they assigned to the student behavior specialist. The schools also varied in suspension rates and disciplinary referrals. The school with the highest number of suspensions and referrals had a codified, strictly enforced discipline policy. The school with the least number of suspensions and referrals did not have elaborate descriptions of rules, but the principal and teachers shared standards and were able to use discretion  in handling individual cases of misbehavior. Rather than providing conclusions about effective discipline policies, these three case studies illustrate the problems of administrators in trying to balance teachers' needs for protection and students' needs for correction.

An interdisciplinary approach focuses on thinking as an essential, integral part of both subject area learning and &quot;higher order&quot; basic skills development, particulary reading comprehension, analytic writing, and mathematical reasoning and problem solving. Since 1980, more than 100 Newark teachers have participated in the project's program of graduate course work in curriculum development and basic skills  instruction, a supervised classroom implementation, and elective professional development activities. Hundreds more have engaged in less intensive project activities. Analysis of pretest and posttest scores of students in grades 10-12 found that the students doubled their annual growth rate in reading comprehension, from an average rate of 6 months in a 10-month period to a rate of 12 months, demonstrating the effectiveness of the project.

        "description":"This research examined the distributional and programmatic impact of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) of 1981, Chapter 2, during its first year of implementation, to determine how it has measured up to meeting the goal for which it was enacted, and whether or not the Reagan Administration's promises regarding block grants have been fulfilled. A brief historical review of antecedent federal legislation is provided, followed by the legislative history of ECIA. Provisions of the act are described, along with the claims of the Reagan Administration with respect to its effects. The validity of these claims is assessed by means of a multidimensional time-series study comparing the fiscal and distributive impact of antecedent federal aid to education for fiscal  years 1980 and 1981 with Education Block Grant funding for FY 1982, at all levels of the intergovernmental transfer system. Findings revealed that reductions in aid, coupled with consolidation of categorical funding into block grants, had a disproportionately adverse effect on (1) the Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes areas; (2) states with large numbers of poor children; and (3) minorities. The stated goals of the block grants, namely to reduce wasteful spending, improve education, and increase local decision-making power, have not been met.

        "description":"Recent criticisms of science education in the United States led to a unique experience in the Conroe Independent School District in Texas. An evaluation committee of local professional and eminent scientists was established by the local superintendent to review and evaluate the adequacy of (1) the scope and sequence of science courses; (2) laboratory and classroom facilities; (3) equipment and supplies; (4) student participation in science activities; (5) textbooks and teaching aids; (6) inservice opportunities; (7) student scheduling and counseling; (8) teaching force; (9) enrichment activities; and (10) library offerings, at the secondary and elementary levels. The committee visited science classes, counseled with participating students, and conferred with science teachers at  all levels throughout the district. Findings include: (1) the high school teachers lacked current, state-of-the-art science knowledge; (2) the science courses needed improvements in six specific areas; (3) the laboratories needed larger physical facilities with more sophisticated equipment; and (4) there was a need to improve academic counseling of students with respect to science and mathematic course prerequisites. The changes that have resulted from the evaluation have led to improved instruction and support of science education in the district, and an ongoing relationship between the district schools, scientists, and the university programs.

Specific questions are posed, reviews of relevant literature conducted, and an assessment of the soundness and completeness of existing evidence is made. After an introductory overview, chapter 2 presents a series of five tables illustrating Ontario school finance trends from 1968 to 1980: per pupil expenditures; the allocation of these funds among public, separate, and secondary schools; the number of special education students; the number of pupils per teacher; and the ratio of public and separate school pupil-teacher ratios to secondary school pupil-teacher ratios. Chapter 3 reviews research that demonstrates the social benefits of education to the entire community. Chapter 4  reviews research showing a positive correlation between education and public health. Similarly, chapter 5 reviews research showing an inverse correlation between education and the crime rate, while chapter 6 draws on research to show the positive effects of education on economic growth. The concluding chapter discusses the private and social rates of return on investment in education. An epilogue provides an update on recent actions taken by the Ontario government in support of education and points out the need for further research. (TE)",

Data are assembled under three categories of measures: outcomes, resources, and context of education. The section on outcomes contains such measures as the proportion of 18- to 19-year-olds who have graduated from high school, student achievement, and what students do after they graduate. Student performance data are drawn from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), and the American College Testing Program (ACT). A study by the International Association for Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA)  compares mathematics achievement in grades 8 and 12 in the United States with that of comparable students from 18 other countries. The resources section contains data on such measures as fiscal resources, quantity and quality of the teaching force, estimated teacher supply and demand, and teacher earnings. The section which focuses on context of education includes such variables as instructional climate of the school, opinion and support of parents and the community, student characteristics, graduation requirements, and an index of state requirements for special educational services. Eleven appendixes provide supplementary data and a glossary concludes the report. (MLF)",

It begins by briefly noting the changing face of industrial society and suggests the need to reexamine traditional concepts of work as paid employment. The effects of new technologies are traced, along with changes in the distribution of occupations, changes in working conditions and the organization of work, changes in attitudes toward work and the meaning of work. The origins and evolution of British vocational rehabilitation are noted, and trends revealing the accumulation of a large pool of long-term unemployed disabled people are cited. The final section addresses the future of the British vocational rehabilitation system, noting the  need for improvement in four areas: assessment and intervention methods appropriate to a post-industrial society, increased services to underserved portions of the disabled population (e.g. disabled women, disabled people in rural areas), increased attention to the social and economic context in which services are provided, and use of more sophisticated planning and decision making aids.

Seven college seniors in special education were trained to implement SCE's naturalistically in tutoring 13 LD pupils in grades 1-6 over a 10 week period, with a control group of 8 seniors tutoring 11 LD pupils. Pre- and postwriting samples, obtained using standardized drawings as stimuli, were analyzed for mean number of words, mean number of words per T-unit, percentage of well-formed T-units, and mean number of adjectives per T-unit. While no significant differences were present for the control group, the experimental group made significant gains on mean number of words (p<.05) and mean number of words per T-unit (p<.001). No  evidence was found that the experimental group either overapplied their SCE instruction or created errors in new syntactic structures. Limitations of the study were discussed. However, the size of the effects obtained and the fact that data corroborated previous studies with other populations indicated that instructional use of SCE's with LD pupils should be pursued.

A study of the program's effects on changing attitudes involved 12 mothers of children 3-6 years old. Analysis of pre- and post-scores in an attitude survey revealed a statistically significant change in the group of mothers' attitudes toward the handicapped as a result of the Parent-Child Enrichment Program, while there was no statistically significant change in their perception of their children as a result of the program.  Possible reasons for the findings are considered, and recommendations for parent training programs are offered. (CL)",

        "description":"The paper examines the possible role of siblings of handicapped children in helping or caretaking. A review of the literature is performed as a basis for proposing that there are circumstances in which intrinsically motivated, or altruistic, helping may be a more adaptive approach to coping with a handicapped brother or sister than other strategies, including enforced compliance to helping demands, indifference, or withdrawal. A model is presented which sets three kinds of antecedents as bases for voluntary adoption of a helper role within the family: demographic factors, personality variables, and situational factors. Research is reviewed on the predisposition to help, helping behavior, and mental health outcomes. It is concluded that there is evidence to support the position  that voluntary helping may be used as a means for productive and successful coping with the stress of living with a handicapped sibling.

Students then participated in general computer literacy instruction and instruction with either the spelling or language arts program. Results revealed that software selection was difficult in that very little software lent itself to adaptation. A program was developed that successfully increased students' typing skills. Spelling and language programs were evaluated, and computer attitude measures revealed a  decrease in enjoyment scores (perhaps revealing that initial scores were inflated due to unrealistic expectations about computers). With computer experience, a decrease in anxiety about computers was evidenced, along with an increase in feelings of efficacy.

Contrary to hypotheses, good writers did not make more changes (i.e., improvements) from draft to revised writing than poor writers. Good and poor writers did, however, differ greatly in the content of their writing protocols, despite the finding that poor writers were more likely to use a structural  organization while good writers focused on cohesiveness.

A comparative study is made of two issue areas that typify judicially mandated reform--prisons and special education. Distinctions between the two settings--school systems and penal institutions--are noted for organizational structure and operations, stated and operational goals, and the relevance of  professionalism. The emergence of public law litigation and the effects of judicial attempts to reform public institutions are briefly considered, followed by detailed analysis of four decisions (Pennsylvania Association of Retarded Children v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Jose P. v. Ambach, Rhem v. Malcolm, and Palmigiano v. Garrahy). Four major determinants of the impact of institutional reform litigation are identified: issue, organizational setting, professionalism, and environmental factors.

Background and current status data were analyzed revealing a largely male, white, sample with lower-middle to upper-lower socioeconomic status. Achievement scores ranged from 55% to 66% of expected grade placement. Ss placed in LD classes seemed to evidence poorer school coping skills than did LD Ss identified but not placed. Discriminant analysis indicated that the number of retentions and the presence of others in the family with learning problems determined the discriminant function which maximally differentiated the placed and nonplaced Ss. Current status indicators showed the  sample to be functioning quite well as adults, with Ss reporting moderate happiness with their employment. The great majority of Ss reported no longer experiencing a significant problem in reading, although some did. Highly positive ratings were ascribed to vocational education and LD classes by those who participated in them. Multiple regression techniques suggested that the best predictors of grades completed were presence of dropouts among peers, number of absences prior to referral, and grade-point average prior to referral. The best predictive combination with reference to current income range included group membership (placed or nonplaced) and grade-point average prior to referral. (CL)",

Results revealed that  significantly more LD and non-LD treatment Ss compared to attention and test-only control Ss, demonstrated improvement on number of institutional negative behavior reports recorded, phase level promotions earned, good days credited, and institutional ratings of progress toward treatment goals. LD and non LD treatment Ss also demonstrated learning of specifically trained metacognitive awareness skills. Both LD and non LD treatment Ss demonstrated some but not practical improvement in generating better quality solutions to novel hypothetical social problems. Meta self-assessment was not enhanced at a statistically significant level by training. Blind staff ratings found many more LD treatment Ss as inproved in behavior and somewhat more non LD treatment Ss improved compared to control Ss.  (CL)",

        "description":"The mental health/education outreach training model to prevent special education teacher career attrition is based on the assumption that if one member of a relational system has a problem, then the entire system has a problem. High special education teacher attrition rates are contrasted with lower estimates for the teaching profession as a whole. The unrecognized special education teacher relational issues which are similar to the dysfunctions found in family interactions can also be viewed as concepts fundamental to change. These include: (1) fusion; (2) triangulation; (3) problem ownership; (4) defensive response style; and (5) the maintenance of expectations for parents and children at some level other than zero. The outreach training model content and specific strategies  discussed in this paper focus on a choice \"intervention\" based on the premise that a perception of \"no choice\" in changing self-perceptions and behaviors on the part of teachers interacting with children and parents breeds poor mental health. The model focuses on preventing the intimidation and resentment that are precursors of this poor mental health resulting in the well publicized special education teacher career attrition. There needs to be a therapeutic line of support for teachers to help them learn to approach children and parents with systematic healthy objectivity during the inevitable problem times and rough spots which occur while teaching. Enhancing educational training through an outreach model is one way to ensure such support. (Author/CL)",

Cultural differences in communication are divided into eight types and illustrated: (1) when to talk; (2) what to say; (3) pacing and pausing; (4) the art of listening; (5) intonation; (6) what is conventional and what is not in a language; (7) degree of indirectness; and (8) cohesion and coherence. Examples of these observations about communications skills, found in one person's experience with answering telephones in Greece, are discussed. It is concluded that cross-cultural communication presents a double-bind: the need to be  connected to others and the need not to be imposed upon and that, in certain cultural situations, individuals must compromise these needs in order to communicate. An analogy is made between cross-cultural communication and a route on which someone has turned the signs around: the familiar signposts are there, but they don't lead in the right direction. (MSE)",

        "description":"Models of and research into the writing process support the use of peer editing in the regular activities of a writing class. It has the advantages of: adding perspective to students' perception of the writing process, both their own and others'; promoting student self-confidence; improving the class atmosphere by active student involvement; and providing an additional diagnostic and teaching tool. For teachers using peer editing, it is useful to establish a classroom climate of trust, design activities leading to the first editing exercise, give the students clear reasons for using the process, designate regular peer editing days, have specific tasks and questions for peer editors to use to build on previous work in class and on previous editing sessions, work with groups of  three students, set a time limit for student editors, have student editors explain comments to their peers as well as write them down, have students rewrite their compositions and incorporate the suggestions made, and include an editor self-evaluation component. Common questions about peer editing in English as a second language (ESL) concern its effectiveness for grammatical errors, reinforcement of errors by peers, whether or not students take peer editing seriously enough, the opportunity for cheating and plagiarism, and the time consumed in the process. Editing sheets for intermediate and advanced ESL classes are appended. (MSE)",

        "description":"Two methods of outlining are suggested for college-level students of English as a second language (ESL) who need the tools to master rhetorical patterns of academic written English that may be very different from those in their native languages. The two outlining techniques separate the four logically distinct tasks in the process of outlining: (1) information or idea gathering; (2) logical grouping of the information or ideas; (3) labeling the groups according to a common denominator; and (4) placing the groups and the information within them into some logical order. The techniques separate the four tasks and deal with them one at a time. The first technique, box outlining, combines a modified brainstorming technique, called a scattergram, designed to gather ideas about a topic,  with the task of organizing the ideas into boxes of related ideas, which the student then orders and the teacher checks. This technique can be used to introduce rhetorical patterns as well as organize ideas. The second technique, the card outline, allows more experimentation with classifying ideas by having ideas, printed on small cards, easily arranged and rearranged until the student arrives at an appropriate organization. Both techniques allow students to learn the separate elements of outlining and the logical development of English academic and professional writing so that linking ideas becomes a simpler task.

        "description":"Graduation competency test results of 27 Spanish-speaking high school students in grades 10-12 indicate that overall oral English proficiency is moderately to strongly correlated with test passage in all three areas tested: mathematics, reading, and writing. These results agree with previous research. However, despite the intuitive appeal of competency testing, its rationale must be carefully evaluated to determine the importance of the test results. Passage of competency tests is intended to demonstrate that students possess skills needed in later life, but prediction of the skills needed in life is problematic. Other conceptual and technical questions about competency testing arise from the definition of test content and method. While it is unrealistic to expect to find a  perfect fit between school language demands and those found in an adult role, instruction in English as a second language (ESL) could profit from materials drawn from other curriculum areas to help students develop skills tested by competency tests, thus improving articulation between second language instruction and other school subjects in the process of preparing ESL students for the tests.

Complex cerebral mechanisms function in a coordinated effort to analyze and synthesize the various components of linguistic codes, store them in semantic representations in one memory, and reproduce them in the language in which the bilingual speaker is expected to communicate in a given situation or context. Aware that they communicate in a sociocultural environment, speakers interact with members of social groups representing two different languages and realize that their linguistic codes are influenced by and permeated with sociocultural elements unique to each language. This is the  reality for bilingual persons as they learn to live in and adapt to the changing circumstances of a bilingual bicultural society. (Author/MSE)",

The results exceeded the initial grant requirements by including seven videotapes instead of six, ranging from 27 to 37 minutes each.

        "description":"The teacher's guide to a series of seven videotape recordings based on television programs of three African countries, Gabon, Cameroon, and the Ivory Coast, is for use in intermediate to advanced college level French courses. Its objectives are to: improve students' vocabulary, listening comprehension, and speaking skills; acquaint students with the culture of selected French-speaking African nations; accustom them to the variety of French accents heard in francophone Africa; and introduce an innovative use of video into the language-learning classroom. Three instructional units contain a total of seven modules, each consisting of a half-hour videotape and accompanying print materials from the teacher's guide. The first unit focuses on a dramatic serial from Gabon, in four parts,  the second depicts a play set in Cameroon, in two modules, and the third unit focuses on a talk show and commercials from the Ivory Coast. In the teacher's guide, the videotapes are described and a chapter is devoted to each of the modules. Included in each chapter are: (1) a statement of objectives; (2) synopsis of the story; (3) cultural notes; (4) student materials consisting of pre-screening study sheets for vocabulary and cultural references, post-viewing exercises for comprehension, vocabulary, and oral and written situation topics, and quizzes; and (5) appendices containing answer keys and transcriptions. Suggestions for teacher use of the guide, lesson presentation, and activities are also included. (MSE)",

Then three desirable characteristics--authenticity, communication, and integration--are discussed at length, divided into subcriteria, and arranged as a rating scale for textbook evaluation. Criteria for text authenticity include the presence of authentic spoken and written language samples, a wide range of cultural topics, typical cultural situations, global awareness potential, and illustrations of target language and culture. Criteria for judging the communication aspect of the book include a balance of practice in all four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing), emphasis on the use of language in  realistic situations, limited grammar and vocabulary, language practice exercises that are situational and items that are contextual, a range of meaningful activities, and open-ended questions. Criteria marking integration include clear indications of the relationship between language and culture, built-in communicative activities, systematic treatment of culture and communication as well as language, and the assigning of equal weight to language, culture, and communication. A rating scale for evaluating the materials' global potential for developing student skills and attitudes is also included. (MSE)",

        "description":"An investigation of children's metalinguistic and metacognitive competencies examined children's sensitivity to the verbs of cognition in two related studies using a task designed to measure mastery of verbs of saying and meaning. In the task the children hear six short stories, each ending with a statement containing one of the verbs &quot;think,&quot;&quot;know,&quot; or &quot;pretend&quot; followed by a plausible complement (e.g., &quot;You think that your book is lost&quot;). The children are asked after each story to judge the truth of the complement and justify the answer. The first study involved 72 children from grades 1 through 4 with normal intelligence and reading achievement, graded good, average, or poor by their teachers. A second study used more precise measures of reading skill and groups from grades 1  and 3 only. It was found that while knowledge of the cognitive verbs did not relate directly to reading skill, there was a relationship between reading skill and the tendency to justify answers by appealing to the text, which increased with grade level. It is suggested that this indicates the child is beginning to differentiate his interpretation of the text from what the text actually says and to justify the former on the basis of the latter. This demonstrates the metalinguistic skill of understanding the surface structure of language (what is said) and its interpretation (what is meant), are basic to acquisition of theoretical knowledge about the world and to entertaining complex mental states.

They serve three functions for commercial French students: (1) to increase awareness of foreign investments and business in the United States as well as American business activities abroad, (2) to give students valuable experience in locating information on international corporations, and (3) to expose students to basic business practices. In both assignments students are required to use reference works available in the business section of most libraries. The first assignment, designed to familiarize students with the library's business section and its resources, is to list five French corporations in the same industry in the United States and five American  companies in the same industry with operations, subsidiaries, or branches in France, together with information about their addresses and products. The second assignment is to find as much information as possible on a single corporation doing business in France, or a French company doing business in the United States, in any industry. The practical information gained from these assignments has been found to be an asset for non-business majors who are the majority of commercial language students. The resources used by the students contain information not only on the companies but also on aspects of the industry and its trade and on current policies and developments. (MSE)",

The project was based on the premise that such materials would help Black college students develop an affinity for cultural and linguistic linkages with peoples in the African diaspora, which would enhance the value and relevance of their foreign language study. This hypothesis is supported by research on cultural attitudes. A series of learning modules and accompanying slides on the cultures of Black French Africa, the French Caribbean, and areas of South and Central America where there are Spanish-speaking peoples of African descent  were developed.

In one of three tests, the subjects, 44 children aged 3.6 to 6 years, were presented with a series of structurally diverse sentences about toys within reach. The children's comprehension of the sentences was observed in their reactions as measured by their movements of the toys. The second and third tests used two imitation tasks focusing on adverbial structures, using the same toy-moving sentences, varying in length, and toy-moving sentences carefully controlled for length, to find the subjects' critical sentence  length for imitation. Analysis of the various responses to sentence types and complexity in all three tests supported the \"weak complexity\" hypothesis and suggest that the linguistic factors affecting performance are task-dependent and deny a simple one-to-one relationship between complexity and performance.

The subjects were 76 students at each of three levels of French instruction, with instructors from a variety of backgrounds. A number of demographic and attitude measures were used. The major findings were: (1) the two lower level classes indicated a desire for more personal contact with francophones; (2) there was decreasing ethnocentrism-chauvinism  from elementary to intermediate French; (3) more positive descriptions of francophones occurred between elementary and intermediate French, but not in advanced French; (4) males experienced the most rapid decrease in social distance across all grade expectations; (5) females had higher semantic differential scores across all levels; (6) high mean scores on the three attitude scales correlated with high socioeconomic level; (7) low grade expectations were associated with negative descriptions of francophones, greater ethnocentrism-chauvinism, and greater social distance; and (8) course grade expectations were substantially correlated with all three attitude scale results.

Language is the primary means for understanding and communicating ideas and for creating new knowledge. If schools can articulate a broad understanding of language and have teachers of all subjects guide students in organizing, synthesizing, and expressing their thoughts clearly through diverse languages, a large step will be taken toward improving  students' thinking and communicating skills. A multidisciplinary approach to language effects and uses should yield greater understanding of life's choices. Class discussion provides a natural opportunity for probing the meaning of language. Through self-conscious attention to the flow of a discussion, appropriateness of questions and answers, extension and development of ideas, students learn to evaluate alternative perceptions of reality and make judgments about which perceptions are most logical and consistent. Students also need to be evaluated more frequently in ways that require language use to organize, relate, and draw conclusions from the information taught, and classes involving more written assignments and thoughtful probing of new concepts should be small.

        "description":"A line of reasoning used in recent research on language acquisition assumes that a child acquiring the language has only two reliable sources of information available about the target grammar: a set of grammatical principles and the primary data of the language spoken around him. A third kind of evidence, negative evidence, would be helpful but is unavailable. However, with its current set of assumptions, this logic of language acquisition is not easily applicable to any problems involving overgeneralization in child language. Another kind of evidence, indirect positive evidence, is the combination of a principle stated in the form of a negative conditional or its equivalent, a disjunction, and data that allow such a principle to operate. This kind of evidence allows learners a  way out of overgeneralizations, and is an indication of how positive evidence and principles of grammar can be turned around to substitute for the negative evidence that seemed to be the only answer to the problem of overgeneralization.

        "author":["Irujo, Suzanne"],
        "description":"A study of transfer of native language training and/or interference in learning English idioms had as its subjects 12 Venezuelan students in an American university who were advanced learners of English as a second language. Fifteen equivalent and commonly used English and Spanish idioms were used in tests of recognition, comprehension, recall, and production. Statistical analysis of the results indicates that the subjects were able to generalize from the idiom's meaning in Spanish to its meaning in English, even when the form was slightly different, and they could correctly produce many more identical idioms than idioms of other types. Both of these results indicate use of positive transfer. Interference (negative transfer) occurred on the two production tests, more for similar  than totally different idioms. These results support the notion that advanced second language learners whose first language is closely related to the second can use knowledge of idioms in their first language to comprehend and produce idioms in the second. In addition, the subjects used target-language-related strategies such as mixing idioms and providing an incomplete idiom. It is suggested that language similarities may encourage interference, and that idioms are not always considered nontransferable. Further research is recommended. (MSE)",

Measures were made of the following variables: citations, rankings from previous studies, publications, conference participation, funding, and general institutional characteristics. Publication counts were estimated from data in the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) system. Each school of education's participation in the American Educational Research Association conference was assessed for 1981 and 1982. Information on grants awarded to schools of education during 1978-1982 was obtained from the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange.  Finally, the Higher Education General Information Survey provided data on five variables: percentage of doctorates granted, total research expenditures, total overall expenditures, government grants and contracts per full-time equivalency, and average faculty salary. Conclusions include the following: program size did not significantly determine prestige; surveys on reputation did not appear to be reliable; and citation counts seemed to be the best measure of scholarly work.

Students enrolled in either two- or four-year institutions were included. Grants, loans, and college work-study funds were considered as financial aid. A casual model was used to illustrate how withdrawal was affected by interacting variables, and path analysis was used to test the model's validity. The following variables were assessed: socioeconomic status, race, sex, academic aptitude, high school grade point average, occupational aspiration, degree level goal, college performance, institutional characteristics, and receipt of financial aid. The primary data source was the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. Of the sample of 4,838  students who entered college in the fall 1972, 36.4 percent were identified as dropouts.

Additional contents include: summary information for the University of Alaska on degrees offered and awarded from 1978 to 1984 for each unit; a profile of students attending the university system according to age, part-time and full-time status, and ethnicity; and forecasts of general fund unrestricted revenues. The recommendations are as follows: (1) the university should continue its review of degree programs that may be underproductive; (2) the university should explore strategies for increasing  productivity at all university campus centers; (3) the university should design and implement a program to assess knowledge, intellectual capacities, and skills developed in students through academic and cocurricular programs; (4) the university should consider establishing a weekend degree program, since there are a number of older part-time students; and (5) research should be reviewed as it relates to state needs. Appended are definitions of college programs. (SW)",

A total of 135 usable questionnaire responses provided information on age; sex; length of time as CFO; previous professional experience; career goals; educational level; specialization in highest degree; selection factors; relationship with the president, governing board and chief academic officers; areas of responsibility; and title of position. Respondents also indicated the scope of the CFO's responsibilities and the variables that affected the scope of responsibility, including enrollment size and student composition,  single- or multi-campus structure, and the CFO's qualifications. It was found that most CFOs carry the words &quot;vice president&quot; in their title. In one-fifth of the colleges, business and financial responsibilities were shared by two or more vice presidents. Academic training for CFOs seemed to be mainly in business administration and management, although several respondents had specialized in educational administration.

A total of 247 usable responses to a questionnaire were received, representing a 66 percent response rate. By sex, 37 of 42 females deans responded, compared to 212 of 335 male deans. There were few significant differences between male and female graduate deans. Although most deans held administrative posts at some time before becoming graduate deans, 44 percent were faculty members before becoming deans. Male deans had spent  significantly more years in higher education than had female deans. While graduate studies were the main function for 43 percent of the deans, 32 percent were involved with research and grants. There were no significant differences in the number of professional staff reporting to male and female deans. Overall, the deans had the most authority over setting graduate school policy, reviewing programs, and recommending program terminations. They had little authority in managing recovered costs, faculty hiring, promotion and tenure, and fund-raising. (SW)",

Faculty handbooks and policy manuals are good starting points for determining how salary decisions are made. Once the salary allocation criteria have been identified, the next step is to translate those criteria into quantifiable variables. Much of the data needed for variables representing individual qualifications can be obtained from records maintained by the university personnel and payroll departments. The most reliable data elements probably will be those used in ongoing administrative processes like payroll and reappointment. Statistical procedures and tests of significance that are helpful to the  researcher include: the chi-square, t-test, correlation, and analysis of variance. Three multivariate techniques frequently used for salary studies are analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and multiple regression analysis. Choice of regression techniques is determined by whether the study is designed to explain the salary reward system, to predict and monitor individual salaries, or to check for discrimination. Some problems that may arise in interpreting the data are noted. (SW)",

Costs of undergraduate sandwich courses are compared with those of the more traditional 3-year, full-time undergraduate courses in British universities. Distinction is made between marginal and fixed costs. The degree course in applied biology is described as an example of one of the many 4-year course patterns. Data are provided to show the expenditure pattern of the average British university in 1979-1980 in support of a biology full-time equivalent undergraduate for 1 year. Costs from placing a student in an industrial work environment result from academic staff commitment, department support staff costs,  departmental consumables, and traveling costs. The annual unit costs of the sandwich student is higher than that of the traditional student. Costs of the biology sandwich pattern, which places students in industry for 2 terms during the first 3 years, are compared to those of the chemistry degree, which places students in industry only during the third year. It is concluded that additional academic staff are required in order to provide the necessary support for the sandwich system. (SW)",

Results of three projects illustrate the importance of teachers in creating and interpreting children's learning environments. The first project was designed to determine whether experience with LOGO programing would enhance third and sixth grade children's planning skills; no effects on planning were found. The second project involved one aspect of the Bank Street College Project in Mathematics and Science Education, in which a FLE is based on a multimedia simulation of a science show. Results indicated that the materials were successful from the children's  viewpoint, while teachers' evaluations were mixed. The third project investigated whether networking can be used as a FLE for writing and communication. The three studies raise fundamental questions about the design and implementation of FLE's, particularly the relationship between the children's purposes and those of their teachers.

Early media research questions are criticized for their naive assumptions, inadequate distinctions, and the researcher's zeal to generate answers rapidly. A summary of the implications of the symbol systems approach suggests that (1) every medium, including the microcomputer, will favor the transmission of certain symbol systems over others and is likely to require and cultivate different  representational skills; (2) every medium is biased toward specific kinds of activities applied to its symbol systems, and is likely to cultivate a different set of mental operations; and (3) subjects will bring different expectations to different media.

In the opening chapters, the current state of research in the field of database translation is summarized, various interchange forms that have been proposed as potential standards are examined, and proposed standard data models and other commonly-used data structures are discussed. Additional chapters analyze the results of experiments with database translation between data models--hierarchical or relational to network,  hierarchical or network to relational, hierarchical to network, and network to hierarchical--and summarize a cost benefit analysis of a database conversion. Conclusions address the future impact of standardization on database translation, and appendices provide specifications for mapping between data structures and completing the interchange form, together with detailed examples.

        "description":"By the year 2000, European higher education institutions must achieve the following aims: resolve the conflict between the social demand for education and costs of higher education without lowering standards; provide continuing education to cope with rapid technological change and increased leisure and/or unemployment; build even closer links between industry, public services, and higher education in the field of informatics; and infuse new talent into static academic manpower. Informatics (varied new communications technologies that are based around microprocessing and optics) may enable the achievement of those aims. The move to distance education and independent learning will accelerate through computer conferencing, cable television and videocassettes, computer-based  audiographic systems, and interactive videodiscs. New technologies offer an alternative model to the large, centralized specialist system, because they are both easy to access and easy for teachers to use. The technology needed to achieve these aims is here now, and will become increasingly easier to use. The main barrier is the inability of large institutions to carry through the fundamental changes in organization, financial arrangements, and teaching strategies that are essential if flexible, off-campus teaching is to be achieved. Eight references are listed. (LMM)",

        "description":"This study was initiated to design, develop, implement, and evaluate a videodisc-based simulator system, the Interactive Graphics Simulator (IGS) for 6883 Converter Flight Control Test Station training at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado. The simulator provided a means for performing task analysis online, developing simulations from the task database, presenting simulations to students, and adapting the presentation of simulations to the level of student achievement. Simulation lessonware covered both procedural equipment operation and troubleshooting activities. A comparative study was performed with 22 students using the actual equipment trainer during training and 21 students using the IGS. Student performance was assessed using a battery of tests designed to measure  troubleshooting ability, equipment operational procedures performance, and field assignment readiness. These scores were supplemented with conventional end-of-block test results and student attitudinal data. Although the IGS-trained students performed significantly better on the troubleshooting test, no other significant performance differences were found. Student attitudes toward the IGS were favorable, and the system operated extremely well in a standard classroom environment. (Author/LMM)",

The use of the CYCLOPS audiographics system in distance tutorials of the Open University is highlighted. Difficulties in introducing these newer technologies into existing distance education systems are also discussed.

        "description":"Ways in which teachers organize classrooms when they have more students than microcomputers available to them were investigated as part of the National Survey of School Uses of Microcomputers, which collected data from 1,082 microcomputer-using schools. These schools represent 68% of a nationally representative sample of about 1,600 microcomputer-owning public and non-public elementary and secondary schools with one or more microcomputers for use by teachers or students, that were surveyed between December 1982 and March 1983. Results indicate that: (1) students work at computers individually more often than in pairs or groups, but some form of mutual assistance is more common than strictly solitary activity; (2) social arrangements for using computers are more common at the  junior high level; and (3) seatwork is the primary activity of students in a classroom when other students are engaged at the computer. In addition to grade level and subject matter, variables that might influence style of classroom computer use include the number of students in the classroom, the number of computers available, characteristics of the teacher, and characteristics of the schools' students, particularly the computer-using students. This report is the sixth and final in a series based on the national survey. (LMM)",

It provides specific guidelines and criteria for planning and development, equipment considerations, software and courseware, training, program activities, and financial implications. Charts indicate 23 implementation steps for an organizational structure of grades K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12, and costs are projected for the 3-year period from July 1, 1983, to June 30, 1986. Issues addressed include appropriate applications for computers in the school program, the effect of the computer on curriculum, and the priority areas for implementing  educational technology on the 3-year timetable. Eight specific recommendations are listed that relate to the hiring of a computer applications coordinator, purchase of a high school minicomputer, continued purchase of microcomputers, training considerations, software selection and exchange, administrative and special applications, a system-wide computer committee, and evaluation and updates. Preliminary planning steps outlined include establishing a planning committee, conducting staff awareness activites, developing educational philosophy and policies, documenting current computer-based activities, identifying resources, conducting awareness for key groups, and establishing priorities.

        "description":"If computers were used ideally in education, each student would have enough computer time, each computer enough student time, and computer-based activities would be chosen well. The move towards using microcomputers in the schools has less to do with any clear and demonstrable instructional advantage of using them, and more to do with general societal-wide interest in applicability of computers. A national survey on students' use of microcomputers in schools found that, although schools have made major investments in microcomputers, very few students get a substantial exposure and benefit from using computers, and the typical computer-using student gets little more than a cursory experience. Given the way schools must operate to provide instruction to hundreds of students, simply  grafting microcomputers onto the school (and even providing the best software and best curriculum available), will not result in extensive or effective use. The organizational problems of using a relatively small number of computers in a school setting require centralized placement, supervision of younger students, knowledgeable and enthusiastic teachers, cooperative planning among teachers with divergent interests and goals, and, in elementary schools, strong involvement of the school principal.

The disciplines covered--literature, fine arts, law, history, education, chemistry, biological sciences, medicine, and engineering--were selected because they illustrate both different information use patterns and a variety of different types of information resources. The segment for each discipline examines briefly the nature of the subject and the way in which information is generated and  communicated in that subject, in order to provide a background and setting for the identification, evaluation, and use of its information resources. Study questions and exercises are included for each section. The guide concentrates on Australian information resources, but also includes material produced in other countries that is relevant to the Australian situation. (Author/THC)",

        "description":"In the 1980's, the well-being and enhancement of community colleges will require not only instructional and programmatic excellence, but also a well conceived, continuous, and systematic program of public information to foster and maintain community support for the institution. The college president must create the climate, establish the structural mechanisms, and ensure the money and resources to make a comprehensive information program work. The chief community information staff person must be assigned a new status in the organization as a senior member of the management team, with the opportunity to influence the decision-making process relative to the impact that these decisions will have on public opinion. The primary function of the public information office is to interpret  the activities of the college to the community and to help interpret and predict the pulse of the community to the college. To fulfill this function, the community information officer must: (1) know about the community being served, with particular understanding of the feelings of target segments such as business or labor leaders, politicians, and leaders of community groups; (2) have the skill to serve as an institutional spokesperson and to determine the most appropriate spokesperson for a given situation; (3) have an open, sharing, and trusting relationship with the college president; and (4) be recognized by vice presidents and deans as a college decision maker. In short, community colleges need the guidance and counsel of public information officers, who are capable of analyzing,  interpreting, and predicting public reactions to the institution as well as managing a dynamic public information program.

Section I suggests that the pre-calculus orientation of high school mathematics may be inappropriate, viewing mathematics related to computers and dependent on computers for computation as more widely applicable. In section II, two-year college instructors are urged to take the initiative in developing new curriculum and teaching modes, taking advantage of their training, the classroom environment, and the absence of standardized tests. Section III offers principles for the development of a new curriculum, arguing that it should emphasize problem solving, meaningful mathematical topics, practical applications, and proper motivation  of mathematics. Two ways of naturally motivating algebra are highlighted: through computer programming and by trying to do problems without using algebra. Section IV focuses on the content of the new curriculum, indicating that it should cover algebra taught in conjunction with computer programming, as well as probability/statistics, logic, and matrices and linear models. Section V provides examples of ways of introducing these new topics. In section VI, concluding remarks urge the Sloan Foundation and National Science Foundation to support two-year college efforts to develop new mathematics curricula and recommend that two-year colleges obtain the backing of the principal transfer institutions of their students.

        "description":"Nassau Community College (NCC) is currently working with a program evaluation model in which faculty from one department serve as peer evaluation consultants to direct the self-evaluations of other departments. The four functional objectives initially motivating the development of NCC's plan directed that: real decisions about academic programs should result from program review and involve the joint participation of faculty and administrators; objective information reviewed and analyzed as part of the program review should be the basis for program decisions; community needs should be examined as part of the program review; and a practicial timetable should provide for the timely review of academic programs from which decisions of current value are produced. The peer consultants,  who are generally selected from faculty who have previously participated in the curricular evaluations within their own departments, administer evaluation activities undertaken in four phases: (1) needs assessment, which involves a survey of constituent groups regarding program goals and a conference to promote consensus among diverse groups about specific program objectives; (2) outcomes assessment, which includes an examination of the extent to which proposed goals are being achieved; (3) review of program objectives, which uses the results of the previous phases to make early decisions about desired modifications; and (4) impact assessment, which provides for a follow-up by program faculty of the effect of the program modifications in producing intended improvements.

Introductory comments trace the emergence of educational marketing in the community college, define &quot;marketing,&quot; and briefly describe the process. The next sections discuss the four marketing structures represented by the institutions: (1) CCC's Central Administration Dominated Structure, which uses the chief administrative officials of the college as its marketing group with  the college president as the marketing leader; (2) MCCD's Marketing Committee Dominated Structure, which places much of the responsibility for planning and implementation in the hands of marketing committees at the individual college or campus level; (3) TC's Marketing Division Dominated Structure, which devotes an entire division of the institution, staffed with a cadre of trained professionals, to the marketing enterprise; and (4) PGCC's Student Services Dominated Structure, in which the Dean of Student Affairs is charged with organizing and leading a collegewide marketing program. Each of these sections includes a description of the college, an organizational chart showing the place of the marketing efforts within the institutional structure, and an enumeration of the responsibilities  of the personnel involved. Finally, the main advantages and disadvantages of the four structures are reviewed. (LAL)",

Using the Salley model, direct economic impact was determined based on the collection of institutional enrollment, payroll, and purchasing data; surveys and estimations of faculty/staff and student spending; calculation of the local multiplier peculiar to Caldwell County; calculation of employee equivalent of student spending; and determination of CCC&amp;TI's total impact on community income. In addition, available data were analyzed to assess CCC&amp;TI's indirect impact on areas such as unemployment, wages, and reduced industry training costs. Study findings indicated that: (1) full-time students spent an average of  $5,665 locally, while faculty and staff spent an average of $13,628; (2) direct spending of faculty/staff and students totaled $6,354,272; (3) the total impact of CCC&amp;TI was calculated at $9,658,494; (4) the local multiplier was found to be 1.52, indicating that for each dollar spent, an additional $0.52 of income was generated; (5) 86% of the full-time students and 72% of the part-time students said they would be enrolled elsewhere if the college were not located in Caldwell County; and (6) the college spent $30,531 in state aid to train workers for new or expanding industries.

        "description":"Drawing from a review of the literature, this paper addresses a series of questions related to the issue of whether state agencies, such as state boards of regents, commissions of higher education, or boards of education, should have the sole legal and official power to determine which postsecondary educational institutions can operate legally within a state and/or to determine the legality of recognition of academic degrees within the state regardless of the location of the degree-granting institution. Answers to six questions are presented and discussed: (1) What are the main subordinate academic or education policy issues raised by the major policy issue posed above? (2) What is the legal framework for academic policy in California, is it typical of other states, and is it  likely to change within the next 5 years? (3) With the Marin Community College District and California as specific points of reference, what special educational and non-educational interests are likely to engage in political action either to change or preserve the current policy framework? (4) How does the current or predictable status of the economics of American postsecondary education affect the state's role in regard to the previous question; (5) Assuming that the state's role in determining policy in these areas were diminished, what consequences in postsecondary educational finance would result? (6) What conclusions can be drawn? For each question, relevant information derived from the literature review is presented first and then analyzed from a professional perspective.  (LAL)",

        "description":"A study was conducted in the Marin Community Colleges to determine whether direct mail and telephone contacts with college dropouts would be perceived as demonstrating a caring attitude on the part of faculty and staff, and positively influence their rate of return. The study measured the rate of return of four groups of students who were enrolled as full-time freshmen in fall 1983, but who did not return in spring 1984. Group 1 received both a letter from the College President and a phone call from the Director of Public Affairs and Development encouraging their return; Group 2 received the telephone calls only; Group 3 received the letters only; and Group 4 was not contacted as part of the study. Of the 168 students in the study sample, 29 re-enrolled after a semester's  absence. Of the returning students, 11 belonged to Group 4, 7 belonged to Group 1, 6 belonged to Group 3, and 5 belonged to Group 2. Based on the study, it appeared that direct mail and telephone contacts with students who dropped out had no statistically significant effect on their rate of return. It was therefore recommended that the Marin Community Colleges direct their efforts toward finding more effective ways of retaining students or influencing their return. (Author/LAL)",

A demanding clientele of students and community members, a faculty and staff unprepared for microcomputer technology, and limited equipment resources dictated the rules of change. After it was determined that computer literacy efforts would emphasize a practical understanding of computers and applications software, a series of one credit-hour courses was developed on the use of the microcomputer as a personal or professional tool for school, home, or work. Most of the time in class was devoted to hands-on activities in a microcomputer laboratory. The first course developed, &quot;Microcomputer Literacy: An Introduction,&quot; was designed for individuals with no  previous computer experience. Additional courses were developed in word processing, spread sheeting, programming, and using integrated software packages. The one-hour computer literacy course was also chosen as the basis for a systematic training program for the vast majority of the faculty who were not computer literate. Participating faculty received a stipend for taking the basic computer literacy course and an additional independent study course focusing on discipline-based competence. The final phase of Chipola's computer literacy training efforts was a structured inservice course for career service personnel. Evaluations conducted for each of the program components revealed that the emphasis on short applications courses worked well for the college and its constituencies.  (LAL)",

        "description":"In this study, 104 primarily indigent primiparous mothers from urban and rural areas and their healthy, full-term neonates were placed in one of four conditions during the normal postpartum lying-in period. Conditions were control, initial contact, rooming-in, and initial contact plus rooming-in. Dependent variables consisted of scores on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale, results of observations of the mother-infant dyad by the nursing staff, and data gained through assessment of mothers' perceptions of their neonates by means of a questionnaire. For both the neonatal assessment and the interaction observation data, results were found to fit a model contrasting dyads that received initial contact and dyads that did not. Nurse ratings produced no effects, while  maternal perceptions inferred from the temperament scale yielded contrasts between rooming-in dyads and dyads not rooming-in, as well as contrasts between dyads that received initial contact and those that did not. Results were interpreted as indicating an interaction between method of assessment and choice of dependent variables. In addition, findings with respect to the direct measures (neonatal assessment and feeding observations) were construed as important evidence for the existence of a sensitive period following birth. Speculation regarding the process involved in initial contact was presented, and results were discussed in light of this possible mechanism.

Begun in 1973, the program was primarily designed to meet the needs of economically disadvantaged preschool-age children in Canada. For comparative purposes, high income/high ability and low income/average ability groups attended the preschool. The children were tested for growth on intellectual and cognitive abilities, problem-solving styles and strategies, and social competence. Findings revealed that all three ability groups made significant gains over time on all measures.  Chapter 1 of the present volume provides background information about intervention and research programs. Chapters 2 through 5 provide curriculum materials in the areas of number, classification, and spatial relations. Chapter 6 describes program modifications and special studies conducted in the third and fourth project years. Chapter 7 describes the development of a measure of social competence. Chapters 8 through 11 describe methods and discuss results of the summative evaluation of immediate and long term program impacts. Chapter 12 presents a summary and conclusions.

The first part of this discussion offers an historical perspective on job satisfaction research, describes approaches used to measure teachers' job satisfaction, and relates various motivation theories to research on teachers' job satisfaction. The second part presents a working model to illustrate how the many variables of job satisfaction interrelate. Building on the social-ecological conceptualization proposed by Rudolf Moos, this model stresses the dynamic, interactive nature of person-environment factors. Such  factors include environmental variables, personal variables, cognitive appraisal, coping responses, and outcomes. Research findings on aspects of these variables are discussed in detail, especially as they relate to early childhood teaching. It is hoped that a model incorporating some theoretical explanation of these complex relationships will have value in training early childhood teachers. (CB)",

These stories are illustrated by figures sketched in mud with a ceremonial knife. The sustained involvement and effort of the children engaged in Yaaruilta may aid cognitive development by encouraging the learning of culturally related geometrical abstraction. With its demonstrative pronouns, the Yupik language may give children the tools to develop accurate geometrical figures. It is essential to document oral activities such as Yaaruilta before Eskimo languages are replaced by Western languages. In addition, parents and teachers outside Alaska can use this activity for language enrichment by providing mud and a plastic knife and by presenting children with a set of basic symbols. The  child draws the symbols with the knife while simultaneously telling the story. In this way, Yaaruilta is similar to allowing a child to use a puppet while practicing language skills. Both methods reduce the child's inhibition. (Appendices include a set of symbols used in knife storytelling and two sample stories.) (CB)",

Both assumptions and categories of the typology are viewed in relation to their implications for teacher development. Reported next, as an illustration of the value of the life-span approach, is a longitudinal exploratory study of preschool teachers enrolled in the 2-year Child Development Associate inservice education program. In October 1981, May 1982,  and March 1983, 55 subjects were administered a battery of measures to assess the teacher-as-person, teacher-as-teacher, and teacher-as-teacher-as-person. Findings revealed differences between first- and second-year trainees; effects of teaching experience; variation across time on teacher-as-person variables; and significant relationships between teacher beliefs and personal characteristics. In conclusion, the design and results of the study are discussed with respect to the contribution that a life-span approach to teacher development may have on the study of inservice education. (RH)",

Among the issues discussed at length are the amount of funding for training and technical assistance and the continuance of the Child Development Associate (CDA) certification program. Other issues include current requirements to give existing Head Start programs preference in granting contracts for expanded  programs and proposals to limit children to 1 year of participation, to administer child care food funds through Head Start rather than through the Department of Agriculture, to strengthen Head Start performance standards, and to dissolve the Indian and Migrants Program (at the time of writing, a separate division within Head Start).

        "description":"An extension of a project that examined the associations between parental responses to children's emotional upset and children's competence in preschool, this study focuses on gender differences in the socialization of competence. Parents' warmth and responsiveness, firmness and control, and responses to their children's emotional upset were assessed in 30 families. Parent self-reports, observer ratings, home observations, and a projective interview measure were used. In the projective interview, children were asked to finish stories by saying how parents would respond when the story child confronted emotionally stressful events. Children's competence was assessed by administering the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and by having the child's teacher complete Baumrind's Preschool  Behavior Q-Sort. In general, gender differences in socialization were outweighed by gender similarities. Mothers and fathers showed no mean differences in measures of warmth, control, or responsiveness to children's emotional upset. Boys and girls were equally cooperative with their parents as well as with their peers and preschool teachers. Two sex-of-child differences emerged: fathers were more firm with their sons, and girls attributed more comforting responses to story parents on the projective measure. Despite the few observed differences in socialization practices, consistent mean differences were found on the outcome measures. Girls were rated as being more socially competent in preschool.

        "description":"Research conducted on Child Development Associate (CDA) training in HSS Region III during the past 2 years has attempted to analyze this form of adult education by combining some aspects of life-span research with aspects of more traditional adult education research. This report provides a brief update on two types of research: research on the impact of CDA training and research on the training process itself. Research on the effects of CDA training shows short term gains in child development knowledge and classroom behavior, but it also indicates that a partial reversal of earlier endorsement of child-centered beliefs takes place during second-year training. Two explanations are offered for the latter finding. The first concerns the emphasis during second-year training on  teacher behavior as opposed to child development. The second, oriented in the life-span perspective, suggests reversion by most trainees to previously held beliefs. Three studies have been completed on the CDA training process. The findings of one study suggest that the CDA approach to assignments and inservice feedback should be combined with a child development knowledge base typical of traditional training. Results from another study emphasize the influence on training of external motivating factors in the work and personal lives of trainees. The third study concludes that the more successful training programs include opportunities for independence in working with complex materials in complex social interactions. (CB)",

To address this third aim, a series of studies conducted over a period of 4 years has focused on the effects of training on a range of teacher characteristics: teacher beliefs, dogmatism, locus of control, self-concept, self-confidence, educational aspirations, professional involvement, child development knowledge, early childhood methods, CDA behaviors, and cognitive flexibility. Results of these six studies show that (1) CDA trainees gain specific knowledge of child  development and early childhood methods; (2) trainee educational aspirations appear to be raised by participation; (3) trainees are more actively involved professionally and seek professional growth; (4) trainees demonstrate increased self-confidence, and (5) cognitively oriented, child-centered beliefs increase during the first year of participation and slightly decrease during the second year. It is suggested that slight differences in percentages between these results and those of national CDA surveys indicate that training may be enhanced by the actual assessment and credentialing process or by the subsequent recognition credentialed CDA's attain.

The implications of this changing environment for designing a new Follow Through program are also examined. With respect to the changing demographic environment, information regarding fertility, adolescent childbearing, proportion of working mothers, single parent households, and international immigration is presented. The consequences of changing demographics are discussed in relation to reduced fertility, children of adolescent and working mothers, single parent households and immigrant and foreign language status. Such changes are seen as having several implications for designing new Follow  Through options; specifically, these concern the declining size of the traditional pool of applicants, increase in applicants for whom English is a second language, and substantial demand for custodial services for &quot;latchkey&quot; children of all social and ethnic backgrounds. It is suggested that the assumption of new purposes and functions by Follow Through implies the need for new models of evaluation using broader criteria. (AS)",

Twenty-four toddlers, ranging in age from 17 to 28 months, were each observed for approximately 4 hours during regular center activities. Across all center settings, positive contact among children was more frequent than negative contact. Children exhibited both positive and negative social behavior most often during play with large equipment. Transition between activities also was associated with higher levels of negative contact. During activities with high levels of adult verbal involvement, children had reduced frequencies of vocalization to peers. Sequential analysis of specific social  responses showed that peer-directed behavior was less likely to occur after a child had been in social contact with adult caregivers but was more likely to occur after a previous interchange with peers. Children frequently maintained the ongoing quality of an interaction, reciprocating the positive or negative tone of the previous behaviors. Probability of adult social response to a child decreased after that child had exhibited positive peer-directed behavior but increased after negative social behavior. (Author/RH)",

The sampling method was rigorous, and the results closely parallel United States Census Bureau statistics. The reliability is well within acceptable professional standards. Preliminary validity studies demonstrate strong content and construct validity. When predictive validity studies are completed, information concerning the ability of this test to identify children at risk for future school problems will be available. At present, the MAP is one of the few  nationally stanardized instuments available that identifies the full spectrum of severe-to-mild delays in preschoolers. It is unique in that it allows both screening conclusions and supplemental observations, which are important for providing appropriate intervention strategies.

A study demonstrating this conclusion observed, videotaped, and photographed children at different stages of development as they played with specific primary source materials related to the theme \"technology in the home.\" Children at the sensorimotor period played with washboards, tubs, and old clothes. Children at the preoperational level played with an old wringer, a copper boiler tub, and replications of a modern washer and dryer. Children at the concrete operational period studied photographs from 1900 to 1920 depicting familiar household chores. At each stage of development, different facts or evidence,  conclusions or inferences, and generalizations emerged. Facts and evidence at the sensorimotor period included experiences with wet and dry, bumpy and smooth. Conclusions at this early level of development involved object identity and continuity. At the preoperational period, facts encompassed ideas about how machines worked and about physical characteristics of materials. Children concluded that clothes may be washed in different ways; their generalization stated that people washed clothes differently long ago. Facts at the concrete operational level included statements concerning the physical work required to iron, get water, sweep floors, and sew. Chldren at this level inferred that, although basic household tasks remained the same, completion of tasks in the past required more muscle  power. A generalization within the capacity of children at the level of concrete operations would indicate that technology has changed the ways in which household chores are done. (RH)",

In order to help determine the prospects for bringing about such a relationship, a written questionnaire was mailed to parents, teacher educators, teachers, principals, school superintendents, school board presidents, and state education agency officials in six Southwestern states. Focusing on elementary education, major dimensions of each survey were as follows: (1) general attitudes about parent involvement; (2) parent involvement in school decision making; (3) parent involvement roles; (4) current parent involvement  practices; and (5) parent involvement as part of teacher training. Teacher educators, teachers, and principals were asked about the usefulness of parent involvement along these dimensions. Parents were queried about their interest in these aspects of parent involvement. School governance officials were asked about policies and/or technical assistance with respect to such parent involvement. Results were reported in terms of both patterns of responses to questionnaire items and comparisons among groups. It was concluded that parent involvement is acceptable to most parents and educators, but that educators and parents have distinctly different views about certain aspects of parent involvement.

        "description":"The purpose of this report is to give an updated perspective on teenage parents. It is suggested that, from the late 1960's to the early 1980's, thinking about the issue of adolescent parenting has shifted away from viewing teen parents primarily as intrapersonally and interpersonally deficient, from conducting teen-parent studies in a bivariate linear manner, from regarding teen-parent programs only at the micro-level, from studying only the teen mother, and from gathering global measures of development. The discussion focuses on these shifts by examining: (1) causes and effects of teen parenting; (2) programs and support systems designed to meet the needs of adolescent parents; (3) studies focused on the role of the teen father; and (4) research related to in-depth analyses of  dyadic interactions between teen parents and their young children. Implications are drawn for those whose role it is to support adolescent families. To gain information, approximately 300 sources were reviewed. Over 90 percent of these sources either discussed the causes and effects of teen parenting or reviewed programs for adolescent parents. The remaining 10 percent described the role of the teen father and the dyadic interactions between teen parents and their children. Recommendations based on the review are offered. (RH)",

According to the Social Services Act of 1982, children with special need of support (physical, mental, social, linguistic, or other needs) are to be given priority in the waiting lists for preschools and leisure centers. Care of children who are temporarily ill is also a municipal responsibility. Underlying the expansion of public child care facilities since the late 19th century is a change in people's views regarding the responsibility of public authorities in guaranteeing a good environment for children. According to the Social Services Act, municipalities are required to plan for the expansion of child care facilities  for at least 5 years. According to a Parliamentary decision, full coverage of the demand for day nurseries and family day nurseries is to be achieved gradually within a 10-year period ending no later than 1986. Current public debate in Sweden centers on the contents and quality of child care programs. The structure of child care programs in terms of age categories, staff patterns, working hours, costs, and preschool activities is discussed. (AS)",

The question of how to cross the river to see if food is plentiful is proposed to the community members. After a lengthy discussion among the community members and dissatisfaction with a professional's advice from outside the community, it is decided that a needs assessment survey should be conducted. The community decides to build a canoe after conducting the survey using the following procedure: designing a questionnaire that reflects the culture, values, customs and beliefs of the people it is  designed for; passing around the questionnaire to all the people; taking votes from everyone; gathering the responses and tabulating them; communicating the results (needs, objectives and goals) to the community members; as a group deciding how to act to obtain the objective; and finding people in the community with skills and background to help fulfill the objective.

The three project schools were located in the public school districts of Plainview, Olton, and Petersburg, Texas. The project's overall goal was to assist limited English proficiency (LEP) children to acquire and/or improve their English skills and, using bilingual methodology and materials, to facilitate and expedite writing and content area concepts to the extent necessary to insure academic success in the regular school program. Four specific objectives  developed for the 1983-84 school year pertained to student achievement, teachers and aides, increased involvement by the Parent Advisory Committee, and development of a unique bilingual curriculum guide. The external evaluation design for 1983-84, the project's final year of operation, focused on the perceived effectiveness of the project personnel and the project's specific objectives, overall impact, and overall goal. All objectives were satisfactorily achieved, except for the effectiveness of the Parent Advisory Committee and degree of parental involvement. The project did have a positive impact on participating students. Five specific program recommendations conclude the report. (Author/NQA)",

Applications were surveyed for information relating to Indian community goals, broad educational goals, and specific program activities intended to meet or support the goals. Priority Weighted Valuations (PWVs), developed by taking the product of reported priority of a goal or activity multiplied by the frequency of its appearance in the applications, were summed for each goal or activity to provide ordinal measures of its &quot;importance.&quot; PAC expressions of curricular concerns and actual  school program attempts to meet those concerns were compared. Findings indicated that: PACs expressed 17 broad educational goals, while program activities fell into 15 categories of services; improved academic achievement, the major concern of both parents and schools, appeared well-matched by school activity; counseling services, the second highest ranked activity, addressed several goals, yet was valued much lower by parents when improved counseling services were considered as a goal; and the matches and mismatches suggested a lack of coherence in planning JOM projects in numerous districts and programs.

Distance education is particularly appropriate in rural and small schools where low enrollment limits course availability, but it is also useful as state legislatures raise graduation requirements for students and accreditation requirements for schools while budgets are declining. This guide provides descriptions of distance education programs that are in operation, such as teleconferencing (PRISMS, &quot;Operation TECPAK,&quot; Gemini Electronic Blackboard, TELENET), interactive videotape (Winthrop Rockefeller  Model Secondary Project), microcomputers (&quot;The Computer Chronicles&quot;), teletype, and others. Studies are cited that show distance education is effective. Hints for doing distance education right are listed along with the admonition that distance learning programs need good planning, management, structure, and master teachers. Distance education costs are discussed and representative examples are given. Some distance education issues are reviewed (teacher certification, course accreditation, textbook adoption, Average Daily Attendance/funding, class size). The guide concludes with a resource list of 18 experts, state department of education contacts for six states, and a 16-item bibliography. (BRR)",

Individuals living in rural and remote communities face several contextual problems, including distance, personal and professional isolation, unique social/economic/political environmental pressures, sporadic and limited resources. Rural social workers can engage in a variety of activities to optimize the quality and sufficiency of support that people receive from informal caregivers in the community and from their primary social contacts. This paper presents a social networks and social support framework for use by rural social work practitioners in the remediation and prevention of  emotional and social problems generated by rurality's contextual factors. The framework is then applied to a rural remote community case situation, Churchill, Manitoba, and its application to both local and transient groups of people is examined. The paper closes with a discussion of common elements of the interventive frameworks: increasing individual and social support resources and/or building new linkages while abandoning problematic old linkages.

        "description":"A survey was conducted to determine the needs of elementary teachers with respect to the teaching of science. Areas addressed in the survey included: biological, physical, and earth science topics taught at various grade levels; criteria used to select sequencing and content of the science curriculum; most common methods of instruction used in the teachers' science classroom; process-based national curriculum projects used in the last 2 years of science teaching; factors that would be most helpful in improving science instruction; areas that hamper science planning/instruction; time required by state guidelines per week; time required/suggested by school district per week; average time of science instruction per week; adequacy of science instruction in teachers' schools; and  science program/curriculum in use. Each of these areas is discussed in terms of six demographic variables, namely: (1) grade levels; (2) years of experience in teaching; (3) size of school district; (4) region of the United States; (5) type of residential setting; and (6) college degree(s) held. Findings, among others, indicate that few teachers are using the process-oriented curricula developed during the 1960's and that instruction is fact- and concept-centered rather than process-oriented. Recommendations for in-service workshops are made based on these and other findings. (JN)",

How computer-assisted instruction would appear when Skinner's programmed learning suggestions are followed is described, and other points of his philosophical beliefs are discussed. In the next section, the use of microcomputers for drill and practice is noted, with questions raised. The use of word processing in the mathematics curriculum and in particular in problem solving is next discussed. This leads to a discussion of the broader meaning of problem solving. The fifth section considers remedial work, with characteristics of useful software listed. Next, the usefulness of simulations is discussed,  followed by sections on tutorial concepts, correlating mathematics with other curricular areas, computer managed instruction, and computer literacy. In-service education with computers is the subject of the final section, emphasizing teacher workshops. (MNS)",

These data are discussed and analyzed in a final section with respect to six major topic areas: (1) department heads' assessments of instrumentation needs and priorities; (2) amounts and costs of research equipment in the 1982 national stock; (3) instrumentation  age and condition; (4) funding patterns; (5) instrumentation location and usage; and (6) instrumentation maintenance and repair. Technical notes, questionnaire used, detailed statistical tables, and other information are provided in appendices. Among the findings noted are those indicating that research personnel cannot conduct critical experiments in important subject areas due to lack of equipment and that the top priority need is for upgrading and expanding equipment in the $10,000 to $1,000,000 range.

Motivation, application of social studies content and skills to real issues, and enhancement of intellectual skills are among the benefits discussed. The second section provides guidelines from the National Council for the Social Studies to help teachers choose controversial topics appropriate for the classroom. How to deal with parent or community problems that may result from teaching controversial issues is examined in the third section. Suggestions for introducing controversial issues  to students not familiar with their use in the classroom and effective instructional strategies are presented in the fourth and fifth sections.

About half the states in this country have mandates requiring economics instruction. Rationales for free enterprise education, for consumer or personal economics, for economics from a global perspective, and for economics as citizen education are presented. Representative statements from mandates in Florida, Illinois, and Utah illustrate the wide range of concerns and interests with regard to economics education. But whatever the content focus, the teaching of economics involves ideology and is never value-free. It is, therefore, very important for teachers to think through a rationale for teaching economics. An excellent source of information on all  aspects of economics education is the Joint Council on Economic Education. The ERIC database also includes numerous documents presenting many points of view regarding economics education. Three examples of excellent ERIC documents are included. (RM)",

As the Constitutional Bicentennial approaches, the focus in many social studies classes increasingly will be on teaching about this most important document. Results from two recent textbook evaluation studies showed that the treatment of the Constitution in U.S. history, government, and civics textbooks is inadequate and incomplete. Because they lack in-depth coverage of the Constitution, textbooks should be used as part of a larger group of resources that include many types of supplementary materials. Supplementary curricula developed by projects commemorating the  Constitution are described. In addition, brief descriptions are provided of on-going projects dealing with the Constitution that are funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. An annotated listing of ERIC documents dealing with the Constitution is also included.

The survey was an informal one that asked educators, mainly teachers and professors, what their reactions were to the report in general and to the five areas of recommendation (high school curriculum content, standards and expectations, time, teaching, and leadership and fiscal support) in the report. While some respondents questioned the information gathering process used for the report and the lack of teacher input, almost all agreed that education, including social studies, has problems. Social studies educators generally supported recommendations for requiring three years  of social studies for high school graduation. They called for a national framework for social studies education, as well as new teacher education standards. Many felt the report ignored current research related to time on task, rather than time in school. Research findings need to be applied to teacher education.

Specifically discussed are what issues are considered controversial, why controversial topics should be taught, court decisions, ways educators can prepare for community response or complaints, and questions to address when making curriculum decisions. Generally speaking, an issue that tends to create polarized viewpoints many be considered controversial, e.g., sex, nuclear warfare, and religion/science conflicts. Curricular areas most likely to create controversy are literature, social studies, and science. The discussion of controversial issues in K-12 classrooms counteracts student apathy and allows students to learn and apply decision making and problem solving skills. The  Supreme Court and lower courts tend to uphold the rights of teachers and students to engage in controversial topics. Major court decisions are briefly described. Schools should have official policies concerning the teaching of controversial issues, and teacher training should be provided. When developing curricula, decision makers should consider questions such as: (1) What inculcates creative, critical thought in children? and (2) Who determines public school standards? (RM)",

The components of the model are cognition, affect, action, and community. Reasoning, the actor's emotional nature, free choice and character formation, and the development of the person within the social setting are all crucial components in the formation of the moral agent. The interaction of these various elements can be seen in the example of an employer deciding whether to use racial factors to discriminate among job applicants. In coming to a decision on this problem the employer has many opportunities to recognize the problem, to deliberate carefully, and to act in a way that considers the human good.

Descriptors of the economy were considered either primary or secondary. Primary descriptors were the major terms used to identify the U.S. economy and were used explicitly in the text. Secondary descriptors were strongly, but not explicitly, associated with the American economy. Descriptors frequently used included mixed capitalism, market economy, free enterprise, and capitalism. The characteristics that each text identified with their major descriptors were then analyzed. Results indicated a need for an objective, logical, and systematic characterization of the U.S. economy consistent with guidelines established in the &quot;Master  Curriculum Guide&quot; of the Joint Council on Economic Education. The mixed market system is suggested as a more appropriate descriptor because it identifies the mix of resource-allocating mechanisms, the societal control of values and goals, and the primary motivating force; with a circular flow model, it can be used to identify the most important economic institution of United States society.

The first argues that for both men and women, anti-abortion and anti-Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) sentiments have disproportionate appeal among lower socio-economic status, rural, and older constituencies. The second asserts that for women, these sentiments are most common among those most vulnerable to and dependent upon men. Examination of studies of anti-abortion and anti-ERA opinion suggests that both theories are wrong: what distinguishes opponents of abortion and ERA from proponents is neither social position nor personal dependency but rootedness in religious networks. Degree of religious involvement determines availability to feminist or antifeminist  mobilization and shapes cultural beliefs about the conditions that empower women and ensure their security. Both of these, in turn, determine opinion on abortion and ERA. (Author)",

Self-image ratings were examined with respect to the student's interest in taking science courses. Particular attention was paid to male/female differences and Mexican-American/Anglo-American differences. Results indicated that the commonly held image of the scientist corresponds to the self-image of students with an interest in science insofar as intelligence, self-confidence, independence, and creativity are concerned. Girls also include competetiveness in the image. Variation by gender and ethnic background were found significant in how  students evaluated themselves and what additional characteristics were seen as part of the image of scientists. Boys and Anglo-Americans were more likely to see themselves as intelligent and creative. They were also more likely to be interested in science. Contrary to expectations, Mexican-Americans were more interested in taking math than Anglo-Americans. Feedback to girls and minorities about their intelligence may be crucial in raising their interest in science, but it may be difficult to do so because students' self-perceptions develop over many years.

Chapters 6 through 15 contain the class activities. Some examples follow. Children play name games to have fun and loosen up. They learn to cooperate through group activities such as drama games. Listening skills necessary for good communication are taught through telephone and telegraph games. To develop a positive self image, children put together a book  about themselves. Students learn to solve problems through skits, puppet shows, and role play. Chapter 16 contains evaluation techniques. The concluding chapter discusses how the activities can be used with other kinds of audiences, e.g., emotionally disturbed children. Appendices contain success stories of the CCRC, sample lessons, a chart indicating in which curriculum area the handbook's activities can be used, and listings of print and human resources. (MR)",

        "description":"Intended as an introduction to those about to visit the United States for the first time, this booklet provides general information about the United States and its people. The title, derived from Mark Twain's observation that &quot;the only distinguishing characteristic of the American character I've been able to discover is a fondness for ice water,&quot; reflects the variety and diversity of the American people. The booklet, however, while not losing sight of the differences, focuses primarily on cultural similarities of Americans. Brief sections present information on major geographic regions of America, America as a &quot;pluralistic&quot; society, American government, the free enterprise economic system, religious liberty in America, education, family life, and social life of American youth.  Sections describing behavioral characteristics of the American people discuss American individualism, equality, friendliness, assertiveness, and the importance of hard work. Non-verbal behavior characteristics of Americans are also described. The booklet concludes with an annotated list of eight publications produced between 1962 and 1983 on the culture of the United States. (LH)",

The mode of instruction that predominates in the large college class tends to be lecturing, with a minimum amount of time spent by students in verbalizing, and a maximum amount of time spent in taking notes. While teacher educators speak about individualization, diversity of teaching techniques, grouping strategies, and the application of knowledge, students observe something quite different. Consequently, the explicit messages about effective teaching may be lost to preservice teachers who experience instruction in a passive, receptive mode. A model is  presented of instruction that engenders active student participation and can provide preservice teachers with valuable experiences in the role of active student participant. (JD)",

Basic procedures consisted of identifying appropriate cost categories and gathering the required cost information. Major effects data from previous studies were reviewed and summarized, and the relationships between program costs and program effects were investigated. The investigation linked \"program effects\" with cost data for alternate programs in secondary school teacher education. Results from the inquiry can be applied as base-line indicators of cost/effect units when future program revisions are being considered. In particular, the outcomes of the inquiry, i.e., a 10 percent increase in learner cognitive  attainment costs an additional $73 a semester per student, may have direct implications for whether teacher education programs should consider extending their teacher preparation period. Integrating costs with effects provides additional information for program decision-makers to use in reaching summative decisions about their teacher education programs. (JD)",

It is suggested that a national commission on teacher education be created to take a broad and objective view of the problems and potential solutions. The second paper, &quot;Needed Research and Practice for the Preparation of Teaching Professionals,&quot; maintains that research and practice that will enhance teacher education in the future will be grounded in a profile of the effective teacher that  acknowledges the professional requirements of the &quot;school teaching&quot; occupation. While some teaching requirements will always contain aspects of the performance that are labor-like, craft-like, and artistic in nature, the research and teacher preparation programs of the future will increasingly focus on the knowledge and information-processing skills that are requisite to informed professional decision making. Such knowledge and skill will be related to the complex inter-play of teacher judgments that are required for effective response to the multiple and diverse youngsters that attend school, and the multiple and competing functions that schools are expected to serve.

His work reviewed &quot;desist&quot; techniques employed by teachers to stop children's misbehaviors. The first step in developing the workshop consisted of a teacher videotaping a simulated teaching episode in a junior high mathematics class in an effort to demonstrate the concepts outlined by Kounin. Seven vignettes were extracted from the original product and a voice-over was recorded explaining the Kounin terminology, episode by episode. A description is given of the step-by-step development of the workshop format, its presentation to a group of inservice teachers, and an  evaluation of the program by participants. Kounin's definition of terms on the dimensions of classroom management are appended, as well as a sample of the evaluation instrument for the inservice program. (JD)",

Following a brief discussion of the underlying theory of these models and a description of their procedural steps, detailed illustrations are presented of the technique, including reports from teachers who have used the approach in a classroom setting. Specific recommendations for using these approaches with different types of students and different types of disciplinary problems and situations are presented. (JD)",

The Georgia Teachers Certification Tests (TCT) are used to determine whether prospective teachers possess essential knowledge in their respective teaching fields. The on-the-job assessment focuses on the teacher's capabilities to organize, plan, and implement instruction as well as on classroom management and interpersonal relationships with students. Each  of these instruments is described in detail in this report.

A solution to the problem is to apply ESP principles to the design of teacher training courses for general English teachers. The language needs of teachers of English as a second language (ESL), both those required to complete the course successfully (course needs and study skills) and to operate in a full professional role (teaching needs and activities) must be considered. A multilevel model of course design is presented, each level moving from content through format and methodology to the language required to understand content. The syllabus can be adjusted to suit the conceptual and linguistic  requirements of teachers in particular courses, while maintaining the subject-language link. The concept of ESP for teachers reveals the need for research into (1) the language difficulties experienced by teachers in English language teacher training courses, (2) the language of ESL teaching, and (3) the structure of both spoken and written academic English language teaching and applied linguistics texts.

Subjects were 260 children attending nursery schools, day care \"clubs\", and schools. Mastery of morphological forms were measured by tests using archaic (i.e., unfamiliar to the children) Finnish words, and some cognitive-linguistic skills were also measured with a variety of tests. Results indicated that the correct inflections are achieved gradually, as a result of the child's developmental level, the difficulty of the morphological form, and the linguistic and grammatical  properties of the words to be inflected. Results also suggest that erroneous responses can offer psychologically valuable information about development, with the errors having different meanings in different age groups, revealing both linguistic progress and information about children's perception, processing, and interpretation of the tasks and approaches to solving cognitive and linguistic problems. However, more detailed research is needed to learn the strategies children use. Errors occurring in spontaneous speech were found not to have the same developmental meaning as those produced in a morphological test. (MSE)",

Elements critical to successful implementation of the model are identified from these experiences, and causes of potential breakdowns are noted.

Rather than correct these assumptions, teachers often seem to unwittingly reinforce them, actually inducing errors into their students' work. Teacher-induced errors occur when teachers mislead students by overemphasizing some aspect of the writing process or when students oversimplify and apply a principle or strategy too broadly. Two related pieces of advice commonly given to students are to use a variety of sentence structures and to avoid an unpleasant repetition of a word or phrase. Students often misunderstand these to mean: don't use the same sentence structure twice, and don't repeat a word or  phrase. In response to these recommendations, students force errors into their writing, complicating it unnecessarily, making it awkward, and losing coherence. Students should first be encouraged to write coherent and error-free prose that reads smoothly, uses economical language, does not require the reader to backtrack, and allows the reader to accurately guess what the writer is saying. When taught this way, students will naturally vary their sentences and not be preoccupied unnecessarily. (MSE)",

Based on the review, implications for nursing education are considered. It is suggested that within the educational program, nursing students need: experiences in setting their own goals and being responsible for meeting them, faculty role models who show and discuss the combination of home and career roles, and democratic models  of shared decision making. They need experiences in collegiality, assertiveness, and leadership, as well as opportunities to discuss changing sex roles and the consequent stresses and rewards. Many writers emphasize that nursing's educational programs are not providing students with the learning experiences required to ensure career commitment. Faculty need consciousness raising to alert them to the effects of their own socialization and the ways in which they influence students. (SW)",

Sixteen university courses in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities were investigated through the application of cognitive theory to instruction. Attention was first focused on portraying the knowledge structures in the courses. Next, these knowledge structures were used as the basis of research into student learning in the course (i.e., to measure gains in student knowledge and to test the degree to which they predicted course achievement). Current analysis of the knowledge structures using feature analysis and network analysis demonstrated the kinds of analytic processes required to understand the main concepts in  the course and the degree of concurrence of relationships within and between concepts. The research is based on cognitive theory applied to instruction. The concept was the unit of analysis; the methods were different forms of conceptual analysis. The application of conceptual portrayal to instruction and to learning is illustrated with reference to a university course. In addition, a taxonomy illustrating relationships between concepts is presented. (Author/SW)",

Suggestions are directed to those in the institution who will be working with decision-makers, with a focus on how such individuals can assist the decision-maker in the development and use of computer-based tools. The instigators of computer tools must work through issues involving how useful quantitative information is to daily management decision-making. It is also important to understand and work with the political dynamics of higher education decision-making. Research on institutions using computer-based planning models suggests that this type of tool involves time and effort by the decision-maker to understand the benefits of such work. The users of computer-generated  information need to be educated in the form that quantitative information is kept and how it can be accessed. Recommendations for the successful implementation of decision support tools are as follows: identify and develop the integrators in the institution, invest resources in training middle and senior managers, examine ways quantitative information is reported, and study the decision-making process and the use of quantitative information in it.

        "description":"The evolution of computer hardware for college computing has mirrored the industry's growth. When computers were introduced into the educational environment, they had limited capacity and served one user at a time. Then came large mainframes with many terminals sharing the resource. Next, the use of computers in office automation emerged. As college computing grew, it took several mainframes to handle the workload, especially at large institutions. Microcomputers then came on the scene, but they had evolved back to the initial limited capacity, one machine-one user concept. They first served as personal computers, then evolved as enhanced terminals. Now, microcomputers are becoming part of networked systems, allowing more users to become part of the overall institutional system,  while reducing the dependence on large mainframe systems. The next generation of college computing will allow maximum use of microcomputer networks. Networks allow common use of data and programs and provide a communications link not previously available to microcomputer users. The most immediate applications for these networks are office automation, faculty needs, and staff requirements. Colleges and universities must lead the way in innovation, especially in the area of networked microcomputers. (Author/SW)",

Two themes are emphasized: the &quot;top-down&quot; strategy, and the significance of office automation. The first system installed was the All-in-One system, which permitted executives to use terminals and work with the computer. The office automation system moved from being only a by-product to being the first major system to be implemented. After the computer service department staff had successfully used the system, a deliberate strategy was undertaken to put the executive network in the office of the Chancellor, vice-chancellors, and college presidents--the &quot;top down&quot; approach. Uses of the network by  the executives included electronic mail messages, the electronic file cabinet, word processing, and the preparation of graphics. The largest potential use is the ability to access the administrative data files. The additional tools of spreadsheets, personal filing systems, and data based systems are just beginning to be used. Eighteen conclusions of a study on the network are presented, including the following: executives learn the equipment best during a hands-on training session, and executives learn functions of the system on a need-to-know basis.

The widespread recognition of a need to train chairs and some important characteristics of such programs are considered. In addition, the means by which institutional administrators can assess the need for training are examined. Results are also provided of several training programs, which should complete the information institutional officials need to decide the kind of program they should  underwrite for the professional development of department chairs. It is noted that an important way to determine the need for training before the situation becomes critical is to carefully examine the job and role characteristics of all chairs in an institution. Several kinds of surveys that have been used to study department heads are discussed.

Challenges for educational managers in the coming decade will include (1) recognizing that the benefits of the instructional applications of computers rest with the software or programming, not the hardware; (2) recognizing a new kind of illiteracy--computer illiteracy; (3) avoiding the wholesale importation of nonindigenous instructional materials and theories in the panic to use computers; (4) being prepared for the possible structural reorganization required to accommodate a technological society; (5) admitting the insensitivity of current organizational arrangements  to the accommodation of a major technological innovation; (6) deducing the type of organizational pattern concomitant with the use of computer technology and whether this pattern is locally relevant or applicable; (7) readjusting concerns from equal opportunity to equal outcome and avoiding exacerbation of existing social, political, and economic polarization; and (8) being aware of the hidden, ongoing personnel costs of effectively introducing computers.

        "description":"Because the Navy needs tools to assess the personnel implications of proposed equipment and system designs, a literature search was conducted in 1978 to determine how hardware design engineers perceive the relationships between system design characteristics and the skills of the system operator and maintenance personnel. Recent studies conducted by the human resources research community were reviewed, especially research on the design process and skill information needs of designers, job performance, the analysis and measurement of skills, and the presentation of human resources information. It was found that engineers were responsive to human resources constraints when such constraints were presented as design requirements, but that they consistently ranked human resources data  as less important than other aspects of system design. This publication presents the literature review and recommends that, in defining the techniques needed to communicate human resources data to design engineers, research be directed toward developing a better understanding of how engineers perceive the relationship between design characteristics and resulting skill implications, and that specific operational definitions of skills applicable to Navy ratings and pay grades be developed in terms and formats readily understandable to and directly usable by hardware designers.

TEDS uses a device which can transmit, via a dedicated telephone network, not only oral communications but also material written upon an electronic blackboard, which is regenerated at distant locations on a standard television monitor. TEDS was evaluated during the 1980 and 1981 fiscal years in comparison with resident instruction at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB). It was found that TEDS students achieved at least as well as students taught in  residence; students accepted TEDS as a delivery method; acceptance of the TEDS schedule depended on the time zone in which instruction was received; and TEDS was cost effective in that, during its second year of operation, it provided instruction to 3.46 students at the cost of instruction for one resident student. The first and second operational year evaluation reports describe TEDS development, evaluation methods and results, TEDS sites, courses taught, and TEDS cost benefits. It is recommended that TEDS be expanded and that evaluation of its effect upon learning, acceptance, and cost be continued. (ESR)",

Questionnaires were sent to instructors, training program coordinators, system management personnel, instructional program developers and evaluators, and computer personnel. Based on information collected, five system upgrade alternatives that would satisfy instructional requirements and cost estimates for these alternatives were developed. It was recommended that the CMI upgrade effort should include adding automated support for group-paced instruction, which should result in a system with no more than 5% DT; a  systems analyst should identify precise causes of system malfunctions and provide computer specifications for group-paced instruction; the Chief of Naval Education and Training (CNET) should coordinate all CMI computer programs; and training program coordinators should be knowledgeable about CMI reports for their courses.

Cognitive test questions were written to conform to a set of objectives used in the Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS) curriculum; attitude questions were obtained from the National Assessment of Educational Progress; and background questions were designed to assess relevant prior knowledge of and experience with computers. The questionnaire was administered to approximately 23,400 twelfth grade and 293,700 sixth grade students. Boys reported having more experience with computers than girls did, and this experience was associated with higher test scores. Nearly all groups studied showed a low  level of understanding of the basic concepts of computer technology. A majority of students did exhibit awareness of certain basic concepts and hold positive attitudes towards computers. Even so, substantial percentages of students subscribed to various common misconceptions about computers. Students with parents having more education, or who worked professionally, had higher test scores than students with parents who had less education or who did unskilled work.

The advantages of using microcomputers as instructional tools are identified as more active learning, more varied sensory and conceptual modes, learning with less mental drudgery, learning nearer the speed of thought, individually tailored learning, more independent learning, and better aids to abstraction. The following seven problems of using microcomputers are also outlined: (1) the fact that microcomputers can supplement but not substitute for conventional education; (2) difficulties in their use; (3) rapid change and lack of standardization in the microcomputer marketplace; (4) the  scarcity of good software; (5) the lack of knowledge on optimum methods of educational computing; (6) the fact that computers favor formalism over judgment; and (7) the inability of computers to solve social and other problems in education. Software development time and cost, machine incompatibility, software piracy, difficulties in software location and review, home market competition, and the difficulty of integrating software into other classroom activities are identified as factors contributing to the software shortage problem. Suggestions for overcoming the software problem are also briefly reviewed, such as the use of tool-type, modifiable, and electronic blackboard programs. (ESR)",

Information on 350 critical incidents--situations where computer use and access were limited for some students--has been collected from educators, students, and parents of students at 12 elementary and junior high schools. The findings halfway through the project indicate that: (1) computers have not found a place in the curriculum; (2) computer technology seems to generate enthusiasm for both very  creative and routine tasks; and (3) many students do not understand what they are supposed to be learning on the computer. Gender-related findings are illustrated by means of personal narratives, e.g., females confronted by impediments to computer exposure, female difficulty in maintaining an interest in software content, and fewer opportunities for females to gain out-of-school experience with computer technology.

        "description":"As a demonstration of the application of heuristic devices to decision-theoretical techniques, an interactive computer program known as MAUD (Multiattribute Utility Decomposition) has been designed to support decision or choice problems that can be decomposed into component factors, or to act as a tool for investigating the microstructure of a component of a decomposition problem. MAUD produces a log of decision making sessions, including a list of the MAUD-composed holistic preference values for the alternatives under consideration and a summary of the structure and basis on which these values were computed. The option of updating decision making structures is also allowed. In addition, MAUD interacts directly with clients, without the use of an intermediary decision analyst or  technician. This report contains a complete user manual for the operation of the MAUD program implemented on an IBM 5110; it is noted that MAUD can be used to teach students with a variety of military decision problems to produce decisions and be more cognizant of their own values. Several examples are provided to help the user both understand the input and interpret MAUD outputs. A decision-theoretic rationale for the MAUD algorithms with special reference to multiattribute utility theory is summarized as are the programing logic and operations. Also included are a 41-item bibliography and a complete line-by-line program listing. (Author/ESR)",

It is noted that, despite glowing predictions for various mediums of instruction, educational technology in general has been shown to produce no significant difference in learning achieved through formal schooling. Also presented are lessons gained from attempts to implement instructional technology innovations which have relevance for the educational computing field: (1) the introduction of large, expensive media requires strong political support; (2) decision makers must be  prepared to amortize high capital start-up costs over a long period of time; (3) a well-trained, skilled staff and an extensive infrastructure and educational support system are required; (4) cost estimates must be based on adequate production guidelines and cost effective means of distribution or communication that reach the largest possible audience; (5) close attention must be paid to the psychological and affective factors undergirding communication; (6) teachers must receive information about an innovation, training in its use, curriculum materials to assist in integrating the application, long-term support services, and incentives to change; and (7) courseware must be well designed and compatible with a philosophy of application that stresses creative and productive uses, word  processing, information access and processing, simulations, and problem generation and solving.

        "description":"This paper discusses the incorporation of heuristics in computerized decision aids that are used for structuring decision problems. Decision theory is described in terms of linked subsystems, and sites where it is necessary to employ heuristic rather than normative, algorithmic procedures are identified. Production systems are then used to illustrate heuristic devices handling transactions across the interface between decision-theoretic subsystems and the decision maker's semantic memory. It is suggested that these heuristics can be incorporated into decision aids designed to improve the quality of access to the information contained within the decision maker's semantic memory. Candidate heuristics for use in development of such decision aids are identified and criteria for  locating the operation site of heuristics are developed. The preliminary implementation of heuristic aiding devices within one particular decision aid, Multiattribute Utility Decomposition (MAUD), is briefly described. Heuristics that operate on the interface with semantic memory are identified within a comprehensive table of heuristics cited in the literature. Also provided are guidelines for further development of automated decision structuring systems by the use of modular uncertainty structures, and a 98-item bibliography. (Author/ESR)",

These efforts had the common goal of teaching generalizable diagnostic skills rather than equipment-specific procedures. Preliminary findings suggest that each of the approaches can improve maintenance performance under certain conditions. Playing a logical game is an  effective substitute for training in reading logic circuit diagrams, and practice in solving context-free diagnostic tasks enhances subsequent performance when diagnosing faults in equipment-specific simulations. It was also found that feasibility of the Adaptive Computerized Training System had been demonstrated, though the system had not yet received rigorous experimental evaluation.

The fourth revolution, which is based on the use of electronic technology in teaching, began with programmed teaching machines, individualized instruction, and the development of computer based education. This paper draws on meta-analyses conducted at the University of Michigan and the University of Colorado to review what has been learned from the application of educational evaluation and research synthesis tools to the area of instructional technology. Eight separate meta-analyses are covered, representing at least 500 separate studies. The results presented indicate that programmed instruction was more  effective in recent studies than in earlier ones; individualized systems produce about the same results as conventional teaching at the elementary and secondary levels, although at the college level they are strikingly effective; and computer based education has real potential as a tool for improving student achievement.

Analysis emphasized both patterns in family use of the microcomputer and the effectiveness of diskettes as an experimental method for data collection and analysis. Computer uses were categorized as entertainment, education, work, communications, word processing, programming, and household management, with most usage falling in categories related to occupational interests. Users tended to spend 30 minutes to 2 hours in each computer session, to underestimate the amount of time that  would be spent, and to wish for more computer time. Major activities replaced by computer use did not involve social interaction. All participants were generally enthusiastic about the computer and felt its impact on their lives had been positive. Families classified as single-user dominated and group-dispersed seem generally similar in all aspects measured. Results also indicated that use of diskettes seemed to be less expensive than other methodological approaches and provided a convenient means of recording data on each computer session at the time, if subjects were willing and remembered to answer the questions.

A 48-item administrator questionnaire and a 52-item teacher questionnaire were used to gather data from all Iowa school superintendents and from random samples of both elementary and secondary teachers. Results indicate that both the teachers and the administrators felt positive and enthusiastic about all aspects of instructional computing. They perceived a need for inservice instruction as well as for using the computer in classroom instruction and management. Both teachers and administrators felt that preservice teachers should learn programming and techniques to evaluate, select, and use appropriate software. Differences  emerged between administrators' and teachers' perceptions of teacher needs, and elementary and secondary teachers differed on specific items concerning the usefulness of various computer assisted instruction modes and of various computer management techniques. Significant differences also existed among five secondary teacher groups (humanities, mathematics and science, physical education, vocational education, and special education), suggesting that certain groups favor computer applications unique to their discipline. Finally, teachers and administrators warned educators against making the computer a panacea for all educational woes. The survey instrument and 77 data tables are included. (LMM)",

        "description":"This paper describes how four classes of high school students were introduced over a 2-year period to the concepts and terminology of online bibliographic searching, instructed to formulate their own search strategies, and received the opportunity to observe their strategies executed by a skilled searcher on various selected databases. It also examines and evaluates the methods employed and the students' achievement level responses to the course. Sixty-seven college bound seniors with no prior knowledge or experience with online subject searching participated in the course. The primary purpose of the course was to introduce students to a library service which would enable them to perform research more expeditiously and provide them with relevant information for research projects.  A series of different methods were employed to teach online searching, including a printed manual, a lecture, a case study, an audiovisual demonstration, and a small group assignment which culminated with observations of actual online searches. It is concluded from the results of the course that not only can high school students benefit from such a course, but also that they can be taught to form their own information searches in the future.

While most of the general procedures in the manual are probably basic to most document depositories, the specific manner in which they are carried out may be applicable only to the setting at the University of Massachusetts. The manual is divided into 15 main sections dealing with all aspects of technical processing including cataloging rules; catalog card filing rules; binding government documents; and processing procedures for specific types of documents such as serials, microfiche, maps, oversized documents, and  multivolume sets. These sections are followed by four addenda dealing with public service related procedures: (1) circulation overdues and billing, (2) government documents reserve shelf, (3) interlibrary loan requests, and (4) search procedures.

Introductory material places the discussion in the context of changes that have taken place in the community college over the past 20 years, highlighting increases in part-time attendance, the enrollment of lower ability students, and the influx of minority and low-income students. The effects of these changes on the community college curriculum are analyzed with respect to the prevalence of remedial and introductory courses and the paucity of advanced courses; curriculum deficiencies; and testing and placement programs. Reports from individual colleges are reviewed next, providing information on  developmental teaching methods, attempts to combat high attrition rates, math anxiety programs, and the operation of labs and centers. Next, the paper addresses the math competencies expected of entering freshmen and ways of assessing them. Focus is placed on the research of the Center for the Study of Community Colleges on the general education knowledge of two-year college students. An overview of recent changes in the instructional design of two-year college math classes is followed by a review of the research on the professional characteristics of two-year college math instructors. Finally, the future of mathematics is discussed, and recommendations concerning the professionalization of the faculty, curriculum reform, and the promotion of student understanding of the importance of  math skills are presented.

This trend is exemplified by demands that the liberal arts be made relevant and comprehensible to the student and that they be related in some way to the search for a good job. The great classical literature, such as \"The Republic,\"\"The Iliad,\" or \"Medea,\" are relegated to the useless or the irrelevant, while examples of popular culture, such as \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\"\"Shane,\" and \"M.A.S.H.\" are elevated to the position of \"modern classics.\" Popularity and cleverness have become the criteria for judging value in art, literature, and music, replacing such qualities as universality and historical judgement. These new criteria would  have consigned \"Moby Dick\" or the works of Gauguin to permanent obscurity, since they failed according to the criterion of popularity. The classics, however, have had a profound influence on the understanding of significant issues, moral concerns, and enduring questions that have confronted mankind during the ages. They have provided links between peoples, systems, and disciplines; and, despite the challenges of high-speed information processing, sythesized and summarized learning, and popular culture in general, the classics and liberal arts offer the only genuine, lifelong answers to the perennial questions of human existence. They must be elevated above any attempts to bend and shape them into superficial job-related worlds and needs. (HB)",

Among the new requirements of the educational system will be the need to plan and manage strategically and develop an awareness of the social, economic, and demographic environment in which the institution operates; an awareness of the institution's strengths and weaknesses; and a matching of institutional strengths with opportunities in the external environment. North Central Technical College is attempting to redesign and restructure itself to be more responsive to the needs of its service area during this structural  economic shift. Elements of this process include: (1) relating program structure to the occupational structure of the future and the development of programs in key goals areas (e.g., information processing, electronic delivery of programs and services, and high technology); (2) the promotion of programmatic excellence, as exemplified by the college's associate degree program in nursing; (3) the increase in program flexibility through an emphasis on credit for life experiences and multiple ways for students to earn academic credit; (4) programs focused on skill retraining or upgrading developed in collaboration with local business and industry; and (5) an emphasis on leadership and service.

Survey instruments were distributed to member institutions of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges and the National Association of Veterans Programs Administrators, and responses were received from 42% of the nation's community and junior colleges. Study findings, based on responses representing 83% of the fall 1983 veteran student population in two-year colleges and 21% of the veteran enrollments in  four-year institutions, included the following: (1) 11% of the two-year colleges and 7% of the senior institutions had been assessed school liability by the VA within the past 5 years; (2) 58% of the two-year institutions had attendance policies for all students, and 24% had attendance policies for veterans only; (3) 76.5% of the colleges indicated that the reporting fee paid by the VA was much below the actual cost of certification; and (4) major problem areas cited included frequency of regulation changes, procedural changes, and VA intrusion into institutional policy. Study findings are analyzed by state for both two- and four-year colleges and the survey instrument is appended. (AYC)",

First, historical and philosophical developments in the community college field are highlighted, indicating a shift in the primary concern of community college educators from the attainment of equity to the achievement of quality education. Next, an overview is provided of honors programs in community colleges as one manifestation of this movement. Reasons for starting honors programs and benefits that can result from them are discussed. The Accent on Excellence program is described next, in terms of its emphases and components (e.g., an honors program, a community interaction forum, a distinguished residence program, and an  arts alive program). The following section details how the college obtained outside funding for the program through its overall resource development plan, highlighting some of the lessons learned by CCCC about obtaining private financial support. Finally, information is provided about the Greenspun Technology and Honors Center, which was funded through the college's donor program to provide community-responsive, technology-related educational experiences for the southern Nevada region and provide opportunities for academically talented students to pursue honors study. A schedule of Technology Study offerings and a center budget are included. (AYC)",

        "description":"Honors programs are a viable part of the community college response to the challenges of the late 1980's. The growth in the two-year college memberships in Phi Theta Kappa and the National Collegiate Honors Council suggests that greater attention is being given to the academically able students at the two-year college. A rationale for developing honors programs includes the following elements: the increased numbers of academically able students attending two-year colleges for financial reasons; a renewed commitment to excellence in community colleges; the potential for professional development and faculty revitalization; and increasing competition among postsecondary institutions for enrollments. Honors programs offer benefits for students through smaller classes, increased  opportunity for individualized study, recognition of their achievements, and increased acceptance by transfer institutions. Faculty benefit as well in that honors classes offer a more stimulating environment and improved opportunities for personal renewal. The colleges themselves also benefit from an enhanced image and the generation of new ideas and practices in honors programs that are applicable across the curriculum. Existing honors programs share the characteristics of specified admissions criteria, financial support for the students, special course sections and creative program designs, and an extra-course aspect. Five questions which probe the nature and extent of institutional commitment are provided to assist colleges in determining their readiness to initiate honors programs.  (HB)",

The primary file of data collected for the study contained information on all 3,497 students who had taken freshman composition (Eng 210) between winter 1979 and fall 1983, while the secondary file contained information on all 191 developmental English (Eng 102) classes taught from fall 1975 through summer 1983. Statistical analyses of variance revealed: (1) student achievement had significantly increased since the college instituted its basic literacy skills  assessment program in January 1981; (2) assessment by writing sample seemed to be particularly effective in increasing student achievement in freshman composition and least effective in increasing achievement in developmental writing; (3) the Stanford Task instruments seemed more effective in increasing student achievement in developmental writing than in freshman composition; (4) basic skills abilities, as measured by high school grade point averages (GPA's), of students entering the college before and after assessment began were not significantly different; however, college GPA's increased significantly under both assessment programs.

After affirming the importance of the transfer function of community colleges, the paper examines flaws and inconsistencies in the data on student transfers and estimates that 5% of the students who enter community colleges complete a two-year program, transfer to a four-year institution and earn a baccalaureate degree, with an additional 7% to 8% transferring prior to completing a two-year program. The argument is presented that cooperative arrangements among all segments of postsecondary education in California will be required to obtain  reliable information about transfer, and incipient efforts in California and more developed programs in other states are highlighted. Next, allegations that community college enrollment adversely affects students' chances of obtaining baccalaureate degrees are counterposed with evidence of the colleges' success in helping students achieve their goals. Research findings are then presented, focusing on articulation of curricula and transfer information, course numbering systems, the paucity of second-year courses, and activities that enhance transfer. Finally, it is suggested that a common entry form be used by all postsecondary institutions in California and that studies of baccalaureate degree recipients be conducted. (AYC)",

For the purpose of classifying this array of problems, the macro- and micro-implementation distinction appears inadequate as an analytical tool. A more elaborate framework seems necessary for understanding or monitoring an implementation  process of the Follow Through type. A five-phase model of implementation, in which the emphasis is on variable sequences and emergent phenomena, seems advised. Such an implementation process would involve policy development, program development, project design, practice adoption, and practice implementation phases. Intensive inquiry into all five phases of this model must be conducted to fully analyze the implementation process. Further, at each phase, analytical concern must focus on four general criteria: sound management, fidelity to original intentions, elaboration of vaguely stated objectives into operational practices, and reduction of internal contradictions. While political or administrative realities may restrict changes in program implementation, monitoring should enable more  accurate anticipation of likely program outcomes. (RH)",

The original Follow Through evaluation was based on the assumption that the world consists of a single system explainable by appropriate methods; the evaluation presumed that in the domain of early childhood education there exists an underlying internally consistent reality to be discovered. The evaluation foundered badly. An alternate method of evaluation is to deal with the world in terms of ordinary language and as it appears phenomenologically to individuals. This mode of investigation emphasizes experience as lived. Ways of investigating such experiences in a disciplined manner exist;  these disciplines are called the humanities. Whereas science looks for causes, the humanities look for reasons. The essence of humanistic thought seems to be that human action is intelligible only when we see it through the eyes of the acting agent, only when we see why he would do what he did. Many of the features of humanistic inquiry can be seen in Zimiles and Mayer's (1980) study of the Bank Street Follow Through Project. (RH)",

To this end, interviews were conducted with the staff director or principal investigator of four Follow Through programs affiliated with member institutions of the Council for Educational Development and Research. Interviews sought to determine the extent to which directors/investigators believed their model's affiliation with the host institution enabled them to (1) benefit from the host institution's other major research and development thrusts, and (2) remain committed to a rigorous research and development mode rather than be turned into a technical assistance program for  various school sites. Responsive education, bilingual/bicultural, individualized early learning, and cognitively oriented curriculum program models were investigated. Additionally, the sponsor of the direct instruction model, not developed in affiliation with a research and development institution, was interviewed to provide a basis for comparison. It was concluded that sponsors do benefit from affiliation with institutions having a strong commitment to programmatic research and development. It was also found that other factors appeared to be as important as the host institution's focus. (RH)",

Perceptions of change itself, of control, of the school system, and of the school staff are critical to his/her effectiveness in implementing change. To create an institutional climate that supports change, the principal must provide an administrative synthesis of the many elements of the school environment. The principal must first perceive the gestalt of the school situation with innovations in place; he then can bring the change about sequentially by applying linear, analytic methods to the planning and &quot;building&quot; of the climate element by element. The climate is developed through (1) holistic thought; (2) instructional modeling; (3) complete communications; and  (4) planning the future. The relevance of such perceptions and actions can be seen in the application of administrative synthesis to inservice activities designed to develop teachers' group process skills and to meet other identified needs at an &quot;open concept&quot; elementary school.

The first section identifies areas in which federal programs have consistently succeeded or failed and presents reasons why those outcomes are probably the inevitable results of the policy tools that the federal government has available. Discussion of successes focuses on efforts that make disadvantaged children important clients, build school districts' capacities, encourage curriculum experimentation and research, and strengthen local protectors and advocates for disadvantaged children. Failures include approaches that encourage districts to adopt and faithfully implement promising new curricula, involve the institutionalization of  curricular and other practice improvements once grant funds run out, and promote exact compliance in detail with federal financial and service requirements. The second section discusses the problems of the present federal program strategy, specifically focusing on ways in which the programs may be unnecessarily reducing one another's effectiveness. It is argued that two aspects of the federal program structure--the multiplicity of programs in one local site and unfunded requirements--contribute significantly to interference (conflict between categorical programs and the core local program) and cross subsidy (the use of federal funds intended for one purpose or group to provide services for another purpose or group). A third and final section briefly identifies ways that Follow Through can  help solve the problems of federal program strategy. (RH)",

Two strands of the preliminary research strategy are specifically discussed. The first strand centers on the development of guidelines for funding a first wave of new approaches, to be tested beginning in the 1981-82 school year. The second strand focuses on a continual  process of seeking out newer, less developed conceptions of Follow Through that could lead to implementation of a second wave and succeeding waves of pilot projects over 5, 10, and 20 years. Several uses for the new Follow Through research are pointed out, details of the planning process are discussed, and content areas of papers solicited in the first and second research strands are specified.

This thesis is expanded mainly through a brief description of the elements of mastery learning and through discussions of organizational dimensions and the operational character of outcome-based practice. After describing the development of a researcher/practitioner coalition addressing implementation obstacles, discussion of organizational dimensions focuses on major obstacles to implementing mastery learning and philosophical premises underlying outcome-based  practice. Specifically explored are staff attitudes and beliefs, role responsibilities and techniques, and organizational structure and procedure. Operational character is discussed in terms of learning outcome goals, criterion-referenced assessment and reporting, curriculum, instructional process, information management, success-oriented record keeping, and program evaluation. In general, the examination concerns philosophical premises, optimal instructional conditions, and operational components of outcome-based practice and suggests how these factors are related to apparent attitudinal, role performance, and structural obstacles to implementation. Concluding remarks concern how such factors are related to obstacles posed by the system of power and incentives governing school  operations. Implications for Project Follow Through are pointed out.

It is asserted that educational reform in America usually attempts to change people, especially children, and that this tendency is evident in Follow Through programs. Subsequent discussion illustrates the idea and importance of structure by describing an observational study of playgrounds. Specifically, playground structures appeared to (1) have strong, but not uniform, effects; (2) be designed into systems that can be modified but not radically changed; (3) reflect several goals and half-resolved compromises among those goals; and (4) be designed  for adults as well as children. Other aspects of structure are delineated in a discussion of attempts to change the structure of a university sociology class. Concluding sections of the paper critique the mainstream of classroom research, provide suggestions for changing educational structures, and highlight three studies that illuminate the nature of school and classroom structure at the elementary level.

        "description":"One of several papers commissioned by the National Institute of Education (NIE), this discussion addresses the utility of test-equating studies for large-scale program evaluation and investigates the use of standardized tests in similar evaluation efforts. The discussion begins with an examination of the question, Should standardized achievement tests be used in a programmatic evaluation of Follow Through? Predominant issues in the argument against the use of standardized tests in program evaluation are then addressed. It is concluded that the earlier practice of evaluating Follow Through with a single standardized achievement test should be abandoned. The second question addressed poses the issue of whether NIE should sponsor another large-scale test-equating study in support of  Follow Through program evaluation. Consideration of this issue is based largely on experience gained through the administration of the Anchor Test Study (ATS). Following a brief description of ATS history, the discussion draws on an extensive review of the literature to suggest that ATS results have not been considered. Finally, implications of the review for Project Follow Through are presented together with (1) a set of recommendations concerning the use of standardized tests in the evaluation of Follow Through, and (2) recommendations about NIE sponsorship of a major test-equating study involving tests that might be suitable for Follow Through program evaluation.

Versions compared include (1) a federally coordinated research program designed to generate knowledge about the relative advantages of different combinations of Head Start and Follow Through; (2) the version that actually occurred (the planned variation approach), which contrasted a variety of curricula to determine the nature of effects each produced in disadvantaged children; and (3) small, federally coordinated pilot tests of new, alternative instructional techniques. The comparison is guided by a list of seven research/program  dimensions, including nature of programmatic variations, utility of the study, likelihood of measuring relevant outcomes, duration of the study, size of the study, inferential problems, and cost/benefit implications of the above considerations. In conclusion, eight arguments weighing heavily against the third variation are presented, and an alternative third version is offered for consideration. In this latter version, the program would continue as before, and the federal government would support research into all major program dimensions (such as the nature and implications of disadvantage, the organization and delivery of noninstructional services, variations in compliance with federal regulations, program implementation, and characteristics of program models).

First, a brief overview is provided of social and economic changes prior to and after the 1940s, showing how such changes have affected the daily experience of individuals and the responsibilities of the schools. This is followed by a description of efforts by educators to aid underachieving children, including compensatory education and school improvement programs. Next, an ecological perspective on the school is offered, focusing on work done in conjunction with the Yale Child Study Center at two public elementary schools located in New Haven, Connecticut (99% black, with more than 50% receiving Aid for  Families with Dependent Children assistance). After a brief review of basic concepts of system management, interventions in the two inner-city schools are described in terms of structural, procedural, and time-related program elements. In the interventions, priority was given to the development of a governance and management body consisting of administrators, teachers, parents, aides, and support staff. This body functioned at the highest decision-making level in the schools. The document concludes with a discussion of the relationship between management and school improvement, emphasizing the importance of good management practices and school staff members' knowledge of them.

Discussion of the first question focuses on findings of past Follow Through evaluations, problems associated with the use of experimental design and statistics, and prospects for discovering new knowledge about the program. With respect to the second question, it is suggested that NIE should conduct evaluation emphasizing an ethnographic, principally descriptive case-study approach to enable informed choice by those involved in the program. The discussion is based on the following assumptions: (1) Past evaluations of Follow Through have been quantitative, experimental approaches to deriving  value judgments; (2) The deficiencies of quantitative, experimental evaluation approaches are so thorough and irreparable as to disqualify their use; (3) There are probably at most a half-dozen important approaches to teaching children, and these are already well-represented in existing Follow Through models; and (4) The audience for Follow Through evaluations is an audience of teachers to whom appeals to the need for accountability for public funds or the rationality of science are largely irrelevant.

Discussion of standardized tests addresses the following criticisms: (1) Items on tests of mental ability are not based on any theory of cognitive or intellectual functioning; (2) Tests yield little information regarding the cognitive process; (3) Standardized test formats preclude clarification of questions asked; (4) Cultural bias exists in test content, language, and format; and (5) Tests are of little use in diagnostic efforts to guide instruction. Exploration of black children's learning  characteristics focuses on the nature of the intellectual processes of black children; problems of designing tests with ecological validity; the influence of home and neighborhood environments on cognitive organization and intellectual styles; implications for cognitive assessment; frameworks for an integrated conceptual paradigm (the adaptive analysis of social behavior and the processes of rule induction); and the generality of an inductive learning style among black children.

        "description":"Focusing on issues involved in improving the education of low-income children, this paper identifies two categories of questions: (1) programmatic questions, which concern what and how to teach; and (2) procedural questions, which concern how best to insure implementation of instructional approaches. The discussion also provides a summary of what Project Follow Through has revealed about instructional models and sponsorship, and proposes a multiple-evaluation design for a second generation of Follow Through studies. It is suggested that, while Follow Through investigators have intended that programmatic questions be resolved through a variety of instructional models, considerable controversy has arisen concerning the degree to which answers have been provided about teaching young  disadvantaged children. It is also asserted that procedural questions have related to the processes of implementing instructional systems under sponsorship. Throughout, the discussion assumes that interest in studying the usefulness of instructional models and sponsorship as educational improvement strategies still exists. To evaluate such strategies, it is proposed that research compare the effects of Follow Through sponsorship against the effects of dissemination of knowledge only on change in instruction and on the specific impact of various instructional models.

        "description":"This document discusses measurement-driven instruction, necessary conditions for effective management, and effective program coordination in the context of the design, implementation, and coordination of future Follow Through programs. The discussion of measurement-driven instruction addresses several issues, including selection of objectives, test specifications, test items, instructional support systems, and revisions and remediation. Two measurement-driven instructional programs operated by the Detroit, Michigan, public school system are very briefly described. The section on effective management includes guidelines for promoting effective educational change and provides lists of conditions shown by research to be characteristic of effective schools and classrooms. The final  section, discussing effective program coordination, provides suggestions for problem solving. First, the use of content as an integrating force is discussed. Second, school level planning is illustrated with examples from the Detroit Achievement Program, which requires each school to have an annually updated achievement plan. Third, some issues regarding equal educational opportunity are presented. An appendix includes three examples of competency-based instruction dealing with identifying main ideas, employing appropriate mechanics in writing, and problem solving in arithmetic. The examples describe the competency, provide a sample test item, describe test questions, provide guidelines for analyzing students' answers, and offer suggestions for instruction and possible teaching  activities.

Subjects were individually tested during two or three sessions by a female experimenter in a day care center in Jyvaskyla, Finland. Children's symbolic play level was assessed according to a developmental structure of five play levels proposed by McCune-Nicholich (1981) and based on Piaget's sequential stages. Data were based on observations of play sessions with 22 selected toys and administration of linguistic tasks. Specifically, language skills were assessed by recording spontaneous verbal behavior during play sessions and by presenting tasks of language comprehension, language production, and the mastery of morphology. Findings indicated that  symbolic play levels follow a hierarchical order. Regardless of the developmental sequence, considerable variation was found at each level that play activities were attained. Results also supported temporal correspondences between symbolic play and aspects of early language; in addition, symbolic play level significantly predicted the mastery of morphology 3 months later.

        "description":"A study investigated 261 Mexican American mothers' estimations of their preschool children's cognitive performance. Existing literature on parental estimations was reviewed. The McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA) were administered to 107 boys and 154 girls, ranging from 32 to 75 months of age. The children's mothers were then asked how they thought their children performed on the MSCA, item by item. At the same session, family background data were obtained and the mothers were interviewed, using a home environmental instrument. Major findings were that mothers tended to overestimate children's performance in general intellectual functioning and between/within MSCA areas; mothers were fairly accurate in their estimations when several accuracy indexes were used; mothers  who tended to give higher estimations had more exposure to the culture of schools (e.g., English-speaking rather than Spanish-speaking, United States-born rather than Mexican-born, higher schooling attainment); as mothers' estimations increased, intellectual climate of the home environment increased; and as maternal inaccuracy of estimations increased, children's MSCA performance tended to decrease. The major conclusion was that Mexican American mothers were subject to similar estimation patterns as those observed in the existing literature. Appendices include English and Spanish versions of the maternal MSCA, family data questionnaire, and home environment instrument. (MH/Author)",

        "description":"Using a cross-cultural perspective, researchers studied the &quot;math avoidance syndrome,&quot; which has reached crisis proportions among American Indians, at two elementary schools on Utah's Northern Ute Reservation and Wisconsin's Oneida Indian Reservation in 1980. Researchers gathered data by observing math instruction at the schools and by interviewing parents, teachers, tribal officials, and a group of students from third and fourth grade classrooms. They also discussed with tribal elders each tribe's style of computation and problem solving. Results showed that, contrary to widely held beliefs, neither degree of traditionality nor sex of student served as an accurate predictor of student math attainment or interest in math. Perceived conflicts between school and home regarding  function and purpose of education, social organization of math lessons, incompatibility of classroom management styles, student-preferred patterns of self-dependence, familiarity with the tribe's traditional enumeration system, and other factors were found to be more significant variables. What emerged from the study was not a listing of causes for Indian student math avoidance, but a configuration of behavioral and attitudinal dimensions, each working with the other, that encourage or inhibit math learning. Implications for future research and for classroom policy are given. (Author/SB)",

Acceptability and use of the Spanish edition was generally high among students and staff, although the vocabulary level was difficult for younger students. Respondents considered the content, format, and translation to be of exceptionally high quality and most students in all sites wanted to continue receiving the magazine. Results indicated that the approach represented by the Spanish edition had merit, served many pressing educational needs, and should be pursued further. (Author/SB)",

        "description":"A field study conducted in the east Jordan Valley (September 1981-August 1983) explored the role of formal education in the maintenance of sex-gender hierarchy and other social heirarchies. Two rural secondary schools were studied, one for boys and one for girls, both attended by members of several different social/ethnic groups who consider themselves Jordanian bedouin. Curricula in both schools were similar, as all students must take the &quot;tawjihi&quot; state examination. Girls also had two hours of study equivalent to home economics, and were more closely supervised than boys, because of the traditional Islamic concern with protecting women's honor. In the schools studied, 56% of the girls passed their tawjihi exam, and 43% of the boys, reflecting scores in Jordan as a whole.  Although social expectations were different for boys and girls, similar importance was given to daughters' and sons' success on the examination, perhaps because Islam traditionally emphasizes learning for women as well as men. Although nearly half the students in Jordan's elementary/secondary schools and teacher training colleges in 1981 were female, percentages were lower at university and postgraduate levels, probably because Jordan's emphasis on women's education began relatively recently.

Participants discussed organizational deficiencies in rural adult education, the sense of isolation all felt, and the need to link experiences of adult learners in different parts of the country. The essential message was that the rural lifelong learning movement was coming of age, and that its first responsibility was self-definition. The history of rural adult education, including the Extension Service, was discussed. Participants compared difficulties they faced, including natural constraints of terrain and weather, and also another  kind of &quot;weather&quot;: poverty, unemployment, despair--the social winds that buffet many small communities. To overcome the consequences of despair, also called &quot;rural fatalism,&quot; delegates preferred three kinds of pedagogical medicine: special programming, individual counseling, and community development. The Bill of Rights emphasized the right of all rural students to equal opportunities for lifelong learning, the need for immediate national action, and the diversity of rural people's educational needs, including a need to help plan their educational programs.

Interview data were organized into 10 sets of findings: general farmwork experience, health, life well-being and stress, locus of control, social supports, experience in the Midwest, living and working conditions, views on farmworker labor rights, views about the farmworker movement, and demographic background. Most farmworkers were from Texas (63%) and Florida (34%) and were American citizens (89%). Average age was 36 years, family size - 5.6 persons,  education level - 6.8 years, 1982 income - $6,447, time worked in farm labor -18.9 years, and annual employment in farmwork in the Midwest - 3.4 months. Although 42% experienced above average health problems, a doctor had not been seen in an average of 26.3 months. While farmworkers had little meaningful interaction with people outside work settings, they perceived that they generally experienced worse housing, sanitation, and education than other Midwesterners. Over 20% belonged to United Farm Workers; 99% endorsed farmworker labor rights; and 32% had actively supported the movement and participated in movement events.

        "description":"A revitalization of Canadian Indian culture occurred as a result of the 1967 Hawthorn Report, which advocated the integration of Canada natives into white society. On the Eskasoni Indian Reserve, home of 1700 Micma Indians in Nova Scotia, the revitalization was shown in the results of two questionnaires about local education. On the first questionnaire, 141 heads of household indicated the importance of 23 educational goals to the Eskasoni School, serving 620 students in grades K-9. Most important were the desire to learn, English, tolerance, citizenship, and Micmac language arts. Least important were Canadian studies, science, and French. On the second questionnaire, 138 heads of household indicated their satisfaction with the Eskasoni School. Although many were uninformed about  Eskasoni education, others expressed satisfaction with existing mathematics, English, science, home economics, and social studies programs, but not with courses in drama, or Micmac culture and language arts. Respondents were also satisfied with the staff and with their cihildren's liking of school, but not with available classrooms, parent consultations, or their say in decision making. Factors with which respondents were dissatisfied should be dealt with promptly and all results should be verifed or validated. Appendices contain new data and copies of the questionnaires. (SB)",

        "description":"Various responses to the current crisis in science and technology education have been initiated, including federal aid, responses from industry and professional organizations, and introduction of more than 30 bills into Congress. Reasons suggested for the crisis include the three ideas that defined the curriculum and instruction foci of the 1960s: (1) science when taught in a way that is known to scientists will inherently be interesting to all students; (2) any subject can be taught in some intellectually honest form to any learner regardless of his/her stage of development; and (3) science must be taught as a narrative of inquiry, not a rhetoric of conclusions. These assertions have not only provided a philosophical base but have also caused several problems, including the  separation of science and technology into two distinct identities. However, a new direction for science education, based on findings from Project Synthesis, is proposed. This direction focuses on personal needs, societal issues, career awareness, and academic preparation. Descriptions of 18 science programs are provided as examples of programs which approach the ideal state in secondary schools as suggested by Project Synthesis. (JN)",

The model used during the attempts to: (1) incorporate some aspects of science content development, manipulative hands-on experiences, video-taping, development of self confidence, teach-reteach methodology, and supervisor, peer, and self-evaluation strategies; and (2) to modify the teachers' affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses to elementary science teaching. Results obtained from a 27-item instrument (measuring science knowledge, use of science equipment, interest in science, and apprehension about science teaching) indicate development of positive attitudes in  each of the four areas measured. The study shows that the model was effective in producing the desired attitudinal changes and strongly suggests the use of the model in attitude modification research among in-service elementary teachers.

Subjects included 205 females and 147 males from seven high schools. In addition to analyzing instructional techniques, classroom climates, and teacher-student interactions, a selected sample of former and current students received a variety of instruments which assessed attitudinal, cognitive, and socio-cultural variables. Results obtained from the case studies and survey instruments indicate that teachers who successfully encourage girls in science maintain well-equipped, organized, and perceptually stimulating classrooms, are supported in their teaching activities by parents of their students, are respected by  current and former students, use non-sexist language and examples, include information on women scientists, use a variety of instructional strategies, stress creativity and basic skills, and provide career information. Factors which discourage girls in science include high school counselors who do not insist on further courses in science and mathematics; lack of information about science-related career opportunities and the prerequisites for them; sex-stereotyped views of science and scientists fostered by textbooks, media, and many adults; lack of development of spatial ability skills; and fewer experiences with science activities and equipment that are stereotyped as masculine.

Specific objectives were to identify naturalistic models of curriculum development used in curriculum projects in Israel; point out relationships between contextual factors (such as location of development teams in universities or in the Ministry of Education) and the characteristics of the development process; and uncover elements of the personal, practical knowledge of the participants in the development process. Among the findings reported and discussed are those indicating that: (1) the average time of development of a project was 3 to 5 years; (2) almost all projects have engaged in formative evaluation;  (3) all projects were funded by the Ministry of Education; and (4) although organizational characteristics of individual projects varied, several modes of operation could be identified. For example, two modes of cooperation and interaction (group interaction and linear mode of team work) were identified across all projects. One conclusion reported from analyses of the curriculum projects and from interviews with the curriculum developers is that there is not one naturalistic model of development; every project examined has its own special blend of characteristics.

It was hoped to compare the characteristics of teachers of exemplary programs with those possessed by teachers in general. Results are presented under the following headings: (1) qualifications of science teachers; (2) factors affecting instruction; (3) teacher knowledge and attitudes toward science; (4) instructional techniques and classroom activities; (5) sources of information concerning new developments in education and science; and (6) experience with selected federally funded science materials. Results indicate that key teachers of exemplary programs when compared to teachers in general are older, have more teaching experience, and are more  likely to have graduate degrees and recent experience with college credit courses. They are more likely to find other teachers, inservice programs, professional organization meetings, and journals as sources of information. In addition to rating themselves as &quot;very well qualified,&quot; they cite few problems with materials, facilities, or space. Their curricula tend to be locally developed, and they use more hands-on manipulatives and laboratories and lecture less than teachers in general. It is suggested that these and other findings provide the rudimentary elements to start the process of designing a model of excellence in science education.

Formal instruction, which emphasized oral and written language, included lecture, discussion, oral quizzes, written assignments, reading assignments, films, film strips, written tests, and quizzes. Students receiving formal instruction did not perform any laboratory investigations and did not manipulate science apparatus. Concrete instruction was organized around the three-phase learning cycle approach (exploration, conceptual invention, and discovery) and emphasized hands-on activities. Although the two treatment groups seemed not to differ in science achievement or cognitive development at the onset of the study, after a 9-month  period, the concrete instruction group (N=57) scored higher in science achievement, delayed science, and cognitive development than the formal instruction group (N=58). Also, the percentage of students advancing from concrete to &quot;transitional reasoning&quot; was greater in the concrete instruction group than in the formal instruction group. These results are consistent with previous studies and add to the increasing body of evidence which points out the importance of hands-on science instructional activities in promoting intellectual development and science achievement.

        "description":"A framework is presented for characterizing competence for cognitive tasks, with a detailed hypothesis about competence for counting by typical 5-year-old children. It is proposed that competence has three main components that are called conceptual, procedural, and utilizational competence. Conceptual competence, which is discussed in greatest detail, is the implicit understanding of general principles of the domain. Procedural competence is understanding of general principles of action and takes the form of planning heuristics. Utilizational competence is understanding of relations between features of a task setting and requirements of performance. A characterization of conceptual competence for counting is presented, in the form of action schemata that constitute understanding  of counting principles such as cardinality, one-to-one correspondence, and order. This hypothesis about competence is connected explicitly to a detailed analysis of performance in counting tasks. The connection is provided by derivations of planning nets for procedures that are included in process models that simulate children's performance. It is concluded that the nature of young children's understanding reflects competence that supports the understanding of counting as well as later development, such as explicit understanding of the role of one-to-one correspondence in definitions of equivalence.

In this paper, a model is developed which explains how attribution theory could explain student effort and achievement in mathematics. According to the model, student perceptions of success or failure in mathematics are followed by attributions which then influence effort and finally achievement. Learned helplessness or mastery-oriented attributional styles are expected to develop when attributions are made in a consistent fashion over an extended period of time. Three directions for research relating attributions and mathematics education are also discussed. The first involves studies to validate the model, the second suggests new  instruments, and the third deals with possibilities for changing students' attributional styles in mathematics. (Author)",

        "description":"This investigation, part of an on-going research program examining social learning theory applications to career development, tested several hypotheses derived from A. Bandura's self-efficacy theory in the career-related domain of mathematics. Specifically, the effects of failure on a mathematics task and on a task irrelevant to mathematics were explored. Findings indicate that, congruent with theoretical expectations, measures of mathematics self-efficacy (MSE) expectations of females were not influenced by verbal-task failure; however, contrary to predictions, MSE expectations of males rose significantly higher as a result of verbal-task failure. For the mathematics-task failure condition, again counter to expectations, females' MSE rose while males' MSE was not significantly  affected. No task-failure effect was found on a global rating of subjects' mathematics ability. Findings for a global verbal ability rating were partly consistent with predictions; all subjects responded to verbal-task failure with a decrease in verbal ability ratings. Unexpectedly, subjects in the mathematics-failure condition significantly increased their ratings of their verbal ability on posttest, indicating that the effects of failure had a facilitating, rather than a debilitating influence on self-efficacy with respect to a task irrelevant domain. Implications of these results for future career-related self-efficacy research are discussed. (Author/JN)",

Eight attitudes that have been hypothesized to be related to learning cognitive performance and enrollment in science were assessed. These were: science usefulness; confidence in learning science; science as a male domain; effectance motivation in science; success in science; teacher support; parental support; and peer support. The relationships between these attitudes (dependent variables) and sex (male, female), three grade levels (tenth, eleventh, twelfth), and science program (academic terminal, academic continuing) were examined. Among the  results reported were those indicating that: (1) although there were no widespread differences in attitudes between males and females, females anticipated more positive consequences as a result of successful achievement in science; (2) academic continuing students saw more usefulness in the study of science, had more confidence in studying science, and liked science more; (3) perceived peer support toward the study of science was low regardless of the grade. The overwhelming significant differences favoring academic continuing students, regardless of sex, indicate the importance of attitudes in possibly reducing the attrition rate in science.

        "description":"An evaluation of the instructional materials used by high school and college students who participated in the Model United Nations Program showed that the program is uncritical of the United Nations (U.N.) and biased against the United States and the West in general. These materials are strongly promoted by many prominent educational professional organizations. Examples of some of the biases found follow. The core curriculum being taught through the materials is the New International Economic Order (NIEO), which teaches that capitalist nations are exploiting poorer nations and that the solution to this exploitation is the massive redistribution of wealth from the developed nations to the Third World. There is no analysis of the internal problems of developing countries. Other  curricula support the U.N. continual condemnation of Israel and South Africa, never mentioning PLO terrorist activities, the training of Angola troops by Soviet advisors, or the extensive U.N. funding of Marxist guerilla groups. Other areas of bias were found in the way the materials treated population, food, disarmament, U.N. peacekeeping, and human rights. A balanced program in international affairs is urgently needed.

Computer communication is defined as the communication of symbolic information from one location to another electronically over phone lines, satellite links, or microwave links. Hardware discussed includes national and local area networks and microcomputers. In the software category, electronic mail and bulletin boards are discussed, online information retrieval services are examined, and software programs provided by national microcomputer utilities are described. Demographic aspects of anthropology that tend to increase the usefulness of computer communications in the discipline are outlined:  (1) anthropologists working on the same things tend to be isolated in relatively distant locations, and (2) anthropology needs a communication system that can cross cultural and national boundaries. Also described are applications of computer communications to anthropology, including person-to-person data exchange, electronic mail, computer conferencing, electronic publishing, electronic data sharing, and cross-cultural communication.

        "description":"The economic evolution of American women from the colonial era to 1984 is examined. The labor-scarce environment of the colonial era gave women access to any occupation they wished, e.g., field work, household manufacturing. With the Industrial Revolution, 1820-1865, the role of women changed. Industrialists hired women because they would work for low wages. Late in this period the &quot;cult of true womanhood,&quot; i.e., women belong in the home raising children, appeared. In the period from 1865 to 1920 work opportunities for women changed and widened. Women entered the professions of nursing and teaching. The proportion of women employed increased from 14.7 to 24.9 percent; a women's union movement was founded. In 1920 women won the right to vote. From 1920 to 1984 more women entered  the work force but at a slower rate. Although women had access to skilled, higher-paying industrial jobs, they were discriminated against. The women's liberation movement of the 1960's demanded employment equalities as a condition for equality of the sexes. The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was approved by Congress, but was not ratified by the required 38 states. ERA supporters, however, have not conceded defeat. (RM)",

Material is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1 outlines the essential role that the social studies play in the general school curriculum by cultivating \"democratic\" citizens. Chapter 2 defines the special nature of a democratic citizen as one who participates in social, political, and economic processes. It is suggested that the development of such citizens through active, participatory learning experiences is one of the most potent contributions of a comprehensive social  studies program. Examples of community-based and school-based social studies programs are provided. Chapter 3 reviews the research on political socialization that supports the claim that a strong social studies curriculum is needed in each of the 13 years of formal schooling. The final chapter outlines the role of the social studies teacher in advocating the social studies. Specific techniques for promoting social studies education by working with local media, promoting instruction of the Constitution, recognizing student achievement, building social studies networks, and promoting social studies to parents are discussed.

The foremost objective of the Beltman program is to develop the habit of wearing seat belts and to develop positive safety attitudes. Three study groups made up of 550 second grade students were divided into one control and two experimental groups. The control group teachers taught safety in the traditional way. Experimental group teachers received inservice training and followed 16 lesson plans featuring the Beltman program. At the time of the first behavioral assessment, the three groups exhibited statistically the same total on out-of-school safety behavior. On the follow-up assessment, the experimental group students exhibited statistically more positive out-of-school safety  behavior than did the control group students. Graphs, survey instruments, the traffic safety questionnaire, and the experimental teachers' evaluation form are appended. (JD)",

Mean scores for each study variable were calculated and comparisons made between Health-Promoting Decision Makers (HPDM) and Health-Risky Decision Makers (HRDM). There were statistically significant differences between HPDM's and HRDM's on three study variables: (1) future decisions on premarital sexual behavior; (2)  future decisions on drinking and driving; and (3) degree of reflection over the health decision. Regardless of the decision made by students, their reported cognitions during the making of that decision were overwhelmingly social in nature. Recommendations for health curriculum planners and school health researchers are presented in conjunction with suggestions for potential future investigations in this area. (JMK)",

Future teachers must know academic subject matter thoroughly, have a comprehensive understanding of the principles of human development and learning, and be able to apply their education and training effectively prior to becoming fully certified teachers. A teacher education program extending beyond four years has now been implemented at the University of South Carolina. The program includes expanded coverage of important content areas as well as more opportunities for students to acquire effective teaching strategies through directed field experience. This extended baccalaureate program includes certification tracks in early childhood, elementary, middle, and secondary  education. While a core of coursework and corresponding practica experiences is common to all programs, highly specialized professional training characterizes the certification program. Beyond the new extended baccalaureate are two additional levels of professional development: the master's degree in selected teaching areas and a proposed specialist degree in teaching. Linked to the two levels of degree study, and to specific school district and teacher development needs, are various professional education/training courses and inservice education workshops and institutes.

Several important questions were considered: (1) What types of field experience programs are most and least effective? (2) Are there common characteristics of field based programs that affect students consistently in all areas? and (3) How do field experiences in methods courses compare to field experiences in other areas of study? These programs were assessed in relation to preservice teacher attitudes, achievement, delayed outcomes, and teaching behavior. Consistent findings indicate that field experiences are generally positive experiences in general education courses, methods courses, and science  methods courses. Attitudes, achievement, and teacher behavior, however, are not affected equally in all courses. In addition, duration studies of field experience indicate that few to moderate numbers of field experiences tend to have positive effects on preservice teachers. Conversely, exposure of students to many field experiences appears to dramatically diminish previous gains on desired outcomes. Eleven tables and a four-page bibliography are appended. (Author/JMK)",

The subjects also evaluated their present attitudes toward teaching. In addition, the principal or department head of each graduate provided ratings of the graduate's on-the-job success. Analyses were made of 25 sets of scores or classifications derived from the approximately 400 practicing teachers and their principals who were initially involved in the study. Scores were related to teachers' academic ability, academic achievement, attitudes toward teaching, perceived needs, perceived proficiencies, evaluations of the various components of their  teacher education programs, and the effectiveness or success of these teachers as rated by their superiors. Presented in this paper are findings resulting from analysis of the teachers' effectiveness ratings as provided by their principals, and analysis of the teachers' perceived proficiency scores and their attitudes toward teaching. Findings are presented in narrative and tabular format.

The intent of the elementary school teacher education project was to establish a single collaborative team that would determine appropriate ways to introduce knowledge of effective teaching into preservice curricula and to implement plans for including this knowledge in teacher preparation programs at three colleges. The team consisted of a researcher and three teacher educators. The secondary school mathematics teacher education project consisted of three separate  collaborative teams, each having a researcher, a high school teacher, and a university-based mathematics teacher. The task of this project was to identify and describe conditions surrounding the education of high school mathematics teachers and to implement plans for the improvement of mathematics teacher education.

Also, stress-reduction techniques must be sensitive to individual differences, both culturally and situationally. Consequently, since no one technique will work for everyone, a stress-reduction program must assault the problem at many levels. A study sought to find specific coping techniques helpful to educators and cluster the techniques into interpretable categories. Data were collected from 1,156 questionnaires about stress answered by teachers. One hundred fifty-six techniques were identified and found to cluster into seven categories: social, physical, intellectual, entertainment, managerial, personal, and attitudinal.  Effective coping appeared to consist of building a repertoire of techniques equally balanced in these categories. The study also assessed the number of coping responses used and the frequency with which 125 educators used them. Data were analyzed by respondent's sex, age, and position.

A brief history is presented of psychological theories of instruction from the viewpoints of E. L. Thorndike, B. F. Skinner, Gestalt psychology, and Piaget.

Football was also played by Los Angeles Chinese Americans, and their games drew considerable local interest. Girls and women also played basketball as well as tennis. However, indigenous Chinese games and sports remain popular in their communities. The area's elementary school and children's center has attempted to retain authentic Chinese dances and past-times such as Chinese jump rope, lion dancers, and kite flying. This paper presents a history of the role of  sport in the cultural and social development of Chinese Americans in the Los Angeles area. (JD)",

A study explored: (1) how classroom management skills are evaluated relative to other instructional skills, and teachers' and students' evaluations; (2) mastery of 10 individual classroom management skills and teachers' and students' perceptions of mastery; and (3) degree to which students improve in classroom management skills during student teaching, and teachers' and students' perceptions of progress. Student self-reports and cooperating teacher reports for 87 elementary school student  teachers were examined. Pairwise comparisons and descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the data and answer the research questions. Results indicated that: (1) Teachers and students both rated classroom management relatively high compared to other instructional skills; (2) Teachers and students were in general agreement on the most easily mastered classroom management skills; and (3) Students rated themselves more modestly in the beginning of the student teaching experience and perceived themselves as making greater progress than did teachers, who ranked the student teachers higher at both points with less progress in the interim.

To that end, a series of teacher development intervention programs and teacher interviews were conducted. This report describes the programs and interviews and highlights the most pertinent sociological findings held in common by the two areas of inquiry. Three major sociological phenomena studied were professional isolation, professional modesty, and the socialization of beginning teachers. The study uncovered sociological factors which limit or promote teacher evaluation activities. Because of professional isolation, teachers do not develop the skills and attitudes necessary for peer review, a key component of  professional evaluation. Professional modesty prevents teacher support for, and involvement in, increased peer evaluation. Generalizations drawn from the interviews and programs provide the bases for several recommendations for educators interested in improved and increased teacher evaluation. (DWH)",

This included pre- and post-survey questionnaires; interviews with students at various points in time; interviews with the school principal, program teachers, and field placement supervisors; and observation of classes and student activities at their field placement. Several criteria for assessing developmental activity as being productive  were delineated. Student testimony and research staff observations were the main sources of data.

The borderline group method and the contrasting groups method were each compared with the Nedelsky method at four schools and the Angoff method at another four schools. The Basic Skills Assessment Tests in reading and mathematics were administered for the study. The project was designed to determine whether different methods yield similar passing scores and, if not, whether the differences between them are systematic and predictable. The Nedelsky and Angoff methods are based upon judgments about test items. The borderline and contrasting group methods produce similar results when approximately equal numbers of students are classified as  masters and non-masters. The contrasting group passing score produced different results when the ratio of masters to non-masters fluctuated. The Nedelsky and Angoff methods produced inconsistent results across schools. The passing scores were higher at schools with more able students. Results of the study suggest that those who set passing scores should use methods based upon test scores of actual test takers whenever possible. (Author/DWH)",

The relationships between anxiety or boredom and test performance were explored. Anxiety and boredom were shown to have adverse effects upon performance on reading and mathematics tests. Anxiety and, to a lesser extent, boredom sometimes appear to have effects on test performance which are strong enough to neutralize or reverse effects associated with other variables, such as sex, socioeconomic status, and race or ethnicity. Differences in anxiety level can lead to differences in test scores large  enough to mask any evidence of growth. Cognitive growth may not be indicative of true growth, but reflects a change in anxiety level. (DWH)",

Standardized testing at the local level declined dramatically with the widespread introduction of comprehensive secondary education. However, in the late 1970's widespread local testing programs were re-introduced for the purposes of monitoring student progress, screening students to identify those in need of special help, or providing information for transfer from junior to senior school. A national testing program, the Assessment of Performance Unit (APU), was established in 1974. It is designed to assess achievement in language, math, science, and modern language. The emphasis of the APU has shifted away from its original purpose of providing information relevant to policy making and resource  allocation toward providing detailed information to guide teaching practice. In the UK, there are also two types of public examination: the General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level (at age 16) and Advanced Level (at 18), and the Certificate of Secondary Education (at 16) for the less academic student. These examinations are set by various examination boards, and with such a diverse system, there are questions over comparability and confusion over whether the grades awarded are norm-referenced or criterion-referenced.

It is different from other conference syntheses, as it includes the process for creating the conference as well as the conference content and the evaluation of it. The objectives of the conference were to give participants the opportunity to explore the state of the art in validation; to provide the time and the environment for each SEDL/RX state team to work on its own validation concerns; and to arrange a forum and begin to pool the collective knowledge of the SEDL/RX region regarding validation. Papers were presented by William Hinze, Christine Dwyer,  Bud Grossner, John Osborne, Preston C. Kronkosky, Jack Lumbley, Bill Reaves, and Sharon Adams. The conference evaluation consisted largely of determining if the objectives were attained through questionnaires and monitoring state validation efforts. (DWH)",

The first example focuses on Center for the Study of Evaluation (CSE) research in writing assessment. This research investigated issues in domain definition, cognitive processing requirements, rater and scale stability, and response mode. The analytic scales resulting from this research were implemented, with CSE assistance, in district and state assessment programs. These implementations provided data to further the research. The second example focuses on theoretical research in integrating testing and instruction. A school district's desire to raise students' test scores provided the opportunity to reality test some of  the research ideas. The result was higher test scores for the district's schools, and important data for the researchers. (Author)",

The first set relates to the process in which the evaluation activities are conducted. They include: validity of assessment procedures, validity and reliability of evaluation instruments, representativeness of findings, use of procedures for minimizing error, and use of multiple objectives and multiple measures. The second set of standards relates to the content of the evaluation, and includes: project implementation; student performance; school, family, and community factors; and evaluation use. In implementing evaluation standards, several issues and problem areas are likely to emerge, e.g., resistance to change, burden on resources, and technical issues. However, the  development and implementation of sound evaluation standards should go a long way in ensuring the accomplishment of desired outcomes in Title VII projects. (BW)",

        "description":"This paper presents findings from a study of teachers' and principals' testing practices. The research included a nation-wide survey, exploratory fieldwork in preparation for the survey, and a case study inquiry on testing costs. Teachers and principals share misgivings with some of the research community about the appropriateness of required tests for some students, and about their quality and equity. Teachers seem to use test results temperately--as one of many sources of information. As a result of required testing, more time is spent in teaching basic skills and less attention can be paid to other subject areas. The survey also suggests that those in the education and testing communities have paid far too little attention to the matter of teachers' assessment skills. Teachers  essentially receive neither training nor any kind of supervision nor any supporting resources in the development of their own tests. Given their frequency and importance at the elementary school level, the findings also suggest curriculum-embedded testing as another neglected area of inquiry. Finally, formal measures should have three important qualities: a close match to curriculum, immediate availability and accessibility, and feelings of ownership. (BW)",

Pearson intercorrelations among the summary indices of these cognitive measures were uniformly high, ranging from .78 to .94. Mean differences were not found between the three full scale indices. However, the short form index of the Woodcock-Johnson was found to be a consistent, significant underestimate of the full scales. Academic achievement was measured by the Wide Range Achievement Test and teacher ratings. Correlations between the cognitive and achievement measures were significant in all cases. Although striking differences were not apparent,  the Woodcock-Johnson indices proved to correlate slightly better with achievement. Partial correlations between the Wide Range Achievement Test and teacher ratings were likewise all significant and were ordered in a manner that would suggest that the two sets of scales measured similar domains.

        "author":["Brumberg, Stephan F."],
        "description":"The public schools responsible for educating hundreds of thousands of East European Jewish immigrant children in New York City between 1893 and 1917 had three major goals: scholastic preparation, especially literacy in English, acculturation, and socioeconomic stratification. According to information obtained from interviews of students and teachers who were in the schools before 1917 (all of whom remembered their experiences with fondness and pride), the schools were enormously successful in achieving the first two goals--goals which the immigrants shared. A number of factors blended together to provide the immigrant students with a new &quot;American&quot; persona: the curriculum, which taught American ideals and American ways and emphasized the commonality of American citizens; the  teachers, who were looked on as role models of &quot;Americanhood&quot;; school rituals; high levels of structure and discipline; the enforced use of English; and underlying pan-Protestantism and the ignoring of Judaism and the students' historical and cultural roots. The German Jewish leadership aligned itself with New York's educational leaders in the promotion of rapid assimilation of Jewish immigrants. A drifting away from Jewish religion and culture thus often accompanied the &quot;Americanization&quot; of the eastern European immigrants. The schools' third goal, however--that of facilitating and rationalizing socioeconomic stratification--was not shared by immigrant students. They saw the schools as a way out of their confined communities and as means of achieving higher status and greater material  rewards. Instead of maintaining the social order, then, schools became vehicles for upward socioeconomic mobility. (CMG)",

The Boston Public School youth employment data and analyses presented in this report are taken from two surveys--one given to high schools students in the spring of 1982, and the second given to graduates of the Boston Public School Class of 1982, seven months after graduation. Findings show that Boston's in-school youth have a much higher employment rate and lower employment/population ratio than that of the nation and the Northeast. Boston student data, like national statistics, show a large gap between races. Unemployment rates differed as much as 60 percentage points among Boston's high schools; the most achievement oriented schools had the highest employment rates. Boston Public  School 1982 graduates had a slightly lower unemployment rate than that of the nation, and the gap between races was less pronounced. Both surveys show that Blacks and Hispanics who were working--particularly Black females--found their jobs through school more often than did Whites. Data also show that one-half of graduate respondents had the same job they had while in high school. Numerous graphs and tables present data by race, school, employment, type of employer, length of job, source of job, and attitude toward work obstacles. (Author/GC)",

It was found that while there are formal structures in place for involving the community, such as a district-wide bilingual parents' advisory council, these are not viewed as critical to school or program functioning by either administrators or parents. Since administrators have not taken the community's role in school affairs seriously, they have not assisted parents in organizing themselves and in acquiring the skills necessary to become truly functioning partners in school-community dialogues. Furthermore, both administrators and  parents are limited in their views of the roles of community people in the schools: fundraising, general support, and help with homework were cited as possible roles, but classroom teaching, presentation of community skills and resources, or sharing of childrearing and informal education techniques were not mentioned. Parents have no real sense of forming policy and even less of evaluating it. Finally, despite outwardly good intentions, schools do not seem really interested in the kind of community participation which results in any realignment of the basic power relations between school and community.

It would also amend three other statutes prohibiting discrimination in Federally funded programs on grounds of race, age, or handicap. H.R. 5490, however, goes well beyond its openly-stated purpose. The most troubling ambiguities and complexities in the proposed language are the following: (1) the definition of &quot;recipient&quot; of Federal financial assistance recognizes few limits; it is so broad that, for example, if a State received a Federal block grant for educational purposes, all political subdivisions of the State would likely be brought under  the Federal Government's civil rights oversight responsibilities; (2) the existing enforcement options of the four statutes would be considerably expanded so that, for example, a worthwhile program operated in a nondiscriminatory manner could be terminated because the Federal funds going to it provide &quot;support&quot; for another, nonfunded, discriminatory program; and (3) administration would be a nightmare, as H.R. 5490 gives all funding agencies statutory responsibility to regulate all the programs, activities, and subunits of a recipient; the law would effectively remove existing boundaries of agency jurisdiction to conduct compliance reviews and complaint investigations and impose regulatory requirements.

        "description":"This report examines the meaning and utility of several different desegregation-related measures relevant to Federal policy and technical assistance. Following the introduction, Section II discusses alternative measures of school segregation and desegregation. Major indices are compared, using a hypothetical school district for illustrative calculations. This comparison is extended to show the effects of modifying school racial composition in various ways, and observations are offered about commonly-used measures of school segregation. Section III examines the reduction of racial isolation measures used to determine the allocation of Emergency School Aid Act funds, and offers an alternative that can further decrease bias against districts with large minority populations by  correcting for changes in a district's overall racial composition. An addendum to the section presents a comparison of three indices for measuring the severity of racial isolation. The final section offers a simple model for considering the costs and benefits of desegregation over time, in terms of &quot;white flight&quot; or resegregation. (CMG)",

Following a chapter on the definition and background of resegregation, Chapter 2 discusses resegregation in academic programs--ability grouping, tracking, compensatory education, special education, and bilingual education--due to methods of student assignment and program organization, and to multiple eligibility for categorical programs. The impact of discipline policies on resegregation is also discussed. Chapter 3 offers alternatives to resegregative practices in terms of student assessment and assignment, instructional organization, and student discipline  practices that recognize student diversity and facilitate interracial contact. The final chapter discusses Federal strategies for reducing resegregation. An appendix outlines five ways in which the Federal government might respond to the needs of local education authorities for technical assistance to facilitate effective desegregation. (CMG)",

After an introductory section, the report considers the extent of white flight from desegregating schools, taking into account the effects of suburbanization, interregional migration, and differentials in racial/ethnic birth rates on white enrollment rates in public schools. Both the implementation-year impact and the long-range impact of desegregation on white enrollment are considered, and distinctions are made between enrollment losses due to white flight out of the desegregating school district and those due to transfers of whites from public to private schools within the district. Following this discussion, the conditions associated with white  flight are listed, and a tentative explanation of why desegregation may induce different patterns of white flight in various circumstances is offered. Methods that the schools, the courts, and the government at the State and Federal levels might use to reduce white flight are considered next. A final section discusses the costs of white flight in terms of interracial contact and the socioeconomic composition of the student and community population. (CMG)",

        "description":"This handbook, structured to facilitate use by policy makers, practitioners, school board members and school staff, contains three parts. Part I presents practical information and an action plan for implementing school improvement and delinquency prevention measures. Chapters 1 and 2 focus on how delinquency affects the U.S. educational system, and on establishing a rationale for school-based delinquency prevention policies and practices. Chapters 3 through 5 present a six-step process to support local boards in selecting non-punitive approaches to discipline and to delinquency prevention, particularly early prevention programs. The process provides for choosing a focus for change, assessing a school's weaknesses and strengths, setting goals and objectives, developing an action  plan, implementing chosen strategies, and gauging progress toward improvement. Part II is a compendium of more than 45 in-school improvement and delinquency prevention program models that are currently being implemented in public schools throughout the U.S. This part functions partly as a how-to manual for practitioners, and partly as a resource guide to a network of innovators and experts. Part III, a more extensive resource and reference guide, may be used to assist in planning and evaluating delinquency prevention programs; it includes and annotated list of recommended books, articles, readings, theme-related periodicals and congressional hearings, selected media aids, technical assistance sources, databases and clearinghouses, and development resources. An appendix contains examples  of behavioral contracts between students, parents, and schools. (Author/KH)",

The program's main objective was to enable LEP students to function successfully in terms of language achievement and content courses, acculturation, and motivation to remain in school. Students were not scheduled for tutorial sessions but came in when they needed help and specified areas in which they most needed help. Supportive services offered by the project included services from the school's grade advisors and guidance counselors and more informal advice and encouragement from program staff. Quantitative analysis of student achievement indicates that  (1) students did not meet the program's criterion for English language development, but high pretest scores limited the possible growth in this area; (2) passing rates for program students in Spring social studies and foreign language courses exceeded those for mainstream students; and (3) attendance rates did not differ significantly from the general school attendance rate. In the area of staff development, staff members attended relevant university courses. Finally, parental participation was limited because the school is not neighborhood based. (CMG)",

        "description":"The major goal of Project SPEED (at Fort Hamilton High School, Brooklyn, New York) was dropout prevention. In its first year of operation, 1982-83, the project provided English as a Second Language (ESL) instruction, bilingual instruction in basic skills required for graduation, and guidance services to approximately 300 limited English proficient (LEP) students in grades 9-12 who were regarded as high risks for dropping out. The students, mostly recent immigrants, were 65 percent Spanish speaking, 20 percent Chinese speaking, and 15 percent Arabic speaking. The project's individualized approach was based on three models, each having a specific goal and curricular emphasis: Model 1 aimed at dropout prevention, particularly for 9th and 10th graders; Model II aimed at truants whose  likelihood of staying in school is minimal; and Model III aimed at retaining LEP students older than 18. Evaluation of the project, however, showed that it was impossible to examine these models as such because the counseling, educational, and vocational guidance components that were to differentiate them had not been formally implemented. In terms of student achievement, quantitative analysis indicated the following: (1) attainment of English language objectives was mixed; (2) objectives in content area courses were attained overall; (3) 75 percent of students taking the High School Equivalency Exam passed; and (4) the program attendance rate was significantly greater than the general attendance rate. In addition, curricular materials were being developed and adapted in the three native  languages, and staff participated in meetings, workshops, and university courses.

Quantitative analysis of student achievement in English language development, however, was difficult because program objectives in this area were  vaguely worded. It was found that (1) gains in New York City reading and math tests were not significant; (2) passing rates in content areas declined from fall to spring; (3) the overall passing rate of Hispanic students in native language studies exceeded 90 percent; and (4) program attendance rates were significantly higher than general school attendance rates.

        "description":"The primary goal of New York City's Bilingual Pupil Services project was to improve the academic performance and linguistic proficiency of Spanish-speaking limited English proficient students in grades 1-6. The project was designed to achieve this goal through a program which trained and supervised bilingual paraprofessionals who provided direct instruction to students in designated classrooms in 14 districts throughout Manhattan, the Bronx, and Brooklyn. Through a rigorous selection and retention process, structured inservice training sessions, and close ongoing supervision, paraprofessionals were guided by field instructional specialists toward becoming more knowledgeable, conscientious, and effective teachers. In 1982-83, 55 paraprofessionals worked with 1,210 students in 24  schools. Analysis of student achievement indicates that in all areas of the curriculum--English reading, Spanish reading, and math--and at all grade levels, students demonstrated statistically significant gains; attendance was excellent. During the year, 17 of the participating paraprofessionals received their baccalaureate degrees as a result of their participation in this project; all are presently employed as fulltime teachers. And finally, the project had a sound management system with clearly articulated expectations and thorough recordkeeping, which may in fact be the cornerstone of the project's success.

In reading, 87.4 percent of the students meeting attendance criteria mastered at least two new reading skills and 72.8 percent mastered three or more. In math, 87.3 percent mastered two or more new skills and 72.1 percent mastered three or more.

In addition, staff were  enthusiastic about the expanded preservice training and the newly introduced inservice training, and saw the incorporation of sports activities and concepts as a strong motivating factor. In marked contrast to previous yuears, transportation was seen as a positive program feature. Finally, teachers found a new curriculum guide to be a useful supplement. Moreover, analysis of aggregate student achievement data from the current and previous years indicated a moderately strong relationship between teachers' use of particular lessons from the guide and student mastery of related skills.

        "description":"Project Esperanza supplemented the basic special education program for handicapped students with limited English proficiency (LEP) by providing (1) staff training and consultation, (2) materials development, identification, and evaluation, (3) assistance in the diagnosis of educational needs and the prescription of instructional strategies, (4) direct individualization of instruction, and (5) outreach services. During 1982-83, the project's third and final year, 515 students were served in 28 elementary, intermediate and secondary schools in New York City. Project staff included a project coordinator, two resource specialists, a curriculum specialist, two educational assistants, and two family assistants. Analysis of data from pupil achievement measures, program records, and  interviews and observations lead to the overall conclusion that Project Esperanza provided an effective, comprehensive program of supplementary services that promoted the academic development of handicapped LEP students. All program objectives for pupil achievement were attained: proposed criteria were met in English and Spanish reading, oral-English proficiency, mathematics, and cultural heritage. The project objective for teacher training was also attained. After participating in teacher workshops, classroom teachers demonstrated proficiency in developing culturally-relevant individualized lessons for bilingual special education students. The objective for parent involvement was not attained, despite efforts by project staff and improvement over previous cycles. Relative to many other  projects for similar populations, however, a moderate degree of parent participation was achieved. (Author)",

The project, which served recent immigrants from Cambodia, Vietnam, and Haiti, had as its primary stated goal &quot;the promotion of bilingual excellence among new immigrants.&quot; Title VII funds supported administrative and support services staff. At each site, students received instruction in ESL and, when possible, bilingual instruction in science, social studies, and mathematics. Supportive services provided to students included academic, personal, and vocational counseling, contact with families, and referrals to outside services. Development activities for staff  members consisted of training by the project director and attendance at conferences and university courses. In addition, some sites were able to offer ESL or high school equivalency classes for parents. Quantitative analysis of student achievement indicated that Project BACIS adequately met its instructional objectives during its first year of operation. The stated objective regarding students' attitudes toward their cultural heritage and continued education (beyond high school) was not met; validity and reliability of the program-developed attitude assessment instrument, however, may be responsible for this finding. Finally, the attendance rate of program students at all three sites was higher than the overall attendance rate for each school. Appendices include questionnaires in French,  Cambodian, and Vietnamese regarding future education and cultural attitudes. (GC)",

The major instructional objectives of the program were to provide participating students with instruction leading to the development of basic skills in both English and the native language; to develop students' business and secretarial skills; and to allow students to apply those skills in after-school or summer job internships with local businesses. Title VII funds supported all program staff positions. Due to efforts of the  job developer and the curriculum specialists, 12 program students were able to serve as interns with various businesses and agencies during summer 1983. In addition, these staff members met with school personnel and students and gave class presentations dealing with career orientation. Curriculum development efforts also were carried out. Parental involvement, on the other hand, did not reach expected levels. Analysis of student achievement indicated variable levels of attainment of program goals. Data were not available, however, for all students at every high school.

In 1982-83, the program served 885 students in 18 New York City high schools. TPRC funds--provided under the Refugee Act--supported classes in English as a Second Language (ESL) or content-area instruction with an ESL approach. Because the Refugee Act funds were limited, amounting to six full-time teacher positions distributed across the 18 schools, such monies necessarily were combined with funds from other sources in individual schools. As a result, the extent and kind of services actually provided varied from site to site. In addition, funds for 1981-82 and 1982-83  were combined and were allocated late. This report presents the assessment instruments and procedures and the results of testing to evaluate student achievement in 1982-83. The data provided suggest that TPRC students made progress in their knowledge of English syntax and in mathematics. It is difficult, however, to offer meaningful interpretations of the data for two reasons. First, only a limited number of cases were reported. Second, the combination of funds to create coherent academic programs, while justifiable from an educational standpoint, makes questionable the attribution of growth to any individual funding source.

Yet it is clear that metaphors, and metaphoric thinking, may be used to great advantage in clarifying and elaborating on ideas, and in helping students to develop their critical thinking skills so that they can move from the concrete and the familiar to the abstract and remote. (Metaphoric thinking involves thoughts and ideas, and ways of looking at things, that are formulated and expressed in figurative language.) To foster their 10th-12th grade students' ability to use metaphors, a group of Newark, New Jersey teachers associated with Project THISTLE (Thinking Skills in Teaching and Learning)  collaborated on a classroom research project on metaphoric thinking. After various experiments they designed and used a strategy in which students (1) explored the meaning of metaphors in everyday language, (2) analyzed more formal metaphors from their own subject areas, (3) created their own metaphors, first for familiar concepts and then for more abstract concepts, (4) created metaphors for subject-related concepts, and (5) evaluated the final metaphors in general classroom discussions. The experiment made it clear that metaphoric thinking is particularly useful in the development of critical thinking skills. (CMG)",

        "description":"In a study conducted to identify the major forces that appear likely to influence vocational education in the next three to five years, a general model or conceptual framework was developed and modified by suggestions from a panel of experts. The following were identified as major influences: (1) a gradual decrease in the number of secondary students, with proportionately more minority and disadvantaged students at all levels and many more adult students with widely varying characteristics at the postsecondary level; (2) rapid technological change making it impossible to keep curricula and equipment up to date; (3) decreased time for vocational education at the secondary level because of stiffer academic requirements; and (4) continuing emphasis from the Federal level on  facilitating access to education. The interaction of these and other broad influences indicates that secondary vocational education will have to include more communication and other basic skills; its teachers will have to change to meet the needs of a computer-oriented society; and postsecondary vocational education will be called upon to provide more occupational skills, especially to the disadvantaged, dislocated workers, displaced homemakers, and other adults. Other changes foreseen include greater links between vocational education and employers and an emphasis on providing new skills within existing programs rather than creating entirely new programs.

        "description":"A project was initiated to develop a cooperative relationship between local adult education programs and public libraries. It was hoped that this relationship would result in greater use of library services by undereducated adults. In return, it was anticipated that libraries would refer undereducated adults to adult education programs. While all 66 parishes in Louisiana were involved at least minimally and asked to carry out basic activities, four pilot systems were encouraged to develop strategies and activities beyond those suggested statewide. Public/parish libraries were provided with bibliographies of adult education materials by the State Library. Publicity, public service announcements, and other media instruments were developed and distributed to publicize the joint  effort. Information on adult learning and adult learner characteristics was issued to librarians through direct correspondence and the State Library newsletter. A questionnaire was mailed to adult education supervisors to determine the degree of participation existing between adult education programs and libraries at the initiation of the project. (Other contents of this report include reports from pilot parishes, correspondence, and a five-page bibliography of high-interest, low reading level books.) (YLB)",

During the first phase of the project, the researchers conducted an in-depth case study of programs and facilities in which successful competency-based technical education programs had been conducted. Next, an analysis was made of the discrepancies between the findings of the case study and the current standards for programs and facilities. After identifying program and facility standards for selected vocational and technical education programs, the researchers developed a model for establishing standards for competency-based programs. The model provided for identification of what is to be taught, how it will be taught, what is needed to  teach the programs, and how much space is needed. The final step in the model entails an evaluation of the space required for the program. Based on the field tests of the model in architectural drafting, automotive mechanics, and licensed practical nursing programs, the researchers recommended using a computer to assist in implementing the assessment model and revising the model to include more detailed provisions for assessing the need for instructional materials.

Topics include national policy and local program response, policy recommendations emanating from the forum deliberations, and employment security. Two papers address private and public responsibilities for retraining displaced workers. The next six papers and reactor comments describe and assess operating programs for displaced workers, including two programs at two-year colleges, training programs negotiated through collective bargaining by the United Auto Workers, and Bethlehem Steel  Corporation's program. A presentation on international experience and reactor comments follow. The next three research and evaluation papers and reactor comments examine use of unemployment insurance data to predict economic hardship from displacement and the economic impact of the Downriver Community Conference Economic Readjustment Activity Program. Finally, broad policy options to facilitate the reemployment of displaced workers and reactor comments are made. (YLB)",

During the next phase of the study, researchers interviewed teachers, counselors, and administrators at three vocational-technical centers, four community colleges, and five high schools, all in Florida, that were identified as having a high percentage of nontraditional students. In addition, they administered surveys to 465 students enrolled in program areas at these 12 institutions. Based on their analysis of the information obtained  from these interviews and from the survey, the researchers identified a series of recruitment, counseling, training, pretraining, placement, and follow-up strategies that appeared successful in the 12 schools examined. As a further validation measure, a cross-tabulation was made between the items included in the student survey form and the context of the strategies.

These problems seem to cluster into three categories: communication, the &quot;so what phenomenon,&quot; and the form or substance of the idea. Observations of programs in South Dakota suggest that some characteristics cut across successful models. Most of the successful programs have one of these factors or features: program leadership, program security, and support or &quot;innovations&quot; networks. One of the programs has combined the programming efforts of the parks and recreation department into the school-based community education program, and this administrative configuration has provided a basis for seeking and getting financial support from other sources. Another  program demonstrates the ways in which a director can work to involve the full spectrum of the community through the program. A third program is working to change the community's perception of itself as a resource through educational programs. The benefits and rewards for innovations and innovative practices provide sufficient motivation of staff and personnel that, in turn, generates more ideas and innovations.

        "description":"The Electronic Telecommunications System project was conceived to assist in the integration of telecommunications technologies such as electronic mail into adult and vocational education programs. After identifying and evaluating over 20 vendors and electronic mail systems, the researchers selected the ITT Dialcom system as the subject of a three and one-half month field test that involved a network of 16 sites. During the field test, training was provided dealing with the use of Dialcom as both a training and communication network. Planned exercises were sent via electronic mail to illustrate the applicability of the system as well as to ensure practice in its use. No technical problems were encountered and all computer systems and equipment configurations worked satisfactorily  during the field test. Based on an analysis of usage data and participants' comments, the researchers concluded the Dialcom compares favorably with systems used previously and that ADVOCNET (Adult and Vocational Education Network) achieved a high degree of applicability and acceptance in a very short time. (This report, which is intended as a planning and implementation guide for installing electronic mail systems for use by adult and vocational education program improvement agencies, includes a brief report on the methodology and results of the field test, a series of recommendations, project cost figures, and the project training activities.)

Data were obtained from structured interviews with employers, union representatives, employment service staff, educators, ongoing service agencies, and emergency assistance agencies. The major contributor to high unemployment rates was a narrow economic base. Dislocated workers were more skilled than the usual pool of unemployed, in their early to midforties, eager to work, heads of households, and lacking in job search skills. In addition to support services provided by some employers to workers prior to layoff, state employment services, human service agencies, emergency service providers, and postsecondary  institutions also helped. Collaboration among local agencies to meet needs of dislocated workers was reported. Besides information on dislocated worker characteristics, the written survey collected data on the economic impact of unemployment. Participants reported a number of financial adjustments they had made and major financial barriers to becoming satisfactorily employed. Dislocated workers had a positive attitude toward work before and after the layoff. Information was also obtained on the layoff process, help during the layoff, job search activities, stress symptoms, and the most difficult period during unemployment. (YLB)",

The two strategies studied were direct retrieval and plausibility. The first experiment tested the hypothesis that older subjects will rely on the plausibility strategy more than young subjects. A second experiment tested the hypothesis that the different pattern of data is due to processing differences, not differences in the strength of episodic memory traces. Performance was slower in general for older subjects. However, older subjects also tended to modify their performance to minimize the detrimental effects of inferior retention of specifics. In some conditions, older subjects outperformed young subjects even in terms of response time. This  resulted from their propensity to use a strategy that depends less on exact memory and that can be more efficient in some circumstances. This strategy involved using consistency as opposed to a careful inspection of the nature of relationships found in memory. (YLB)",

        "description":"Research for Better Schools (RBS) has operated INROADS, a career development program for minority youth, for 13 years and the High School Academies, a work-study program aimed at potential high school dropouts, for 14 years. RBS found that a new approach to educational research and development was needed when working in partnership with the private sector. Using Scriven's concepts of goal and role and adding the concept of method, RBS developed a research strategy that draws from several models: qualitative and quantitative, summative and formative, analytic description and policy information. This approach, which became known as the potpourri strategy, was found to be useful not only for identifying needs but also for developing specifications meeting those needs. Research using  the strategy showed that both programs needed a stronger staff development component, and specified the content of each staff development program, as well as how they should be structured and delivered to INROADS and Academies staff. With these guidelines, self-instructional modules were developed for each staff group and field tested. Both sets of modules are currently being used by INROADS and the High School Academies. RBS concluded that the potpourri approach was a valid research strategy that has intellectual integrity and validity as a research method. They found this approach particularly well suited for their research effort in support of two business/education collaborations. (KC)",

The analysis is based on a year-long field study of a cooperative office education program in a midwestern urban high school, a vocational program that combines schooling and on-the-job training. The data were collected during the 1980-81 school year using participant observation at the school and worksites, formal and informal interviewing, and examination of curricular materials and school records. Findings were that, contrary to the literature, students did not view themselves as academic failures, did not dislike school, and did not have  office career aspirations. Rather, enrollment in the program meant that the students were testing the world of office work, developing employable skills as something to fall back on, and accommodating themselves to the best and most likely wage labor options for women. The analysis also indicated that the meaning of work and career aspirations are misconceived as individual psychological variables. Rather, they arise from the cultural context, within which these students accept and reproduce the meaning of traditional sex roles in their vocational choice. (KC)",

        "description":"The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction implemented, in 71 school districts, a pilot project designed to assist handicapped learners to participate in vocational education programs. The program, called Designated Vocational Instruction (DVI), is intended to improve the scope and quality of secondary-level vocational education for special needs students. DVI teachers who participate in the program attend a graduate level six-week training course at the University of Wisconsin on the DVI role, vocational education principles and practices, vocational education for handicapped learners, vocational assessment instruments and techniques, development of vocational curriculum and aspects of the Individualized Education Program (IEP), and instructional accommodation needed for  handicapped learners in vocational education. Through this preparation, DVI teachers learn to assist handicapped students to enter and participate in existing vocational education programs. The DVI teacher provides support to both the vocational education teacher and the special needs student. The DVI teacher also facilitates communication between special educators, vocational educators, and student services. The first year of the program was rated a success, with 437 students served, 61 percent of whom earned at least a C or better grade in vocational education courses as a result of this instructional support. If evaluation of the program continues to be favorable, the DVI program will be continued and expanded in Wisconsin. (KC)",

In order to determine the influence of applicants' education and skills on employability assessments made by employers, the researchers analyzed data from almost 600 mail questionnaires that were returned by employers from across the nation. In general, employers tended to give preference to participants in relevant cooperative or experiential educational programs. Although part-time employment during school months appeared to confer a slight advantage to entry-level job applicants in the fields examined, data indicated that if part-time work during the school year jeopardized grades, it was not as  advantageous from an employability perspective as was work during summers. As expected, employers preferred that job applicants have a high school diploma. In certain instances, however, work experience had certain advantages over school completion. To the extent that the researchers were able to control other variables, the personal characteristics of the application reviewer did appear to influence significantly the employability index assigned to an applicant. Based on these data, the researchers cautioned school administrators and policymakers to be aware of the emphasis that employers place on grades and to provide students with job search skills and some awareness of management principles.

The approach of the study was to observe the responses of 56 employers in the Columbus, Ohio, area to simulated hiring settings concerning youthful applicants (aged 16-25) who were seeking full-time jobs in clerical, retail, or machine trade positions. The simulations, which took place at the National Center for Research in Vocational Education, required employers to rate a number of applicants first from job applications, and then from several videotaped interviews of the job candidates. In the application screening process, the employers rated work experience, relevant vocational  education courses, vocational skills, good grades, and a neatly completed application form as highest factors in leading them to consider applicants further. The results of the interview ratings show that employers especially liked in the applicants a conservative business appearance, good work attitudes, correct language and grammar skills, good expressive skills, and self-confidence. The study concluded with numerous recommendations for youth and/or youth guidance counselors, employers, and school administrators.

        "description":"This study was conducted to describe and to analyze how employers respond to information presented to them on application forms and interviews when they make hiring decisions for entry-level jobs. The approach of the study was to observe the responses of 56 employers in the Columbus, Ohio, area to simulated hiring settings concerning youthful applicants (aged 16-25) who were seeking full-time jobs in clerical, retail, or machine trade positions. The simulations, which took place at the National Center for Research in Vocational Education, required employers to rate a number of applicants first from job applications, and then from several videotaped interviews of the job candidates. In the application screening process, the results of the study demonstrate the advantage of having  some work experience, of having taken relevant vocational education courses, of having high levels of vocational skills, of having good grades, and of completing application forms in a neat manner. The results of the interview ratings show that behavior and appearance can affect not only employers' perceptions of characteristics such as attitude, personality, and verbal ability, but also of educational preparation, training, and work experience. The study concluded with numerous findings and recommendations for youth and/or youth guidance counselors, employers, and school administrators. (This technical report contains extensive data and analysis of the information gathered through the employer seminars.) (KC)",

Although many studies have examined characteristics of abused wives, there has been a dearth of literature examining the relationship between victim and perpetrator levels of aggression. The purpose of this study was to explore those variables that are related to female victims' own level of aggression toward spouses. Demographic variables, personality variables, and wives' ratings of husbands' level of aggression were used to predict wives' rates of agression. A demographic questionnaire, five scales of the 16PF, and the Conflict Tactics Scale were administered to 108 battered women. The results indicated that the sample and their spouses engaged in more acts of verbal and physical aggression than does the normal population.  The sample also scored deviantly on all five personality variables. Wives' age and husbands' level of reasoning and verbal aggression predicted wives' level of verbal aggression. Husbands' level of physical aggression was the best predictor of wives' level of physical aggression. (Author)",

        "description":"With the increased number of women in the work force, sexual harassment is receiving increased attention from the federal government, journalists, researchers, and counselors. To investigate the influence of two contextual variables (status of the initiator and age of the victim) on perceptions of sexual harassment allegations, 123 college students (69 males, 54 females) read three case studies of alleged sexual harassment, manipulated for the two variables. After reading the vignettes, subjects responded to Likert-type items on belief, certainty, and responsibility, and a group of items assessing general attitudes towards sexual harassment and the importance of the age and physical attractiveness of the victim. An analysis of the results showed that greater credibility was given  to the claims of a young victim when the initiator was her supervisor as compared to her co-worker. When the victim was middle aged or old no differences in perceptions of credibility existed between the two status conditions. Sex difference emerged, indicating that compared to males, females attributed less responsibility to the victim and were more likely to believe that the victim had been sexually harassed. The findings provide additional evidence of the importance of contextual variables in influencing perceptions of social-sexual encounters. (BL)",

The five guidelines used in working with communities (i.e., community designated goals, total community representation, ongoing community participation, multiple approaches for multiple factors, and PMHC staff as facilitators) are stated and activities of the PMHC staff in three communities are described to illustrate the use of the guidelines. In part II, the characteristics of a community development model,  focusing on process rather than specific prevention techniques, are given. The effectiveness of the process-oriented community development approach is discussed from both first and second order changes. Part III discusses the implications of a process-oriented model in the areas of implementation, funding, and evaluation. The discussion on implementation specifically focuses on agency history and orientation, staff roles, and community relations. A comment on successive revolutions in mental health practice and services concludes the paper. (BL)",

        "author":["Zarit, Steven H."],
        "description":"A widespread bias exists among legal, medical, and social service professionals that the appropriate placement for elderly individuals with cognitive impairment (dementia) is a nursing home. Two major reasons for institutionalization are to remove the patient from a potentially harmful situation and to relieve the family of the burden of care. However, research studies have shown little relation between burden and severity of symptoms. Critical factors which account for the differences in the experience of burden are how well the caregiver manages problem behavior, the level of support given to the caregiver, the relationship between the caregiver and the patient, and the quality of the prior relationship. Interventions to improve caregivers' skills in managing the patient and to  reduce stress and diminish burden may make home care a viable alternative to the nursing home. Interventions to lower burden include providing information about dementia and its effects on behavior, teaching a problem solving process for managing behavioral impairments, and identifying potential sources of support to relieve the primary caregiver. These interventions can be made through three treatment modalities: (1) one-to-one counseling; (2) family meetings; and (3) support groups. (Each of the intervention techniques and treatment modalities is described in the remainder of the text.) (BL)",

To evaluate other factorswhicn may influence conformity (gender, age, status of the conforming subject, and altruism in conforming), 150 adult pedestrians (45% female, 71% white) participated in a replication of Bickman's dime and parking meter study on a major street in Salt Lake City, Utah. Subjects were approached by one of three men representing different authority roles and statuses (no authority dressed as a blue collar worker; status authority dressed as a businessman; and role authority dressed as a fireman), and told to give the experimenter a dime for the parking meter. Data on type of conformity and  reasons for nonconformity were collected. An analysis of the results showed that conformity significantly increased as perceived authority increased. Female subjects were not significantly more altruisitc than male subjects. Older subjects (over 30 years) conformed significantly more than younger subjects in the role authority condition. No significant difference between subject status, as determined by apparel, and conformity was observed. Altruistic conformity was signficantly less as perceived authority increased, and nonconforming subjects were significantly less hostile as perceived authority increased. The latency between request and conformity decreased as perceived authority increased. (BL)",

        "description":"In research, the use of linear additive methods is expedient when prediction is the goal; however, when understanding is the goal, an exploration of non-linear multiplicative procedures is more appropriate. To compare the results of linear and non-linear models, data obtained from a survey of 35 bereaved mothers were compared using scattergrams, correlational analyses, analysis of variance, and factorial plots. Independent variables in the study included length of time since the death, the mother's level of education, her perception of family religiosity, and family stress. The dependent variable was maternal perception of family adaptation to the unexpected death of a child. Results showed that analysis based only upon correlation coefficents was misleading since this approach  did not account for the disordinal interactions indicated by the Anova. These findings suggest that research and theory on family adaptation to crisis, based only on additive linear information, could misdirect family practitioners and counselors. Researchers must be careful to define their goals, conduct exploratory data analyses, and use non-linear models when theory is not strong, in order to derive the most beneficial and \"true\" results from their data.

        "description":"Traditionally, school-based approaches to remediating deficits in social competence have focused on building aspects of temperament and character. The Socially Adept Verbalizations of Youth (SAVY) Curriculum, consisting of a series of exercises and activities, preceded by brief introductory lessons, was designed to develop social judgment skills in socially incompetent youths by decreasing egocentrism and by heightening their perspective-taking skills. To collect preliminary validation data on the curriculum, 17 adolescent students with behavior problems, who were attending an alternative inner city high school, were exposed to the SAVY curriculum as a 2-week module emphasizing social foresight, i.e., anticipating the consequences to oneself of various interpersonal actions. A  control group (N=15) participated in the regular mental health course without the SAVY curriculum. A teacher-rated, modified version of the Acting Out, Moodiness, and Learning (AML) checklist was used to assess effects of the curriculum on behavioral adjustment. An analysis of the results showed that the experimental group demonstrated significantly greater rated behavioral improvement than the control group. This finding suggests that social foresight training may be of potential benefit in school-based intervention programs aimed at adolescents with behavior problems. (Author/BL)",

        "description":"Recent research suggests that family attitudes may be significant determinants of relapse and hospital readmission among both schizophrenics and hospitalized depressives. To assess the incremental effectiveness of inpatient family intervention within the context of treatment for schizophrenic disorder and major affective disorder patients, a 6-month community follow-up assessment was conducted with 71 of 130 patients participating in such an intervention program. Patients, who were divided into three diagnostic groups (\"good\" prehospital functioning schizophrenic, \"poor\" prehospital functioning schizophrenic, and major affective disorder), were subsequently assigned to two treatment conditions (multimodal hospital treatment or mulitmodal hospital treatment with inpatient family  intervention--IFI). Patients and families assigned to IFI received a minimum of six family sessions focusing on communication, acceptance, and adaptation. The Global Assessment Scale and the Family Attitude Scale were administered to all participants at admission, discharge, and 6 months post-hospitalization. A preliminary analysis of the results showed a significantly better outcome for schizophrenic and major affective disorder patients treated with IFI than for those treated with the equivalent multimodal hospital treatment without IFI. A similar, though nonsignificant, trend was observed for patients in the other two diagnostic groups.

Discriminant function treatment of coded analysis of verbal and non-verbal behavior showed significant sex differences in both Israeli subjects and a comparison group of Americans. Two-way ANOVAS carried out with the variables which discriminated fathers' behavior to sons and daughters showed that, on the whole, Israeli fathers were close and collegial with their daughters, distant and uninvolved with their sons.

To examine ability attribution under conditions of ascending (improving), descending, and random patterns of performance on a typing task, 179 college students (69 males, 110 females) evaluated applicants for a typist position based on typing tests results. Ratings of the typist's ability, motivation, and expected future performance were also measured. An analysis of the results showed that fewer errors were associated with ascending as compared to descending performance, while the random performance pattern elicited the highest number of recalled and predicted errors. The ascending performer was rated as a better typist  and was seen as significantly more competent than either the descending or random performers. The ascending performer also scored significantly higher on the motivational attributions of concern about doing well, level of concentration, and motivation. Fatigue was perceived as a significant factor affecting the descending performer, while practice was perceived as a factor helping the ascending performer. No signficant main effects for sex of typist were found. These findings suggest the need for caution in generalizing about the primacy effect in ability attribution. (BL)",

To determine the opinions of teenage drivers about their traffic safety education (TSE) experience, the process of learning to drive, and the licensing of 16- and 17-year-olds, 10 percent of TSE students (N=1,070) were surveyed. Further data were collected on the use of safety belts, drinking and driving, restricted and probationary licensing, and parental involvement in the driving process. The results (response rate 62%) showed that the average age for both males and females receiving a driver's license is 16 years 5 months. The teenagers rated their traffic safety education course highly and strongly supported the continuation of the course. A vast majority of the teenagers  reported passing the driver licensing examination on the first attempt. They indicated transportation to social events and family errands as the major reasons for using the automobile, and reported a higher safety belt usage rate than the statewide rate for the same group who are involved in accidents. During the first 24 months of driving 25% had been involved in an accident and 28% had received a traffic citation. Twenty-three percent had driven after drinking alcohol, but only 2 percent reported receiving an alcohol related citation. Teenagers were split in their views on probationary licensing but did not support a restricted license. (BL)",

To assess family and community needs in Lewiston, Idaho, 150 randomly selected adults (50% male) were surveyed by telephone. The survey focused on residents' perceptions of alcoholism and drug abuse, interest in family-oriented prevention programs, and methods of improving programs to increase public interest and attendance. Results of the survey (81% response rate) showed that the majority of respondents saw alcoholism (66%) and drug abuse (67%) as serious problems among youths in their community. Most respondents (75%) viewed prevention as more important than treatment, and more than 90% of the respondents stated a need  for such prevention services in their community. Eighty percent of the respondents felt prevention responsibility rests with parents. Married individuals and those with children stated they would be more likely to attend proposed intervention programs, e.g., puppet shows, workshops, and presentations, and felt the probability of attending could be increased by offering child care and having community experts (doctors, lawyers, and ministers) present information. These findings support family-oriented approaches to prevention and illustrate how marketing techniques can improve service delivery. (BL)",

To investigate the behavioral and emotional antecedents and consequences of binge eating in women, 22 female college students (14 diagnosed bulimics, 8 binge eaters) completed self-monitoring forms for four binges. Subjects recorded the antecedents, behaviors, and consequences surrounding their eating episodes. An analysis of the results showed that the affective, cognitive, and behavioral antecedents and consequences of binge eating were similar for the bulimic and binge eater groups. Binge eating was often precipitated by food-oriented thoughts accompanied by an anxious or depressive affective state. Binges occurred in private and lasted about an  hour. Following binge eating, the women felt out of control and negatively about themselves (depressed, angry, or guilty). After eating, bulimic women attempted to counteract the effects of eating by exercising, vomiting, or taking laxatives, while women in the binge eater group tended to do nothing. The findings indicate that binge eating is surrounded by a number of emotional states in both bulimics and binge eaters, and suggest that treatment programs need to address personality variables as well as behavior in the treatment of bulimia and binge eating.

To examine the effect of causal attributions and subject gender on the use of stereotypes in evaluations and predictions, 180 college students (90 males, 90 females) were presented with one of three vignettes of a person behaving assertively. One version gave no attributional information while the others included a causal attribution which was internal and stable (IS) or external and unstable (EU). The gender of the actor in the descriptions was systematically varied. Subjects evaluated the actor's assertiveness, predicted the likelihood of future assertiveness, and estimated the percentage of males and females who were  assertive. An analysis of the results showed that subjects did hold the stereotype that men are more assertive than women, with female subjects believing the gender gap to be larger. The IS attribution condition produced significantly higher evaluation and prediction ratings than the EU attribution condition. The use of the stereotypes was eroded for evaluation, but when predicting future assertiveness, male subjects used the stereotype while female subjects did not. Future research should identity under what circumstances and in what settings gender will elicit differential attributions. (BL)",

        "description":"The Freudian view of psychopathology suggests that the individual is motivated to distort reality. In contrast, social-cognitive theory views the individual as a naive social scientist, who observes his behavior, others' behavior, and the social context. Out of these observations come meaning structures which organize, guide, and structure behavior in a particular domain. Reality is never viewed directly, but as a construction of the observer. Distortions in social judgment are honest attempts at understanding, rather than the result of deliberate manipulation to protect the individual from self-knowledge. Cognitive errors result from neglecting co-variation and accurate sampling, and through transference. Although these errors may be characteristic of psychopathology, the form  of many aspects of psychopathology may be quite general and may not serve motivational purposes. Developmentally, the social-cognitive view implies that adult distortion in judgment occurs as the result of sampling biases that lead to distorted ways of viewing social reality. Sampling errors may begin in childhood; children tend to base generalizations on irrelevant characteristics of exemplars and imagistic forms. Given that the vividness of information unduly influences social cognition, adolescence may be a crucial period for the development of pathology. The constructed world view of the child oftentimes is carried into adulthood, resistant to modification. (BL)",

        "description":"Each of the major approaches to psychotherapy (psychoanalytic, behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and humanistic) has dealt with the issue of why verbal, conscious activity seems to be impotent to control feelings and behavior. In these appraoches, thinking has been equated with conscious, verbal activity and feeling with nonconscious, nonverbal activity. However, recent debate has centered on the characteristics and location of both cognitive and feeling systems. One way to view the relation of feeling to thinking is to see these two as at least partially knowing systems. The verbal knowing system is linear, flexible, and slow in its responsiveness, while the feeling system is global and holistic, and fixed, rigid, and rapid in its responsiveness. Crucial to this interpretation  of the feeling system is the assumption that it processes meaning and that the conscious, verbally guided response sequences may get programmed into a nonconscious, affective level. Given these assumptions, two sources of pathologicl behavior may exist: rapid, consciously uncontrollable behavior; and articulated meanings. This perspective leads to a flexible view of psychotherapy in which articulation of meanings is needed. Articulation will lead to an integration of the two knowing systems through hypothesis testing, juxtaposition, and restructuring. (BL)",

Because the problem of family violence is multidimensional, no professional can be expected to meet the needs of every member of a violent family without assistance. To achieve and maintain the safety of family members and maximum intervention results requires a multidisciplinary and coordinated effort by professionals. Clinical practice with abusive families requires a non-judgmental approach and the establishment of a trusting, and possibly long-term relationship. In addition to negative attitudes on the part of professionals, a number of factors can impede  successful intervention, including problems of identification and age discrimination. Assessment for elder abuse involves both history taking and a physical examination. To do this effectively, the professional must be open, honest, nonjudgmental, supportive, and compassionate. The objective of interventions must be toward prevention, which can be defined in three stages: primary, to strengthen and enhance the individual; secondary prevention, which includes screening, identification, and treatment to decrease severity of impact; and tertiary prevention or rehabilitation. Research on elder abuse must move toward a systematic program to test and develop theories of family violence.

        "description":"From Erikson's (1968) psychosocial criteria of crisis and commitment, Marcia (1964) derived four ego identity statuses, i.e., achievement, moratorium, foreclosure, and diffusion. To explore antecedents of Erikson's ego identity construct, 130 college females completed a modified identity status interview, and questionnaires designed to elicit information about self-esteem, social desirability, and selected parent variables (e.g., acceptance, rejection, indulgence, approval). Hypotheses concerning the antecendent variables were derived from the theoretical formulations of Erikson (1968), Maslow (1970), and Coppersmith (1967). Analysis of results showed that only 2 of the 15 variables (paternal indulgence, and maternal nonenforcement of standards) failed to discriminate among  identity statuses. In addition, the identity statuses could be significantly discriminated along two different dimensions. The first dimension, which accounted for about 68 percent of the variance, set achievers and foreclosures apart from moratoriums and diffusions. The second dimension, which accounted for about 26 percent of the variance, set achievers and moratoriums apart from foreclosures and diffusions. Although the sample did not broadly represent the adolescent population, the results suggest that Maslow's motivational hierarchy may be useful in determining the processes which underlie identity outcomes. The results also relate to the debate concerning which statuses are more stable or adaptive for women within particular social milieus. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"Computer assisted career guidance (CACG) systems and other computer applications are becoming established components of counseling and guidance services. While technical details involved in software and hardware operations are usually attended to, problems resulting from interpersonal dynamics in the implementation process often contribute more to implementation difficulties than problems resulting from technological malfunction. This monograph presents an overview of computer applications in counseling, discusses typical problems associated with the implementation process, and describes the types of systems found in various settings. The interpersonal dynamics involved in organizational change are reviewed. Based on this discussion, a comprehensive model for implementing CACG  systems and other computer applications is presented. Phases involved in this model are described including planning; staff training; trial; and operation, evaluation and refinement. The monograph concludes with a discussion of future perspectives regarding computer technology. (Author/MCF)",

        "description":"To test three specific hypotheses about recall as a function of four categories of logical relations, a study was done to determine whether logical relations systems of prose analysis can be used to predict recall. Two descriptive passages of naturally occurring expository prose were used. Each text was parsed into 45 statements, consisting of predicate proposition and modifier units. The explicit and implicit relations between the statements were specified, and the relationships of statements were classified as conjunctive, disjunctive, implicative, or contrastive. Average reading seventh and ninth grade students and adults read both texts. They wrote their recall both immediately following the reading of each text and following a 1-week delay. Statement recall was used to test  out a probability model, and compared with predicted recall for each grade level and recall time. Data indicated that analysis of logical relations in a text for predicting recall of information provides a reasonable representation of recall of expository prose by adolescents and adults. Data also indicated that the system of logical relations provides a more adequate account of adults' recall than do other theory based systems, and in the absence of explicit, top-level globally cohesive information, the logical relations system provides a better presentation of adolescents' as well as adults' recall for expository prose.

        "description":"To determine the effects of repeated readings with cues on reading fluency and comprehension, a study was conducted on 30 third grade students reading at or above grade level, utilizing three equally difficult passages. Half the children were told to read for meaning, and the other half were cued to read for speed and accuracy. These cues were repeated before each reading, and the children were timed during the final reading of each passage, their errors were recorded, and their reading rate in words per minute was estimated for use as the measure of reading fluency in the data analysis. As the subjects recounted the stories, they were videotaped and the tapes later were analyzed to determine the proportion of propositions retold as a measure of comprehension. Data revealed that  (1) reading fluency increased 22% from one to three readings and 9% from three to seven readings independent of the attentional cue given, (2) fluency was greater among children cued to read rapidly and accurately regardless of the number of times the passage was read, (3) comprehension was greater among children cued for meaning, and (4) three to four readings would seem optimal in that the greatest gain in fluency and comprehension is achieved by then.

        "description":"In this paper addressed to graduate students in reading, the nature and problems associated with graduate student research are described. It is noted that the purpose of research is seen in different ways by those engaged in it. However, regardless of how a profession defines research, it must contain and reflect scholarship; any other research is vacuous and pretentious. There are four pathways to initiate graduate students into research functions: inquiry, observation, cooperative effort, and consistency. In addition, graduate students should not be satisfied with what they are told. They should explore, probe, and ask questions. By being resourceful and persistent, young faculty members and graduate students can find opportunities and sources of funding for research. Armed  with a well-founded idea, in part based on readings of the original research in the topic area, all that is required to pursue funding sources is organization, energy, and enthusiasm. To earn and deserve credibility, researchers must also produce well-written manuscripts within specified deadlines, and limit their efforts to two or three themes throughout their career. Obstacles to the researcher, such as poor training, lack of time, and inability to see problems or issues that warrant research can be overcome by independent study, time management, and further reading in the subject area. The researcher must acquire the convictions that only through research can truth come, and that truth emerges through the shared findings of many. Finally, conviction, faith, and patience will help shape  the quality of future reading research and instruction. (CRH)",

        "description":"A study examined whether environmental logos could be used as tools for beginning reading instruction. Logos are bold, colorfully adorned symbols featuring printed words in design formats that appear on products and advertisng signs. Subjects were 20 preschool children, half of whom were three and one-half years old, and the rest four and one-half years old. Half of each age group was randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. All were given pretests and posttests consisting of a book handling task, a logo identification inventory, a reading attitude interview, and word/sentence identification cards. The experimental groups were given reading instruction with logos approximately 20 minutes per week for eight weeks. Each received a personalized logo book, and during  each session a different logo was introduced and pasted in the children's books. The researcher also transcribed the children's dictated sentences about the new logos. The posttests indicated that the experimental three and one-half year olds improved in their book handling task, and could identify three to five more logos than on the pretest, while control group children could identify only one to two more logos. Children in the experimental four and one-half year group were able to identify six to eight more logos than during the pretest, and their reading attitude and print awareness were improved. Children in both age groups were able to recognize words or sentences during the posttest, indicating that the approach improved print awareness.

        "author":["Parrish, Berta",
          "Atwood, Karen"],
        "description":"With the rise in popularity of teen romantic fiction, many teachers wonder about the nature of such books and whether they should be used in the reading program. Most of the teen romantic fiction is written to a well-defined formula, based on guidelines from the publishers and on high-interest low-vocabulary literature. Characteristics with the most appeal for students include simple and direct story line, a lot of action and dialogue, and tight writing with short, simple sentences. Female central characters involved with slightly older, handsome, sensitive boys, in familiar teen settings such as school, beaches, or fast-food restaurants are also features specific to romance series. Advertising campaigns for these books are targeted specifically for teenage girls, which accounts  in part for their popularity. This popularity may also be a reaction to the so called &quot;problem novel,&quot; or due to a desire to feel good and self-confidant about boy-girl relationships. Teen romances have been criticized as sexist and stereotypical, but many librarians support them as one component of a well-balanced reading program, and a stepping stone to books with a romantic element but with greater literary value. Research on reading interests indicates that romances are widely read and in great numbers, by junior and senior high school students. Students who read teen romances, however, indicated that they also read other kinds of literature; the paper concludes that teachers may safely and enjoyably include them in their reading programs.

        "description":"A study investigated developmental changes in children's fluency in interpreting metaphors. Specifically, it examined the development of an implicit interpretation strategy found in adults of mapping relational structure from base to target. Ten subjects from each of three age groups--five to six years, nine to ten years, and college-age students--interpreted attribute, relation, and double metaphors. In attribute metaphors, the predicates shared by the base and target objects were object-attributes (both are round). In relation metaphors, the shared predicates were relations (both help people get well), while in double metaphors, both attributes and relations were shared. The major result of the study was that the relationality of the responses increased significantly with age,  while attributionality showed no age increase. The findings indicate a developmental increase in relational focusing; other aspects of the data suggest that this trend may be due in part to the accretion of knowledge.

Half the subjects were given a model paragraph from an Edgar Allen Poe story, without having the story identified for them, while the other half received only a verbal summary of the story, with the author and genre identified. All students were given a written summary of the paragraphs that followed the model paragraph. These summary paragraphs had been modified from the original in four characteristics (the long sentences in the original were shortened, the tense was changed, all subordination was removed, and the number of adjectival phrases was reduced). The students who had read the model paragraph were instructed  to rewrite the summary paragraphs so that they would seem to belong with the model text. The other students who did not see the text were instructed to rewrite the summaries to create a &quot;horrifying&quot; story. All students were given six phrases taken from the original Poe paragraphs that they were supposed to work into their compositions. Between the two groups there was no significant difference in the ability to create a horrifying story. There were also no significant differences between the groups in their use of three of the four modified characteristics: length of sentence, and use of subordination and adjectival phrases. Thus, except for tense, a model text did not help the students to write in the horror genre. (HTH)",

Four 100-word samples were chosen from each manual, according to four themes common to each manual and of particular importance to young adults: (1) driving under the influence of alcohol, (2) motorcycle safety, (3) the use of seatbelts, and (4) obtaining a learner's permit. Readability was calculated using the Fry, Flesch, and Raygor formulas. The readability analyses indicated that the manuals varied widely in reading level difficulty, with at least nine grade levels separating the easiest from the most difficult to read. In more than 60% of the states,  students would need to read at or above the tenth grade level. Beyond the scope of the readability formulas, there were other key differences from state to state that appeared to influence the difficulty of the manuals, including organization, tables of content and indexes, and use of headings and highlighting techniques.

        "description":"A study surveyed 64 teaching credential candidates in secondary school English, journalism, and reading at a large public university, to determine their motivation for entering the teaching profession. The study sought to confirm or refute the popular notion that students choose teaching because they cannot qualify for a \"better\" career. The responses were divided into two groups: those listing positive and those listing negative motives. The results indicated that 20% of the respondents did, in fact, admit to having motives for pursuing a teaching career consistent with negative stereotypes of teachers. These motives, however, were not statistically correlated with age, sex, or grade point average. The remaining 80% of respondents indicated that teaching was a long-standing,  preferred occupation choice. In addition, these respondents had grade point averages exceeding 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. The results refute the popular opinion that teachers are academically inferior and uncommitted. (The questionnaire and individual responses to the motivation question are included.) (HTH)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine how a reader identifies and represents the major topics in a text and their interrelationships. Subjects, 56 college students, read two texts one sentence at a time. Each text contained 12 paragraphs that discussed six attributes of two major topics. The paragraphs on one text were organized by attribute, while the topics of the other text were randomly organized. Reading times were recorded for the initial, topic-introducing sentences of each paragraph, and for matched, nontopic sentences. Results showed that reading times for topic sentences depended upon text organization, while reading times for nontopic sentences did not, and that topic sentences were read faster if the new topic was predictable as opposed to unpredictable from the  preceding text topics. The findings suggest that when readers encounter a new text topic, they integrate it into a representation of the topic structure of the text. (Author/FL)",

For descriptive writing, students can select and write about unsigned collages made by classmates. The writer can try to find a unifying theme that characterizes the artist's personality. A narrative component can be added to descriptive writing by dividing the class into three groups and by having each group work independently to create a setting, a cast of characters, and action. The three disjointed contributions can then be merged through chalkboard arbitration into a single dramatic scene. A third activity, which results in description, dialogue, and anecdote, involves an interview with a person whose one-line description the class has found most intriguing. Finally, to  introduce argument, students can be divided into three or four groups and assigned a common topic. A \"secretary\" can write down fellow class members' evidence in support and in refutation of the argument. Almost invariably, the resulting essays will be more sophisticated than they would have been without benefit of the authors' committee experience. (HTH)",

Programs designed to aid student invention, such as TOPOI, BURKE, and TAGAI, are described, as well as SEEN, along with examples of its application. The composition process is related to the neat appearance of words on the screen, and BEGINNINGS is described as a program that details compositional related approaches to writing. Shared  disks and textfiles, as well as the malleability of the screen text are identified as aids to revision, as are programs and textfiles that aid grammar and spelling study.

While Lee has been the subject of a full biography that included contemporary reaction to his ideas, there has been no similar work on how Bernays' ideas were received, though his ideas were in some ways more radical. He believed that propaganda was the modern instrument by which intelligent people could fight for productive ends and could help bring order out of chaos. He argued that public opinion was slow and reactionary, and that those who use the psychology of public persuasion to bring about changes in public opinion are performing a great public service. Initial reactions to Bernays' first book were enthusiastic, but by 1928 he was coming under heated criticism for his  forthright work \"Propaganda.\" By 1935 his techniques were being compared to those used by Nazis, but he weathered this period comparatively unscathed. During the 1940s, Bernays was noted as the most successful publicist in the country. He pioneered fellowships at United States universities for the study of public relations, and is now generally regarded as a man with a vision of authoritarian liberalism mixed with corporatism, and as a seminal thinker concerning the synthesis of a new Freudian perspective with the older practices of the publicists' trade.

        "description":"Basic writers are defined as those whose home dialects are least like standard English. Given that all dialects of English are capable of conveying complex thought, the question facing educators is, Should students be made to learn and work in standard English, or should they be given the opportunity to express themselves in their home dialect? Basic writers, unfamiliar with the genres of academic writing, write according to discourse forms with which they are familiar, such as soap operas or grammar school history lessons. The question of whether students should be required to learn conventional genres or allowed to work in ones with which they feel comfortable is answered by standard English advocates who say that the standard forms are necessary for college work and by  advocates of other forms who say that criteria for college success must change. In looking at academia as a language community in which language creates and organizes a world view, the clash between dialects becomes apparent. As basic writers learn the new world view, they become bicultural and are pressured into subsuming their less prestigious, less socially powerful world view in favor of the academic. (CRH)",

        "description":"Teachers should be making every effort to use approaches for teaching literature that encourage students to discover the meaning of a text for themselves, using the language of the text and without unnecessary teacher intervention. Therefore, rather than having the students be led by the teacher/interpreter through a work they encounter the first time, they should become actively engaged by knowing that they are going to have to explain their reading to others who have read the same text but may not have seen the same things. Starting with the so-called &quot;gut&quot; reaction, which contains many bits and pieces from which meaning can gradually emerge, students can be encouraged to keep journals to record their responses along general guidelines or question sets. Journal entries then can  be used to generate discussion in class or used in later essays as the nuclei of key ideas. After they become comfortable with the initial observations and reactions recorded in the journal, students should be encouraged to read a work closely and make observations about what they discover. Oral reading of both poetry and prose can show students that slow reading will help them learn and interpret the language of the text, and that personal observation will also help them range over the text in a nonlinear fashion. Such a process of making meaning takes time, but to enable students to uncover the possibility for enjoyment of reading and the importance of making meaning for themselves from their reading, is worth the risk and effort.

Specifically, the study investigated (1) the relationship between a market's newspaper circulation gap and the likelihood of appearance similarity between the two daily newspapers, (2) whether the circulation trailer tended to use more modern graphic devices than the circulation leader, (3) whether morning newspapers tended to be more traditional in their appearance than evening or all-day newspapers, and (4) whether a newspaper's total circulation is related to its use of modern graphic devices. Data revealed that pairs of competing  newspapers tended to be more similar in their use of graphic devices than those not in close competition, that newspaper trailers tended to use more modern graphics than leaders, and that larger circulation newspapers tended to use more traditional graphics than smaller circulation newspapers. The findings suggest that as competition increases, sameness in newspaper appearance increases. (Copies of scales used in the study are appended). (CRH)",

        "description":"A review of policy statements made in the past 10 years in Soviet academic journals and Communist Party newspapers indicates that integrating rural and urban populations has become a concern of academics, government officials, and policymakers in the Soviet Union. One means by which the rural segment of Soviet society could be pushed or helped onto the cultural, social, and economic plane of its urban counterpart is through the mass media, specifically, the newspapers. Many Soviet policymakers have concluded that mass media fare--centrally produced and distributed--is capable of &quot;powerful effect,&quot; and have begun calling for the use of such media products in the integration of the rural and urban populations. Such integration is a complex task, complicated by differing levels of  urbanization, income, literacy, migration patterns, and languages. Although the success of the Soviet government's attempt to unite its people remains inconclusive, it is clear from statements made by government officials and policymakers that the mass media are viewed as powerful agents or mobilizers of rural-urban integration.

All respondents were members of the American Society of Journalism School Administrators. Respondents ranked the importance of 33 activities specific to journalism research. The results indicated that respondents clearly considered some types of research more valuable than others. The types considered most valuable included writing a scholarly book, writing a refereed article for a national journal, and writing a textbook. The activities considered least valuable included editing a newsletter for a nonjournalism group, publishing a photograph in a local newspaper, and appearing on  a television program unrelated to a faculty member's teaching assignment. Many of the respondents said some activities were forms of teaching or service, not research. They expressed the greatest disagreement about the more professional or media related activities, such as working part time for a newspaper. Most preferred articles published in refereed, national journals rather than local or nonrefereed journals. They also preferred articles written by a single faculty member, articles related to a faculty member's teaching assignment, and research published in journals rather than presented as a convention paper.

Most of the students responding to the questionnaire were majoring in engineering, computer science, or business. Their six instructors had similar criteria for their papers, but used different grading methods. The four areas investigated were clarity of comments, transfer of comments to future papers, motivation or encouragement of students by comments, and the efficiency of time spent by teachers in responding. Results indicated that students found teacher comments unclear, sometimes unreadable, and containing the same type of writing errors for which they were penalized. Other findings showed  that 52% of the students found comments helpful in writing the next paper, that more critical responses were more motivating, and that (with regard to the efficiency of teacher response to student papers), protocols for student review of returned papers would more effectively determine the quality of review.

It was hypothesized that (1) editors and cartoonists would agree on the cartoonist's role, and (2) cartoonists and their editors would differ significantly in their view on several specific autonomy factors, such as quotas, freedom from editorial constraints, and decision making processes. As predicted, cartoonists' descriptions of their role agreed with the editors' descriptions of the cartoonists' role (i.e., as critic, artist, entertainer, reporter, etc.). However, there was a contrast between how cartoonists thought the editors perceived the role and how the editors in fact perceived it. The  cartoonists were more likely to use two different roles when describing their perceptions and their editors' perceptions, while the editors were more likely to use the same role to describe their own view and what they thought the cartoonist's view was. concerned the statement that cartoonists should be free from all editoral restraints. Most editors disagreed strongly. The two samples agreed that the cartoons published did reflect the paper's editorial policy. Both groups gave similar rankings to sources of ideas for cartoons, and both agreed on the importance of a quota in the production of good cartoons. More cartoonists believed, however, that the number of cartoons they were submitting was excessive, while none of the editors believed the quotas were excessive. (HTH)",

Teachers need to discover students' writing backgrounds, the anxieties, rules, and attitudes they bring to the classroom. In addition, research must be designed to inform composition teachers about the particular needs of college writers. Studies should be designed to include the context of the classroom itself. Closely related to the problem of research is the issue of designing curriculum. Too often curricula are shaped by the results of major studies, which have included neither the teacher who will use the material nor the students for whom it was designed. At the college  level many assumptions about writing development are based on teachers' acceptance of a totally untested theory of cognitive development. The best curriculum models seem to be those that allow students at all levels to try out a variety of forms of writing for a variety of audiences, including opportunity for experimentation and taking risks. Until research in college composition moves more toward context-based findings, teachers would do well not to lock students out of any mode of discourse for fear of limiting them. (HTH)",

After examining various emerging technologies for the delivery of video program services, the paper explores the dramatically improved technology for combining information from a variety of diverse sources to construct models of audience segments, which are then used for the delivery of specially tailored promotional or persuasive messages. It contends that  privacy law, as well as regulations agreed to as part of cable franchise agreements are inadequate because of their limited scope. It argues also that while the increase in public concern with privacy is positive, the tendency to limit privacy protections to &quot;individually identifiable information&quot; ignores trends in the media environment where individuals are targeted as members of purposely constructed groups or segments. The paper concludes that democracy itself is threatened by a further dislocation of access, redress, and individual control from the local political community. (Author/FL)",

Development of such a model also requires recognizing that (1) a relationship exists between reading and writing in the revision process, (2) strategies are based on a set of heuristics in the revision process, (3) revision is part of the recursive nature of the composing process, and (4) a relationship exists between revision and the writer's knowledge and familiarity with the subject, audience, and style. Revision behaviors need to be analyzed from the viewpoint of the reader, and those behaviors that occur during the rehearsal or prewriting stage must also be considered. In  a study of the revision processes of four professional writers, conducted within these parameters, the writers indicated that revisions are centered on the goals of communicating a specific message to a specific audience as effectively as possible. Although they differed in the stages during which they engaged in various revisions, all admitted spending a great deal of time during the rehearsal period to consider and revise their decisions concerning voice, point of view, style, and organization. Eleven functions observed in the case studies appeared to provide a comprehensive as well as descriminating means for describing the revision process.

Results showed that: the expert editors did not correct all errors in the tasks, even with feedback on error locus; they did not distinguish between matters of correctness and matters of style and taste and judgment; they did not operate entirely by a set of conventional rules for editing; and, proportionally, they were no better than were the novices in correcting errors in their own writing.

        "description":"It was the evangelical Christian publicists in the tract and Bible societies who first dreamed of genuinely mass media--that is, they proposed to deliver the same printed message to everyone in America. To this end, organizations such as the American Bible Society and the American Tract Society helped to develop, in the very earliest stages, the modern printing and distribution techniques associated with the reading revolution in the nineteenth century. Their successes were not as extravagant as their dreams, but by 1830--long before the success of the penny press, or the dime novel, or the cheap magazine--in some sections of the country, they had nearly achieved their goal of delivering their message to everyone. It was the will to print, not the way to print, that first led  American evangelicals into the business of mass media. Eventually this will drove the organizers of the Bible and tract societies to adopt better ways to reach the best end. One step was to seek and to promote new printing technology that would be more efficient for mass publication: stereotyping, stem-powered printing, and machine papermaking. Another step was to put aside denominational differences to build a genuine national organization for systematic distribution. A third step was to raise money. For both the American Tract Society and the American Bible Society, the period 1829-1831 was the time of realization that the creation of mass media was possible in America. Many secular associations would eventually adopt the printing, distribution, and organizational methods of these two  societies. One of the first was the American Anti-Slavery Society, whose experience with mass media in the 1830s suggests that the pioneering work of the Bible and tract societies had far reaching implications.

        "description":"The so-called \"cultivation hypothesis\" proposes that television content comprises an organic whole of interrelated themes and symbols not necessarily congruent with the real world. However, findings of a primary study have indicated that television news has enough baseline credibility to have a significant impact on fear of crime among citizens. Therefore, a study was undertaken to (1) replicate the television news attention findings of the primary study within an urban metropolitan area sample, (2) expand the scope of dependent variables to include citizen orientations toward self-protection and crime prevention, (3) determine whether findings similar to television news are obtainable for newspaper crime content, and (4) utilize a panel survey design to investigate directions of  causality between crime news attention and crime prevention orientations. Overall, data revealed that individuals who pay greater attention to televised news about crime are more fearful of crime and are more concerned about protecting themselves. Data also indicated that persons already concerned and knowledgeable were more likely to read newspaper reports and were more confident about protecting themselves. Finally, data revealed no correlation between overall television viewing or viewing of crime dramas and people's fear and perceptions of crime and its extent, or their attitudes toward self-protection.

        "description":"To examine colonial American press coverage of the British court decision to free American slave James Somerset, a study was conducted to clarify why the decision worked as a victory for British abolitionists but was usually cited even in post-Revolution America in the passage of increasingly oppressive slave legislation. Twenty-three of the thirty-two regularly publishing newspapers of 1772 were selected for survey. The extent of coverage was ascertained by determining the number of insertions each paper devoted to the story during the trial period and by counting the total number of words given to the story in these insertions. Because of the colonial editors' tradition of transcribing verbatim British press accounts, completeness of coverage was determined in large part by  word count. On a colony by colony basis, it was found that readers in the areas surveyed could be as well informed as readers of most British papers. For example, the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot; provided only 42 words on the story, while its rival, &quot;The Massachusetts Gazette and Boston News-Letter,&quot; devoted some 2,700 words to it, including trial coverage and opinion papers. Since the patriotic press saw its duty as inflaming rather than informing the public, the findings suggest that coverage of the Somerset trial manipulated colonial fear of racial equality as a way of providing yet another reason colonists should seek separation from Great Britain.

        "description":"To analyze and compare specific oral communication behaviors of primary school pupils who score high on reading and language tests with those who score low, a study was conducted on approximatley 200 students who were classified as (1) high language, (2) high reading, (3) low language, or (4) low reading according to their scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills. Twelve students were then randomly selected from each of the four groups and videotaped interacting with a teacher and two other subjects of the study. Three trained observers separately viewed the videotapes and recorded the subjects' communication behavior using the Rieke Communication Model as the recording form. Data revealed that pupils who scored high on language and reading tests did not as a group  exhibit significantly more nonverbal communications, vocalizations, or the use of words, phrases and sentences when compared to students who scored low on the same tests. In addition, it was shown that they did not initiate communications or respond more frequently in class, or ask significantly more questions. Directions for further research are suggested. In the meantime, the implications of this study suggest that teachers should make use of instructional materials that foster interaction and questioning techniques by their students, and deliberately use questions that elicit high level responses.

Participants were four infants and their parents, who came to a laboratory for one-half hour every 2 weeks from the child's fifth and one-half month until the ninth month. Cognitive tasks for auditory memory, for causality, and for ends/means relationship were administered during each session. Free interaction was videotaped for 12 to 15 minutes. Results showed that three of the infants inhibited parent vocalization for 4 to 10 seconds after their own vocalization, from the age of seven and one-half months to nine months. Parents decreased mean utterances to 7  seconds or less by the infants' ninth month. There was no apparent direction of relationship between interactive speech and some types of causal thought. Although interactive speech changed between five and one-half and nine months toward increased infant influence and, at the same time, causal thought accomplishments also increased, there was no clear direction indicated for the relationship between interactive speech and causal thought.

        "description":"From the perspective of organizational behavior, mentoring received little attention until the mid 1970s. Since that time, the topic has been praised, criticized, analyzed, and in some organizations formally endorsed. A survey of 1,200 leading corporate executives found that two thirds of those surveyed had a mentor, that the number of these relationships is growing, and that those who have had them earn more money at a younger age and are happier with their career progress than those who have not had mentors. (A mentor is someone who takes a protege and teaches him or her the basic job, shows how to cope with an environment and encourages progress through it, and acts as a model for career or adult behavior.) This relationship exists on a one-to-one basis between a more  experienced person and an inexperienced person, usually a half generation apart in age. Proteges can often attract a mentor by modeling themselves after the chosen person, talking to that person, and displaying knowledge and initiative. Mentors who wish to attract proteges usually set high examples in terms of productivity, excellence, and concern for people, in addition to having wide knowledge of the organization and industry. Mentors are helpful to women in business because they provide access to information channels that are unavailable except through grapevine-type sources. However, formalized mentor programs do not generate the warmth and spontaneity of informal relationships, and they create discord among other employees because of perceived favoritism. (CRH)",

The study attempted to determine why, at that meeting, the committee's consensus process of decision making failed. W.R. Bion's theory of unconscious group motives was also used to supplement the analysis and provided a basis for concluding that the committee was motivated by the unconscious desire to fight or flee from its responsibilities. It was only after the committee had reflected upon its actions--a move brought about because one member publicly questioned its motives--that it was able to reach a &quot;true&quot; consensus. The findings imply that the process of group discussion is perhaps the most significant factor that  should be considered when either evaluating or intervening in labor-management committee decision making. Moreover, structures within labor-management programs that establish and maintain an &quot;ideal speech situation&quot; during committee meetings are necessary to ensure consensus decisions. (FL)",

        "description":"Although social science has contributed much to the student of schools, the perspectives of earlier thinkers about school effectiveness can fill some of our present need, too, by emphasizing the social values most important and then applying them as educational standards. Former generations viewed good schools normatively rather than empirically (that is, rather than using test scores as evidence of outcomes). Educators should not abandon normative principles simply because of the existence of standarized test scores. Instead of giving up on applying contemporary school effectiveness research, those interested in improving educational quality should be aware of the limitations of the research--not applying it too broadly or simplistically. Effective schools should be defined as  educational settings for teachers as well as students, stimulating teachers to learn as they teach. The Schenley High School Teacher Center in Pittsburgh may be a step in that direction: a school that emphasizes teacher education much as a teaching hospital emphasizes medical education. (JW)",

The program, providing training for teachers and principals in administrative and instructional skills, is examined for outcomes in two schools, both with lower socioeconomic students. Data were collected on students' time on task, teachers' instructional interactions, and classroom management, and on general organizational climate and demography. Analyses focus on four major areas: (1) engaged-time rates in classrooms, (2) student achievement, (3) teacher implementation of the Instructional Skills program, and (4) correlations among the above three areas. Nine of the 14  teachers studied improved or maintained their instructional skills after returning to the classroom from the Instructional Skills program. Students in all but one classroom were more attentive during posttest than during pretest visits. Further, achievement scores show that the lowest and highest performing students made progress after implementation of the staff development program. For math, but not for reading, the program improved student engaged time and achievement. (JW)",

Catholic elementary enrollment in 1965-66 was 89 percent of the private school enrollment, but by 1978-79 the figure had declined to 66 percent. State-by-state and regional estimates of Catholic elementary school operating revenues and expenses are shown with the caveat that the value of the contributed services of religious community members or clergy is generally not recorded. Despite fewer students and schools, higher salaries and other costs led to the national per pupil cost in 1982-83 of $782, a 19.8 percent increase over 1980-81. Nationally, sources of revenue  for Catholic schools are 46 percent from parish subsidies, 43 percent from tuition, and the remaining 11 percent from fundraising activities. In 1970-71, about 72 percent of the Catholic schools charged less than $100; by 1983-84, only 29 percent charged less than $300. Other figures show that an increasing percentage of Catholic elementary schools have less than 300 pupils; nationally, about half were in the 21-18 pupils-per-teacher range, and 22 percent had less than 21 pupils per teacher.

Developing effective job descriptions and interviewing techniques, though essential, can be supplemented with assessment center observations, in which administrator candidates are observed in model job situations for several days and rated according to the important skills needed by successful principals. Academic leadership training institutes, such as those at Harvard, the University of Oregon, and Butler University, also provide workshops to improve administrators' instructional leadership skills. Finally,  superintendents and school boards can identify and prepare future principals in five steps designed to support a district's commitment to administrative excellence. (JW)",

The Educational Priorities Panel (EPP) therefore proposes a $50.7 million increase in the education budget of the City Council and the Board of Estimate, to be directed toward the following priorities: (1) restore PEG cut supplanting federal Chapter 1 funds ($13.7 million); (2) increase funding for high schools, contingent on per capita formula ($15.0 million); (3) provide additional support services for middle schools ($5.0 million); (4) provide additional funding for school repairs ($13.0 million); (5) increase funding for school opening fees ($4.0 million). Executive budget service increases endorsed by EPP include reduction of  first-grade class size, repairs for school buildings, full funding for special education, and a school health program. These recommendations are discussed in detail, accompanied by illustrative tables and charts. The overall goal of the EPP's budget position is to rebuild a school system better than the one substantially dismantled a decade ago. An appendix presents recommendations to improve special education. (TE)",

        "description":"Although policymakers have recently tended to call for longer school days or years, such reforms might be ineffective or counterproductive if they fail to take into account the interactions between time and other determinants of learning, including the role of the student in allocating time. Research has shown that the amount of learning is a function of capacity, effort, time, and quality of resources. Since effort is a variable determined by the student, means must be found to increase it by developing motivators either intrinsic or extrinsic to the curriculum. Extrinsic motivators, which seem to be losing their appeal to students, include rewards provided by parents, school and society; expectations of economic success; and fear of economic failure. Extrinsic motivators are  difficult to manipulate. Cost analysis indicates that investing in upgrading the quality of teaching resources would cost less than increasing school hours and student workloads and would enhance learning. Furthermore, no good evidence suggests that adding days to the school year improves performance; even so, many states are making such additions. More research is needed before sweeping reforms can be justified. (FWR)",

        "description":"Research extending back into the 1890's reveals that the quality of classroom instruction depends not upon differing curricula, for example, but rather upon the attitudes and actions of teachers. Instructional effectiveness is especially important for independent schools, yet availability as well as quality of candidates has dropped markedly. Nonetheless, independent school trustees can attract quality teachers if they shift their focus of concern to issues of school climate and instructor motivation. Such a task encompasses a comprehension of the task of teaching, classroom life, positive trustee attitudes and policies, and a supportiive climate. In the first place, trustees should realize that teachers face obstacles ranging from finding it difficult to evaluate their own  effectiveness and thus generally feeling uncertain about their roles, to lacking the necessary time and support for analyzing just what they are doing, and thus remaining oblivious to needs for change. Taken together, such factors are detrimental to classroom life. Yet incentives related to job satisfaction--recognition for teaching excellence, for instance--can lead to an improved learning environment and increased achievement among students. It is this incentive/satisfaction concern that trustees must address if they want to retain and attract high-quality faculty. (KS)",

This paper explores those organizations' prospects, particularly the voluntary, administrator-directed \"principals' center,\" and borrows its analytical framework from theories of group formation. The Principals' Center in New Orleans, Louisiana evolved from an interest in Roland Barth's informal learning program for Boston principals. The Center brings in outside \"major\" speakers or workshop leaders twice yearly and organizes smaller programs during the year. Although the New Orleans structure used the Harvard Center as its model, it differs in the fund-raising area, relying on businesses, foundations, and school districts, whereas Harvard is funded by the  Graduate School of Education. Harvard's initial planning was also determined by university personnel, as opposed to New Orleans' board of principals. As interest groups, principals' centers require financial bases and membership groups, both complex issues. Incentives to elicit contributions are important, as is proof of successful training of members. Unlike Harvard, New Orleans is weak in material and solidary incentives, and must basically rely on purposive incentives grounded in forward-reaching curricula and a philosophy of mutual support.

This study furthers research examining adjustment from the individual, organizational, and individual/job match perspectives by investigating adjustment patterns for 113 satisfied and dissatisfied elementary principals surrounding Chicago, as well as career/adjustment and employee position/adjustment differences. A preliminary analysis has identified two variables involving adjustment responses related to the principal's dual role as office subordinate and school superordinate: career mobility (specifically, variety of movement as an objective indicator) and work satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Additionally, a  correlation can be drawn between background and adjustment differences; 28 percent of \"movers\" remained in their first principalship, for instance. \"Movers\" and \"stayers\" also differ in terms of their teaching experiences as well as in their adjustment to the dual role. Satisfied stayers tend to adjust to that role without battle, while movers adjust by viewing themselves as protectors of school interests. Balancing autonomy and control is another role factor, with dissatisfied principals perceiving that they have insufficient autonomy over teachers. A final role factor involves social group support.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility, validity, and reliability of using the quasi-ethnographic field technique of the structured interview to determine the critical personal and professional competencies needed by a sample of 50 Northeast Florida public school administrators. The researchers trained 50 graduate students to conduct interviews with 50 practicing administrators and code the continuing educational needs. The data collected provided a true representation of the educational needs of  those surveyed; reduced generic conceptual areas into smaller, more critical training topics; provided valid and reliable data; were consistent with the national concerns of educators; and provided a list of specific skill needs of individuals and subgroups within the sample population. The researchers concluded that the structured interview technique offers a feasible, more accurate needs assessment determination process than the formal survey, has the unique byproduct of motivating administrators to more readily participate in inservice activities, and is a practical alternative for small and medium size school systems.

Yet problems like competency shortages and outmoded curricula remain. When schools were basically \"socializers\" (1885-1957), praise outstripped criticism--until 1957's Sputnik. In response, Congress initiated the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), passed the National Defense Education Act, and the National Science Foundation granted graduate scholarships by the thousands. By the sixties confidence in schools was again high. Meanwhile critics like Goodman and Holt began to use words like \"stifling,\" and a new reaction was underway. Open classrooms in open-designed buildings replaced interest in traditional cognitive skills. The result was an outcry  from back-to-basics proponents. At the same time integration of minorities was slow, while private schools multiplied. Finally, city school enrollment plummeted as urban areas became largely black, lower-class, and more violence-prone. Frightened teachers of all races left the profession. Such factors may be viewed in two ways: Large metropolitan school districts face closure by 1999. Inner cities go first and the incoming poor create the same problems for suburban and rural districts that caused inner-city collapse. Conversely, education leaders begin now to fight for schools' revitalization by implementing survival conditions ranging from equitable resource allocations to system-renewal strategies, and illiteracy vanishes by 1999.

That study found that elementary schools correspond to the rational bureaucratic image, whereas secondary schools are more loosely coupled systems. The study was limited by a small sample. In this paper the research was extended to a larger sample of schools and utilized a more extensive analytic approach. Again the finding was that high schools fall into organizational structures of the loose coupling type, and elementary schools tend to group into organizational structures of rational bureaucracies. There is evidence that it is easier to implement change in schools with relatively tight organizational structures. This suggests a basic dilemma for reform of high  schools. Major reforms may require basic changes in structural arrangements, staffing, and service mix. Unless major changes are made, it seems unlikely that substantial reform will be accomplished.

Other fault-tree symbols represent input or output types or failure-oriented events, and are classified by their nature. The circle, for instance, points to a failure event in which further development is not required. In constructing the tree, decision-makers should develop each failure event so that cause and effect relationships can be identified, and thus recommendations leading to better communications  or resource allocations made.

        "description":"Based on recent school effectiveness literature, this paper suggests local policies to stimulate and facilitate school reform. After discussing the goals of the effective schools movement and briefly reviewing the literature, it presents a two-phase model for school improvement projects, based on the premise that a school's culture primarily determines its effectiveness. This model uses relatively simple organizational adjustments to stimulate more organic changes; participative decision-making is recommended to effect these changes. Accordingly, the authors propose that planning proceed from the school level upward, and they offer four general policy recommendations. Subsequent passages discuss the respective roles of the school and the district in a reform program; the  applicability of school effectiveness research to secondary schools; the roles of teachers' unions and middle management and of the school board and the superintendent; individual school goals; evaluation methods; and staff development programs. The paper concludes with some observations on school improvement theory and on &quot;institutionalizing&quot; or &quot;routinizing&quot; reforms. (MCG)",

Few teaching strategies have been studied in different types of environments, so validated knowledge on teacher effectiveness exists for only a few issues. Research findings discussed include: the amount of learning by pupils is related to exposure to content; teachers maximizing pupil learning allocate more classroom time to academic activities; learning is maximized when pupils move briskly through curriculum and experience consistent success; learning is greater where pupils are taught and supervised by teachers rather than working on their own; greater learning is associated with frequent presentation of materials and  practice and application of what is learned; pupil morale and achievement are higher in relaxed, supportive classrooms; and teacher beliefs about students correlate with pupil achievement. The relationship between research on teaching and policy is complex and indirect--the authors define the differences between the cultures of research and policymaking and stress the importance of including teacher effectiveness research findings and concepts in teacher training. They discuss the value of self-study for teachers, the problems of teacher evaluation and merit pay, and areas needing future research, and conclude with a discussion on innovations and improvement.

Concern for higher educational quality produces concern for standards. The risks involved in setting standards include inhibiting the most effective schools while ineffective schools continue to fail. Nine commandments presented as guidance for policymakers working to achieve stronger educational outcomes without crippling effective schools are: (1) recognize the school as the key organizational unit in public education; (2)  establish standards emphasizing broad goals and desired outcomes; (3) encourage school differences except for core standards; (4) develop school leadership with strong principals, and remove weak ones; (5) make selection and deployment of staff a school-level responsibility; (6) treat teachers as individuals who must function collegially; (7) give a good deal of budgetary authority to individual schools; (8) allow flexibility in teaching, learning, and internal organization at each school; and (9) regard school improvement as a dynamic and cyclical process taking place over a long period.

        "description":"This paper focuses on ways in which one state policy for improving education--standard-setting through testing mechanisms--affects the classroom teacher-learner relationship. That uniform policy-making is problematic is clear from observations of 43 Mid-Atlantic school district teachers. Responding to three types of standards, 45 percent found minimum competency testing objectionable because a single measure cannot allow for student, resource, and goal differences. Likewise, standardized testing for decision-making about students was typically viewed as curriculum narrowing. The strongest reaction stemmed from competency-based approaches to teaching and learning that require test-passing for each discrete skill before moving on. Teachers generally found it difficult to adapt  standard policies to the disparate needs of students, though many recognized the usefulness of a common educational direction. The need for dual accountability--to students and administration--is a problem that could be partially rectified through ensuring competency among teachers. Nonetheless, teachers familiar with the competency-based teacher certification idea recently advanced by policy-makers again tended to oppose it: like teaching itself, learning to teach is a complex activity requiring behaviors varying from student to student, an attitude research confirms. Paper and pencil competency tests were also viewed skeptically; 60 percent of teachers opposed tests for recertification. In sum, policymakers must realize the collective impact of such policies since they may make teaching  less attractive and thus work against themselves. (KS)",

Experience shows that successful measures incorporate lessons gained from the growth years of the 1970's. New teaching practices, for example, can be transferred from site to site; schools can use to their advantage past efforts of distant colleagues. At the same time, schools require the help of decentralized networks in implementing improvement proposals and maintaining normal operations during financially tight periods. Additionally, small incentive grants to schools and teachers can have an impact far exceeding their cost. Proper staff development is still another important reform category; substantial guidance is provided by past research on educational  change. In sum, such activities are not meant to replace more comprehensive strategies, but they do represent an essential link in the educational reform chain. (KS)",

The second section proposes that states and school districts facilitate principals effectiveness by (1) giving principals a greater role in educational improvement programs; (2) selecting principals according to precise and explicit competencies while recognizing the symbolic importance of selection, using behavioral measures derived  from such programs as internships and assessment centers, and matching principals to schools; (3) providing more relevant preservice and inservice training; and (4) improving school districts' organization and management by articulating districtwide goals while preserving school autonomy, and by developing comprehensive evaluation systems.

Features of these external governance and support systems are reflected in the school systems; one example cited is the parallel differentiation of spheres of authority in the regulatory and support agencies and of program domains within districts and schools (e.g., compensatory, vocational, and special education). Despite the complex and pervasive influence of these external forces, local decision-makers can work productively with outside agencies, requirements, and resources in the following ways:  (1) develop strategies for what they wish to accomplish and how external systems can help; (2) match outside resources to the nature of the planned improvement and to the internal resources available; (3) make sure that external resources and demands result in advancing (or not impeding) school improvement; and (4) attend to advantages and disadvantages of segmenting school improvement efforts. As a postscript, state and federal options for reducing the disadvantages of program differentiation are discussed. (TE)",

Although school systems are now using a number of organizational tools that lift standardized test scores (for instance, broad instructional goals are being clarified and classroom teaching matched to goals), schools are not finding effectiveness programs cost-free as implementation expenses and continuing programs impose substantial costs. Issues of hiring, training, evaluating, and increasing staff awareness capture the personnel policy tasks. Districts must choose administrative fiat or school-generated initiatives to implement new strategies.  Boards must, in any case, consider the issues of requiring compliance with policy, the shape of inservice training, and the incentives and sanctions available to administrators. Although research stresses the role of administrators as instructional leaders, their leadership roles must be clarified for each district's situation. Boards and administrators must also be aware that pushes for effectiveness may have unanticipated consequences: in increased curriculum uniformity, narrowing of school focus, and staff conflicts.

As liberal and vocational education vie for dominance, so foreign languages and geography may lay claim to being essential studies. The issues of school prayer, evolution, humanistic values, and sex education raise the question of whose values are to be taught in the schools of a pluralistic society; and in dealing with problems unique to schools,  how shall we deal with individual differences among students and cultures? How shall teachers be selected, educated, and rewarded?

        "description":"This survey is the fifth in a series conducted to gather information about attitudinal barriers to parent involvement and to examine their implications for teacher training. In six states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas), school superintendents, school board presidents, and state agency officials were asked about their attitudes toward parent involvement and the extent of parent activities in their schools. Respondents indicated positive feelings about having parents involved in traditional roles which support schools, but were less favorable toward having parents in co-learner roles, and negative toward parents being involved as partners in making school decisions. These views corresponded to data collected from teachers, principals, and  teacher educators, but contrasted with responses of parents, who reported interest in being involved in decisions even though opportunities were almost non-existent. The report includes responses of three groups of policymakers, and, with the information collected in previous surveys, has been used to describe current attitudes and practices and to make recommendations about training teachers to work with parents.

        "description":"Although parental involvement can be important for improving schools, very few parents are involved. This paper explores attitudinal barriers to such involvement from the perspectives of 1,200 superintendents, 664 school board presidents, and 30 state agency officials in six states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas), compares results with surveys of teacher educators, parents, principals, and teachers; and synthesizes findings into recommendations for developing training guidelines for teacher-parent cooperation. Subjects were given six-part questionnaires, dealing with items ranging from agreement or disagreement with statements about parent involvement to policy involvement statements and demographic items. Results suggest administrators' and  board presidents' responses are very similar to those of teachers and principals. The former support the general idea of parental involvement, indicate moderately strong support for involving parents in traditional school roles, but have considerably less support for power-sharing roles. Results also stress the wide variance in involvement interpretation. Eight recommendations for training elementary teachers and three for improving parent involvement conclude the report. (KS)",

In brief, there appears to have been substantial reductions in the size of SEA evaluation unit staffs. While the majority of studies continue to be conducted inhouse rather than contracted out to external consultants, far fewer evaluations are being performed. Although the variability across units in terms of size of staff and number of evaluations conducted seems to be decreasing, the individual units still respond to a diverse set of multiple responsibilities, from consultation to evaluation monitoring to policy analysis. These units would like assistance in providing  better services through improved database maintenance, study design, and problem formation. In addition, they continue to cope with the perennial problems of insufficient funds and lack of trained staff. (Author)",

State statutes continue to be the primary source of the law concerning RIF, so a table is provided for these statutes and their various provisions. These statutes include the dismissla-type, and the less numerous layoff-type, with provisions for recall or restoration. The most common statutory reasons for RIF are enrollment decline, followed by fiscal or budgetary constraints, reorganization or consolidation of school districts, reduction in the number of teaching positions, curricular changes, and the catchall provision, \"other good or just cause.\" Nonstatutory reasons for RIF may be included in collective bargaining agreements. Courts  have made clear, however, that they will not tolerate school boards' use of RIF as a fictitious pretext for discharging a teacher on other grounds. Once a bona fide reason for RIF is established, the next decision is the proper order of RIF. Criteria in various statutes include tenure status, seniority, and other formulae such as seniority-plus-merit. Limits on these criteria include realignment clauses, sex balance, and affirmative action. Other issues discussed include due process requirements for RIF and recall rights. The chapter concludes with nine summary generalizations about the legal status of RIF. (TE)",

        "description":"This study developed a systematic approach for examining effects of policy decisions on student outcomes and assessed collective bargaining's impact on public school effectiveness and cost. Teacher unions' influence was gauged by modelling the educational process and examining responses of teachers, students, and administrators to the education and bargaining environment. Data from over 200 districts indicate that unions alter the way schools are run. Unionized teachers teach smaller classes, rely more on traditional instruction, and spend slightly less time in instruction, but more time preparing. Nonetheless, the overall quality of education as measured by scores on standardized tests is about the same in union and nonunion districts. Bargaining does appear to reduce  achievement gains slightly for atypical students because specialized instructors or modes of instruction are more common in nonunion districts. Bargaining also increases the cost of providing a given quantity and quality of education by about 15 percent. (Author/KS)",

Using data for students and teachers from over 300 districts nationwide, the analysis identified factors that differ significantly between smaller and larger schools. There are fewer differences among student and community background characteristics than among factors over which policymakers have greater control--teacher and principal characteristics, school climate, and types of school personnel per student. The effect of these differences on student achievement is not large going from a small school to a moderately sized school, but very substantial going from moderate-size to large schools; in the latter case the  difference is more than a quarter of the average gain in annual student achievement. This negative association between large schools and student achievement calls for additional investigation, especially since some large school characteristics are susceptible to policy or administrative manipulation.

A job's motivating potential is thus linked to five core characteristics that affect three psychological states essential to internal work motivation and positive work--outcomes--an idea valuable to educators concerned with human resources management. This paper examines the applicability of the theory to school teaching, an occupation very different from those originally considered, and hence requiring the revision of the Hackman-Oldham instruments as outlined in section B. The section also analyzes the scales for measuring job characteristics. A  third section traces results of instrument administrations to 198 Oregon teachers, considers distributions and inter-item reliabilities, and discusses sensitivity of revised measures, subjectivity of measures, and relationships with organizational commitment.

The types of miscommunication prevalent in recent United States education-related forecasting are discussed; four specific publications are cited. Preoccupation with internal trends is the most prevalent type of miscommunication found in these  publications, and next is the ignoring of normative issues. Other significant problems include an overemphasis on prediction, tempocentrism, and factors internal to education while ignoring significant external issues.

        "description":"Several years of research support a differentiated system of supervision in which teachers can choose from among four different supervision styles. With the clinical style, intense observation and feedback is conducted by a trained supervisor. Cooperative professional development consists of small teams of peers working together for their mutual growth. With self-directed development, the individual teacher assumes primary responsibility for his or her own growth. Administrative monitoring is a process by which the administrator conducts brief drop-in visits and conferences. Although research indicates that the differentiated system is feasible and has a positive effect on those who participate, it will not be effective in all schools or with all teachers. An implementation  process that has been found to be generally effective is presented, but each school is encouraged to develop its own version of the system, after teachers, supervisors, and administrators have had an opportunity to discuss ideas and their own needs.

        "description":"This report examines the extent of policy bargaining, as well as factors that might explain variation in its extent. Results of interviews in 6 districts with over 15,000 enrollment indicate that bargaining is more extensive than predicted in the curriculum, student placement, and teacher selection areas. States without the teacher strike option also have more bargaining, but no relationship was found between policy bargaining and union affiliation. Status quo provisions that freeze working conditions for a contract's life are also extensively bargained. Additionally, most sample contracts contain grievance procedures that affect policy by mandating how provisions will be enforced. Bargaining agreements reflect a sensitivity to the emerging policy issue of education of the  handicapped, which means that special education teachers' interests influence bargaining agendas. Between 1975 and 1981, significant increases in bargaining over noncompensation provisions occurred, indicating that such bargaining had not peaked by 1975. Educational policy bargaining may reduce school district adaptability because of the fixed nature of the contract. Bargaining may also be related to student achievement because it regulates key variables related to school effectiveness. (Author/KS)",

        "description":"To illustrate possible dangers of \"exit\" as a teacher option, questions about labor relations and work role perceptions were given to teachers from three California districts. The canonical correlation technique measures teacher role perceptions against organizational conditions and labor relations beliefs. A figure shows three variates: organizationally engaged teachers; teachers who are organizational isolates; and frustrated teachers who, like the isolates, believe individual responsibility more important than organizational loyalty. Further, categorical variables reveal that younger teachers are associated more with the third variate, and that the first variate is associated more with female teachers. Teacher-work perceptions markedly differ in relation to four ideal-type  work structures--labor, craft, professional, and art. For example, third variate teachers are best described as frustrated artists. First-variate teachers are more accepting of criticism, whereas second-variate teachers define their work as autonomous and embody the \"exit\" rather than \"voice\" response in reaction to organizational stress. Variate-three teachers feel independent in their work but have a less firm sense of vocation than variate-two teachers. That self-defining and frustrated teachers tend toward \"exit\" has serious consequences for teacher unionism's future, since variate-one teachers represent the dominant \"voice\" in the school but lack the willingness to define and defend their occupation.

This paper analyzes the Tucson (Arizona) Unified School District's conversion of a centrally organized Chapter 1 project to the school level. A section describing the process notes that the planning cycle began with the annual Chapter 1 needs assessment process, assigned in 1982 to school principals at their own sites. During the next year, principals participated in a Chapter 1 development program offering them greater expertise in requirements previous to the needs assessment planning cycle.  Decentralization outcomes, problems, and possibilities are outlined in an eight-part discussion of changing guidelines, cost effectiveness, Chapter 1 and district services coordination, implementation factors, technical assistance, school proposals, program monitoring, and gains evaluation. Findings show that principals are enthusiastic about Chapter 1's new freedoms. (KS)",

The philosophy of independent living is reviewed and its attributes of community responsiveness, provision of support services and advocacy, and leadership of disabled persons in program design and management are considered. The origins of the independent living/disability rights movement is traced from the 1960's up to current policy conflicts over the federalization of independent living under the rehabilitation system. Crises facing the independent living movement are examined, dealing with funding and funding development, leadership development and direction, organizational  development and management, service delivery and community needs, and public relations, education, and community support. A final chapter offers recommendations for addressing five major needs: support and technical assistance in operations and management, development of strategies for networking and communications, leadership development and training, research and policy development in independent living, and long-term planning.

The review is written from developmental and measurement bases and covers materials published by the SOI Institute, workshop materials from districts using SOI materials, and professional research literature. It is concluded that the SOI promotional literature promises far more than it has delivered and that severe psychometric limitations seriously limit the SOI model's usefulness. Limitations center on the lack of reliable assignment of test items to SOI categories,  unreliable difference scores, and the lack of adequate validity evidence for differential treatment effects.

        "description":"The evaluation of 45 recent bachelor's degree graduates of non special education teacher preparation programs employed questionnaire and interview measures of both teachers and their respective building principals. Teachers were asked to evaluate their pre-service training program in preparing them to teach in mainstreamed classrooms, their own competence in teaching handicapped pupils and their current role in the special education process. Principals independently assessed their teacher's competence, described their view of the teacher's role in the education of the exceptional child and provided suggestions as to what pre-service training should include. Both teachers and principals agreed that there should be greater interaction between prospective teachers and exceptional  children during training, particularly through participation in IEP (individualized education program) conferences. Self-ratings of teacher competence were positively correlated with amount of exposure to handicapped children during training. Principal ratings of their teacher's competence validated teacher self-ratings in all categories except that of contributing to IEP conferences. Description of current roles of teachers revealed that principals did not expect their teachers to take an active part in the instruction of exceptional children, relying instead on the special education teacher to administer the IEP. Teachers reported little involvement in the planning, conduct and administration of programs for handicapped learners, other than initial referral. This discrepancy between  actual role and expectation of teacher training programs was greatest for secondary level teachers. (Author)",

The areas reviewed include those state policies which clarify education agencies' responsibilities, and those which increase the resources available for related services by securing other state agencies' cooperation. The volume also examines local policies which (1) obtain resources from other human service agencies, (2) pool resources to increase the availability of services, and (3) seek to develop new programs for specific population groups such as emotionally disturbed students. Examples are given of policy implementation including state or local actions in the following localities: Michigan;  Washington; California; Connecticut; Maine; Anne Arundel County, Maryland; Upper Peninsula in Michigan; Capitol Area Region, Maine; Weld County, Colorado; Independence, Missouri; and Montgomery County, Maryland. Unresolved issues concerned with related services are identified including the limits (if any) to the responsibilities of education agencies, how education agencies can meet their financial obligations to provide related services, and how to share resources with local agencies to provide related services.

Instruction was provided to handicapped students with mixed etiologies (mentally retarded, deaf-blind, deaf-retarded, emotionally disturbed, autistic) and a comparison group of nonhandicapped 4 to 6 year olds in five areas: rhythm, melody, keyboard, ensemble, and harmony. Although handicapped Ss did not achieve the same magnitude of results as the comparison group, it was concluded that the handicapped population could learn many of the music skills. To determine if the children were using the taught music skills at home, a  questionnaire to measure generalization was administered. Although generalization results could not be tied to the times when the child entered instruction, 33% of the students for whom questionnaires were completed showed good transfer to other settings. Appended material includes the curriculum used in the study, an assessment tool, a music questionnaire, and multiple baseline plots for each subset of the curriculum. (CL)",

Thirty-six normal and 36 LD Ss (8-11 years old) were asked to remember consonant trigams using one of three encoding strategies (study, vocalization, and elaboration). Findings revealed that, overall, LD Ss recalled significantly fewer consonants than normal Ss. There were no significant differences in recall among encoding strategies. LD Ss also exhibited a significantly faster rate of forgetting and lower asymptotic level of recall. Contrary to expectations, LD Ss were at least actively involved in maintaining the information. Speculations are  offered for the reason for LD Ss' slower rate of processing and greater interference. Educational implications, including training acquisition and retrieval strategies that can be quickly executed, are noted. (CL)",

Program outcomes were measured via examination of the student records, interviews, and recollections of special education practitioners. In chapter 1, an overview of the project is presented. A summary of findings revealed that students with less serious handicaps were more likely to complete secondary training than were those with more serious handicaps; the secondary special education program appeared effective in helping the majority of students to function in the regular high school environment, and the effects of program intervention did not seem to  be uniform across categories of handicap or for students from different backgrounds. Findings supported the need for data-based decisionmaking. A second chapter describes in detail the research methodology and the final dispositon of the students. Chapter 3 examines three aspect of secondary program operation: level of intervention of program staff in students' academic programs, extent to which a student's history in special education influences the current level of functioning, and the effects of a district's discipline policies on the academic programs of handicapped children. The final chapter offers a causal model of special education services designed to evaluate program operations by examining the interrelationships of program variables. (CL)",

Students and their peers, teachers and aides were observed with a behavior observation instrument designed to monitor the frequency of 14 target behaviors, the direction of the interaction (i.e., given to or received from), and the status of the party involved in the interaction (i.e., peer, teacher, aide). The results indicated that BD and LD students emitted significantly more negative statements to teachers than did regular education students. Teachers of BD students emitted significantly more neutral statements  to their students than did LD and regular teachers but the three groups of teachers did not differ in positive and negative statements directed to students. The three groups of peers and BD and LD aides did not differ in positive, negative, and neutral statements emitted with the exception that LD aides emitted more positive statements to their students than BD aides. A correlational analysis indicated that peer-student negative interactions were reciprocal. Neither positive nor negative teacher-student interactions nor positive peer-student interactions were reciprocal. First-order conditional probabilities (i.e., the probability of a statement being followed by a selected response) indicated that BD, LD, and regular students responded to others in a similar manner. Likewise, the three  groups of teachers were similar in their responses to students. In all groups, positive, negative, and neutral statements were most likely to be followed by the absence of a response or a neutral response. (Author/CL)",

Data revealed that teacher non-sponsors viewed activities as more formidable and inaccessible for handicapped youth than teachers working in activities. Level of experience and expertise in special education had no effect on teacher views. Nonparticipating students indicated that did not join activities because membership was unimportant  to them and activities were not relevant to their interests. Black and Mexican American Ss indicated a stronger desire to participate in school activities as compared to White Ss. Nearly all of the nonparticipants, including handicapped Ss, indicated that handicapping condition was not an important determinant of participation. Agreeing that interpersonal relations and personal growth were the most important benefits of participation, participants did not appear to differ in their outlook toward school activities by sex, ethnicity, or handicapping condition. Further, minority handicapped students did not differ markedly from adolescents in general relative to the importance of factors affecting participation. (Author/CL)",

Volume I details the design and results of the interview study focusing on Ss in five age groups: preschoolers, primary grade Ss, junior high school Ss, high school Ss, and adults. Among results were that there was a clear association between patterns of expressed awareness of handicap and age; there was no evidence of a relationship between sex and handicap awareness; a majority of confusions between handicaps involved mental retardation; patterns in explanation of causes varied with age; young children appeared to believe in immunity to  handicaps; the percentages of Ss expressing realistic views of the curability of each handicap generally increased with age; Ss' understanding of adaptation appeared to begin as concrete and practical, becoming abstract and experiential with age; with age, Ss became more apt to mention phenomenological aspects of handicaps when asked what it would be like to be handicapped; and half the adolescents and nearly three-fourths of the adults expressed one or more nagative statements toward people with handicaps. Volume II reports results of systematic observation of handicapped and nonhandicapped Ss in mainstreamed preschools. Analysis of observation reports and teacher interviews were performed to determine which behaviors consistently differentiated handicapped from nonhandicapped Ss.  Results revealed very few behaviors that were consistently associated with only one group of Ss across both preschools and all observation periods. In general, mildly handicapped Ss tended to behave more like their nonhandicapped classmates than did severely disabled Ss. Positive effects of socializing for both handicapped and nonhandicapped Ss were revealed, as were negative effects of the summer break on social behavior of handicapped Ss.

An initial chapter focuses on the socio-political context of the IEP, noting the lack of research on how the IEP is implemented in the classroom. Chapter 2 presents an alternative conceptualization of individualization which emphasizes the previously neglected interrelationships of teachers and students. In chapter 3, the research plan is detailed, including a rationale for selection of a naturalistic methodology. Separate chapters focus upon data collection, analysis, and results for the contractual plan, the phenomenological plan, and the empirical plan. Findings are interpreted to  demonstrate the comprehensive nature of IEPs and the interaction of written plan, teacher intent, and child behavior. Twelve appendixes include examples of IEPs designed for the preschool student in the study, a subject appropriateness scale, criteria for external review of IEPs, sample letters of consent, the contractual and phenomenological plans, and rules for matching agendas to objectives.

The first thrust of AIM was to help each student develop functional skills within specific community target sites, to decrease maladaptive behaviors that interfered with community acceptance, and to increase adaptive behavior skills. The second major project activity was the community integration component which included a high school teacher assistant program and supervised field placements in the extended community. High school students were trained to work with and record behavior of autistic Ss. A summary of project  accomplishments provides details of activities for each of six objectives (development of the integration curriculum, the high school training program, and the transition assessment instrument; community involvement; dissemination and replication; and project continuation). Extensive appendixes include the table of contents for the high school training manual and a flow chart for vocational training of severely handicapped adolescents. (CL)",

        "description":"The observational study investigated the process of mainstreaming 32 learning handicapped children (grades 4-5) into regular education programs. Ss were enrolled in special day classes and mainstreamed for approximately one hour per day. Systematic observations focused on the handicapped student, nonhandicapped students, and the regular class teacher. Additional data were obtained from teacher questionnaires and interviews with students and teachers. Findings suggested that certain instructional practices are related to student academic involvement, student social interactions, and student attitudes toward the class. The types of instructional practices associated with student academic involvement reflected a direct teaching method in which the teacher presented information,  questioned students, and provided supportive feedback. Handicapped students reported more positive attitudes toward the class when they were more academically involved in the instructional tasks of the classroom. Mainstreaming programs that facilitated students' academic involvement and social integration on the school playground were identified. It was also concluded that the effectiveness of a mainstreaming program can be facilitated when principals provided specific kinds of administrative support. Regular education teachers were able to incorporate the handicapped student into the class instruction without decreasing the amount of time spent in academic instruction, for when the handicapped student was in the regular education classroom, the teacher and low achieving students spent  more time in academic tasks than when the handicapped student was not in the room. Contrary to teacher expectation research indicating that teachers shun the lower achieving students and spend more time with higher achieving students, the teachers in this sample interacted more often with the handicapped student than with high and medium achieving students.

The studies, carried out over a 3-year period, were intended to examine evidence on the efficacy of mainstreaming, with particular emphasis on the role of competitive, cooperative, and individualistic learning experiences on friendship, interpersonal attraction, performance, achievement, and relationships between handicapped and nonhandicapped students. The studies point out the value of the cooperative learning approach in securing active participation of handicapped students, generalizing positive relationships to free time situations, promoting achievement and self-esteem of handicapped Ss, and promoting the ability of nonhandicapped students to  take the perspective of their handicapped peers. The cooperative approach is said to be easily developed and implemented and to result in benefits for both handicapped and nonhandicapped students.

        "description":"According to traditional measures, the productivity of the American worker has declined. If education's contribution to economic productivity is to be imprortant in this decade, the measures need better definition. Technology has affected our perception of how much education is required to keep pace with growth. Those who believe there is a shortage of job-specific skills want more vocational education in the schools; others, who see vocational education as a way of narrowing student competencies and lowering expectations, stress that schools' first priority should be the teaching of a core of skills. In the 1980's there has been an increase of workers holding jobs for which they are overeducated. Gains in educational equity have not produced economic equity, making the problem a  concern of the workplace, not the classroom. It is evident that productivity increases as workers participate in decision-making at work. It is also becoming more apparent that the most productive workers may be those with broad educational backgrounds, yet math and science skills have declined and foreign language and international studies have been neglected. The skills needed for the evolving information society call for general training in addition to job-specific training. The challenge to educators is to meet the current needs through evaluation of the type of curriculum that best prepares students for the range of tasks the future will require. Most important in concentrating on individual productivity is maintaining a sense of balance in educational programs between job-specific  training and general training. (MD)",

Five remedies, designed to meet children's psychological needs in desegregated schools, are first defined and then analyzed for specific interventions appropriate at the school or classroom level. Self-esteem may be improved by seven interventions, including reducing social comparisons and interpersonal competition among students. Achievement motivation may be enhanced through such means as offering attainable but challenging goals to students, while coping skills are aided by stressing students' strengths. Vocational aspirations and social skills are also necessary in school settings and are developed by  interventions such as ascertaining students' interests and encouraging cooperation. From a list of 6 kinds of desirable school integration practices and 13 school climate characteristics, a 9-step improvement process for school integration--provided in an appendix--also helps put classroom interventions in larger perspective.

        "description":"An examination of literature in the field of staff development reveals five models of inservice for principals. The traditional model involves enrolling in courses at colleges and universities. Institutes are short-term specific learning experiences. Competency-based training identifies knowledge and skills needed and focuses on influencing programs. The inservice academy is similar to the traditional model, but an agency provides classes. In networks, individuals from differennt schools and districts link together to share information. Evaluation of these models reveals that adults learn best in situations where they are connected to the process. The Principals' In-Service Program, developed with support of the Institute for Development of Educational Activities, builds on the  positive features of the five models. Piloted in 1978-79, it focuses on the needs of local schools and principals. The structure is a collegial support group of 6-10 principals working together with a trained facilitator on long- and short-term problems with a defined agenda. Participants are committed to a full day once a month for 2 years. The group allows principals responsibility for their own learning and development. No implication is meant for superiority of any one of these models. The principals' role is important, and effective inservice education must be a priority for the 1980's. (MD)",

        "description":"In an effort to describe parent-teacher conferences and assess their influence on the curriculum, three researchers interviewed children, parents, teachers, and the principal of a midwestern elementary school and observed various school and Parent Teacher Association functions. High school and elementary school parents were mailed a survey. Research focused on how to describe parent-teacher conferences, parents' beliefs about conferences and what they learned, and children's views of conferences. Parent-teacher conferences were described as discussions of the students' attitudes and academic and social performance in school. Parents believed that they were to work in a partnership with teachers to help students and received information on their children's problem areas. Children  reported that they were helped by the conferences, most often by their parents' advice and assistance with schoolwork. The evidence suggests that the major purpose and function of the conference is to help students conform to standardized school requirements. Communication flows from teacher to parent to student, but parents' comments to the teachers have little influence on the curriculum. Conferences are trivialized by class size and time limitations. Parents willingly attend conferences in the early school years but stop attending conferences as children advance in school. Because the effectiveness of parent-teacher conferences is limited by the parents' understanding of the discussion and communication of it to their children, teacher-student conferences might also be warranted.

        "description":"In the context of large-scale primary and secondary school innovation projects in Belgium and the Netherlands, this paper examines the adaptation and construction of a version of the SoC-Questionnaire (SoC-Q) for Teachers. The SoC-Q was adapted from the Concerns-Based Adoption Model designed to identify teachers' concerns about an innovation. The paper also presents findings, discusses the use of questionnaires in large-scale projects, and describes ongoing research. Factor analysis of the questionnaire provides several subscales: awareness, personal/informational, consequences for pupils, management, collaboration, and refocusing based on experiences with pupils. These subscales provide a basis for comparing the findings of the original and adapted SoC-Q's. Teacher profiles  derived from this questionnaire illustrate how these data are used within the framework of large-scale projects and allow the formulation of some general conclusions concerning innovation implementation. The study assumes such projects are influenced by five characteristics: the innovation itself, innovation policy, school organization, interventions/strategies, and teachers. These characteristics are used to develop semistructured interviews analyzed in conjunction with SoC-Q's. Five tables focus on the SoC-Q. Nine figures provide data on the development of teachers' concerns during innovations and implementation factors. Three appendixes provide an overview of the subscales, followup data, and an analysis of a first interview. (PB)",

An analysis of the sociopolitical context in which scholarly models, research paradigms, and systems for running schools were created is followed by a review of this scholarship, which concludes that no consensus exists on the best method of handling or studying behavior problems. A section inquiring whether schools have improved synthesizes literature on the level of concern of various groups responding to behavior problems, changes in student behavior, changes in educators, and changes in schools. The conclusion is that improvements in students' and  educators' behaviors have not been demonstrated, but changes in school organization include formalization of disciplinary codes, the growth of alternative schools, the introduction of material dealing with student behavior into the curriculum, the development of alternatives to suspension, and increased community involvment. A discussion of future prospects anticipates the impact of teacher shortages and declining resources in the 1980's. Conclusions are summarized, and policy makers are urged to assess school environments systematically, to make schoolwide plans for improvement, to offer more comprehensive staff development programs, and to integrate various models, paradigms, and systems.

The characteristics of better schools listed are: 1) clear sense of purpose, (2) well-formulated instructional goals, (3) orderly environment, (4) a team approach with shared objectives, (5) high pupil expectations, and (6) effective instructional leadership. It is emphasized that effective schools have effective principals. In identifying these characteristics, Michael Cohen of the National Institute of Education is quoted extensively. The author delineates additional skills and knowledge that principals need but that are not taught in education classes.  He recommends that effective principals must, first, understand school effectiveness research; second, be able to evaluate and improve instructional programs; third, have a knowledge of organizational behavior; and fourth, understand the nature and theory of leadership. The author additionally points to skills in supervising, evaluating and giving feedback to teachers, effectively communicating, using incentives and rewards, and viewing the school as a continuing cycle of diagnosis and assessment. It is concluded that the school is a dynamic institution that changes and grows, and effective principals determine that growth potential. (MD)",

Other project attributes discussed include program size (68 RCTC's in 1978; 2,000 SSM villages in 1977), funding sources (RCTC funds are raised locally; local contributions and foreign philanthropic organizations support the SSM), and curriculum (both projects respond to local needs). A comparison of the projects shows that while  both were founded to help the rural poor, RCTC's were begun by foreigners and are both capitalistic and decentralized. The SSM, however, is much larger in size and budget. It is voluntary, socialistic, moralistic, spiritualistic, and was founded by people indigenous to Sri Lanka.

To investigate the possibility that neither of these strategies necessarily has this effect, a survey was undertaken of 53 school districts that had experienced declining enrollment over a 10-year period beginning in 1970-71. Following data collection by means of closed-ended questionnaires called checklists, a least-squares regression analysis was conducted of all variables, including community opposition, planning comprehensiveness, consultant involvement, teacher involvement, and community involvement. Results, as revealed in three statistical tables, indicate that, contrary to what might  have been expected, comprehensive planning may actually increase rather than decrease opposition in conditions of decline where less systematic, shorter term planning might be more effective. Similarly, although increased participation generally leads to less opposition, in times of retrenchment only teacher involvement tends to decrease resistance. Under such conditions, the increased involvement of outside consultants and the community at large may have no impact on efforts to reduce opposition. (JBM)",

        "description":"Although educational leaders have been coping with declining enrollment for almost a decade, educational researchers have begun to focus on the topic only recently. The first part of this introduction to a special issue of the Peabody Journal of Education briefly summarizes the contents of the subsequent essays, which are intended to bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners. The introduction's second part provides a conceptual framework for the essays, discussing the problem of adjusting to declining enrollment as one of determining not only what actions to take, but also how to make unpleasant decisions. The first aspect of the problem, that of \"substantive retrenchment policies,\" concerns revenue-generating policies, cost-cutting policies, and degrees of political  divisiveness likely to result from such policies. The second dimension of the problem, that of \"process retrenchment policies,\" involves the management tasks of planning for and obtaining acceptance of a board's decisions, including policies that vary in being of a technical or political nature and in being divisive to differing degrees. Educational leaders' decisions in times of enrollment decline must be based on both efficiency (making cuts for the benefit of the organization as a whole) and equity (distributing cuts across the entire organization).

        "description":"The first part of this paper discusses the events leading up to the federal district court's May 18, 1980 decision in &quot;Kelley et al. vs. Metropolitan County Board of Education of Nashville.&quot; The decision rejected a Nashville-Davidson County, Tennessee, school board's rezoning plan and called for an end to busing in grades 1 through 4 and a return to neighborhood schools. The events described, covering the history of Nashville's desegregation efforts from 1955 to 1980, are divided into five stages: (1) 1955 to 1971: minimal efforts to comply with Brown vs. Board of Education; (2) 1971 to 1976: the comprehensive remedy--busing; (3) 1976 to 1979: plaintiffs oppose inequities; (4) 1979 to February 1980: the board's response--more busing; and (5) March 1980 to May 1980: legally  approved resegregation. Following a review of each of these periods, the paper discusses Nashville's projected return to neighborhood schools as a consequence of three factors: the perceived failure of the 1971 desegregation plan, the perceived high social, educational, and financial costs of transportation in a declining economic environment, and the apparent decrease in support for busing among black leaders. The paper concludes by discussing possible implications of the court's decision and its July 27, 1982 overturning by the Sixth Circuit Court. (JBM)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on the organizational consequences of retrenchment policies emphasizing efficiency (selective cuts to insure long-term survival) and equity (across the board actions). The effectiveness of each of these policies was tested on 59 cases of school district enrollment decline over a 10-year period by means of a questionnaire/checklist and followup interview. Dependent variables considered were per pupil expenditures, teacher-administrator equity (change in ratio of teachers to administrators over time), and pupil-teacher ratio. Independent variables included two substantive retrenchment policies--reduction in force (RIF) rate and consolidation rate (speed with which districts closed schools)--and two process retrenchment policies--superintendent selection and use  of a consultant. Environmental variables were limited to community type and decline rate. Regression analysis of hypotheses constructed using all variables tends to support the efficiency model of educational policymakers. Results further indicate that the use of consultants in urban situations has a significant effect on teacher-administrator equity and that outside successors are consistently more effective than superintendents drawn from within the organization. The fact that RIF and school consolidation emerged as of little organizational consequence suggests that educational policymakers in times of crisis deal with issues as they come up, like firefighters.

        "description":"As studies of organizational development have focused increasingly in recent years on stages of decline and death, theories of revolutionary adaptation have gained currency. The theory of organizational retrenchment developed in this paper is divided into five chronological stages: (1) preresponse, (2) emerging awareness and buying time, (3) alarm and relatively safe responses, (4) crisis and confrontation, and (5) postcrisis equilibrium. Hypotheses developed from these five stages were tested through case studies of declining enrollment in 53 school districts over a 10-year period. A questionnaire/checklist and followup interview examined 15 variables divided into 3 categories: organizational structure, including such variables as pupil-teacher ratio and per-pupil expenditures;  pattern of relationship, including board-superintendent conflict and superintendent succession; and strategic responses, such as hiring freezes and school closings. Results of five statistical tests of collected data reveal (1) relatively abrupt change over the phase of decline, (2) a rigidifying tendency in organizational structure and the pattern of relationships, (3) relatively late utilization of strategic responses to declining enrollment, and (4) a tendency toward revolutionary adaptation to decline. Such findings indicate that educational organizations should anticipate that each new threat will bring an initial period of relative rigidity, followed by a period of revolutionary change. (JBM)",

        "description":"Using enrollment decline cases for data, the case survey method analyzes the content of case studies, thus allowing data from various cases to be aggregated and researchers to overcome constraints on data collection. The analyst uses six steps in this method in reviewing the case literature: (1) definition of the unit of analysis, (2) identification of case search strategy and case sources, (3) actual case search and selection, (4) checklist development, (5) checklist application to the cases, and (6) data analysis and interpretation. For enrollment decline, the unit of analysis chosen was that of case literature written between 1971 and 1980; the identification of case studies involved 10 sources, including journals, dissertations, and research suggested by scholarly  organizations. Seventy representative cases were chosen and a checklist of 227 variables was prepared for application to the cases. Conventional statistical techniques were then used to determine the relationships between variables of interest to the researchers, including questions about the relationship of enrollment decline and school closings and the impact of declines on per-pupil costs. Although refinement is needed to ensure validity, adequate data, representative samples, and consistent application of checklists, the case survey method can successfully integrate fragmentary case studies and combine qualitative and quantitative methods of research.

        "description":"Previous literature investigating community protests of school closings may be divided into four perspectives emphasizing (1) lack of comprehensive planning, (2) lack of participative decision-making, (3) loss of community maintenance (or sense of community), and (4) contextual factors, such as district size and type. The present study examines the validity of these explanations by means of a case study survey of declining enrollment in 65 school districts over a 10-year period. After data collection by means of a questionnaire/checklist, community opposition tactics were analyzed according to severity, from writing letters to board members to voting down referenda or budgets. Ordinary least squares regressions of the four types of variables--planning, participation, community  maintenance, and context--reveal that (1) comprehensive planning tends to exacerbate rather than reduce community opposition; (2) of the various participation variables, only teacher involvement reduces opposition; (3) the only community maintenance factor increasing opposition is the lack of superintendent-board compatibility; and (4) urban districts experience greater opposition than do suburban or rural districts. Taken together, the findings suggest that orthodox principles in times of growth, such as comprehensive planning and participative decision-making, may be ineffectual or counterproductive during decline.

        "description":"As a study in the presentation of a public policy issue in education, the argumentative rationales of 139 opinion pieces (editorials, op-ed pieces, and letters to the editor) in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on the issue of school busing were analyzed. Material from the years 1971-75 was located through &quot;The New York Times Index&quot; and classified according to four bases of argumentation: politics, legality, fairness, and efficacy (whether busing furthered desegregation). For all format types, the most frequently used argument was based on politics (41 percent), with that based on efficacy second (26 percent), and those on law or fairness last (16.5 percent each). Distribution of arguments shifted with public climate, however; political reasoning predominated during the 1972 elections and  legality and fairness during nonelection years. The pro-busing position dominated the argument--reflecting &quot;The Times&quot; editorial position--with 75 percent pro and 25 percent con for all opinions. The letters section was the only format type to have more pieces opposed to busing than in favor (56 percent opposed), reflecting the newspaper's policy of choosing letters contrary to editorial positions. The major appeal of the editorials was to political reasoning but that of the letters was to the efficacy and results of busing. The study shows that the opinion pieces reflected already-formed opinions on the issue and that the presentation was propagandistic, with political views dominating the editorials and few neutral letters appearing.

Chapter 1 discusses microcomputers, centrally located \"mainframe\" computers, and speech synthesizers. Educational courseware described includes such programs as drill and practice, simulation, tutorial, and problem-solving. Chapter 2 explains the two most significant applications of computers in schools: computer-assisted instruction (CAI) programs, which provide students a one-to-one learning environment, immediate attention, and  feedback geared to abilities; and computer-managed instruction (CMI) programs, which enable teachers to monitor students' progress, diagnose problems, prescribe remedies, produce reports, and analyze curriculum effectiveness. The contributions of CAI and CMI to individualized instruction are also noted. Useful practical information for bringing computers into the classroom is considered in the next chapter, including implementation of computer literacy programs to overcome \"computerphobia,\" evaluating and purchasing hardware and software, and integrating computers into the existing curriculum. Case studies from Illinois, Florida, Texas, and California are presented in the final chapter. (PB)",

National and statewide professional eduational associations, institutions, and agencies nominated innovative and effective schools for the studies. Five studies focused on hypothesis testing of a priori theory utilizing rationalistic, quantitative approaches; eight studies utilized naturalistic, qualitative techniques, including interviews, observations, and record analysis by multiple researchers. All data were gathered on site. Results show that principals,  the key educational leaders within schools, achieve positive outcomes by balancing structural/facilitative and supportive/participative behavior. Analysis shows that the content of the issue to be decided determines who is involved and to what extent, before, during, and after a decision is made. Seven change phases reveal the interaction of leadership, decision-making, and change: germination, initiation, evaluation, implementation, routinization, refinement, and renewal. Although oversimplified, these phases describe the interrelationships of leaders and staff in implementing planned educational change for school effectiveness. (PB)",

The principal's legal status, including a definition of authority and employment rights, is discussed. The author delineates the principal's responsibilities for student welfare as follows: enforcing attendance law, identifying neglect and abuse, guarding children's health and safety, regulating access to student records, and placing students in appropriate educational programs. Asserting a principal's authority to discipline, the author differentiates between student First Amendment rights and negative rights (freedom from discrimination, right to due process, right to privacy of school records, and certain  protections of the Fourth Amendment). Since many student rights have been established by federal court decisions and are in a state of flux, principals are advised to learn the areas in which legal difficulties are likely to arise and seek direction in those areas. The author covers the fairness of school rules and methods of enforcement, legal consideration of the duties a principal has as a supervisor, school financing, and duties involved in maintaining school property and supervising school transportation systems. In describing the principal's liability the author lists the statutes and penalties involved in North Carolina law. (MD)",

In confirming school boards' commitment to school improvement, this workshop also points out the boards' roles in governance, the relevant research on school effectiveness, the importance of formulating and implementing instructional goals, and the relationship between collective bargaining and school boards' advocacy for excellence. The manual consists of six sections: an introduction; three sections on planning, presentation, and evaluation; a selection of resource materials; and a booklet for workshop participants. The presentation section includes sequential  descriptions of workshop activities, leader focuses for each activity, and instructions for conducting those activities. The evaluation section advises participants on what aspects of the workshop to evaluate and provides an evaluation form. The resource materials provided include: selections from a National School Boards Association report on instructional improvement; excerpts from Washington State statutes regarding school board responsibility for instruction; a report presenting the instructional goals of Clover Park School District (Tacoma, WA); a paper on the characteristics of school effectiveness; and masters from which transparencies for projection at workshops can be reproduced.

        "description":"Using a sample of responses to questionnaires mailed to schools in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas, a study was made of student activity programs to locate the available and most effective programs, and to develop appropriate criteria for evaluating programs. It was found that the most available activities were student council (100 percent of the 102 responding schools), music organizations (99 percent), and interscholastic athletics (98 percent); intramural athletics were least available (48.5 percent). Participation by students, however, varied widely, from 10 percent to 75 percent of students in a school. The primary administration of programs varied among school administrators, student leaders, and faculty sponsors, but student interest was the major factor in  creating new programs. Financial support was found to come mostly from money-raising projects, though athletics were funded mostly from appropriated monies. Only 28.7 percent of reporting schools had any type of formal evaluation of activity programs, raising the question of relative weight of such evaluative criteria as student opinions (ranked first by responding schools), educational goals, or cost. Respondents identified getting students involved, recruiting sponsors, scheduling activities, and budgeting as the four biggest problems in activity programs. The findings are incorporated into a seven-point model for organizing activity programs. (JW)",

PRISM III is intended to increase student  achievement and the effectiveness of personnel evaluation and to manage an enrollment decline. By restaffing a secondary school with the district's best teachers, a teacher center will be established where secondary teachers will be able to spend 8 weeks in order to observe exemplary instruction in a real setting, sharpen their instructional skills, practice new techniques, receive feedback, translate theory into practice, update their knowledge of their specific subject and of teaching technology, obtain a broad perspective on contemporary youth culture, and receive support on return to their home school.

A section on schooling and the mandates presents the researchers' findings and conclusions regarding a working definition of schooling for use by the Illinois State Board of Education and also derives generalizations about  the nature of schooling from an aggregate analysis of the mandate studies. A section of recommendations addresses future policy courses regarding instructional programs, driver education, physical education, special education, and bilingual education mandates.

It gives a historical perspective and reviews the practices in selected states and metropolitan districts. Corporal punishment is allowed in 46 states; 4 states prohibit it. Among large school districts in metropolitan areas there is a tendency to prohibit or restrict the use of corporal punishment. Many states and districts have provided safeguards for the protection of students from misuse of corporal punishment. The report includes a limited literature review representing advocates and opponents of corporal punishment. Included are tables providing information on the use of corporal punishment in selected states and in selected large cities, and on the positions agencies and  organizations take on the issue. Federal law leaves the regulation of corporal punishment primarily to the states. In Illinois the &quot;in loco parentis&quot; status of the schools is interpreted differently by different agencies, and the school code does not specifically address corporal punishment. Research is inconclusive as to the benefit derived from corporal punishment. The report points out that the majority of the available literature is written in opposition to corporal punishment.

Federal programs and civil rights provisions examined include four titles of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, the Vocational Education Act of 1963, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Findings drawn from an analysis of federal program requirements, documentary material, and personal interviews with over 300 individuals at the state and local levels in eight states indicate that while the federal education programs examined did not have a great impact on the states' political environments, federal and state program  interactions are robust and diverse, without the intense conflicts expected from popular accounts. Current federal education strategies emerging from the study include the following trade-offs: requiring a basic level of uniformity across the states that initially induces greater intergovernmental conflict; granting more decision-making discretion to the states, resulting in wider program variation but less conflict; and bypassing state-level administrative structures, thereby relinquishing a strong impact on state actions but minimizing potential conflict.

While chapter 2 describes the study's conceptual framework, its methodology, the criteria used for selecting eight states for analysis, and the major characteristics of each of the state's educational policies, chapter 3 analyzes the mix and design of federal educational policies and programs that have evolved to influence state and local actions. Findings show that while each of the six federal service programs studied possessed a unique strategy, several federal programs issued inconsistent and ambiguous development and implementation signals. Chapters 4 and 5 describe the political  environments in the case states, including the impact of these contextual factors on program administration. Findings indicate a robust and diverse federal/state governance system devoid of significant general intergovernmental conflict between the states and the federal government. Chapter 6 assesses the balance of federal-state educational governance in 1981-82, summarizes the study's major conclusions, and notes their implications for altering current federal education programs.

To represent a wide spectrum of political, economic, and institutional environments relevant to educational policy administration, six criteria were used in picking the sample, including (1) state support for education, (2) state fiscal stress, (3) regional location, and (4) state political culture. A second set of factors included state efforts to coordinate federal and state special pupil programs and state policies of particular interest. Each case study relied on documentary material and personal  interviews with an average of 40 individuals at the state and local levels. Topics studied included state management of federal and state programs, and state political environment. Results indicate that (1) both federal and state governments are shapers of state education policy decisions, (2) federal and state policy priorities for special students are frequently divergent, (3) state educational agencies are better organized than 15 years ago but dependent on federal dollars, and (4) intergovernmental conflicts between state and federal governments are relatively mild and uncommon.

Two cases, &quot;Simard v. Board of Education&quot; and &quot;Hortonville Joint School District No. 1 v. Hortonville Education Association,&quot; provide the general principle of leaving employment decisions to educational governing boards unless actual bias is shown to exist. &quot;Withrow v. Larkin&quot; sets forth the basic proposition that mere exposure to evidence is not enough to overcome the presumption of administrative fairness. Two cases involving terminations in higher education follow these general principles. Five other cases illustrate the allowable extent of local school board involvement in initiating termination  proceedings against a teacher and the kind of showing required to establish a charge of board bias. Three further cases illustrate judicial reasoning in conflicts between superintendents and boards of education regarding the initiation of termination proceedings and the inherent biases of unsatisfactory superintendent/board relationships. Although courts are generally reluctant to disquality governing boards from acting, the paper concludes that cases are adjudicated on their own merits. Thus boards of education and administrators should strive to provide fair procedures that promote reasonable decisions. (PB)",

Conclusions are that principals can improve student achievement by concentrating on managing the &quot;human resources&quot; of their schools, that is, by exercising a personal commitment to instructional rather than administrative leadership, helping teachers to assess and improve their teaching. This role requires knowledge about what should be changed in teaching and methods of implementation, such as acting as a supportive leader, a process monitor, and a knowledgeable colleague to teachers, introducing  them to theoretical insights. Several references are made to Australian theory and practice. (MJL)",

Twelve of the 15 interns achieved management level jobs after the program, an 80 percent success rate, while the remaining 3 achieved management level potential. Four interns are identified as able to succeed without the program, and the remaining 11 were assisted by 6 factors: the provision of a mentor; opportunities to increase professional visibility; peer learning; the use of consultants; chances to demonstrate ability; and training through conferences and seminars. Short case studies of all the interns are included. Cited as the most important  aspect of the program is the opportunity to learn by doing with the support of mentors and consultants. Interns minimally in need of the program required only opportunities to demonstrate their competence and models for achieving, while those without management experience benefited from the guidance of a mentor, learning opportunities, and strategies for improving their visibility. The report concludes that the major factor in the program's success was selection of interns willing to be assertive, ambitious, and challenge-seeking. (MJL)",

        "description":"This report discusses adolescent development by examining psychological research and theory and examining the process of adolescent development in the social context of secondary schools. The author functions from a base of four assumptions: (1) that the contours of adolescent experience can constrain or facilitate adult development, (2) that development represents a balancing of individual accommodation and assimilation of the environment, (3) that development is normative, and (4) that different cultures have different values. Outlined are the interrelated development dimensions of cognitive skills, reality, relatedness, and autonomy. Since the author believes development occurs as a result of individuals' interaction with their environment, research on the effect of school  size, student role, and the social organization of the classroom on adolescent development is examined. The research suggests that the typical secondary school has a deleterious effect on adolescent development. Schools are too big, students are often excluded from active roles in governance, and classrooms are often too competitive. In conclusion the author points out that secondary schools provide powerful levers to facilitate as well as to impede the adolescent development process. Included is an extensive bibliography. (MD)",

Further, performance of hearing impaired students on the Stanford Achievement Test for Hearing Impaired students (SAT-HI) was analyzed. Methods for obtaining and analyzing information are reviewed. Among data highlights cited are that state schools for the deaf and visually handicapped accounted for approximately 44% of the total population reported; males were predominant in number in  all categories of handicap; and two-thirds of students with visual handicaps only were served in self-contained classes. Uses of the data management system include: generating individual student profiles, SAT-HI reports, and verification of subgroups within the sensory impaired population.

        "description":"A practical guidebook of ideas, lesson materials, and related resources for developing imaginative and productive thinking skills of children is presented to assist teachers and parents. Emphasis is placed on the use of strategies and techniques that enhance originality, mental imagery, reverie, reflection, humor, novel playfulness, and divergent (but productive) thinking. It is suggested that such instruction is important to enable the learner to think through and effectively deal with the complex world. An introduction to creative imagination, the human mind, and developmental stages, and ways to develop imagination through the educational process, are addressed in the first four chapters. Chapter 5 considers various instructional models and programs by which creative  imagination can be developed; they involve promoting relaxation and \"centering,\" sharpening and enhancing the image, and symchronized learning. In addition, nine goals useful in teaching creative imagination and problem-solving skills are presented in a developmental hierarchy. In chapter 6, resource materials and strategies that may be implemented in lesson form are described. Chapter 7 presents learning activities that emphasize the importance of using basic sensory processes, such as touching, tasting, and hearing in the development of imagination. Chapters 8 through 12 provide learning activities related to the following: directed fantasy, imaginative situations, creative thinking, linguistic strategies, and developing a sense of humor and divergent thinking. Lastly, chapter 13  discusses creativity in general. A list of approximately 72 references is appended. (SW)",

Among findings from interviews were that staff strongly supported the seven program objectives and identified four needs of students (such as a structured environment) and five additional objectives (such as survival skill development). Results indicated that teachers used the special education instructional materials center heavily to  provide for individual student abilities; and that six students were successfully mainstreamed into the high school. Student data were gathered on enrollment, attendance, behavior levels, achievement, and placement. Among findings from student data were that attendance was variable, that the average student had achievement scores typical of fifth or sixth grade students, and that intervention of 1 or 2 years can be effective in preparing the students for regular school or work.

The model emphasized incorporating under-involved relatives, friends, and neighbors into the family's support network. Performance contracts were developed and regularly evaluated, and stipend money was available to help reduce barriers of expenses, time, and skills. Recruitment of family supports was undertaken by the families themselves as well as by project staff. Service plans addressed such needs as respite care, additional home programing, additional equipment, and transportation. Training focused on a variety of topics, including handling and positioning  techniques, feeding skills, and behavior management. Data from analysis of family and staff impact revealed that family support systems with a variety of trained participants can reduce stress related to a child's handicapping condition. An analysis of the stipend component is followed by results of a survey of economic, social, and psychological factors contributing to family stress in 448 cases. Stress ratings of the medium income group were frequently as high as or higher than those of the lowest income group. The severity of the child's disability was highly related to the number and severity of the parents' problems. (CL)",

Students progress from instruction in job tasks and work behavior to a gradual phasing out of the teacher's supervisory role with employers assuming the supervision. Competitive positions include food preparers, bakers' assistants, and laundry workers. The student operated business provides janitorial services, while the sheltered enclave within industry is an industrial bakery. The sheltered  employment setting is a workshop/work activity program in which students participate for 4-8 hours per week. The project emphasizes such necessary student work behaviors as problem solving and conflict resolution, while also helping employees and employers deal with the deaf-blind person. (CL)",

The paper adopts an ecological view in which the interaction of environmental and individual factors is emphasized. Planners are advised to be proactive, that is, to take the initiative in developing more community resources and alternatives. Among system obstacles cited to deinstitutionalization are lack of staff training, staff recruitment and retention, bureaucratic red tape, and negative attitudes.

The linguistic forms they used to refer to themselves as possessors and form-meaning and form-function correspondence were examined. The nominal form was retained during the period that the prenominal form appeared. Both children used both forms over a long period of time. Both children constructed a form-function relationship that does not exist in the target language they were acquiring and continued to use this construct for a long period of time  in a systematic way. As the children developed the adult form of language, they constructed their own hypotheses about the connection between linguistic forms, meanings, and functions.

Previously reported data (Brown, 1983) on mother-to-child speech were analyzed. Thirteen different contexts for verb use were identified. There was a close resemblance between the way the child and his mother distributed their uses of verbs. There was very little immediate imitation on the part of either mother or child. Apparently the child monitored his mother's use of verbs as an index of their potential for new constructions. It is suggested that the child compared a verb's privileges of occurrence with other items heard in a particular construction. The greater the degree of overlap, the more confident he was that it participates in the construction. As a result, verbs  with a variety of heard uses were used with greater confidence by the child even in unheard contexts. A mechanism of this sort would allow for novelty of verb use even while the child was storing information about syntactic rules in his lexicon. (RW)",

        "description":"Although Mandarin is a discourse topic oriented language rather than a subject and sentence oriented one, Chinese children acquiring Mandarin attempt in their early speech to exactly mark the same referential grammatical relationships as subject, object, location, and instrument by using case or ergative markers. Only after marking a closed set of possible sentential relations with a fixed word order do they move on to control the highly variable open set of context sensitive topic chains which are so crucial to their language. Despite the striking formal differences between Mandarin and other languages, the Chinese children's acquisition strategies are similar to those of children acquiring other languages. Based on a statistical analysis of 135,000 coded, contextualized child  Mandarin utterances, five stages for the acquisition of predicates in Mandarin are defined which are believed to exist cross-linguistically. These stages are: single actions; binary actions; enhanced transitivity actions, states, and causes; full predicate systems; and full discourse. It is concluded that the young child's preference for a highly transitive, agentive prototype is adaptive. (RW)",

A total of 95 children aged 2-5 years acquiring Mandarin Chinese as their first language were tested on sentences involving equi-constructions. It was hypothesized that if children were sensitive to the presence of a grammatical subject, they would distinguish topic and subject in the equi-constructions. The results confirmed that Chinese children distinguish the concepts of subject and topic and that they access the grammatical category of subject as well as the semantic category of topic.

        "description":"A case study of the use of reflexive constructions by a Spanish-speaking child from age 2;5.2 to 3;5.2 is presented. Sixty hours of audiotaped utterances were recorded monthly over a one year period. The utterances are analyzed in terms of self-induced actions, impersonal constructions, and two-argument predicates. The data show the regular occurrence of adult reflexive patterns in the child's speech but with errors and restricted uses that indicate incomplete comprehension of the constructions. It is suggested that by age 3;6, the child is using reflexive constructions with only a prototypical meaning. This prototypical usage represents the first developmental stage in the use of the reflexive, the primary function of which is to denote an entity affected by the action mentioned  in the verb. However, further meanings of the reflexive which establish a speaker perspective on an event are not fully understood at this stage. (RW)",

        "description":"Research literature concerning the effects of incorporating the heritage languages of minority students into the regular school curriculum either as subjects or as mediums of instruction is reviewed. Program evaluations from Canada, the United States, and Europe consistently show that the use of a minority language as a medium of instruction for all or part of the school day entails no long-term loss in the development of academic skills in the majority language. There is also evidence that bilingual programs can both encourage minority parent involvement in their children's schooling and facilitate the development of minority students' academic skills. However, this pattern does not invariably emerge in the evaluation data, and further research is required to understand fully  the complex interactions that appear to exist between language of instruction and a range of individual, educational, and social factors. Virtually no research data are available on the academic effects of teaching heritage languages as subjects, as opposed to using the languages as a medium of instruction. Also, because most program evaluations focus primarily on academic outcomes, little or no data are available on the impact of bilingual or heritage language programs on the educational system as a whole. Three major policy implications of the research are addressed. (Author/SW)",

It is noted that the hearing impaired population is not homogenous. Different factors involved in the decision to place a hearing impaired child in a regular classroom are considered. The types of language problems hearing impaired children experience are enumerated, including problems with the function and structure of language. The need for a comprehensive assessment and the development of an individualized education program for hearing impaired children are highlighted. The assessment should include psychological, medical, audiological, and speech and language evaluations conducted by qualified professionals. Language programming at the elementary  and secondary school levels is discussed with emphasis on the establishment of appropriate goals. It is concluded that whatever the reason for placing a hearing impaired student in a regular classroom, the task of helping that child move through the difficult process of mastering the English language is a great responsibility.

        "description":"The view that foreign language study contributes significantly to literacy in the native language is discussed from the perspectives of a foreign language teacher who also teaches English composition. It is suggested that there is a need for research and publications on the benefits of second language study on native language growth and on cognitive growth in general. Benefits traditionally claimed for foreign language study include the enhancement of vocabulary in the mother tongue, learning grammar (i.e., linguistic features and principles and literacy), syntactic fluency, and the ability to pronounce foreign words and proper names. It is suggested that when foreign language students practice shifts and transformations of tense and voice, the same operations are being made  silently in the mother tongue. Moreover, many freshman English students have a defective tense system and difficulty in the use of the perfect tenses. It is noted that sentence-combining exercises are valuable, and that translation into English is an excellent writing exercise. It is recommended that students be made aware of the contribution of foreign language study to their linguistic knowledge and first-language skills and that foreign language teachers should assess and improve students' first-language proficiencies. In addition, it is suggested that foreign language teachers should communicate more with linguistics and English composition teachers. (SW)",

The implication of both assumptions is that educational intervention and the passage of time can eradicate such errors. Present day Indian speakers of nonstandard varieties are keenly aware of their limited English skills while younger native speakers are especially cognizant of the need to acquire the standard code. However, these desires are impaired by the lack of funding for programs to improve English skills. Research at a Sioux reservation school in South Dakota is cited as evidence of the pervasive use of nonstandard varieties of  English. While fewer people speak the native Lakota, an increasing number speak Lakota English. Examples of Lakota English variations are provided. Without the recognition that such dialects exist, Indian children will have difficulty in learning standard versions of English. Thus, it is important to document the existence of non-standard versions of English and to consider their existence when designing native language maintenance or transition to English language programs.

        "description":"The impact of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act Amendments of 1978 (ADEA) and possible options for adjusting to the impact were estimated for members institutions of the Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE). Questionnaire information was gathered on active, departed, and retired faculty from 27 individual COFHE institutions. Modeling was used to separate out the effects of the change in retirement age and the effects of age structure. Findings include the following: the aggregate faculties of the 27 institutions increased 3.1 percent during 1973-1979; institutions became more heavily tenured over the period; the mean age of the aggregate faculties increased 1.5 years or 3.6 percent over the period; and schools are continuing to hire new junior faculty but in  reduced numbers. Estimates of voluntary early retirement suggest that approximately half of all faculties will have retired voluntarily before age 70. The predicted mean age at retirement is calculated to be about 68.5 years, including 52 percent retiring at age 70. General considerations regarding early retirement incentive plans are covered, along with part-time employment options. It is concluded that a mandatory retirement age no lower than 70 will diminish employment opportunities for prospective junior faculty members, and will continue to do so until the 1990s. (SW)",

Findings include the following: a beginning enrollment of 100-180 part-time students could be expected if RIT were to develop a graduate program relating to the management of human services organizations; there is a perceived need to upgrade the knowledge and skills of current and potential managers; direct service personnel need to appreciate management problems and alternatives; there is also a  need for short courses for current managers; a curriculum is needed that has more depth in management and leadership areas; more internships and field experiences would be valuable; the preferred times for courses are weekdays, late afternoons, or evenings; and time and financial concerns are major constraints for electing to undertake an academic program.

The transition from an agricultural to an industrial society and then to a technological one can be described in terms of its impact on individuals, institutions, and society itself. Strategic planning and management matches results of an assessment of an external environment with the results of auditing internal strengths and weaknesses. In the case of large institutions, strategic planning and management requires the capability to collect and analyze a broad range of demographic, social, economic, and political data in order to develop a most likely scenario of their future. The process should assist  institutions to capitalize on strengths, minimize weaknesses, take advantage of opportunities, and eliminate or reduce threats. It helps individuals understand their stage of development and formulate professional and personal goals in relation to an image of the future. As the technical, information society evolves, it is essential that institutions analyze the work culture and develop plans for intellectual capital formation. (SW)",

A non-nurse group of university students also gave decisions about what a nurse should do in each ethically-loaded situation. A dilemma was classified as recurrent if its core problem was spontaneously mentioned by at least five nurses. Twenty-one of these recurrent dilemmas were grouped according to their reflection of underlying issues of: quality of life, maintenance of professional standards, distribution of nursing resources, and information and decision rights in health care. Registered and trainee nurses had similar resolution patterns for dilemmas in four clinical situations. More registered nurses than trainees were willing to give a  patient information against doctor's orders, and to refrain from vigorous resuscitation of a malformed newborn infant. University students and other non-nurse groups were less cautious than trainees in advocating the divulgence of information, and were less willing than both nurse groups to refrain from vigorous resuscitation of the newborn. The importance of discovering nurses' patterns of ethical choice for nurses is discussed in light of study findings, and a literature review on relevant issues is included. (Author/SW)",

It is suggested that new federalism, decreased revenue, declining enrollments, increased state and federal regulations, and public demand for accountability have threatened the ability of higher education institutions to retain their vitality and to attract quality and innovative faculty. Three broad categories of strategies developed to combat these threats are: fund-generating strategies, organizational strategies, and expanding career strategies. Fund-generating strategies are either external revenue generating (i.e., new funds brought to the institution from new external sources), or internal revenue generating by  reallocation of existing funds. These revenues are then used to hire new faculty, or retrain old faculty to meet demand in growing areas. Organizational strategies involve faculty in the development of solutions to solve problems. Expanding career strategies are characterized as counseling faculty to consider other career options. This may involve retraining for another academic area, or a career outside of academe. The retraining is usually supported financially by the institution. (Author/SW)",

This plan requires faculties and administrators to share the responsibility for academic planning not only with their own boards of trustees but with the statewide board of regents. In addition to reviewing annually the enrollments of the 27 taxpayer-supported institutions, the board of regents will undertake periodic systemwide reviews of selected academic  fields or program areas, along with comprehensive institutional program reviews on a 5-year cycle. Personal perspectives are offered regarding whether this new system for Massachusetts higher education will succeed, and predictable stresses and strains that will occur as the new system goes into full operation are identified.

Twenty-six critical variables for learning improvement are presented in the Hierarchy of Decisions. The possible choices that educators can make for each variable are identified and ranked for effectiveness to increase overall academic achievement.

        "description":"Although computer use in a variety of educational environments has grown tremendously in the past five years, issues of who uses the computer and how they use it are arising. Preliminary research indicates that computer access is related to both socio-economic status (SES) and sex, with male students from wealthier school districts being most apt to have access to computers. SES is also related to computer use, with higher SES students being more apt to use computers in creative ways, and low SES students being more apt to use computers for remedial drill and practice. Access to computers is additionally influenced by geographic location, with the least amount of computer usage in the south, and ethnic background, with white native English speakers overwhelmingly predominating as  computer users. As computers play an increasing role in society, and as studies provide additional evidence of the positive effects of computers on achievement and motivation, the problems of computer equity must be addressed and solutions found. A 17-item bibliography accompanies this paper. (Author/ESR)",

        "description":"This publication provides guidance for the introduction of computer software tools within agencies of the United States government or within other installations where there has been little or no prior use of software tools. From a survey of current tool usage, it is concluded that the greatest obstacles to effective use of software tools are encountered in organizations employing fewer than 40 programmers, and the needs of these environments are therefore emphasized. Specific needs for software tools in programming for management information systems (MIS) and for scientific applications are discussed. Measures are described to overcome organizational obstacles to use of tools, to deal with problems arising from the tools, and to reduce the difficulties posed by existing computer  installations. Also described are the responsibilities of software management, software engineers, and toolsmiths (who make minor modifications to tools and the computer environment as necessary). Steps required for the successful introduction of tools are then presented, organized both by the function responsible for their accomplishment, and the time schedule in which they must be completed. Work to be performed in each step is described in detail. A list of 14 references and the agenda and attendance list from a related workshop conclude the publication. (Author/ESR)",

        "description":"Research findings indicate that major breakthroughs in education will have to occur through direct cortical intervention, using either chemical or electronic means. It will eventually be possible to build sophisticated intelligence amplifiers that will be internal extensions of our brains, significantly more powerful than present day computers, which may even be directly wired to the brain for both input and output. Development of such symbionic (symbiotic + bionic) devices can be projected based on emerging research in five areas: (1) &quot;emgors&quot; (electromyogram sensors) for controlling artificial limbs; (2) brain pacemakers and electrical brain stimulation; (3) biocybernetic communication and neurometrics, including the link between brain wave patterns and specific thoughts; (4)  artificial intelligence; and (5) biocybernetics, including the use of genetic engineering principles to construct tiny biological microprocessors or &quot;biochips.&quot; A merger of these steadily-converging areas could allow creation of the symbionic mind, defined as any apparatus consisting of some useful device interfaced with the human brain, which is capable of intelligent action. The current growth of microcomputers foreshadows a trend towards a change in the way learning occurs which symbionic technology will extend, changing the role of the student, teacher, school, and individual in society.

At that time, the judge indicated that some limited or temporary use of the works might be legal. But after considering the potential harm to the markets of Encyclopaedia Britannica, Learning Corporation of America, and Time-Life Films, the judge  again sided with the filmmakers. The Erie County BOCES suggested a temporary-use period (during which no royalties would be paid and works could be used and then erased) of one year or 45 days - the latter period recommended by the copyright guidelines of a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee. But Curtin ruled in &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica v. Crooks&quot; that no temporary use of the works is permitted under federal copyright law. Among the criteria for judging fair use of copyrighted works is the effect of the use on the owner's potential market, Curtin said. The judge found it significant that all of the 19 works at issue in the case &quot;are available for rental or lease for short- or long-term periods in both film and videotape form&quot; and can be rented for as short a time as one to three  days. In addition, the firms offer many types of licensing agreements for schools, Curtin noted. &quot;For these reasons, any temporary use by BOCES of plaintiffs' copyrighted works would interfere with the marketability of these works, and the cumulative effect of this temporary videotaping would tend to diminish or prejudice the potential short-term lease or rental market for these works,&quot; Curtin ruled. Although distribution of copyrighted works may be in the public interest when the information is hard to get, he said, &quot;in this case it is evident that copies of the plaintiffs' work may be obtained for short periods through normal channels.&quot; The standard for proving violations of the doctrine of fair use is &quot;potential&quot; harm to the copyright owner's market, &quot;but we showed actual harm,&quot; said  R. William Stephens, attorney for the filmmakers. He labeled the case significant because the defendants who were found liable for damages included BOCES board members and the staff members who copied the firms' works. Curtin assessed damages of $63,500 and an additional $15,000 in court costs against the BOCES defendants, Stephens said. (Author)",

Part I describes the social, political, and educational environment in which the philosophy of the cluster system was forged. Additionally, this section identifies the critical elements of the philosophy as the student development model, interdisciplinary courses and programs, diversity in instructional modes, emphasis on community, and organizational provisions for growth and administrative effectiveness. Manifestations of the cluster philosophy during its first years at OCC are described next, including the Directory of Courses and Sections; the role of the cluster dean in guiding, supporting,  and evaluating faculty, as well as in administrative functions; the use of student development counselors as teaching faculty; biweekly meetings of cluster faculty; a non-punitive grading system; emphasis on innovation; and the breaking down of traditional barriers between students and faculty. Part II begins by relating the external and internal changes influencing the implementation of the cluster system at OCC, focusing on enrollment increases, greater proportions of part-time students and faculty, and staff turnover. Finally, responses to these changes are reviewed, such as decreased emphasis on innovation, more formal student-teacher relations, and greater attention to administrative work by cluster deans.

Following introductory material on New Jersey's basic skills assessment program, the character of the state's remedial programs is examined, focusing on the number of students tested, identification of students needing remediation, placement criteria, enrollment in remedial courses, skills-deficient students in college-level courses, and graduation credits. Next, the report describes the remedial evaluation guidelines developed by the Assessment Advisory Council of the Basic Skills Council (BSC) and the evaluative data provided by the colleges. Finally, findings are presented for the community and state college sectors and Rutgers University and the New Jersey Institute of  Technology related to passing rates in remedial courses, attrition, credit ratio, grade point average, pre- and post-testing, and performance in subsequent courses. These findings indicate that: (1) a relatively large number of students, especially those in mathematics courses, did not complete their remedial courses; (2) students who completed their remedial courses persisted in college at the same rate or better than those who did not need remediation; and (3) in general, students who completed their remediation passed their regular courses at the same rate as non-remedial students.

Education today, and in the society of the future, needs leaders with qualities of both the visionary and the realist, who can help swing the pendulum back from micro-education, with its emphasis on institutional survival, to macro-education, with its emphasis on the common concerns of educators. Such leaders will be able to make the changes demanded of higher education by forces such as: (1) the information revolution, which has made knowledge, and therefore education, more  sought after and more important than ever before; (2) the growing recognition that education is lifelong and that a blended lifeplan of concurrent education, work, and leisure is replacing the former linear lifeplan; (3) the need for education to focus on teaching the skills that will serve as the foundation of a lifetime of learning, including the ability to analyze, synthesize, and apply knowledge; and (4) the pervasion of education into all of the organizations of society, offering learners an unprecedented choice in what, where, when, and how they learn and the resulting need for cooperative programs rather than competition. Educational leaders must attend to these circumstances and their influence on the changing role of education in society. (LL)",

The three phases of the project were: (1) workshop organization and participation selection, which involved meetings with validation team members, site visitations, attendance at meetings and seminars on computing and computer-assisted instruction by project staff, preparation of instructional materials, equipment and software purchases, facilities renovation, employment of additional project personnel, selection of 30 participants from 22 colleges, and preparation of evaluation materials; (2) a  4-week summer seminar on computer-assisted instruction, focusing on topics such as computer hardware and software, the BASIC programming language, computer graphics, and the future of instructional computing; and (3) on-site visits to the campuses of workshop participants to assess progress and provide assistance, and a follow-up seminar. All of the project participants submitted a report on the activities initiated as a result of the workshop and those who were able to try their materials in learning situations gathered student responses to their materials. The project report includes summaries from each of the workshop participants which describe the materials developed. (HB)",

Fundamental to the organization of the book is the attempt to reflect a gradual development of some of the major issues in the socialization of children as seen from a social psychologist's perspective. Specifically, the seven chapters are: (1) Perspectives of Childhood: Historial Overview; (2) Schooling; (3) Psychology and Education; (4) Language, Communication, and the Curriculum; (5) Socialisation and Achievement; (6) Constraints on the Curriculum; Social-Psychological Issues; and (7)  Self-Esteem and Social Learning. Three problems are focused on throughout the book: the disjuncture between theory and practice; the mismatch between the curriculum and the child; and the relevance of social learning and attribution theories, which, though important to social psychologists, seem neglected by educationists. A &quot;rough, linguistic/cognitive socialisation chart&quot; showing changes in conceptual growth and development, the CARALOC (Children's Attribution of Responsibility and Locus of Control) pupil questionnaire, and a copy of &quot;Twenty Official Rules of the Schools in the USSR&quot; are appended.

A group of 16 boys and 16 girls was divided by age, with the resulting categories consisting of 17 children under and 15 children over 5 years of age. Data were collected by observing classroom activities in 30-minute periods, 3 days per week, for 5 consecutive weeks. Observers recorded each instance that a subject chose the computer activity. Results of a univariate analysis of variance for gender, age, and the interaction between these two factors revealed a statistically significant difference between males and females in the  choice of the computer activity only for children under 5 years of age. It was concluded that the findings lend support for the practice of providing experiences with computers for preschool children. Implications of the findings for sex-stereotyping were briefly noted.

An equal number of boys and girls who had been placed in remedial classes received didactic instruction in listening comprehension. Half of the children in each grade verbalized explicit listening comprehension strategies prior to applying them to questions. Methodology included pretesting (using self-efficacy judgments and a listening comprehension skill test), the training procedure (using strategy self-verbalization and no strategy self-verbalization), posttesting, follow-up training, and follow-up testing. Results showed that  self-verbalization led to a higher level of self-efficacy across grades. Strategy verbalization promoted performance among third and fourth graders but did not benefit second graders. The results also suggested further exploration of strategy verbalization, as well as covert fading procedures, with young children. The experiment was seen as having implications for clarifying the role of strategy self-verbalization in promoting cognitive skills and for encouraging self-efficacy among children with language deficiencies.

An argument has been made that ratings of social behavior are less a reflection of enduring individual differences than a measure of rater characteristics and error variance. This study investigated the possibility that extraneous sources of variance would be found in Carey's Infant Temperament Questionnaire (ITQ). A large, diverse sample of mothers of 6-month-old infants completed ITQ's. Item analyses first identified a cluster of items left blank by a select, middle-class group of mothers. A large number of items (40 percent) were found to exhibit marked response biases, and parental characteristics were shown to affect  response biases and styles, implying that systematic biases are built into the scale. Temperament ratings also varied with social class, ethnicity, and knowledge of infant development. Infants judged as being temperamentally easier tended to have mothers who were white, middle-class, and more knowledgeable than others. Results suggested that caregiver ratings on the ITQ reflect more than mere stylistic differences in infant behavior. (Author/RH)",

Its objectives include enhancing self-concept, increasing learning achievement, and developing more positive communication and interaction between child and parent. Lower socioeconomic status and a high unemployment rate characterize the bilingual families in the project. The program operates on six basic aspects of learning and growth: (1) acquisition of intelligence, (2) specific linguistic/cognitive benchmarks crucial to growth, (3) experiences to expand  language and cognitive growth, (4) self-regulation of learning, (5) social interaction, and (6) children's play. These aspects provide the baseline for self-concept development. Specific activities in the home (grouped according to the dimensions of body self, social self, cognitive self, and self-esteem) may be used by parents to foster healthy self-concepts in their children. These activities include singing songs containing the child's name, reading to the child, role playing, and constructing \"me\" books. (BJD)",

Data were gathered three times (when subjects' modal age was 8, 19, and 30 years). Initially, subjects included the entire population enrolled in the third grade in Columbia County, New York. While aggression and IQ scores were obtained for 632 subjects 8 years of age, samples available for multivariate analyses were much smaller. All, however, were sufficiently large to provide reasonable statistical power. Additional measures of IQ or achievement were made when subjects were 19 and 30 years old. When subjects were 8 years old, mothers and fathers were interviewed; when  30 years of age, data were gathered from the spouses and children. Measures relevant to this study were the California Test of Mental Maturity, school records of IQ, the Wide Range Achievement Test, Reitan's trail-making test, and a video car race game. Results suggested that aggression and intellectual competence are strongly related and that this strong relationship is due partially to the interference of aggressive behavior patterns with the development of intellectual competence. Intellectual competence and aggressive behavior showed similar patterns of stability across generations and marriage-pairs and within subjects. Early IQ did not predict change in aggression from childhood to adulthood. (RH)",

Generally, such interventions have been effective in promoting specific outcomes. For example, skill-training programs improve children's ability to form colleague relations but do not lead to more intimate friendship relationships. To assess the reasons social skill training is effective, further research should investigate (1) children's knowledge of social interaction principles or strategies, (2) children's confidence in their ability to produce satisfying social relationships with other children, (3) children's ability to monitor their social interactions with others, and (4) the influence of  intervention on the way children construe goals in social situations. Since the construction of social goals may directly affect children's peer relationships, the last of these four areas seems particularly important. Research also indicates that differences exist in the ways popular and unpopular children construe social goals; that aggressive, as opposed to nonagressive, boys read social situations in ways that preclude prosocial goals; that children's goals differ with respect to their status and age; and that individual differences in goals in game-playing contexts exist.

In all cases, a marked increase in the importance of the secondary section of the schools accompanied the upgrading. Million-dollar, multi-stage physical improvement programs were either in place or projected for each school. All three schools, especially Glenora, showed solid staffing gains since the upgrading and teachers were more highly qualified.  Sheffield interviewees agreed that the upgrading was of definite economic importance to the area, noting that the school newspaper made a cultural contribution and that school events offered social opportunities. Ouse interviewees noted some economic benefits to traders but few cultural or social benefits. However, the community utilized the school's new sport facilities. Probably because the Glenora school serves a dispersed area, interviewees there cited fewer economic, social, and cultural influences from the upgrading. Opinion of the educational quality in all three schools was mixed. (SB)",

        "description":"To gather information about local Alaskan schooling, researchers surveyed 327 rural school site administrators to determine their backgrounds, school activities, expectations of student performance, perceptions of school-community relations, and perceptions of the roles of actors in school governance. Results of the questionnaire indicated that rural principals in Alaska are likely to be middle-aged Caucasian males with at least 5 years of teaching experience and 3 years experience as a principal. Overall, rural principals spend significant amounts of time on classroom instruction and also on general administration, building maintenance, and support staff supervision. For principals in larger rural schools, administration, supervision, and maintenance are the main activities.  Although principals' opinions of their students' abilities and of the conditions for learning and achievement in their schools are high, half are dissatisfied with student performance and most feel that their students will not progress beyond high school. The involvement of principals in community activities is extensive and usually related to education. Principals also participate in all areas of school governance and are the most influential in six of the eight areas surveyed; further, they perceive themselves as being the most important figure in overall school governance.

Their average age was 33. Over half were women and 91% were Caucasian, markedly contrasting the communities they served. They averaged 7 years' teaching experience, mostly outside Alaska in non-rural areas. They averaged 30 hours/week in classroom instruction, 10 hours in planning, 4 in staff supervision, and 1 in parent meetings. Teacher-parent social contact was much more frequent. The teachers, 50% of whom had close community ties, participated in church, sports, arts, crafts, hunting, and social activities. Still, over half left  Alaska in summer. Teachers expected their students to perform well, complete high school, but not continue to college, although they felt positive about their school's potential to provide excellent education. Teachers noted their active role in selecting textbooks and proposing new courses, but felt that supervisors and principals had greater influence. Eighty percent felt they were successful and felt satisfied with many aspects of their work. Many, however, expressed dissatisfaction with district operations and with the effectiveness of school administrators. (SB)",

Innovative aspects of the program during 1981-82 were inservice training to aid teachers in working individually with gifted students, a mentor program for students to work part-time in the community under specialists in their areas of interest, and a computer for direct instruction of students and for programming individual study projects. A related component was a special art program for artistically talented students. Results were assessed with the Wiener Attitude Scale (to determine teacher attitude), the California Achievement  Test (CAT--to measure student achievement in reading, math, language and spelling), teacher/mentor questionnaires (to measure knowledge/skills acquired by students), and individual evaluations of participating students. Pre- and post-tests indicated general teacher satisfaction with the program; no significant student gain in CAT scores; notable individual student gains on specific area tests (computer programming, typing, German, brain dominance, sculpture, racing cars) developed by the mentors/advisors; and more enthusiasm about the program from mentors/advisors than from teachers.

The CAMP recruitment effort visited 34 high schools and recruited 307 applicants, from whom the freshmen were selected. Each CAMP student received $309 per semester and was eligible for other university financial aid. Although the year was difficult because the recession and increased unemployment among heads of households forced many CAMP students to seek part- and full-time employment, overall grade point average of CAMP freshmen was higher than that of all PAU freshman.  Seventeen tutors conducted 140 sessions weekly for 93.1% of CAMP students; a study skills course was offered. Tutors received 25 hours of on-going staff development training. PAU faculty and staff continued to cooperate fully with CAMP. Individual and group counseling helped 93.4% of CAMP students with personal growth, self-awareness, values clarification, cultural awareness, and decision-making; a Self-Awareness Marathon was held. The report includes charts of CAMP students' academic performance during the year and CAMPS' goals/achievements for 1981-82, plus the Self-Awareness Marathon program. (MH)",

Materials and curriculum development continued, with progress made on Shinnecock, Mohawk and Cherokee curricula. Instruction in Native history and culture was given in five mini-courses in different boroughs. Information on educational opportunities was provided at the central site and through home visits and a workshop. Special activities, with student and parent participation, included trips to the Shinnecock and Ward/Pound Ridge Delaware Reservations,  the Black Bear trading post and museum, an American Indian spiritual musical play, and a New Jersey program for Ramapo Indian children. Staff members attended workshops and conferences to upgrade their knowledge of Native history and culture and to develop professional/administrative skills. Parents showed active and continuing commitment to the program through support for program activities, input into decision making, and participation in trips, cultural activities and workshops. Recommendations include better publicity, prioritizing needs, and finding a more accessible central site. (MH)",

Questionnaires to 640 energy industry workers in contractor-operated workcamps had a low response rate (11.4%), but provided some indicators of attitudes/perceptions. Respondents were divided into mobile home households (largely newcomers),  household units with more than five years residence (oldtimers) and less than five years residence (newcomers), and workcamp residents. Results indicated that although important variations in concern for personal safety, feeling at home, and satisfaction with friendships and spare-time activities occurred between these subpopulations, personal stress indicators illustrated minimal differences between boom town and stable community populations, suggesting that boom town residents appeared to cope fairly well and consequently tended not to exhibit atypical levels of stress.

The unit aids the student in the task because it is intended for individualized study designed in part by the student. In the course of the unit, students gain practice in planning, composition, grammar, handwriting, reading, and research skills. The unit begins with a teacher sheet that provides an overview of goals and presents an outline for classroom organization. A lesson  follows that preassesses student attitudes, writing skills, self-expression, and interests to determine which subsequent lessons should go into each individual study plan. The lessons focus on adaptation, belief, and belonging, and lesson topics include the migrations, economics, world view, leadership, extended family, education, and history of the Teton Sioux. Each lesson plan includes an assignment and a list of specific activities for students to complete.

They make up one of the cornerstones on which our success as a nation is built. To maintain our strength and independence, skills in these fields cannot degenerate. President Reagan has said that the declining condition of science/mathematics education has become serious enough to compromise the nation's future ability to develop and advance our traditional industrial base, and to compete in international marketplaces. The problems are particularly severe at the secondary level where there is a growing shortage of qualified science/mathematics teachers at a time when efforts are under way to raise standards and increase enrollments. In  response to these problems, dozens of bills have been introduced to Congress. What is more urgent, however, is the necessity to forge an effective partnership with states, local education authorities, and private industry so that each can do its part of the job to resolve the problems. Although the federal role must be a limited one, several initiatives have been proposed, including allocating funds to states as scholarships for individuals not currently qualified to teach science/mathematics.

Using student behaviors (on task, off task, and disruptive behavior) as criteria of management effectiveness, this study investigated classroom management practices in 26 classes (part of the JMIS experiment) taught by 13 middle/junior high school teachers. Extensive classroom observations provided information about management practices associated with smooth-running, task-oriented classrooms. These include practices for general classroom procedures, managing student behavior, laboratory procedures, managing student assignments, presenting content, and structuring note-taking. Each of these practices are  briefly described and illustrated. Since no information was available about student learning gains or attitudes toward science, there is no basis for assuming that practices of the better classroom managers constitute &quot;good&quot; science teaching. However, it is indicated that when teachers can establish orderly classroom environments and maintain students' cooperation, student engagement in appropriate learning tasks is more likely to occur.

        "description":"This study is part of a larger study of teachers' use of curriculum materials in planning and teaching fifth-grade science. The study focused on one of nine teachers observed teaching &quot;Communities,&quot; an activity-based unit from the SCIIS science program (a revision of the original Science Curriculum Improvement Study). &quot;Communities&quot; is designed to introduce students to groups of organisms interacting in biological communities: producers, consumers, and decomposers. Observations of instruction and measurement of learning were completed during teaching of units on producers (plant growth and photosynthesis). Although the teacher became aware that students held certain misconceptions about plant growth, she was unsuccessful in helping them replace their misconceptions with the  scientific conceptions she wanted them to learn. The analysis revealed several factors contributing to this disappointing result. Teachers and curriculum developers held different views about learning and the nature of science. In addition, several problems surfaced about the content and organization of the teacher's guide. Implications for and suggestions related to elementary science instruction, development of teaching guides, and teacher education are considered and a list of important teacher education outcomes that should be addressed, such as knowledge of common misconceptions and specific strategies for changing them, is included.

        "description":"Several empirical and theoretical analyses related to scientific problem-solving are reviewed, including: detailed studies of individuals at different levels of expertise, and computer models simulating some aspects of human information processing during problem solving. Analysis of these studies has revealed many facets about the nature of the knowledge required for solving problems in complex subject-matter domains. In addition, the analyses have provided detailed descriptions of the performance of problem solvers at &quot;novice&quot; and &quot;expert&quot; levels. Although these descriptive analyses are intended to document and explain naturally occurring performance, a prescriptive approach could be used to identify effective problem-solving methods that might be &quot;prescribed&quot; to students. The  nature of and major steps in such a prescriptive model and results of empirical tests of the model are discussed. Steps include specification of applicability, formulation of a model of good performance, elaboration of the model, measures to ensure implementability, and controlled experiments. Relevance of the model as well as instructional implications (reasonable conclusions about both what to teach and how that information should be taught) are addressed. Making tacit processes explicit, getting students to talk about processes, providing guiding practice, understanding/reasoning processes are among the strategies suggested. (JN)",

Provided in these hearings are testimony and written statements related to authorizing appropriations for the program for fiscal years 1984, 1985, and 1986. Major program accomplishments, objectives achieved, reasons for continuing the program, as well as reasons for terminating the program are addressed in the testimony and statements. Among the areas considered are: the Reagan administration's viewpoint; a perspective on why Sea Grant is unique, important, and should be reauthorized; a review of the ocean sector of the economy and Sea Grant's contribution to that sector, including activities in graduate  education; partnership aspects characterizing the Sea Grant program (university-industry, college school, and others); Sea Grant activities at the Florida Institute of Technology (as well as at other colleges and universities); and industry use of knowledge generated by Sea Grant activities. It is pointed out that 175 academic institutions are currently participating in the program (19 of which have been designated Sea Grant colleges by the Secretary of Commerce) and that several programs initiated by Sea Grant support now continue without federal funds.

The establishment of an autonomous SMEC, physically located in a science/mathematics environment, is helping to bridge the gap between secondary science/mathematics teachers and specialists by: involving higher education specialists in secondary school-based research and development (R&amp;D) activities; sponsoring activities such as discipline-oriented workshops and seminars for science/mathematics teachers and students; sponsoring visits by science/mathematics education specialists from within Australia and overseas; and by providing avenues for higher education discipline experts to become involved in school  activities such as field trips and extension activities for intellectually gifted students. In addition to graduate courses (leading to Master of Applied Science Degree and Graduate Diploma in Science Education) and such R&amp;D activities as applied educational research, curriculum development, and evaluation studies, the center is directly involved in several on-going outreach activities. In addition to workshops and seminars, these activities include producing a newsletter and information broadsheets, sponsoring of visiting fellowships, and fostering industry/education relationships. The approach to continuing science/mathematics teacher professional development evolved at SMEC could be readily adopted by other institutions of higher education. (JN)",

Three distinct groups of students engaged in these SMEC programs can be identified based on their interests/expertise in computing and computer education: science/mathematics teachers with interests/expertise in areas other than computing or computer education, science/mathematics teachers who wish to develop expertise in computer education, and computer specialists who wish to pursue further studies in this area. Three computing components have been developed to meet the needs of students in each of these groups. One component deals with computer science and  computer education. Units emphasized in this component include all areas of computer science from programing to computer architecture as well as computer assisted instruction and instructional design. Another component focuses on the computer as a tool in educational research while a third component deals with research and evaluation in computer education. Each of these components and the audiences they serve are discussed. A strategy for teaching computing skills as a tool in educational research is also considered.

        "description":"This study examines factors that determine the enrollment of black students in the high school math courses (i.e., advanced algebra, trigonometry, calculus) that are necessary for competitive college and major field access. The data are from a local college survey of juniors and seniors who were enrolled in eight (8) local public and private colleges in Maryland, Georgia, and the District of Columbia. Approximately 2,100 students participated in the survey. Forty-six percent (927) of the students were black. The study found that, after controlling for parental education and high school grade performance, math affinity (the extent to which black students liked high school math) was the single most important factor that significantly influenced the enrollment of black students in  advanced high school math courses. Neither blacks nor whites expressed a great affinity (i.e., indicating that they liked high school math &quot;very much&quot;) for high school math. (Author)",

The major point of the second paper is that United States strategic nuclear forces are not inferior to those of the Soviets. Areas addressed include accuracy/vulnerability, new weapons, madness of nuclear war, SALT I and II, proposed nuclear weapons freeze, and  possible U.S. initiatives. The final paper considers the public consciousness of nuclear war, mutually assured destruction (MAD), nuclear utilization target selection (NUTS)- a conceptual approach to nuclear war which pretends that specialized applications of nuclear weapons are possible, and others. In addition, selected discussion questions from the symposium are provided. Since courses on science and society are proliferating in many colleges/universities, it is suggested that this booklet may serve as reading material for such courses. (JN)",

Sweeping and drastic changes are proposed in the breadth of student participation, methods and quality of teaching, student preparation/motivation, course content, and achievement standards. These changes will be accomplished by: building a strong and lasting national commitment to quality mathematics, science, and technology education for all students; providing earlier/increased exposure to these fields; providing a system for measuring student achievement/participation; retraining current  teachers, retaining excellent teachers, and attracting new teachers of the highest quality and commitment; improving the quality/usefulness of courses taught; establishing exemplary programs; utilizing available resources, including new information technologies and informal education; and establishing a procedure to determine costs of required improvements and how to pay for them. Each of these areas is discussed in this report. In addition, the following information is provided in appendices (exhibits): brief descriptions of program/activities reviewed during the preparation of the report, suggested course topics and criteria for their selection, costs of recommended federal initiatives, imaginative ways to enhance teacher compensation, and computer uses in schools.

Thus, the research consisted of a comparative study within classrooms with a focus on children in high and low reading groups and between home and school.  Results of this and other studies are summarized within six categories: learning and teaching as an interactive process, differential access to learning opportunities, oral and written schemata, social network influences on school children, informal learning in home and school, and methodological observations on ethnography and natural experiments.

To understand education's function in a capitalist society, it is necessary to emphasize that capitalist education, like the capitalist state, has a dual character. On the one hand, capitalist education provides means to contribute to the reproduction of the capitalist system, either as a tool to enlarge capital accumulation and labor force reproduction, or as an instrument which enhances political domination structures, practices, and codes. On the other hand, education is forcefully  expressing the notion of national sovereignty and civil society's demands upon the state, e.g., people's expectations toward greater social mobility. Thus, at the same time that capitalist education is in strong correspondence to the social organization of labor and to the social relations of production, it constitutes by itself a moral and an empirical expression of democracy in capitalist society.

General guidelines for photocopying are offered, with attention given to planning the finished product, obtaining samples before proceeding, and attending to copyright laws. The second section of the paper addresses the cost-effectiveness and techniques used in offset printing. A description of two basic types of offset presses (web-fed and sheet-fed) is followed by an explanation of the  jobs for which each press is best suited. Suggestions for choosing a good printer, minimizing offset printing costs, and obtaining accurate cost estimates are also offered. Suggestions for reducing printing costs are based on the generalization that the per-unit cost of photocopying remains the same regardless of the number of copies printed, while the per-unit cost of offset printing goes down as the number of copies goes up. The importance of matching the job to the most appropriate equipment and then designing the job to make the most efficient use of that equipment is the central theme throughout the paper. (LH)",

        "description":"The importance of following prescribed principles in the implementation of an effective law-related education (LRE) program is emphasized. Based on research findings that law-related education is a delinquency-prevention technique, the fact sheet lists six prescriptions for providing effective law-related education programs: (1) the use of teaching strategies that foster true interaction and joint work among students; (2) the judicious selection and presentation of illustrative case materials; (3) the provision of a sufficient quantity of instruction; (4) adequate preparation and use of outside resource persons; (5) professional peer support for teachers; and (6) active involvement of building administrators in law-related education. The document concludes that while research may  reveal other factors to be important, these six factors are critical in enabling teachers to provide LRE programs that are effective for delinquency-prevention.

Educators need to reinforce examples of the work ethic and emphasize the value of deferred gratification. Similarly, a service component should be included in high school graduation requirements. Students could perform such services as tutoring, acting as school hosts and peer counselors, contributing to school beautification, and participating in charity drives. Community projects could consist of entertaining the infirm, observing and interviewing adults engaged in service to the community, and  studying the methods of service organizations. Service awards and a &quot;service to school and community&quot; component on report cards could enhance the concept of service. A service-oriented educational experience could make the difference in our national spirit, direction, ethics, and production. (LH)",

        "description":"A classification of remote sensing courses throughout the world, the world-wide need for sensing instruction, and alternative instructional methods for meeting those needs are discussed. Remote sensing involves aerial photointerpretation or the use of satellite and other non-photographic imagery; its focus is to interpret what is in the photograph or image. Remote sensing courses are classified into four models on the basis of the strength or weakness of the education and training components of each course. The first model is exemplified by high quality, graduate level programs in which relatively few photographs and images are studied, with a quantitative and specific discipline emphasis aimed at minimizing the need for expensive field work. The second model involves a strong  education component with weak training; students usually study a wide variety of images illustrating diverse topics. The third model, most often used in internal courses of defense organizations, rates low in educational aspects but strong in training. The fourth model, weak in both education and training, is common in small schools and less developed countries. Recommendations are for strengthening the system of lectures and practical classes through short courses, seminars, workshops, and nontraditional methods. A course in the distance education program at the University of Brasilia (Brazil) is described. (Author/KC)",

The first part of the paper, a journalistic approach to sociology, traces the notion of the sociologist as a super-reporter using participant-observation methods as an example of efforts to make qualitative methods a legitimate research tool in social science. Next, the author touches on the risks and personal involvement necessary when using journalistic observation techniques and cites several examples of the extremes journalists go to in order to obtain certain kinds of information. Then the author discusses investigative reporting by journalists as well as  sociologists into the nature and quality of the media. The uncovering of the Watergate scandal is listed as one example of investigative reporting using participant observation and ethnographic techniques. Several sociologists are cited for their ethnographic studies of communications and the media. In the last part of the paper, the author focuses on the differences and similarities in techniques used by both journalists and sociologists and concludes that many journalists and sociologists recognize that qualitative observations are more useful than quantitative, abstract approaches to understanding the human condition.

Pre-project activities included media publicity, reviewing social studies courses to determine which ones lent themselves to the project goals, and selection of participants. Secondary teachers from the Memphis (Tennessee) public schools attended classes to learn about the anthropological concepts of human diversity and ethnicity, and then, under the leadership of Memphis State University staff, developed instructional modules that utilized a problem solving and valuing approach for use in the schools' social  studies courses. Pre- and post-tests indicated an improvement of teachers' knowledge of ethnicity concepts. The modules were critiqued by university staff and outside reviewers; revisions were made based on the feedback. Appendices, which comprise about half the report, include advertising information, a listing and definitions of the anthropological concepts dealt with, an outline of the module concepts for the various social studies subject areas, and a time line of project activities.

The six issues discussed apply to either undergraduate programs that are autonomous social work programs (such as departments of social work) or to programs located in sociology departments, combined with sociology, or combined with other social sciences. The paper recommends that in order to survive, administrators of social education programs need to: (1) legitimize social work as a social science, based on the premise that social work is derived from theoretical and applied research; (2) recognize social work as a profession that operates from both an interdisciplinary base and from its own theoretical and conceptual base in attempting planned social change; (3) offer  social work courses to undergraduate majors from other departments as well as to related professional and allied health disciplines to encourage more students to enroll in social work courses; (4) develop a limited number of graduate social work courses to support closely related graduate programs in social science; (5) develop and implement both continuing education and off-campus programs to recruit students from other social service agencies; and (6) establish the autonomy of undergraduate social work programs. These recommendations, which are currently implemented by North Texas State University, offer pragmatic suggestions for improving undergraduate social work education and ensuring its future survival.

Section 1 traces the use of technology for warfare through the mastery of ocean-going sailing, the maturation of the airplane, and the development of nuclear weapons. This section suggests that these developments have led to a loss rather than an increase in security. Section 2 discusses the &quot;transparency revolution,&quot; which refers to the military reconnaissance, sensing, command, and communication systems literally wiring the earth with a web of electronic intelligence. Section 3 focuses on current military strategies: mutually assured destruction (MAD), nuclear utilization theories (NUTS), and, according to the author's personal projection, destruction-entrusted automatic devices (DEAD).  The differences in these strategies are explained: to start a war in the MAD era would have required a major political misjudgment; in NUTS, a major human error; in DEAD, a major machine malfunction. Section 4 outlines elements of planetary security. It suggests that the same transparent technology now pushing superpower military competition to its most dangerous level can be used to construct an alternative security system. Section 5 promotes good neighbor politics. The final section concludes with the notion that while technology may have overwhelmed human ethical capabilities, it has not overwhelmed our passion for security. (KC)",

Symbols through which people define themselves culturally include idiomatic usage of the language, morals, religion, aesthetics, politics, common practices, and the role assigned to science.

Themes explored include the conflict between individual and societal needs, the relationship of the individual to state and federal authority, individual rights, the shifting balance of power among the three branches of government, the influence of social and economic conditions on judicial decision making, and the U.S. constitution as an instrument of governance. The document is organized into four sections roughly corresponding to the chronological periods in most U.S. history courses: Colonial Period through Revolution, Growth of a New Nation, Civil War through Industrialization, and The Modern Era. Activities, which require  critical thinking, reasoning, problem solving, and inquiry skills, include opinion polls/surveys, role plays, simulations, case studies, mock trials, appellate court simulations, adversary models, and learning stations. Many of the activities focus on landmark Supreme Court cases and modern cases to elucidate the meaning and judicial interpretation of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights. Topics include the Salem witch trials, lawful inspection, the Alien and Sedition Acts, the Dred Scott case, Plessy v. Ferguson, the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, the McCarthy era, and Watergate. Each activity includes an introduction, objectives, recommended grade level, time and materials needed, instructions, and masters for student handouts. (KC)",

There are four chapters. The first chapter provides basic information to help a user understand the computer. Discussed are how the computer is put together and how it works. To help teachers generate ideas about how this new educational aid might be useful in terms of their own teaching objectives, the second chapter describes why and how other educators are using the computer. Chapter 3 is an introduction to software evaluation, i.e., how computer programs that are available for use in the classroom can be judged. Criteria are presented. It is suggested that teachers using computer-assisted instruction should have a  feel for some of the broader issues related to computers in education, as well as practical knowledge. The purpose of the fourth chapter, which deals with social and educational issues and directions, is to provide a perspective about these broader issues and a context into which teachers might place their own activities. Most of the book's readings provide a bibliography of references and further resources. In addition, a list of resources available through the ERIC system is provided. (RM)",

Areas of services included therapeutic recreation, community/school and voluntary/youth agencies, outdoor recreation and parks, and a variety of other miscellaneous fields such as combinations of the above, industrial recreation, college unions, etc. Positions included leadership roles such as therapists or program leaders, technical jobs, supervisory roles, and administrative positions. Findings revealed that, overall, the women have positive attitudes about their own leisure. It was also found that women in leisure service professions have androgynous personality characteristics which allow them to be both masculine and feminine, agentic and communal, and assertive and nurturing. In  general, women in leisure services tend to be more nontraditional in their sex-role orientation. Results also indicated that few differences exist among the women surveyed in terms of demographics and personality, and age appeared to be the primary differentiating factor among the women in this study.

A summary offered of psychological research on the nature of expertise indicates that experts often know more, in a more elaborate way, about the subject than novices and organize knowledge in a different fashion. It is also noted that tasks presented elicit different levels of schema--that is, the same elements in a task may be identified by both experts and novices, but key elements trigger deeper, and more elaborate schema for experts than for novices. A description is given of an evaluation study in which novices (observers with two years of classroom experience) and experts (teachers) estimated the overlap between the curriculum to which a child had  been exposed and a criterion test for each child. Four of the teachers and three of the observers were further asked to provide a discussion of their thoughts while doing the overlap task. The quantitative findings are reviewed, and the qualitative findings are discussed in detail. Also included are quotations of subjects' thoughts, as the subjects formed conclusions on and predicted the potential abilities and expected achievement of the children. Directions for the overlap test are appended as well as diagrams illustrating the subjects' thought processes. (JD)",

A review is presented of previous work by educational psychologists and cognitive scientists who have explored epistemological theories as they apply to the act of teaching. A description is given of the sequence of mental processes an expert teacher uses in planning and teaching a lesson, the knowledge base from which the teacher operates, and how it determines the  structure of activity episodes for the lesson. Also discussed are empirical studies that provide detailed information regarding characteristics of knowledge that constitute cognitive skill in teaching, including general schematic knowledge of teaching activities, construction of plans, knowledge of the subject matter and related pedagogy, and detailed sequences of events that occur during presentation of lessons.

Four supervisors, with their respective supervisees, participated in the study. Participants were videotaped and observed, and transcripts of conference dialogues and participant thought processes were analyzed. A comparison of general behavior patterns associated with supervisors who were more abstract or more concrete was made. More abstract supervisors used \"feeding\" questioning strategies: information-seeking, information-giving, delimiting, and guiding. They also held questions in abeyance (witholding expertise but not support) and stimulated supervisees to conduct analyses for themselves. Only when they were unable  to elicit satisfactory appraisal from the supervisee did they give direct feedback. More concrete supervisors tended to ask inappropriate questions, emphasized the giving of critical feedback rather than probing, and seemed to encounter difficulties in communicating corrective feedback.

The Nutrition Services address a number of problems faced by the nation's elderly, such as dietary inadequacy, declining health status, social isolation, and limited access to social and health services. The major activity of the service is to provide one nutritionally balanced meal per day to the elderly, either in a congregate dining setting or through the provision of home-delivered meals. A second major goal of Nutrition Services is to ameliorate isolation and loneliness that can characterize less mobile elderly citizens. Nutrition sites are also  encouraged to provide certain supportive services, if needed, to participants. This evaluation's major concern was whether Nutrition Services significantly benefited older Americans. Some of the survey findings regarding the service population, program characteristics and operations and Nutrition Services' impacts on the elderly include: (1) the participant population is stable; (2) older persons participate frequently in Nutrition Services; (3) most congregate sites are operating at or near capacity; (4) transportation is available to participants at most sites; (5) volunteers (mostly participants) play an important role; (6) Nutrition Services achieve the goal of enhancing dietary intake, offer social benefits to both home-delivered and congregate participants, and provide support  services to those who tend to need them most; and (7) nutrition education activities have no discernible impact on participants' dietary intake.

        "description":"A field experiment was conducted to determine whether descriptive-correlational results from classroom management research could be implemented by junior high school teachers, and whether such implementation would result in improved classroom management. An experimental group (18 teachers) received management manuals developed by researchers, and attended research-based workshops on class management, while a control group did not. In addition to observation-based data, information on performance was obtained from teachers' responses to a questionnaire assessing their reactions to each section of the manual, and interviews with teachers. Results are presented by management area: (1) room arrangement; (2) rules and procedures; (3) procedures for student accountability; (4)  consequence systems; (5) first week activities; (6) maintaining skills, monitoring, and discipline; (7) instructional clarity; (8) organizing instruction; and (9) adjusting instruction for special groups. Comparisons of the two groups by management areas indicated that some recommendations were used more than others, with certain areas not showing evidence of implementation. Results indicated greater use by experimental teachers of recommended management behaviors and activities along with improved student classroom behavior during the first 2 months of the school year. However, observations made during the middle of the year did not detect significant differences between the groups. (Author/JD)",

Observation data from two classes per teacher were used to assess the level of implementation by treatment group teachers. Results indicated that, as a group, the teachers who received the treatment did not use the recommended strategies significantly more than did the control group teachers. Interview data identified possible reasons for these findings. Because of the small sample size, the power of statistical tests to detect differences between the groups was weak. A survey of teachers' individual scores indicated this was not a homogeneous group of &quot;poor  managers&quot;; several teachers evidenced few management problems. The presentation mode for management information was inappropriate for this group; no specific feedback was given. The teachers may not have perceived a match between their needs and research suggestions. Most of the rules, procedures, instructional plans, and materials were ones that the teachers had used before, and the teachers may have felt defensive after having been recommended by their principals as being among those who would find the materials useful. Seven detailed tables display report data. (Author/JD)",

Each group was presented a social studies lesson based on an article in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly.&quot; After the lesson, each group was tested on comprehension of the material, and then each group completed a lesson evaluation. Teacher uncertainty significantly reduced achievement, and lecture notes significantly increased achievement. While handouts positively affected achievement, students rated lessons significantly lower on  four of the lesson evaluation items when they received lecture notes. One possible explanation for this may be that students preferred a different format for their notes, such as full notes or personal notes. (Author/JD)",

Current studies have indicated that early field experiences, by focusing on how to complete classroom tasks and by excluding consideration of why tasks are important, encourage imitation rather than reflective thinking and experimentation. An effective early field experience program should promote teaching candidates' analytical skills and their teaching concepts and skills. Program designers should consider establishing a content structure, in teaching methods courses, which will serve as a foci for observation  activities. Preservice students would be expected to integrate field observation information with formal descriptions and definitions in subsequent coursework, addressing the components of clinical pedagogical knowledge, e.g., diagnosis, communication, planning, managing, and evaluation.

Differences in categories, terminology, and definitions of five classroom observation instruments are delineated and discussed in relation to their various effects on the validity of process-product research findings. The instruments analyzed are: (1) Teacher and Child Dyadic Interaction observation system; (2) Reading and Mathematics Observation System (RAMOS); (3) Coding System for the First Grade Reading Group Study; (4) Classroom Observation Instrument; and (5) Group Reading Interaction Pattern Observation Instrument (GRIP). Inconsistencies between actual verbal behaviors and teachers' intentions for these verbal behaviors are also  discussed. Suggestions for selecting and writing terms and definitions point out the necessity for consistency of terminology and definitions of categories and subcategories across observation instruments. It is recommended that coding of teachers' intended behaviors, rather than their exact linguistic form, would result in more valid findings in the area of process-product research. (Author/JD)",

Second, the proportions of bachelor's recipients obtaining teaching jobs in both years were not significantly different, 77 percent for 1979-80, and 75 percent for 1976-77. Third, bachelor's recipients newly qualified to teach in 1976-77  and 1979-80 fared better on labor market measures than did any other bachelor's recipients as a group, whether they taught or not.

Specifically, it reports on the experiences of a faculty team that developed a preservice program to prepare students for teaching pupils from diverse backgrounds, with the ultimate goal of fostering equity in educational institutions. An analysis is made of written documentation of the topics covered in the two-year period during which the team met to develop the new program according to stated goals. Four stages of program development are identified: (1) concept clarification--what do diversity and equity mean? (2) course development--what shall we teach in our individual courses? (3) program design--how do all these courses hang together? and (4) bureaucratic approval--how can we get the program passed?  It is concluded that, although discourse emphases were appropriate during these stages, the discourse in the meetings was neither cohesive nor cumulative and that persistent flight from addressing substantive issues in program development resulted in a continuous erosion of program goals. A brief discussion is presented on the implications of these findings for the implementation of educational innovations in general. (Author/JD)",

The first section deals with the pretraining phase, before prospective teachers even realize they are learning things that will shape their future teaching. The second section looks at the preservice phase, when future teachers undertake their formal preparation. The third section examines the induction phase, which coincides with the first year of teaching. The fourth section examines the inservice phase, which covers the rest of the teacher's career. Despite the limitations of the knowledge base, this broad perspective enables assessment of the relative contribution of formal and informal influences on teachers' learning.  Three general assertions are developed in this paper: (1) Formal arrangements for teacher education and training do not fit with what is known about how teachers learn to teach and how they improve their teaching over time; (2) Informal influences figure more prominently in learning to teach, but often have miseducative effects; and (3) Creating more appropriate arrangements to support teachers' learning involves changing not only what educators do but also how they think about learning to teach.

An analysis was made of the relationship between teachers' work experiences over the course of their careers within specific institutional structures, and their perceptions of the meanings of these work experiences to their self-esteem, sense of job satisfaction, and sense of efficacy. Selected excerpts from the interviews reveal the teachers' attitudes, thinking, and perceptions about: (1) conflicts inherent in the accepted goals of public education and the reality of public schools as they operate on a daily basis; (2) conflicting standards teachers face and their recognition of their inabilities to meet  societal expectations; (3) historical roots and continuing impact of conflicting demands on teachers; (4) divisions within the school staff which create an increasingly hierarchical and segmented working force; (5) pressures and expectations that lead to burnout; and (6) teachers' positions within the school system and institutional conflicts inherent in the teachers' roles.

In the introduction, background considerations are made, previous research is reviewed, and the report itself is outlined. The first chapter, \"Finding Goals Outside the Laboratory,\" discusses how laboratory tasks can obscure research goals and talks about different research settings. \"Bases for a Theory of Learning in Interaction,\" the second chapter, covers the essentials of a theory that can adequately account for the appropriation process that happens in teacher-student interaction. \"Misappropriating Cognitive Processes\" is the topic of the third chapter, which discusses the problem of correctly coding cognitive processes in a classroom. The fourth chapter is concerned  with \"Learning and Assessment\" and an analysis of the concept of a \"zone of proximal development\" for assessing children while in interaction with adults. Chapter 5, \"But It's Important Data!: Making the Demands of a Cognitive Experiment Meet the Educational Imperatives of the Classroom,\" contains discussion with the teacher whose classroom was used for experiments; conflicts inherent in the teacher-researcher relationship are covered. Chapter 6, \"Long Division of Labor: In Support of An Interactive Learning Theory,\" illustrates how the \"zone\" is actively constructed in the teacher-child interaction. The seventh chapter offers \"Conclusions\" and implications of the work for researchers and for educators. (CJ)",

Research took the form of a case study, and qualitative research methods of participant observation and indepth interviewing were used to collect data over an 8-month period at an elementary school in the northeastern United States. One other school was also studied for a shorter period of time for contrasting purposes. This report centers on the discussions of four major themes which emerged from the data: (1) teachers' understanding of the nature of their careers; (2) importance of autonomy in their work lives; (3) their need for a sense of community among colleagues;  and (4) their methods for resolving conflicts. The findings suggest that current understandings of teachers' lives have been limited by stereotypical assumptions about the nature of women. (Author/JMK)",

TRLs worked as peers with teachers and administrators in selected school sites. This review provides an analysis of the program's processes by answering select questions: (1) What kind of research is adaptable to classroom situations? (2) What is required to make findings adaptable to classroom situations? (3) What were program staff's roles in facilitating the process? (4) What were teachers'  roles in facilitating the process? (5) To what degree were researchers involved in the process? (6) What is needed to continue the process at the pilot sites? and (7) What is needed to replicate the process for future use?

        "author":["Whitmer, Sylvia Pratt"],
        "description":"A study was designed to generate a description of 5 elementary school teachers' judgment processes during marking (of 152 students) across a school year. The findings support a model of the marking judgment constructed from the strategies and cues that emerged through analysis of marks, record books, and interviews. The model presents a three-phase process that was guided by procedural and contingency rules. Findings indicate that task completion is the primary focus of the judgment, with the criterion of completion having a variable weight. The marking judgment is bounded by the classroom, a conclusion which suggests that many past marking studies have made assumptions about marks that are inappropriate to the teacher judgment process. The study found that formative marks serve  as a feedback mechanism but that summative and final marks do not. Although specific conclusions are tentative because of the small sample size, the model is useful as a heuristic to generate further discussion, deliberation, and research hypotheses. Tables displaying report data are included as is an appendix listing teacher attribution-utility categories. (Author/JMK)",

Certain ETS programs permit the use of the candidate's reader or the use of amanuensis, that is, someone who records answers for the candidate. The primary goal of anyone who adapts an ETS Test for blind or visually-impaired candidates is to provide a test that presents a task equivalent to that presented to sighted candidates. This manual contains both an outline of existing procedures and a number of recommendations. Its purpose is to aid test development staff who have responsibility for preparing tests in large-print, Braille, and cassette editions. Program Direction staff has the responsibility for  planning the production of special editions, arranging for printing and taping, deciding testing time, designating which test form will be the base test for special editions, and checking quality control. The roles of test development coordinator, assembler and adapter are discussed. Guidelines for item adaptation and narration include special considerations for quantitative item types. Test development tasks in adapting tests for the visually impaired, a checklist for test adapter, test adapter's control sheet, and additional information about testing the handicapped are included in the appendices.

Review of the studies conducted on tests receiving major use in higher education reveals that though one cannot make a priori classifications of outliers with confidence, one can with reasonable confidence predict the relatively advantaged group for many verbal items if they subsequently prove to be outliers as follows: aesthetic-philosophical, human relations or female oriented content relatively favors females as opposed to males; practical affairs, science or male oriented content relatively favors males as opposed to females; science content relatively favors whites as opposed to blacks. For test content that varies in  the degree of relatedness to minorities, one would predict a relative advantage for those outliers that are most related to minorities. The magnitude of the differences found is not large; perhaps larger differences would be found if classifications other than race and sex, which are the most common, were used. It has been found that differences in cultural or national origin produce larger discrepancies in item difficulty than differences in race or sex of essentially native American groups. (Author)",

Generally, courses in all areas were rated as satisfactory or excellent, with music receiving especially high marks and mathematics the lowest marks. Students mentioned study skills as an area in which they felt they needed additional preparation. Ninety-one percent of the students reported that they were currently working, mainly in professional and technical jobs and felt that their high school program helped them to develop appropriate work habits and attitudes toward work. The data show that post-high school work experience generally  reflected the course of study undertaken while in high school. Regarding postsecondary education, 73 percent reported having attended a college, trade, business, or vocational school since graduation, and 38 percent reported having completed a post-high school course of study. Counseling services appear to have been a problem; of special concern was the lack of information about financial aid available and the reputation of schools and colleges in the student areas of interest.

        "description":"The symbolic function of curricular debate, as it is manifested in the minimum competency testing movement (MCT), is investigated. Curricular debate necessarily reflects the demands of the society in which it arises. The topics that are addressed spring from this milieu and the language in which issues are couched must be appropriate to it. Examination of the MCT literature shows that educators do not recognize the symbolic power of curricular debate. Typically, educators writing about MCT defend the past or the status quo and reject MCT out of hand or they flow with the times and accept it without question. The writing of those who have climbed on the MCT &quot;bandwagon&quot; provides an example of the confusion that results when curricular issues are not treated reflectively. The first  section of this paper asks what proponents of MCT want, in order to demonstrate that a straightforward answer is hard to pinpoint. In the second section of the paper, responses to MCT which are more analytical are examined. Neither simply rejecting nor accepting MCT, the writers reviewed in this section recognize and call attention to philosophical and political issues raised by the movement, but fail to recognize the power of their own educational discourse. All attempt to reconstruct the MCT movement and divert its popularity to other educational purposes, but new problems arise from their unselfconscious use of language. (LC)",

Approximately 11,400 young men and women from all 50 states and the District of Columbia made up the civilian sample; an additional 1,300 youth in the armed forces were selected for interviewing under funding from the Department of Defense and the Services. The interdisciplinary nature of the Center's research staff, the interests of the agencies who helped fund the survey, and an interest in maintaining comparability with the first four cohorts  in terms of human capital and other sociometric variables, labor market experience variables, and environmental variables are reflected in the survey's content. Three additional data sets on school characteristics, student transcripts, and scores on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery were collected for use with the longitudinal interviews.

It examines the common expressions students used in open-ended interviews to describe their teachers and their experience within these teachers' classes. A semantic structure that underlies the terms that students used to describe their teachers was conceptualized in the following form: the highest level of abstraction and generalizability were four foci (academic work, instructional facility, classroom experience, and personal characteristics), each of which subsumed between two and four themes. Each theme referred to a spectrum of individual variation of a teacher's possible behavior and style of personality, with two evaluatively opposed  contrast poles at which students' descriptions clustered. Together, these foci and themes provide students with a semiotic space which is rich enough to convey their experiences of school life, and at the same time has the definition and specificity necessary for effective and precise communication with peers. The structure provides insight into the communication system, and the perceptions and values, of the sub-culture which students form for themselves within a school. (PN)",

The main purpose in describing cognitive structure is to see whether differences in memory (or cognitive structure) are related to subsequent differences in performance. This purpose influences the discussions of both models and dimensions of cognitive structure and current methods of assessing cognitive structure. The model of cognitive structure discussed is a static one, consisting of four units or elements: propositions, images, episodes, and intellectual skills. These elements, in turn, affect the nine dimensions of cognitive structure considered:  extent, precision, internal consistency, accord with reality, variety of types of element, variety of topics, shape (or form of organization of cognitive structure), ratio of internal to external associations, and availability. Among the current methods of assessing cognitive structure that are discussed are school tests, word associations, graph construction, general interviews, and restricted interviews. Future developments in methods of describing cognitive structure include refining procedures for converting responses obtained by present methods to a vector of dimensional scores, or inventing new methods, each directed at a single dimension.

The Questions for Teachers and Questions for Administrators surveys are both sent out annually to determine the attitudes of District staff on issues of importance districtwide. The Former Student Survey is conducted every other year. This survey asks graduates from the previous year about their present activities and the quality of the education they received in AISD. The attitudes of teachers and administrators can be compared on those items included on both surveys. A few of these are included in this report. Some items have also been included on the same survey for several years to allow a long-term look at  changes in attitudes. The Former Student Survey includes items primarily of this type, plus some items on projects or topics of special interest.

        "description":"This evaluation report describes the process by which a large, urban-suburban school system evaluated its vocational education program and the results of the evaluation. The evaluation was built upon a set of broad evaluation questions addressing two components of the vocational-technical program: (1) questions related to employer needs and program planning, and (2) questions related to the vocational-technical centers and the comprehensive high school programs. Although the specific program area of focus was vocational-technical education, the design is applicable to other curricula. The evaluation, which was advised by representatives of the public and local industry, provided for survey data from a variety of sources which impacted on or were impacted by vocational education.  The value of the design is that it is manageable, can be implemented by a small staff, uses instruments which, although locally constructed, appear to be valid, and provides for a report of results which is comprehensive yet understandable by a lay board of education and which provides direction for ongoing program refinement and improvement.

The right to notice is the most straight-forward and firmly established principle to emerge from competency testing litigation. Students must have fair warning and opportunity to prepare for competency tests and/or to prepare for changed graduation requirements. The length of notice should be related to the magnitude of the new requirements. The tests must measure what students have learned, therefore, content validation is legally required. However, controversy remains concerning how to satisfy a content validation requirement. Test impact on special populations must be considered. Competency tests may not reflect  racial or cultural bias. And, although special students are not necessarily entitled to regular diplomas, those completing their agreed upon individualized education programs have a right to some certification, such as a special diploma.

Achievement scores are lower for children from one-parent than from two-parent homes. The effect appears to work primarily through the lower income of one-parent homes and its impact on subsequent variables in the model. The effects of maternal working differ for various subgroups. Children from two-parent homes have lower achievement if the mother works, and the magnitude of the effect is directly related to the amount of time worked. For black children from two-parent homes the direct effect is negative, but the total effect is offset by enhanced family income; no such offsetting,  positive effect appears for comparable white children. Black children from one-parent homes have higher achievement if the mother works, mediated to a large extent by increased family income. (Author)",

Findings indicate that while overall performance in mathematics and science declined, reading performance remained stable. Students in the lowest performance quartiles realized greater gains than did those in the highest quartiles. Although black students in both the lowest and highest quartiles showed more improvement in reading and mathematics than their white counterparts, all highest quartile 17-year-olds suffered substantial losses in mathematics and science. State boards of education  and teacher training institutions might ensure higher achievement levels in science and mathematics by: (1) reviewing the relationship between teacher training and curricular needs in mathematics and science; (2) reconsidering current retention and remediation policies that separate students from their age/grade group for remediation; and (3) ensuring that the curriculum covers both low level and high level skills.

It has been argued that the increased role of business in  the schools will have no ill effects, but some concerns which have been voiced are the possible acceptance of a corporate ideology, a shifting of the blame for declining worker productivity to the schools, a lack of guidelines and accountability for programs, and a change in educational priorities.

The reanalysis provides considerable support for the Featherman-Jones-Hauser hypothesis, which claims that there is convergence in mobility processes once conditions of occupational supply and demand are controlled. The hypothesis is modified, however, in two respects: First, it is qualified by the suggestion that uniformity in mobility regimes is not limited to highly industrialized societies but may apply equally to less developed societies; and second, it is elaborated through specification of the structure of the shared mobility regime. Properties of mobility shared by the 16 countries considered are: (1) symmetry of exchange between  occupational strata; (2) equality of mobility chances off the main diagonal; (3) severe immobility at the two extremes of the occupational hierachy; and (4) considerable mobility in the middle of the hierachy. These findings of basic similarity do not preclude findings of deviation from the common mobility regime, which seem to be at least as much a consequence of political organization as of economic development. The effects of political and economic variables on mobility processes are more complex than commonly supposed because they differ across occupational strata. (Author/CMG)",

Moreover, urban public schools cannot be left as underdeveloped institutions for the rapidly growing black underclass, which is becoming increasingly powerless and angry. In the midst of the clash of cultures between the declining welfare state and the emerging Managerial Estate, black institutions of higher education must contribute new, innovative, and progressive ideas. Several critical areas demand attention: (1) the need for multidisciplinary studies; (2) the  significance and necessity of international studies; (3) a systematic examination of Western civilization and Judaeo-Christian culture; (4) the need to emphasize research and instruction in science and technology, as well as the social functions of science and technology, to develop scientists capable of making ethical decisions; (5) the need to become future-oriented; (6) the need to develop new leadership from within the black community; and (7) the need for increased interaction between black institutions and the black community.

First, in the area of voting rights, Reynolds describes how jurisdictions covered by the &quot;preclearance&quot; requirements of the Voting Rights Act were asked to submit redistricting plans to the Attorney General's office for approval; no proposal, he emphasizes, was cleared until officials were sure that it had neither a racially discriminatory purpose nor effect. Other efforts to ensure black Americans' right to vote are also outlined. Second, the record of the Reagan Administration in criminal civil rights prosecutions is reviewed briefly. Third, Reynolds discusses school  desegregation, outlining suits filed by the Federal government against various school districts. Fourth, enforcement of fair housing statutes is discussed, and fifth, Federal efforts to erase employment discrimination are described. In conclusion, Reynolds contends that despite charges to the contrary, the Justice Department under Reagan is indeed enforcing civil rights for racial minorities. (GC)",

The program's two major activities consisted of home visits conducted by educational interns and parent workshops. Objectives were (1) that 70 percent of participating parents would implement instruction at least 4 out of 5 days per week, following each home visit; and (2) that 80 percent of participating students would master at least 5 new skills, as determined by their performance on designated strands of  the Vort Behavioral Characteristics Progression (BCP). Two problems were encountered which hampered program effectiveness. First was the use of unpaid educational interns, which resulted in high turnover and extensive time expenditure for training. Second was the difficulty of recruiting interns to visit families in neighborhoods that were perceived to be unsafe. Nonetheless, program objectives were either met or surpassed. (GC)",

Project Speak was initiated to stimulate the language development of preschool handicapped children through direct instruction and parent training. The program provided home-based language intervention, with training consisting of twice-weekly, 50-minute home visits designed to foster language development, demonstrate appropriate and constructive adult-child intervention, and assist parents in reinforcing the language acquisition skills of their severely to profoundly handicapped children. Parents were also trained in developmentally appropriate language activities. Analyses of data from formal and project-developed measures  indicate that program objectives were met or surpassed. Participating children improved significantly in both auditory language comprehension and expressive language ability. In addition, parents and guardians of participating children gradually increased their use of the environment and of their own language development. It is thus recommended that the program's instructional techiques be replicated in other programs for preschool handicapped children and that they be tested and, if successful, implemented with older handicapped children.

        "description":"This report presents evaluation findings for the 1982 summer cycle of &quot;Reading and Math Through the Community as Classroom,&quot; a Title I funded program operated by the Division of Special Education, of the New York City Public Schools. The program was designed to provide supplementary remediation to 1,197 mildly to moderately handicapped youngsters, and incorporate community experiences and sports activities into reading and math instruction. Results of analyses of pupil achievement data and program interviews and observations indicated that the summer program effectively met its proposed goals. Nearly all of the program participants mastered one or more new skills in reading (87.8 percent) and in math (91.9 percent). Students were also reported by teachers to have made social  gains. Program sites were well-chosen and staff were enthusiastic. During 1982, the program made improvements over previous years in preparation, implementation, teacher appointments, and transportation services. However, attrition and the need to recruit new students posed problems. Based on evaluation findings, it is recommended (1) that pre-planning be undertaken as early as possible to ensure optimal student recruitment, teacher assignment, and provision of materials and supplies, and (2) that difficulties with transportation be addressed, possibly by utilizing mini-bus services and by requiring pre-program trial runs.

This report describes the program's history, philosophy, organization and staffing, funding, and goals and objectives; outlines activities undertaken in both its instructional and noninstructional components; and presents evaluation findings for 1981-82, the program's second year. It is concluded that most participating students at both schools surpassed program objectives in English, equalled or surpassed objectives in mathematics, science, social studies, and in business and vocational education, and performed well in their native language courses.  In addition, the average attendance rate of program students exceeded the school average by 20 percent. In noninstructional areas, a biology text was developed for classroom use, and a translation of general science curriculum materials was begun. Academic and personal counseling was available to students, and family workers made home visits to parents when necessary. In turn, parents were generally responsive, attending program meetings and participating in the voluntary advisory committee. Development activities for staff included workshops, staff meetings, conferences, and university courses. (GC)",

A number of tables are presented to show that under Reagan, fewer women have been appointed to top fulltime positions at most departments and agencies, and that a sharp drop in the appointments of blacks has also occurred. Also illustrated is a lower representation of women and minority men among presidential appointments to the Federal judiciary, to U.S.  attorney and U.S. marshal positions, to ambassadorships, and to top Foreign Service and other positions at the State Department.

Common shortcomings of health promotion programs are analyzed and a four-phase &quot;healthy community system&quot; model is described. Within each phase (start-up, involvement, installing change, and sustaining change), strategies for mobilizing individuals and groups in such a way that accounts for the sociocultural characteristics of each community are outlined. The importance of integrating the gains of any health promotion  program into existing services, agencies, and community life is stressed.

        "description":"Many degree programs for adults include a self-directed learning component to offer learners the opportunity to use mature skills in a flexible learning environment. Problems with making the self-directed component work may be the learning setting, learner attitudes, and fears of both skilled and less skilled adult learners. Some learner fears are best understood through a comparison of self-directed learning as carried out in formal and informal settings. Adult learners control their learning direction outside formal settings and share control within. The increased number of initiators within the formal setting often complicates the learning process, and learners may seek to clarify the roles of persons involved. Institutional credibility is strengthened by the provision of  clear expectations and role definitions. The traditional grading process also presents barriers to the effective facilitation of self-directed learning. Other major areas of concern are how self-directed the program will be, how program expectations will be clarified for learners, program standards, and the program definition of self-directed learning. These fears must be recognized and dispelled to develop effective self-directed learning programs in formal settings. (YLB)",

Three major topics are treated by addressing three corresponding sets of questions. The first set of questions provides a framework for describing the mathematical and decision sciences, their contemporary influences in graduate professional education, and the issue of whether a common core of mathematical science skills exists that all practitioners should possess. The second group of questions offers a guide  for examining the influences of the decision sciences in graduate professional schools traditionally associated with the managerial and social sciences. Discussion focuses on how various professions and specific institutions are approaching the development of mathematical methods and techniques as practical tools for use in everyday situations. The final group of questions explores opportunities to link the decision sciences with leadership development and training efforts in vocational education. Seven appendixes and four inserts, amounting to over one-half of the essay, are papers, articles, or supplemental material on the topic. (YLB)",

The mandatory nature of continuing allied health education violates two of the basic tenets of adult learning theory--that adults voluntarily participate in learning to satisfy personal needs and that adults are generally not comfortable in a structured atmosphere. In addition to being flexible, however, the adult educator providing continuing allied health education must thoroughly understand the educational needs of allied health personnel. The educational goals may be influenced by organizations with an interest in the educational achievement of allied health personnel. Characteristics of allied health personnel make them atypical adult learners. Common  personality types include the \"lifer,\" the transient, ex-military personnel, individuals whose licenses are expiring and who need additional continuing education units quickly, and individuals sent by their supervisors. Various educational settings--the hospital, meetings of professional organizations, and public seminars--have advantages and disadvantages. Some innovative and some effective traditional educational techniques that enhance learning experiences are the workshop or seminar, skills training conducted by staff members, educational television and films, computer-assisted interactive video instruction, and simulations.

During the first part of the study, researchers administered a mail questionnaire to 31 teachers to identify the materials that were used most frequently, to obtain descriptive data about the teachers, and to collect teacher estimates of the readability of the materials being used. Next, the researchers utilized the Dale-Chall Readability Formula to estimate the readability of 75 instructional materials. The analysis revealed that difficult vocabulary constituted from 16 to 29 percent of the vocabulary included in the sample texts. As did previous researchers, the designers of this study found only a  nonsignificant correlation between readability scores and frequency of use. Because of the very low degree of association found between the respondents' length of teaching experience and the readability of the instructional materials that they used, the researchers concluded that increased teacher experience does not increase instructors' ability to estimate readability. In general, teacher estimates of student ability matched their estimates of the readability of instructional materials. In most cases, however, teachers underestimated the reading difficulty of materials as it was determined according to the Dale-Chall formula. (MN)",

While the basic skills measured in competency-based exams were found to be more relevant to advanced jobs in both fields than to entry positions, they appeared to be good predictors of ability to accomplish job-related reading tasks, with general comprehension skills, such as finding a main idea and following a sequence of events to be transferable to reading at work.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the TJDP, researchers conducted three rounds of field research and prepared case studies on each of the 14 project sites. These analyses revealed the TJDP to be a partial success. While several communities either made no attempt or were unsuccessful in carrying out the demonstration's objectives, significant accomplishments were achieved in a few communities. This special record  is not, however, surprising when the economic recession and reductions in federally funded economic development and employment and training programs are taken into consideration. Indeed, the experience of the TJDP site in Portland, Oregon strongly suggests that job targeting strategies can be an effective tool for helping disadvantaged persons obtain unsubsidized employment from private firms assisted by economic development investments.

        "description":"A project provided 2,307 high school juniors in 44 schools in Kansas with a career planning experience through use of the Career Planning Program (CPP), a career guidance instrument. Twelve area vocational-technical school counselors functioned as technical skills trainers to high school counselors and as test materials liaison persons. Data were collected from 1,948 of those students with the Student Needs Assessment Survey (SNAS). The suggested procedure in use of CPP and SNAS was a four-step process: preassessment activities to initiate student thinking about career decision making; assessment; interpretation sessions; and followup activities involving students, parents, and others. Student and counselor evaluations indicated they placed high value on the benefit of the  experience. Student needs were identified in such areas as obtaining information and experience in areas related to career exploration and choice, obtaining more specific information about postsecondary educational possibilities, increasing skills in various educational areas, and learning more about self and others through counseling. (Four tables are included. Appendixes, amounting to over one-half of the report, include lists of participants, a followup questionnaire and data, the SNAS, and a profile of career applicants.)

        "description":"Delegates to this training computer conference agreed that the scope of economic change is both accelerating and profound and, therefore, will require a wide variety of approaches to human resource development. Training is only a small part of this development. To meet future needs, the conferees discussed and made recommendations in four areas: the transition from school to work, transitions in the workplace, dislocation and reentry, and crosscutting issues (those affecting research in human resource development and training handicapped students). On the issue of the transition from school to work, conferees agreed that it was the responsibility of the schools to provide basic skills and occupational competencies but that employers could cooperate to increase the relevance of  these skills and to make the transition more efficient and fair. Conferees considered proposals for providing better labor market information, more counseling and transitional services, and the formation of a National Youth Services Corps. Two themes emerged in the discussion of workplace transitions. The first centered on the view that volume of employee training would have to increase to meet technological changes, although it was doubted that these needs would be met fully, even with tax incentives to encourage employer-provided training. The second theme on employee motivation centered on a variety of merit-based incentives. On the third issue, it was recommended that employees dislocated through technological change receive assistance in finding new jobs and training if needed.  Finally, the conference participants recommended that research linking human resources and productivity be increased and that greater efforts be made to tie handicapped persons to the world of employment.

        "description":"For nearly 50 years, the unemployment insurance program has functioned as a unique and largely successful intergovernmental effort. From its inception, federal and state governments have each had principal jurisdiction over particular aspects of the program and both have shared responsibilities for others. The distribution of authority and responsibilities has provided a balance of power that accounts for the vitality of the program and its responsiveness to new problems over the years. Recent economic developments and political shifts, however, are producing an increasing federal dominance and a departure from long-standing program goals. If the unemployment insurance program is to continue to succeed, it requires a return to the traditional federal-state balance of power. This  book discusses first the original reasoning for the federal-state distribution of responsibilities and the provisions originally adopted to implement the system. It next describes later federal standards and their impact on the balance of power. The administration of the federal laws is explored as well as the process of resolving conflicts. Finally, an assessment is analyzed on the value of the balance to the system and the prospects for its preservation. Recommendations are then made concerning how the balance of power can be reformulated. (KC)",

        "description":"A study analyzed the characteristics that are most responsible for enabling low-income female heads of household to complete technical training programs. The research project was undertaken for the purpose of developing a comprehensive assessment and support system (CASS) to aid women enrolling at one of three target technical programs at San Antonio Technical College in Texas. During the project the following three substudies were conducted: an interview of area employers of San Antonio Technical College graduates; a survey of San Antonio Technical College instructors in data processing, drafting, and electronics; and selection and field testing of the CASS battery. The researchers found that an internal locus of control and a high degree of socialization are necessary but not  sufficient characteristics that enable low-income female heads of household to complete technical programs. Included among the many factors that can negatively affect the academic success of these women are financial problems, family responsibilities, lack of time to study, child care problems, and transportation. Therefore, to be effective, a CASS to assist low-income female heads of household should involve the use of several known personal and performance assessments and should include supportive services in the form of financial aid, child care, peer support, internality workshops, general independence workshops, and employability skills development workshops.

        "description":"This study was conducted to identify factors that affect disadvantaged women in their efforts to gain long-term employment or to complete vocational and technical education programs. Following a review of literature, a questionnaire was prepared and administered to 160 disadvantaged women in Texas. An analysis of the questionnaire responses identified a number of factors. Two factors that were consistently identified by all subjects were (1) the lack of marketable skills and (2) the lack of supportive services, particularly child care. Other inhibiting factors identified included financial difficulties; study, time management, and transportation problems; and inadequate socialization to work or education requirements. These were further hampered by a lack of competent career  guidance and personal counseling as well as by a general lack of employment information and educational opportunities. The facilitating factors most consistently identified were child care assistance, financial aid for both education and employment assistance training programs, short-term employment and education programs that result in marketable skills, and job readiness assistance. The study concluded that (1) to increase successful completion of education programs by disadvantaged women, support services, particularly child care and financial aid, must be made available to this population and (2) although such help may facilitate the completion of job readiness programs, they do not ensure long-term employment because the participants do not always acquire skills in the programs for  long-term employment. Recommendations were made to the National Women's Employment and Education, Inc.; to San Antonio College; and to Texas policymakers to improve programs to ensure success for disadvantaged women.

        "description":"Many companies recognize the importance of including older persons in the labor force, but barriers still exist that limit their productive employment. Negative stereotypes may influence hiring and promotion decisions, and training opportunities may be closed. A study was conducted of private sector employment programs/practices that are intended to increase employment options for older workers, using the University of Michigan National Older Workers Information System (NOWIS), a computerized information system containing descriptions of company programs/practices for older workers. A range of private sector approaches was analyzed to determine the extent to which different employment problems are addressed and how these programs/practices meet the personnel needs of the  companies involved. The analysis suggests that programs are successful when they are symbiotic--benefiting both the worker and the company. Approaches tend to focus on special programs to use needed technical or professional skills and/or to employ people for part-time or temporary work. Most programs involve white-collar workers; programs for blue-collar workers generally were concentrated in service occupations. Social Security policies, employee benefit policies, and the state of the economy all have important implications for older workers, the study found. Private sector programs can be expected to expand with the growth in the proportion of older persons in the labor force. These efforts, however, will probably be limited to situations in which a program or practice works to the  mutual advantage of employers and older workers, especially with regard to blue-collar production workers and nonclerical white-collar workers. For these groups, other approaches may be needed. (KC)",

        "description":"A project was undertaken to review funding practices for vocational education in Kansas and to present some alternative funding methods for consideration. During the course of the project, a research specialist interviewed various state-level educational staff and an area vocational and technical school director in order to obtain a general overview of funding procedures in the state and to form some general impressions of the effects and effectiveness of these procedures. Based on these interviews, the researcher concluded that the present funding system makes it advantageous for area vocational and technical schools to enroll postsecondary students in preference to secondary students. It was also concluded that additional funding will not, alone, solve the problem of inequity.  To help create a more equitable funding system, the Kansas State Board of Education should establish priorities for its vocational education program and should provide funding on the basis of those priorities. Furthermore, programs should be funded on the basis of need, cost, and ability to pay; on the basis of the level of achievement of outcomes; and on the basis of increases in the proportion of students taking vocational education. Finally, equitable funding could be most effectively established if all state and federal vocational monies were pooled. (MN)",

It provides specific ideas and strategies to structure experiences that will help students learn about the job market and learn skills that enable them to seek, find, and keep jobs. The book is intended to help staff take advantage of opportunities that already exist in a school or program setting and relate them directly to similar situations or requirements in a work setting. The ideabook is divided into five skill areas that have been identified by people concerned with youth unemployment. The  five areas are responsibility, productivity, literacy, understanding new technology, and using labor market information. Each of the skill areas contains these five sections: (1) what does it mean (a definition and a short statement about why this is an important employability skill); (2) what does it look like (a description of two youth who are demonstrating competency in the particular skill); (3) work requirements and how to teach them; (4) what can a teacher do (examples of activities and ideas that teachers or job training staff might try); and (5) space for staff to jot down other ideas that might work or that are already working locally. A list of resources completes the ideabook. (KC)",

Using some of the new ideas presented in Inviting School Success, Second Edition (Purkey and Novak, in press), a more expansive definition and application of invitational education is offered. New concepts such as theory of practice, stance, and &quot;withness&quot; are explored. The foundations of invitational education are discussed, and an approach to education and training based on the four basic principles of invitational education is described. The metaphor of the school as an inviting family is discussed through five basic characteristics: (1) respect for human uniqueness; (2) cooperative spirit; (3) sense of belonging; (4) pleasing habitat; and (5) positive expectation. Further  exploration of key aesthetic, ethical, political, and religious issues are called for to aid in the refinement of invitational theory. (Author/MCF)",

To test the effectiveness of bibliotherapy in the treatment of problem drinkers, six studies were conducted over 7 years (1975-1982) comparing different treatment approaches. The combined data showed that for bibliotherapy clients who received nothing but a self-help manual, initial evaluation, and self-monitoring cards, the overall improvement rates were 78% at termination, 80% at 3-6 month follow-up, and 73% at 24 months. For all clients treated by all other methods combined the comparable rates were 82% at termination, 76% at 3-6 month follow-up, and 67% at 24 months. The success rate of bibliotherapy could not be attributed to seeking further  treatment. Results suggest that bibliotherapy can provide critical conditions for change by providing information for the contemplation process, motivational techniques to help individuals reach determination, and specific strategies for active change. Supplmentary use of self-help is potentially useful in the maintenance stage of the change process as well. (JAC)",

        "author":["Shaha, Steven H."],
        "description":"When people experience failures they search for an explanation of why the failure occurred. The process of seeking an explanatory cause is the basis of attribution theory. Causal attributions include the dimensions of locus of causality (internal or external), stability of the cause over time, and the degree of personal control over the outcome. These variations reflect self-concept, i.e., a person's perception of him/herself as formed through experience with the environment and the interpretation of such experiences. In failure events, internal locus (recognizing oneself as the cause of events) has been associated with low self-esteem. However, if meaningful others also fail, the cause of failure is perceived as outside of oneself (external locus). Stability is related to  self-concept since successive failures result in ever increasing attributions of lack of ability (an internal, stable cause) accompanied by ever decreasing self-concept; but if failure is attributed to a stable but external cause, self-concept does not necessarily decrease. Thus, failure itself is not sufficient for learned helplessness; one must also perceive him/herself as the locus of causality. A perceived lack of control over a failure event would theoretically help maintain self-esteem; however, research indicates that successive though uncontrollable failure still leads to self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy.

        "description":"Mentoring is a form of adult socialization for professional-level and leadership roles, and plays a critical part in developing leadership for the academic administration of colleges and universities. Sexism in these high level positions means that men, who are most likely to be mentors, choose other men as proteges, leaving women without access to the top of the work structure. Interviews with mentors and their proteges have shown that the mentor serves as a link between the pool of qualified candidates and the inner circle of leadership. After selecting a candidate, the mentor provides his protege with opportunities to learn and practice, and to increase knowledge, performance, and motivation. A mentor is usually found through performing an important and visible task. Once  chosen, the gates of the inner leadership circle begin to open for the protege and contacts are developed through a colleague system. The protege's competence is developed or tested by the mentor. The mentor ensures that the protege learns the standards of the leadership group; he also determines the trustworthiness of the protege, and maintains control of the leader selection process. The protege establishes trust by being available, accessible, predictable, and loyal. The disadvantages of the protege role include role entrapment and tokenism, both of which curtail professional growth. Women may not gain a mentor or access to high levels of leadership without a struggle, but rather than waiting to be chosen they can share the professional knowledge and power they currently hold.

The model, developed as a demonstration project for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, consists of self-contained teaching units for grades K-12. This non-technical report, directed to non-research professionals, describes an extensive 3-year evaluation conducted to measure the effectiveness of the program in grades 4-12. Three Seattle school districts and two Portland school districts participated. Some schools were assigned to the experimental condition, and comparable schools were assigned to a control condition. The test instruments were administered to some students both  before and after exposure to the HLAY curriculum; many students were followed for 3 years. Immediate results showed a definite curriculum impact for all students in the area of knowledge about alcohol and alcoholism. In addition, self-esteem was favorably affected for those in grades 5, 6, and 7. Decision making skills were improved for students in grades 6-12. Attitudes were least affected, although there was evidence that students in grade 8 and younger students changed somewhat toward favoring moderate drinking as opposed to excessive drinking. The program appeared most effective in intermediate grades, arguing for early intervention. Other influences, particularly parents, peers, and religion appeared to have a greater impact. The report contains a number of graphs illustrating the  evaluation process and the results of the study.

To summarize the information from the 16 Technical Committee reports, a conceptual framework was used which focused on the well being of older people in three dimensions - health, economic, and social. Of the 267 areas of concern 248 specifically focused on these three dimensions. The remaining 19 areas applied to all three dimensions and related to defining government roles, and involving public agencies and older people in setting goals, managing services, and advocacy. Health concerns comprized 67 of the 248 concerns; the major area of concern was long-term care. There were 84 economic concerns identified.  Employment was the major issue followed by social security, housing, retirement, and family care. Social concerns accounted for 97 of the 248. Quality of life ranked first, followed by integrated services, transportation, communication, legal services, education, and crime. In addition to the 16 Technical Reports, major areas of concern were analyzed from the conference reports of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Navajo Nation, and the Territories. The state areas of concern paralleled those of the Technical Committees. (JAC)",

To discover events perceived to have been turning points in the identity formation of Hispanic women, 25 Mexican-American women and 25 Puerto Rican women living in Chicago were interviewed by two female Hispanic interviewers. In addition to demographic information, subjects were asked what events or turning points in their lives made a difference in their feelings and understanding about themselves. A total of 189 events were obtained, with most women mentioning about 5. Two Hispanic women were trained to code the responses into five general categories: (1) relational; (2) work related; (3) educational; (4) personal; and (5) health related. Results showed events involving  relationships (marriage, divorce, motherhood) comprised the largest single category of critical events. However, over half the reported critical events involved events other than relational. Results were also compared with those of an earlier study using a sample of black and white women. Overall results point to shared experiences shaping the identities of women regardless of cultural differences. Interview data from the Hispanic study suggest that no single event was critical in shaping the lives of all the Hispanic women. The women saw themselves not only as bicultural but in multi-roles as well. The appendices contain demographic characteristics of the sample, a summary of categories of perceived critical events, and references. (JAC)",

To examine the process by which parents decide on custody of their children in a divorce, a sample of divorcing couples (N=55) drawn from a large urban county and three rural counties, participated in tape recorded interviews and completed two forms of the Custody Decision Form (CDF). In the first form parents rated the importance of 20 general criteria and 6 additional criteria if they applied. On the second form parents were also required to rate the extent to which each consideration favored either the mother or the father. Statistical analyses showed that mothers and fathers agreed on the relative importance of various criteria (e.g., continuity in the  child's environment, quality of the parent-child relationship) but not on the extent to which each criterion favored either partner. Priorities actually used to decide custody (e.g., ability to provide financially, parent's sense of responsibility for the child's well-being) differed somewhat from those rated most important (e.g., emotional stability of the parent, suitability of the parent's lifestyle or morals, parenting skills). Parents rated themselves as more suitable for custody than they were rated by their partners. Generally, fathers were less satisfied than mothers with the custody arrangement (75 percent of the couples agreed on mother custody, 13 percent agreed on joint custody, and 10 percent had not yet decided).

The 7-week workshop met weekly for 2 hours, each session consisting of a lecture on one aspect of memory function and aging, and practice of a memory-enhancing strategy. The sample consisted of 13 older adults, 12 females and 1 male, with a mean age of 70.9 years. On pretesting, participants reported moderate concern about the adequacy of their memory despite demonstrating accurate recall of recent and remote information. Additionally, they evidenced moderate life satisfaction and mild depression. After completing the  program, participants showed a decline in worry about their memory and a slight increase in their life satisfaction and mood. Moreover, participants' satisfaction with the program was high. Results of this preliminary study suggest that memory concerns of older adults can be alleviated and morale improved by the provision of factual information about memory and aging and by instruction in specific techniques for improving memory performance.

        "description":"Questionnaires designed to tap misconceptions of the content of psychology courses can serve as pedagogical devices useful for introducing students to topics and for evaluating student learning. The topic of sleep and dreams is of particular interest to students. To develop a useful introductory tool and to evaluate students' knowledge of sleep, dreams, and sleep disorders, a 39-item questionnaire in true/false format was designed. College students in introductory psychology courses (N=232) completed the questionnaire prior to coverage of those topics. In general, the results indicated that students were not poorly informed about the topics of sleep and dreams. Examples of students' inaccurate knowledge included beliefs that dreams only occur during REM (rapid eye movement)  sleep, and that insomnia is caused by muscle tension. Students' major area of misinformation centered on some of the rarer sleep disorders, e.g., sleep apnea. However, students were knowledgeable concerning the difficulties associated with various sleep medications. The sleep and dreams questionnaire is appended. (WAS)",

Hypothesizing that activities performed for their instrumental outcome are valued less than activities not so externally oriented, and that activities performed for their instrumental outcome are primarily concerned with satisfying Maslow-type lower needs, a questionnaire was developed to measure activities and their rated values. College students (N=41) completed the questionnaire and participated in an interview to determine the perceived utility (primary reason for engaging in the activity) and the level of need the activity satisfied. Statistical analyses showed that the majority of responses for  instrumental activities served the more basic needs of the Maslow hierarchy, while the majority of responses for intrinsic motivations served the higher order needs, mostly self-actualization. The hypothesis that activities performed for their instrumental outcome would be devalued was not supported, although the means tended toward that direction. (WAS)",

To look at instances of spouse abuse in black and white families, and to examine the distribution of decision making influence in these homes, 366 undergraduate students completed two questionnaires assessing spouse abuse and the distribution of marital power. Of the 366 volunteers 129 were males, 237 were females; 318 were white, 45 were black or other; 189 were from lower status homes, 197 were from middle class status homes. Results of statistical analyses showed that 33 percent of the students reported some instances of parental spouse abuse during a typical year while they were  growing up. Perception of family power was significantly influenced by students' sex, race, and socioeconomic status.

Simultaneous integration refers to the synthesis of separate elements into groups, often with spatial characteristics; successive integration means that information is processed in a serial order, so that information is surveyable only in a temporal, orderly manner, with knowledge of each bit of information dependent on the previous bit. To investigate the relationship betwen simultaneous-successive processing and academic achievement, undergraduate college students (N=157) completed six processing tasks: the Raven Progressive Matrices, memory for design, and figure copying (indices of simultaneous  processing); and free recall, serial recall, and digit span-forward (indices of successive processing). Students' task scores were then compared with their cumulative grade point average (GPA) and American College Testing (ACT) composite scores. Analyses of results indicated that the level of simultaneous and successive processing was related systematically to GPA; high levels of both processing modes were necessary for high GPA achievement. Simultaneous processing seemed relatively more important than successive processing for high ACT performance, perhaps due to the ACT's emphasis on complex reading. (WAS)",

To assess differences in affective responses to variations in physical attractiveness and the affect of sex on those responses, 76 college students (31 male and 45 female) viewed colored slides of an attractive or unattractive member of the same or opposite sex. The attractiveness classification of the target slides was based on ratings from a pilot study. Subjects then indicated their reaction to the target person on the Impression Formation Index, a seven-point scale. As predicted, physically attractive individuals evoked more favorable affective reactions than did unattractive individuals; this relationship was especially true of  opposite sex individuals. For same-sex individuals, unattractive individuals evoked more favorable affective reactions than did attractive individuals. Future research might assess the evaluative, behavioral, and affective dimensions of the physical attractiveness stereotype to determine the extent to which they are related with the affect-attraction theoretical framework.

        "description":"The soundness of the home-school relationship depends on mutual trust and understanding. This relationship is now at risk because schools have not adjusted to single-parent and step-families. Concern about the home-school relationship has increased over the last decade. However, accompanying the recent rise in non-nuclear families is a gap in teachers' knowledge of, and skills dealing with, these families, due in part to the general socialization of teachers in a society which compares non-nuclear families unfavorably with traditional ones. This points to a need for both society and education to examine attitudes and differential perceptions that are destructive toward individuals. Teacher training institutions need to provide experiences to aid teachers in acquiring the skills  needed for parental involvement. Possible reasons for institutional shortcomings in this area include: lack of awareness or desire; lack of professional resources on the subject; uneasiness with the emotional and opinion issues surrounding divorce and remarriage; and resistance to further broadening the teacher role. The reasons schools resist dealing with non-nuclear family structures include: complex legal issues surrounding custody; desire to protect student and family privacy; fear that acknowledging divorce will withdraw support for the ideal one-home family; and budget constraints. It is possible to accommodate each non-nuclear family through a combination of individual attention and group/program approaches. A lengthy chart gives recommendations from eight different sources grouped  into the following areas: training/awareness for teachers; logistics; schools/parents; curriculum/instruction; teacher/child; legal issues/record keeping; and intervention techniques.

Studies have demonstrated that texts rely on four types of causal connections; one event may cause: a new physical or mental state, a new action, or a new motivation for action. The density of these stated or inferred connections largely determines text difficulty. Children's spontaneous oral stories can also be analyzed as causal event chains. Analysis reveals that these narratives increase in complexity as children grow, changing from the 2-year-old child's simple listing of events to the 10-year-old child's  careful organization of motivations and consequences. The inferential complexity of texts is also reflected in the pauses during the oral retelling of films. Analysis demonstrates that pauses at event chain continuities are less frequent than pauses at discontinuities. (MM)",

Like programing, flowcharting requires knowledge of a particular content area and an understanding of how to process the information. Skills such as identifying the main idea and supporting details, sequencing ideas or statements, and distinguishing relevant from irrelevant facts reflect some of what is needed to flowchart any idea. A six-step system for teaching skills in both flowcharting and reading begins with the teaching of flowcharting symbols. The second step introduces the sequencing of ideas and events. Next, students are asked to organize ideas on a flowchart, which helps ease them into using flowcharts to organize ideas into sequential order. As a reading skill, it can be used for  recognizing the main idea; identifying supporting details; identifying and using symbols, diagrams, and typographical aids; and identifying key or direction words. The fourth step requires students to write down steps for an activity in flowchart form. Particular emphasis is given to using symbols and typographical aids since the students are responsible for framing each statement. In the fifth step, questions are formulated for students to answer about the flowchart, thus indicating their ability to read and understand flowcharts. During the final step, students put a paragraph's ideas in flowchart form, using flowchart principles to reflect their comprehension. (HOD)",

Specifically, the study examined whether training would enhance student performance in three areas: (1) sensitivity to the task demands of the question, (2) quality of answers, and (3) consistency between their identification of the task demands of a question and the source of information needed for the answer. Subjects were 10 fourth grade teachers and 180 of their students from a semi-rural western community. Three of the teachers were trained in a traditional half-day workshop, three received more extensive  training that included provision of specific materials and weekly monitoring and feedback by researchers, and four served as controls. The performance of high ability students was superior to that of average students, and both groups performed better than did low ability students. Performance on text based questions was higher than that on knowledge based questions. Both groups of trained students were generally superior to control group students in their response quality, and students whose teachers had received more extensive training were better able to identify the information source required by a given question, although they did not differ in their consistency or response quality.

Analysis of the data, based on interviews with family members, students' reading scores, and in-class observations of student behavior, indicated that word recognition and vocabulary were influenced by the cognitively enriching activities some homes provide, and related strongly with children's time with adults rather than with other children or watching television. Reading comprehension, though not  unaffected, was less powerfully dependent on such enrichment, but was related to the emotional climate in the home. More than word recognition or vocabulary development, reading comprehension appeared to require complementary supports from home and school--the positive self-concept that develops in an emotionally positive home and the direct instruction and skill practice offered by the school. The emotional climate of the home also related closely to the students' word production in writing tasks. (MM)",

        "description":"Jackdaws are collections of interesting artifacts that provide information about a particular subject, period, or idea, and build background and interest in works of literature for children. Jackdaws are easy to construct: practically anything that is related in some fairly direct way to a piece of literature and that can aid a student's comprehension or interest in a book is eligible, including photographs, recordings, movies, period songs or music, news articles, time lines and maps, biographical sketches of authors, and lists of related books. The teacher can introduce jackdaw items either as a prelude or as a conclusion to a book, or even at appropriate points in the the story. They can also be placed in a reading corner for independent exploration. As students become  familiar with jackdaws, they can be asked to add to existing ones or to construct ones of their own, an excellent extension activity following the completion of a story or book. Students can then share their jackdaws with the class or in small groups. Preservice teachers who have used jackdaws in their classroom training report that the collections helped involve bored students, increased understanding, and made classroom discussions more vital. Jackdaws also seemed to attract students to books, a primary goal of reading instruction. (HTH)",

        "description":"The most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reports suggest that the issue of declining quality in American education may be more complex than media accounts have portrayed it. If one looks at isolated communication skills, it appears that many students understand the fundamentals of reading and writing. The results also indicate that achievement levels have remained relatively stable across time for older students and may be improving for younger students. Although blacks and students in disadvantaged urban areas still tend to perform below national levels, in many instances they have either shown marked improvements or at least narrowed the gap between themselves and the rest of the nation. However, NAEP data suggest that curricula still emphasize  instruction in competent skills apart from the &quot;application&quot; of these skills. Many students show difficulty with tasks requiring higher-order skills. Declines in inferential reading comprehension and in many writing tasks requiring critical thinking may reflect dwindling resources for teaching application and analytical skills. The results suggest that increased spending combined with placing instructional priority on the basics may have helped improve these skills, but the emphasis on the basics has not helped students develop higher order skills such as inference, analysis, or evaluation. Instructional priorities should be broadened to include higher level communication skills. Students need more time learning to read and write, and more time reading and writing to learn.  (HTH)",

Carpenter using a different kind of passage, to compare the three gaze duration algorithms that have been proposed by other researchers, and to measure processing time in reading. Fifty-one college students read a passage while their eye movements were monitored. Five different measures of processing time in reading were each fit, using hierarchical multiple regression, to a model similar to that of Just and Carpenter. The processing time measures--Just and Carpenter's gaze durations, two modified gaze duration measures, number of fixations, and average fixation duration--were shown to be influenced by different independent variables. Also, some evidence was obtained  that called into question one assumption of the gaze duration measure--that when increased processing time is needed, a trade-off occurs between fixation duration and the number of fixations on a word. The findings suggest that gaze duration measures should be considered indices of aspects of word processing during reading rather than as measures of actual processing time required by words.

The two types of readers differed in their processing of the structural, thematic, and schematic properties of sentences in both reading and listening. The results demonstrated that reading and listening make use of similar language comprehension processes, that unskilled readers are also relatively unskilled listeners, and that effective comprehension involves an interaction of processes for perceiving and relating propositions and for integrating propositions with schematic expectations. School-aged unskilled readers were relatively deficient in propositional processing and tended to  process spoken and printed sentences as a series of unstructured words. College-aged unskilled readers were relatively deficient in their strategies for relating propositions and tended to rely on expectations to form a representation of text. (Author/FL)",

The experiments examined both skilled adult readers and children beginning to read. Oral reading was used both because elementary school teachers frequently ask children to read aloud and because oral reading provides an indication of processing difficulty while the reader is reading. In most of the experiments, violations of different types of information--for example, a nonword, a misspelling, a semantically anomalous word, an ungrammatical word, or a factually inconsistent word--were introduced into common stories. The readers' oral productions were analyzed for disruptions around each violation on the theory that if there were disruptions, then the readers  must have been attempting to comprehend the distorted information. Across the experiments it was found that (1) readers used some types of information to find words in their mental dictionaries and other types of information to comprehend sentence meanings; (2) children reading grade-appropriate stories were governed by the same reading comprehension processes as were skilled adult readers; and (3) readers adapted their reading processes to changes in the reading situation, such as when pronunciation or comprehension was emphasized, or when information was encoded differently (as in Polish and English). The pattern of results provided strong support for an interactive model of reading comprehension. (Author/FL)",

A review of current research indicates that (1) the time of initiating a saccade can be influenced by visual information acquired on the  fixation which terminates in that saccade; (2) processing of the information is not necessarily completed by the time of the decision to move the eyes; (3) with fixations too short to process information, the next saccade must be based entirely on prior information; and (4) part of the variability in the saccade onset time may be associated with the amount of processing time elapsing before the information is utilized.

Labeled as concrete, operational, transitional, or formal operational thinkers according to inventory scores, the students were then given one of two grammar tests. Findings revealed significant correlation between grammar test scores, Piagetian stages, and IQ scores--indicating first, that the Piagetian stage as revealed by the IPDT is useful in predicting grammar test scores, especially when considered with IQ; and, second, that the task of identifying simple subjects and  predicates is too difficult for most of the eighth grade students, including 47% of the students at the formal operations level, and a total of 74% of all students who took the test. The findings support Piaget's principle that children's cognitive development is a limiting factor in what they can learn at any given time.

To evaluate their alternative hypotheses, 163 studies from over 88 sources, representing nearly a century of publications on children and the mass media, were submitted to meta-analysis. After information was collected on the year of publication; medium studied; samples; type of statistical analysis; and independent, dependent, or intervening variables, the studies were categorized under 10 main subject areas: attitudes, life conditions, viewing condition, media behaviors, media psychological factors, media content, behaviors,  psychological variables, and advertising. The data showed support for Reeves's and Wartella's observation that indirect effects models are found throughout the history of research on children and the mass media. Findings do not, however, support their hypothesis that research topics recur cyclically with the introduction of each mass medium into the social system.

        "description":"A review of the literature on the computerization of newspaper newsrooms shows that since 1960, computers have assumed an increasingly important role in information collection, news writing and editing, pagination, and news transmission. When newspaper libraries are computerized, reporters are able to find information more quickly and to use reference material more effectively. Using computers in copy-editing tasks permits newsroom staffs to devote more time to careful research. Word processors reduce writing, rewriting, editing, and headline writing time. An increasing number of larger newspapers are computerizing pagination--the laying out of news space, headlines, and advertising--and using computers for facsimile transmissions--electrical transmissions of pages to different  printing sites. In the future, computers may be more frequently used in electronic reproduction of newspapers for the home through videotex and teletext and in satellite technology for the transmission of wire service news. Continued advances in computer technology will produce (1) cost-effective geographic and demographic newspapers; (2) better quality newspapers created by faster and more economical production methods; and (3) new data base management and marketing possibilities for auxiliary products and services.

Using students as tutors gives the center free tutoring and the students &quot;hands on&quot; experience. To reach students, the director can provide campus-wide publicity and attend meetings for incoming, ESL, and nontraditional students. The center can also provide help for students from academic disciplines other than English with report and scientific writing, research papers, social science writing, theses and dissertations, letters of application, and resumes, as well as offer study sessions for professional entrance exams. The writing center and the library can work together to develop research modules for students to use in conjuntion with  or in lieu of a course on research writing. The center can and should be a force for literacy on campus by conducting workshops geared to specific disciplines, visiting classes to guest lecture on improving writing skills, consulting with departments on evaluation and conferencing, developing materials such as editing guides and style sheets, reading student papers, and conducting surveys. Such projects demonstrate the value of the writing center to the administration deciding the program's fate. Beyond the campus, the writing center can collaborate with high school English departments and with community groups and businesses both to generate additional revenue and to precipitate community-wide literacy.

It involves discovering and maintaining a proper balance among three elements at work in any communicative effort: the available arguments about the subject itself, the interests and peculiarities of the audience, and the voice of the speaker. Teacher management of the classroom, writing assignments, and comments on student papers reflect this rhetorical stance. Effective teachers emphasize classroom writing practice over formal lectures. They spend significantly less time talking about writing than other teachers might but plan many more activities that encourage students to plan, draft, and rewrite progressively more complicated pieces. Conscious of student needs, they compose each writing assignment carefully--assessing its  relationship to previous work, anticipating possible problems, and planning other material to supplement the assignment. They use marginal comments and endnotes as a written dialogue with students about their writing, a private tutorial that explains not just what to do but how. Concerned with the relationships among students, teachers, and the composing process, the teaching of writing is necessarily a rhetorical art. (MM)",

        "description":"To help committed student writers make the transition from school-sponsored to self-sponsored forms of discourse, an advanced expository writing course combines student-chosen writing assignments with a pedagogical structure that promotes a sensitive and critical response to prose. The class is organized into writing groups containing four or five students each. Every week students take turns giving two readings of three or four pages of new, finished prose. Following the second reading, all group members comment on their responses to the words, tone, organization, and argument of each paper. To increase motivation and provide guidelines for peer evaluations, the teacher listens to and critiques one paper per group every week and offers a quick evaluation of group effectiveness.  Writing groups are effective because they (1) consolidate four essential components of rhetorical study--writing, reading, speaking, and listening; (2) encourage writer ownership through self-generated assignments; (3) inspire rising expectations among peer readers; (4) improve the writer's sense of sound and rhythm through oral reading; (5) help listeners develop short-term memory skills; (6) merge audience and writer, subject and response; and (7) show students the value of revising.

The basic unit for analysis was the classroom activity, characterized by an identifiable focus or a definite time allotment and program of action. Preliminary analysis of the data revealed five major themes: the effect of the junior high school class schedule on activity systems, the nature of activities and their contexts, activity boundaries and distinctiveness, processes of getting activities started, and activity management and curriculum. Results of the analysis indicated that successful managers were able to (1) construct lessons  that fit the externally paced schedule of the school day; (2) use activities with a clear program of action; (3) explicitly mark the boundaries of activities and the transition between activities; (4) demonstrate situational awareness by attending to details and commenting on events taking place in the room; (5) protect activities until they were established by ushering them along, focusing public attention on work, and ignoring misbehavior that disrupted the rhythm and flow of events; and (6) push students through the curriculum even when misbehavior was prevalent in the class.

For this reason, students often fail to see the value of writing and thus produce writing that does not reflect their true ability to communicate. In a bilingual Los Angeles school serving students from low income Hispanic and Anglo backgrounds, a method was devised to make writing more meaningful. Students in grades two through four were asked to write letters each day to anyone in the school they chose. These letters were then distributed through a school &quot;post office&quot; system. Students were free to write in English or Spanish; the letters were not graded, or even read, by teachers; and students wrote whatever they wished. Letters  written by 32 students were analyzed for three aspects of writing development: (1) the acquisition of the ability to write and respond to letters, (2) the purposes for which students wrote, and (3) the acquisition of the ability to take another's perspective. Results indicated that while the students were not becoming good writers instantly, they were developing fluency and learning that writing can be fun and rewarding. The findings contributed to theory and practice by showing the use of an effective instructional method and by enabling researchers to study samples produced in response to a real writing situation.

The studies included interviews both with the students concerning their writing histories and with their former high school English teachers. In addition, information was gathered about their verbal abilities and their high school grades. The data were examined for patterns that would explain the cumulative development of the students' negative attitudes toward writing, at least through high school and the beginning of college. Analysis of the data indicated that the three students held many misconceptions about the nature of writing that contributed to their negative attitudes and appeared to hinder the development of their writing abilities.  For these students, writing appeared to be outer- rather than inner-directed--they wrote primarily to please the teacher and earn a grade rather than to please themselves and to learn. Overall, the findings suggested that the students' atttudes toward writing were shaped by their teachers' attitudes.

        "description":"A study examined the effect of topic-specific background knowledge on the general quality and local coherence of student writing. Ninety-seven tenth grade students were assigned two writing tasks on specific topics at two points during a semester. J. Langer's measure of topic-specific knowledge was administered prior to each writing task. Each student's writing sample was then scored on five separate measures: (1) overall quality, (2) coherence, (3) syntactic complexity, (4) audience, and (5) function. The data from the pretest and writing evaluations clearly suggested a strong and consistent relationship between topic-specific background knowledge and the quality of student writing. More interesting, however, was the evidence that different kinds of knowledge were predictive of  success in different writing tasks. The analysis of interactions between background knowledge and audience and function categories suggested that when students had only fragmentary knowledge about a topic, they used tactics to avoid engaging in writing activities that required them to say more than they knew. The findings suggest that for many tasks, writers may need the same kinds of highly organized information that readers do, but for others they may also require an abundance of loosely related informational &quot;bits&quot; for use in their writing. This distinction may arise from differences inherent in each of the two activities: writers not only need to generate, present, and relate intricately linked ideas, but also need a large body of loosely associated information that can be used to  elaborate, embellish, and enliven the presentation.

The subjects, 161 Long Island, New York, sixth grade students, were assigned to four prereading activities: prereading plan (PreP) group discussion of key concepts, motivation discussions of specific questions in small groups, no activity (reading without any preparatory discussion), and a distractor discussion of a  nonrelated topic. Two passages from a social studies text were selected for reading, and students completed a 20-item test measuring wh comprehension. The results indicated that the background knowledge measure was a significant and reliable predictor of wh comprehension. The prereading activity significantly raised available background knowledge, and this in turn increased comprehension of moderately difficult passages. The measure of text specific background knowledge may be useful for teachers in assessing the difficulty of a reading assignment, and for researchers in controlling for differences in prior knowledge or in examining the relationships between background knowledge and various aspects of learning.

To assist students in developing their ideas about a topic, acquiring additional information, and integrating new information with previous ideas--all part of the generating phase--teachers can give instruction in brainstorming, free association, freewriting, evaluating information, and selecting methods for organizing material. To provide young writers with relevant support and instruction during the drafting process, teachers can model unfamiliar genres, permit imitation in early drafts, allow class time for writing, and encourage nongraded writing such as journal writing. To help students learn when and how to revise, teachers can  organize peer response and editing groups, model the revising process in class, engage in written dialogue with students about their evolving drafts, and provide time between drafts to allow students to reassess their own writing.

Generally, entries in the &quot;Writer's Market&quot; guide to publishing markets include a description of the material the magazine is looking for and words of wisdom from the editor. Probably the most useful general work of its kind, &quot;Writer's Market&quot; can present some problems if used without caution. First, it uses the same format to describe all the magazines, tending to make them sound alike. Second, it occasionally lists magazines no longer publishing or editors no longer on the staff. Third, it states needs in such general terms as to be frequently meaningless. One way to help students avoid these problems is to  abstract representative &quot;tips&quot; from the &quot;Writer's Market&quot; listings. These tips fall into five general categories: (1) know the publication, (2) write well, (3) be honest, (4) know the publication's specific needs, and (5) do not be discouraged. &quot;Writer's Market&quot; entries do offer guidelines for writing for specific publications and some sample copies, which are worth sending for. Finally, several additional magazines are useful for market analysis, &quot;The Writer&quot; and &quot;The Writer's Digest&quot; being perhaps the best known. (HTH)",

Student affective outcomes were judged from teacher/course evaluations provided by them, and cognitive outcomes were judged  from scores on midterm and final examinations. Overall communicative responsiveness of instructors was found to be related to affective but unrelated to cognitive course outcomes.

Analysis revealed a loosely structured, &quot;drop-in&quot; group that was sustained by a core of from five to eight leaders. The group met with no success in engaging in collective action or advocacy and with mixed success in providing guidance for members in their daily lives. Continuance of the group seemed to be a result of its success in establishing a network of social relationships for members.

This they termed the &quot;agenda setting&quot; function of the media. A study was conducted to investigate various aspects of the agenda setting function of the media as they occurred in a gubernatorial campaign. Four separate agendas were examined: (1) aggregate newspaper--all news stories appearing in a newspaper that were related to an issue regardless of its linkage to the campaign; (2) campaign agenda--a list of those issues given coverage by the media that were linked to the campaign, rank ordered in terms of amount of coverage each received; (3) editorial agenda--a  list of those issues given coverage by the media in editorials, also rank ordered; and (4) public agenda, a list of issues perceived by the public as most important in the campaign, as elicited through telephone interviews. The three media agendas were then correlated with the public agenda. The results indicated that the campaign and editorial agendas were generally more effective in setting public agendas than was the aggregate newspaper agenda. The findings suggest that if the media devoted more attention to the obvious linkages between important issues and a campaign, the agenda setting effect could be enhanced. (FL)",

The process of allocating negative outcomes may be different from the decision making process for positive outcomes. To examine the decision making process for allocating rewards and punishment, psychology students (N=182) read scenarios in which an individual who either made or lost money for a group was directed to divide the group's reward or punishment (amount of money the group received or owed). The students then imagined they were the allocator, and decided how the money should be divided. Statistical analyses showed that allocators who had contributed a high number of correct or incorrect responses allocated more money to  themselves than did those in the low allocator position. Allocators of punishment took away more money from themselves then reward allocators gave themselves. Subjects were more likely to choose equitable than equal allocations of outcomes in the allocation of punishments. The findings support the idea that reward and punishment allocations are not completely parallel processes. (WAS)",

MMPI profiles of bulimic women and women with alcohol or drug abuse problems were also similar. To assess and compare the personality characteristics of anorexics and bulimics using the MMPI and to compare these results to the earlier results, volunteers who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM III) criteria for anorexia and bulimia  (37 female bulmics and 4 female anorexics) were interviewed, given a diagnosis, and administered the MMPI on the same day. Analyses of results showed that both bulimics and anorexics had similar profile configurations. Remarkable similarities were also obtained in profile configurations when comparing these results with the earlier results. The findings suggest that elevated D, Pd, Pt, and Sc scores for women, even when not all scale points are above T-scores of 70, should alert the clinician to the possibility of an eating or substance abuse disorder.

Complete data for each of the tests and the information composite were  available for grades 5, 7, 9, and 11 and for constant samples of 748 white girls and 655 white boys. Because samples were much smaller, black boys and girls were omitted from this analysis. Separate matrices of correlations were computed for each sex. From each master matrix, three additional matrices were formed of each test and the composite. Results supported the hypothesis. Reading comprehension was most highly correlated with individual differences in general information when all were measured on the same occasion. In contrast, individual differences in estimated true scores of listening were most highly correlated with general information when there were at least 2 years between the occasions of measurement.

        "description":"Race and socioeconomic class differences in children's reading performance are influenced by social and motivational factors. For example, children from poverty backgrounds are more likely to attribute success to conditions outside personal control, and thus do not experience as much pride in achievement as middle class students who have learned to associate success with ability and effort. Parents appear to play a critical role in the development of achievement motivation. Middle class parents generally foster strong achievement motivation by their high expectations of success and their involvement in the achievement-related activities of their children. They influence their children's reading performance more directly by the amount of reading materials they have in the home,  encouragement they give, reading they do themselves, and time they spend reading with their children. Students' involvement in reading is also influenced by the kinds of reading materials schools provide and by teacher expectations. Among students from low socioeconomic groups, achievement is influenced negatively by peer pressure. Additional work, particularly on environmental factors, would allow researchers to go beyond the more demographic variables of race or socioeconomic status in exploring performance differences in reading. A comprehensive reference list is appended. (HOD)",

In each experiment, subjects first read a passage, then several test sentences, some of which tested information that was presented (explicit) and some of which tested information not presented in the passage. The subjects had to decide, as quickly and accurately as  possible, if the sentence was consistent with information in the passage.

The first grade teachers were observed for a total of 605 minutes; the third grade teachers for 780 minutes; and the fifth grade teachers for 535 minutes. The teachers' instructional methods were then compared with the manuals' recommendations. Researchers met with teachers on the same day that observation took place (whenever possible) and, if appropriate, questions were raised about why no basal materials had been used. At each meeting, teachers were also asked to check on the observer's accuracy in reporting behavior. Results showed that while teachers spent considerable time on  post-reading activities recommended by the basal manuals, such as comprehension assessment questions and written practice assignments, they only infrequently followed pre-reading recommendations in presenting new vocabulary, background information, or prereading questions to prepare students for assigned reading. In addition, none of the teachers appeared to be diagnostically oriented. These findings indicate the need to establish priorities in reading instruction so that sufficient time can be allotted to important prereading and diagnostic tasks. (HOD)",

An alternative view is that the quantitative dimension merely modulates preexisting qualitative properties and is therefore only responsible for changes in the degree of affect. Thus, the quality of affect, whether it is positive or negative, has to be treated as an independent variable. In an experiment to compare these alternatives, the quantitative dimension was measured by varying the degree of unexpectedness of endings in stories that were overall either positive or negative. Contrary to predictions of optimal-level theory, the results showed that differently valanced story endings, judged the same on an expectation scale, were rated very differently in  hedonic tone and preference by high school readers.

The results indicated that children understood the concept of the  narrator by the time they entered elementary school.

Schonell. The three lists were administered to 283 pupils in grades 3 through 12. The word lists were collated in random order and were administered over a two-week period. Results showed that mean scores on the WRAT I, WRAT II, and the Graded Word Reading Test were relatively consistent and all correlation coefficients were significant at the .01 level. However, the mean score on the San Diego Quick Assessment was about one year below the other  two. Mean scores for boys and for girls with the San Diego Quick Assessment were 5.05 and 5.79 respectively. No such differences were found for the Graded Word Reading Test or for either form of the WRAT. Conclusions suggest that the San Diego Quick Assessment should be used cautiously when making comparisons within a mixed group. (HOD)",

A comparison of average and high quality essays revealed more effective global organization among the higher scored papers, producing more adequate, unified, and coherent arguments. These papers also showed greater control over syntactic or grammatical theme-marking devices and had fewer  unconventional paragraphs or unrelated themes. The great consistency among readers' evaluations supports the existence of an expository frame by which readers interpret expository texts.

        "description":"In integrating word processors into the structure of a freshman writing class, the instructor has two alternatives: to teach the course specifically as a word processing course, or to offer a word processing option to students on a volunteer basis, either in substitution for some other activity or as extra credit. The first method is good if one can limit class size to the amount of word processing equipment available. While the second alternative assures genuinely interested students the opportunity to learn word processing, it does not permit classroom discussion of lab activities. Whichever method is chosen, freshman writers should not be asked to do their papers on the word processor following a quick mini-course or demonstration. Instead, weekly exercises should be designed  to demonstrate how word processing functions can help solve typical writing problems. It is also important not to overwhelm students by teaching too many commands at once. Since freshman writers are generally less experienced problem solvers than upper classmen, have not had as much exposure to computers, and barely have developed efficient writing habits, they usually need greater initial supervision in using the machines, a more controlled exposure to the various word processing options available to them, and clearer connections made between the word processor's capabilities for changing text and the demands of the writing process itself.

Subjects supplied information about their media use and preferences, political preferences, education level, and age. Data analysis revealed a number of findings, including the following: (1) newspaper reliant persons held more political knowledge than did their television reliant counterparts; (2) individuals with high political interest, regardless of the media they relied upon, read more public affairs magazines and were stronger political partisans than were their low interest counterparts; (3) television reliant individuals with high  political interest showed greater political knowledge than did low interest individuals, regardless of media reliance; and (4) individuals with similar levels of political interests revealed comparable levels of political knowledge.

        "description":"The writing test at Colorado State University determines which students move from basic composition into the college composition course. Initially, all incoming students take a placement test similar to the holistically scored writing tests administered by the Educational Testing Service. This placement test, along with other information, provides generalizations about the students' skills and deficiencies. Once appropriately placed, students in the basic writing course find themselves focusing on writing skills--generating ideas, organizing them to communicate clearly to readers, developing them fully to convince readers, and editing them to reduce distractions. As a pretest at the beginning of the semester, students write an essay on an accessible topic in one hour. At the end  of the semester, students are asked to write on a parallel topic. Because of the pretesting and posttesting, instructors can compare skills at the beginning and end of the semester and can evaluate skills that are expected of any student completing the basic course. Failing tests are examined along with other writing the weak students have produced during the semester. If students fail the final exam because of limited but consistent problems that they have begun to master in the final weeks of the semester, they are usually passed with hopes that they will master specific skills early in the next semester. Instructors of subsequent composition classes have applauded this testing process since it guarantees them more homogeneous classes. (HOD)",

A procedure was used allowing a view of each reader's growing and changing text world, from locally developed envisionments that were appropriate meanings-in-process through the final envisionments the readers had negotiated after completing the entire passage. The test questions had been previously analyzed to determine question type (local/global and literal/inferential), and analysis of  student question-answering strategies permitted comparisons of the knowledge sources used across question types. The results indicated that students did not act on the assumptions used to make literal/inferential distinctions, and therefore interpretations of student performance on these measures did not reflect the meanings the students actually generated.

        "description":"Typically, efforts by English, speech, and developmental reading departments to make students \"complete communicators\" have been confined to one or two basic skills courses giving unsuccessful \"one-shot\" inoculations in the theory and practice of one of the communication competencies. As such communication is not taught in the context of the students' major and thus is not \"tailored\" to fit specific vocational needs, students seldom apply what they have learned outside the classroom. A suitable solution, meeting the need for both specialized training and continued work on skills throughout the academic career, involves asking the faculty to help students communicate more effectively in all classes. Several colleges experimenting with this concept of total academic responsibility  have found that it allows students to improve all their skills and allows more effective teaching in content area courses. The crucial part of one such program is the summer faculty workshop, during which faculty are taught the rudimentary concepts of teaching communication skills in content area courses. Course syllabi are then rewritten to incorporate these experiences in the various communication processes. Internal and external monitoring of the program ensures its commitment to practical and sustained communication skills. (HTH)",

        "description":"To provide a theoretical base for investigating the influence of inferential error on group decision making, current literature on both inferential error and decision making is reviewed and applied to the Watergate incident. Although groups tend to make fewer inferential errors because members' inferences are generally not biased in the same direction, group interaction may promote collective inferential error by encouraging (1) the mass acceptance of atypical cases as representative, (2) the specialization of knowledge in complicated issues, and (3) the development of a shared outlook or schema. A recent model suggests possible sources for these group characteristics. As group participants have less time to individually consider a given concept, and consequently less time to  activate a wide range of significant associations, their formulation of the target concept will tend to be simplistic and selective. A taped conversation among President Richard Nixon, John Dean, and John Mitchell shows how group inference errors develop. After Nixon denigrated its significance, Mitchell and Dean quickly dismissed the grand jury investigation of the cover up as unimportant, accepting Nixon's simplification of a complex and very serious issue as a &quot;can of worms.&quot; (MM)",

Results, while inconclusive, indicated that the pattern of emotions elicited by the candidate are fairly stable and it is only their intensity that varies.

Strangers rated their relational messages as showing less intimacy and similarity, more detachment, more submissiveness, less receptivity and more emotional negativity. They also rated reticents consistently lower on credibility. Friends gave mixed but  frequently more positive ratings to more reticent individuals. In the second experiment, 55 subjects interacted with male or female confederate interviewers who alternately asked innocuous or highly personal questions. The same patterns of nonverbal behavior emerged as in the first study, with increases in stress (due to privacy-invading questioning) eliciting more pronounced responses.

Emphasizing a functional approach, the American diffusionist model assumes that society is a system of interrelated parts naturally tending toward a state of dynamic equilibrium. The European model, however, postulates a society not in equilibrium but in constant flux owing to conflict among competing interest groups. Consequently, while American research tends to focus on mass media's effect on the individual and general role in the socialization process, European studies concentrate on the distribution of control over telecommunications. To integrate these two models, a theory must consider both individual actions and  socioeconomic forces affected by and affecting the mass media, and must reconcile views of society in conflict and in equilibrium. Possible effects of this fusion for mass communication study and policymaking include (1) new understanding of the mass media's close relationship with the entire social system, (2) expansion of the scope of research to include social as well as psychological implications, and (3) greater consideration of cultural differences in policy decisions.

Critics claimed that these NAB efforts at self-regulation were either too lenient or so strong that they posed antitrust problems. Still others focused on the issue of accountability in the code making process, suggesting that changes over the years reflected political pressures more than concern for the public. An understanding of the code and its implementation indicates that all three observations had some truth to them. The code did not demand strict adherence of broadcasters but was very strict for nonbroadcasters such as advertisers. While the Code appears to have had some impact on broadcast content, impact that even many nonbroadcasters would  rate positively, that impact was unenforceable and was ultimately designed to meet the interests of the broadcasters. In January 1983, the NAB disbanded its Code Authority Board, thereby ending the industry's organized self-regulation. The loss of the NAB's codes should not significantly alter the degree to which the public is protected. (HTH)",

While providing a helpful integration of disparate ideas in public opinion formation, Noelle-Neumann's framework has been questioned at a number of points. Is it reasonable to assume that since people fear isolation, most fear being in the minority? Research suggests, in fact, that many people can oppose majority views as long as they have individual or group support and that interpersonal relationships have a greater impact on opinion formation than impersonal public opinion presented via the  media. Recent studies have also offered an alternative to Noelle-Neumann's view of people as simply reacting to their perception of public opinion, suggesting that instead, people use their own opinions to form their perceptions of public attitudes. Whether people's behavior resembles the reaction or projection model may depend on a number of conditions, including their familiarity with the issue. Further research is needed on the many factors influencing opinion formation. (MM)",

Three theories of motivation--Maslow's hierarchy of needs, McClelland's achievement motive, and Hersberg's motivation-hygiene theory--can introduce students to the systems perspective, an approach suggesting that workers' motivations can only be understood in relationship to their work setting. To develop skill in listening, students must develop active feedback techniques: encouraging, restating, reflecting, and summarizing. By responding to hypothetical examples, students can gain skill in listening and thus in changing people's need for sympathy, fame, power, and prestige into positive motivational factors--desire for empathy,  recognition, cooperation, and respect.

Since research data have established that people report using greater mental effort for viewing Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) programing than for commercial network shows, subjects in two experimental conditions were told that they were going to view a show intended for broadcast on PBS, while those in the other two conditions were told that the same show was to be shown on commercial television. In addition, one group in each  condition was told that it would be asked to evaluate the show after viewing, while the other two groups were told that they would have to complete a questionnaire afterwards. Immediately after viewing, all students completed an instrument measuring their affective responses to and learning from the show. Results showed a trend of increased learning from the groups told that the program was designed for PBS, although this was over-ridden in the group warned that it would be questioned afterwards. The mental effort reports were inconsistent with previous research showing greater effort being used for PBS program content. (FL)",

Models of listening behavior suggest that, rather than being a passive activity, listening involves sorting stimuli and encoding messages, analyzing listener needs, and assessing speaker attitudes and internal states. According to current literature, empathy is the accurate perception of other people's feelings, reactions, or attitudes. Nonverbal communication, while difficult to record and evaluate, appears to be a group of interrelated skills dependent on the channel used--for example, voice or gesture. Expressive ability, defined by speech, rhetoric and communication course books, includes skills ranging from  organizing to delivering effective messages. Continued assessment of communication skills within naturalistic settings is needed. (MM)",

Four theoretical strands--decision theory, impression formation, inference theory, and rating theory--are briefly discussed and woven together as the basis for the proposed model. The model is then used as a theoretical framework for examining the results of a study investigating the effects of letters of recommendation on teacher selection processes and decisions. The study involved creating a file for a hypothetical social studies teacher that included one of four constructed letters of recommendation. The four letters each contained nine identical items of information about the candidate but varied by tone of information (favorable or  neutral) and length of letter (short or long). Four treatment groups were established by sending the different types of letters of recommendation to 160 randomly selected high school principals in a large midwestern state. Major conclusions reached from the study are that when the content items of letters remain constant, there is no statistically significant difference in rating of teaching applicants who present long or short letters of recommendation. However, favorable information had a significant effect on the rating high school principals gave a hypothetical teaching candidate. (MLF)",

The constructs of the paradigm are defined, including the multiple influences that must be controlled in such studies, the importance of hierarchical decomposition of variance in teacher work variables, and the sequential nature of reciprocal causal relationships between teacher and principal work. Outlined are the determinants of teacher work, school organization and climate, and principal work. The paper infers that research on policy and management would be relevant to student  educational outcomes. The relationship of the three sets of determinants, though, needs to be discussed further.

        "description":"Because current fiscal constraints call for inexpensive approaches to achieving equity, school finance research should, in addition to engaging in traditional analysis, address the relationship of curriculum and instruction to equity and economic efficiency. Problems of equity are posed by curriculum decisions and classroom management techniques that partly determine student performance. Cost-effectiveness, delivery systems, and time and cost productivity studies can offer data to help schools allocate resources more efficiently and equitably. Suggestions for research include conceptualizing school time as a zero-sum game in which student and teacher time are scarce resources subject to cost-effectiveness analysis, and studying content differences within schools and classrooms  and among districts. The policy links between state departments of education and school districts and between districts and schools and classrooms could also profitably be explored. Classroom and finance researchers could collaborate in exploring policy options for increasing student performance given limited resources, including techniques for better time management. Promising low-cost school improvement methods used or proposed in California are listed. Data generated by school finance research can contribute to creating a climate favorable to adoption and maintenance of reforms altering time, content, materials, and teacher variables. (MJL)",

The conventional explanation is that community colleges offer the most appropriate training for rapidly increasing jobs requiring middle-level skills. Various other models attempting to account for the enrollment growth in two-year institutions are considered; common to several models are: the presumption of expanded job opportunities in middle-level occupations; a concern with the supply of students, who may respond primarily to economic factors such as earnings or training costs, or to other factors including the entrepreneurial efforts of administrators or the ideological appeal of  vocationalism; and a lack of information on the actual benefits of vocationally oriented community colleges. The growth rates of enrollments and degrees awarded in community college vocational programs are compared with the growth rates of specific occupations, revealing that increases in middle-level jobs are insufficient to explain enrollment increases; a pluralistic approach employing a combination of explanations is thus recommended. Focal points for further examination of the problem are discussed. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"The nature of teachers' control in classrooms is explored in order: to understand the tension created when noneducators superimpose their rules on the regime of teachers at work and to learn something of a general nature about the antagonism between regulators and those they regulate. Teachers' regulatory powers are based on coercion, exchange, or authority. Coercion heightens antagonism to a regulatory regime in the classroom, whereas exchange (the \"purchase\" of student compliance) tends to corrupt the regime. The only recourse left is the development of authority--a moralized means of control that transforms teachers' might into right and students' obedience into duty. When outside sources, such as the courts, have an effect on school authority, the moral basis of local  classroom authority may be threatened. Outside officials must develop the prudence and eloquence to preserve traditional organizational purposes while imposing new demands. Regulation is political in the sense that it depends on the arts of human control. If regulators, failing to get a workable agreement, use force, they may be turning away from the possibility of ever again cultivating a working agreement. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"An analysis illustrating the direct and indirect role of government policy in generating employment begins by documenting the level and composition of government spending over the last 50 years. In 1929, federal, state, and local expenditures amounted to 10 percent of the Gross National Product (GNP); by 1980, government expenditures represented one-third of the GNP. The next section examines the employment generated by different types of government spending in 1980--the number of jobs, the types of jobs, and the types of workers who held these jobs. Government spending generated 34 percent of all civilian employment in 1980. More than 40 percent of the jobs in the public sector were high-level professional and managerial jobs, compared to 25 percent of the jobs in the private  sector. The public sector generated more than one-third of all high-level jobs for women in 1980--over 50 percent for black women. The last section of the analysis discusses the consequences of shifting government spending from one category to another. An increase in defense spending will create jobs in aircraft, ordnance, and other manufacturing industries. A reduction in federal nondefense spending or in state and local purchases will reduce employment opportunities for college graduates, women, and minorities more than for other groups of workers.

This paper examines the doctrinal, functional, and strategic meanings of the term &quot;federalism.&quot; The author argues, first, that there is no doctrinal support for the notion that education is exclusively a state function, or that the federal government has overreached its authority by becoming involved in education. The federal structure has divided and dispersed power, precisely what it was designed to do. Secondly, functional interdependence is the central fact of federal-state-local relations in education and occurred because interdependence was necessary in order to ensure that federal purposes were  carried out and that the purposes of state and local government would be taken into account by the federal government. Thirdly, the past errors of federal education policy have been errors of strategy, not errors of doctrine. Strategy errors include allowing the number of categorical programs to increase, allowing the rules and restrictions accompanying them to multiply, and allowing an adversarial relationship to develop between levels of government.

Both problems are caused by a number of factors, but experts fail to agree on which factors have most contributed to the problems. This paper examines the relationship between education, the productivity decline, and the unemployment rise. Increasing education is believed to increase productivity and reduce unemployment, but rising educational levels may have contributed to the slowdown in productivity. Research in this area has been unable to explain the decline in productivity. Thirty years ago the educational level of the unemployed was lower than that of the employed, but by 1971 the educational levels of  the two groups were no longer different. Increases in educational levels may do little to decrease unemployment. Some observers believe that government and business leaders could improve production through better management and improved working environments rather than increasing economic and capital investments. Existing production techniques could also be modified to employ more labor, better utilize workers' skills and education, and still maintain profitability. Included is a bibliography of references and tables delineating the data presented. (Author/MD)",

        "description":"Causes of the significant decrease in productivity growth and dramatic increase in unemployment in the United States since the mid-1960's are examined in order to test the underlying assumption of current economic policies that increasing capital savings and investments will create fuller and more productive employment. Data on trends in employment, productivity growth, and related variables since World War II are presented and general causes reviewed. The conclusion is that causes may differ between economic sectors, and these differences may be explained by shifts in the concentration of capital from industry and nonfinancial commerce and services to oil, gas, and the banks. In the nonmanufacturing sector, growth of capital investment per employee seems to correlate positively  with productivity growth and negatively with the unemployment rate. In manufacturing, however, how and where capital is invested seems more important than the amount invested. Alternative capital allocation strategies furthering increased employment and higher productivity may require worker and government participation and should take into account the relationships between higher productivity and higher wages; growth and consumer demand; accumulation by private and government sectors; and the allocation of capital among sunset and sunrise industries and among sectors, regions, and nations.

The decline in youthful labor force entrants and forecasted changes in technology and the labor force are producing a need for a system that provides opportunities for education and training throughout the life cycle of workers. The author presents nine different motives for advocating the expansion of recurrent education and points out that this very diversity of approaches and motives may be the greatest political obstacle to its adoption and implementation.

        "description":"This paper provides a description of and rationale for paid educational leave policies in Western Europe by examining three basic categories: general leave provisions provided by law, legal provisions for specific groups, and provisions for educational leave in collective bargaining agreements. Five countries presently have general leave provision: France, Belgium, West Germany, Sweden, and Finland. In Belgium, for example, only employees under 40 years of age who have themselves initiated educational activities outside of work are eligible. In France, the law obliges employers of 10 or more employees to spend 1.1 percent of the total payrolls on further vocational/educational training. Educational leave for specific groups is more widespread. For instance, most Western European  countries grant union officials the right to paid time off from work to attend courses relevant to their union functions. Finally, some countries leave the formulation of legal provisions for educational leave to collective bargaining. A 1973 Italian agreement, which views leave as a collective rather than an individual right and which emphasizes leave for the least educated workers, provides the model for subsequent bargaining. The study concludes that progress continues to be made. (PB)",

        "description":"Chapter One of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) distributes compensatory education grants on the basis of a formula that considers population and cost factors for each of the nation's 3,128 counties. The focus of this report is the effectiveness of that formula in meeting the stated purpose of the legislation to provide aid for educationally disadvantaged children, defined as those who are economically deprived. The study, using a specially constructed computer model of the funding formula, projects allocations for all counties through 1987 and examines the distributional effects of proposed formula modifications. Among the findings are an inverse relationship between proportionate concentrations of economically disadvantaged youngsters and allocations per  eligible child. The formula calculates the entitlement for each county by multiplying the number of eligible children by an education cost factor specific to the state in which the county is located. Most states with low per pupil expenditure also have low per capita income--an indicator of limited government fiscal capacity. To address the gap between the expressed intent and the implementation of the legislation, three alternative modifications are suggested. Tables and figures accompany the text. (MLF)",

The survey found that nearly all state SEA's are involved in educational technology. These primary roles for the computer were identified by the SEA's responding to the survey: as an instructional aid, as a management tool, and as a subject area. There is a wide variety of responses, with each state taking somewhat different approaches. There is much duplication, and states would benefit from sharing their experiences. Nearly all SEA's have chosen to function as facilitators providing  information, resources, training, guidelines, and/or policy support. Very few states conduct research and few develop courseware. Included with the survey are individual summaries of each state's and territory's current stances on educational technology as well as a number of tables outlining state positions on specific issues and programs.

This report's purpose is to assist educators in shaping the future role and nature of the public schools. The report centers on two aspects of the change: the economic context and the evolving educational process. The work world will change dramatically, and these changes have significant implications for the schools' curricula, standards, and teaching methods. The workforce will shift from highly paid skilled jobs to low-wage and low-skilled jobs. The demand for reeducation will increase as people prepare for several careers subject to rapid changes. The education process must adapt to the changing needs of the labor force. The teaching-learning process is being  transformed by the computer and provides more individualized instruction and faster and more expanded learning opportunities. Reviewing the application of computer technology, the report points out how existing educational problems are being solved with the new technology. Policy questions and options are also presented, including rethinking curriculum, equipment needs, teacher training and retraining, and financial considerations. (MD)",

        "description":"Focusing on the problem of authority, an analysis of the theories of Max Weber, James D. Thompson, and Elliott Jaques forms the basis for this proposal for improved organizational effectiveness in public schools. Basic assumptions are that modern organizations are established and operated under rational principles and subject to rational analysis, that in order to improve an organization's effectiveness administrators must act on its structure, and that in changing this structure administrators modify authority relationships between members. Thus, if fashionable but cosmetic remedies are imposed, schools' deep-seated structural problems are neglected. The organizational structure of schools can be improved by working for greater congruence with a triadic model granting each staff  position, except teachers, requisitely rational authority--involving two-way accountability--over subordinates. Practical recommendations drawn from the model include: granting principals more authority; clarifying the limits of authority of intermediate assistants, thereby placing principals and teachers in more direct contact; redefining the role of vice principals as buffering principals and teachers from environmental turbulence; defining accountability relationships more clearly; implementing school-based budgeting; and improving teachers' access to principals and chief executive officers. An alternative theoretical analysis is summarized which implies that principals' main task is to buffer teachers from the disturbances of administrative bureaucracy. (MJL)",

Process evaluation, referring specifically to the act of evaluating what teachers do in their classrooms, may be of formative or summative nature. Formative evaluation can be used to monitor what is happening and serves as the basis for making decisions about modifying teacher behavior. Summative evaluation is a quantitative statement that summarizes how well the teacher has been performing. Rating scales require the observer of events to structure, weigh, and relate many perceptions before reaching a conclusion. Rating systems would seem to be better suited  to summative forms of evaluation. The second method, systematic observation, deliberately focuses on a sharply delimited set of process factors or dimensions. Both teacher and supervisor have information on a single aspect of classroom process that yields ideal formative data. The two approaches can exist if the organization ensures that the rating and observation methodologies employed are recognized as having separate and independent purposes and steps are taken to protect the integrity of each.

Comparisons with earlier studies indicate that the creative opportunities offered by teaching appear more important to contemporary students and that these students are more attracted to service to children, rather than to society in general or to broadly conceived ideals. Those who were strongly committed to obtaining a teaching position  scored factors relating to creativity, children, subject, and prestige as more important to them than did those who were less strongly committed to obtaining employment as teachers.

Although basic inequities in educational services remain, the states' generally poor fiscal condition has resulted in less attention for equity issues. However, public school financing has matured as a prominent state policy issue. A summary of school finance reforms in the last 12 years notes significant progress in the 1970's in expanded general aid, increased equity, better measure of fiscal capacity, and more money for districts and students with special needs. New tax and spending limitations have raised questions about current arrangements for tax collection and distribution, and school finance litigation continues  in many states despite the &quot;Rodriguez&quot; decision. The economic, demographic, and political contexts of educational finance is illustrated by tables on the states' fiscal condition, enrollment trends and projections, funding prospects, public opinion, and revenues and expenditures for public education. A chapter on legislative agendas for 1983 highlights major activities in each state, and a final chapter on school finance litigation discusses litigation strategies based on equal protection clauses and on state education clauses and the standards that have evolved to determine the constitutionality of finance systems. A table summarizes states' most important school finance cases. (MJL)",

The remaining three chapters condense the findings of the individual reports--a comparative study of education systems allocation, a school-level study based on survey data on patterns of staff allocation, and a more detailed school-level study using case studies of selected schools with especially effective staffing policies. The conclusion projects that resource allocation will be influenced in the future by such issues as the balancing of concerns for equity and diversity, the tension between traditional centralized responsibility and the emerging devolution of authority to schools, and weighing priorities among the many purposes of education.

        "description":"A comparative analysis of staff allocation in the six Australian States, the Australian Capital Territory, and New Zealand, this report describes existing structures and policies at the education system level and identifies innovative policies worthy of further examination. After an explanation of the background and conceptual framework of this study, the changing structures of the education systems over the past decade are discussed, particularly the devolution of authority to schools, including greater responsibility for curriculum development and administration, and the movement toward administrative decentralization of the Australian systems. The following chapters describe variations in the size and structure of schools among the systems studied, and the number and  characteristics of teachers and other staff. A chapter on the allocation of personnel resources to government schools discusses the mechanisms of staff allocation and the formulae determining allocations. Teacher salary costs are detailed, and the final chapter offers policy options in response to pressures for change. Recommendations include coordination of different sectors of education systems, further devolution of administration to regional offices, progress toward more appropriate structure and size of schools, school-based curriculum development, and greater school authority for staff selection. Appendixes include classification of teachers and notes to the numerous tables. (MJL)",

An introduction reviews research and outlines some theoretical issues relevant to school organization and resource allocation. The design and administration of the survey are reported in the second chapter. Personnel resources available in schools are described in chapter 3, which incorporates data on the number and type of teaching staff and support staff, the configuration of teaching and support staff in schools of different types, and the principals' report of emerging needs and priorities in staffing. In the following chapter school structures concerned with policy formulation and those concerned with policy  implementation are examined in light of their influence on resource distribution. Chapter 5 considers details of resource allocation including the definition of class size, class size patterns at different school levels, and allocation of staff to noninstructional functions. The final chapter summarizes the discussion, concluding that resource allocation within schools is a complex network that needs to be understood in terms of purposes, circumstances, and structures, as well as student-teacher ratios and class sizes, and that staffing policies should be developed accordingly. Data are presented in abundant tables. (MJL)",

Results suggested that children expect words to be a label for pictures, that articles and prepositions are not necessarily written, and that some phonetic relationship is used to write words. When children used decoding strategies, they did so at the expense of meaning. Findings emphasized the importance of avoiding teaching isolated components of reading or letter formation at the expense of a general understanding of the purpose and function of reading and writing.

The Kent Infant Development (KID) Scale (used with severely and profoundly handicapped children) and the Minnesota Child Development Inventory (MCDI) (used with moderately handicapped children in a parallel matrix of testing) were studied. The KID Scale elicits caregiver responses on child competencies in five areas: cognitive, motor, language, self-help, and social. Data are used for computer-generated profiles, including developmental timetables that indicate which milestones have been acquired and  which milestones should be acquired next. Analysis of KID's reliability indicates adequate interjudge and test-retest reliability. Studies on the test's validity established concurrent validity with the Bayley Scale of Infant Development and substantiated the validity of caregiver reports. The scale's utility is discussed, and its prescriptions for programming are emphasized. The MCDI uses the mother's observations to measure development in eight areas: general, gross motor, fine motor, expressive language, comprehension-conceptual, situation comprehension, self-help, and personal-social. In this study, the instrument was completed by both home and educational caregivers and results were compared with the Stanford Binet Mental Age measure for 93 moderately retarded primary school  children. Results indicated that the General Developmental scale of the MCDI was the best measure of Developmental Age in terms of reliability and validity, had the highest interjudge correlation, and had the highest correlation with the Stanford Binet Mental Age.

The first three papers examine the effects of distributed practice schedules on the learning, generalization and initiation of students. The use of distributed practice, an important element in the KICS model, was supported by the three studies. Two succeeding papers explore the effects of the model on initiation and generalization. Little difference was found in the response initiation variable between KICS and massed trial training, while multiple exemplar training (as evidenced in KICS) was found to produce generalization across items requiring similar response topographics. The third set of studies supports  the effectiveness of group instruction for students with severe and multiple needs. Studies featured structured interaction between students, examination of incidental learning, and effects of group arrangements on vocational workshop tasks. Data recording systems are addressed by three studies which emphasized the need for frequent, although not necessarily daily, recording. A final paper investigates the effects of allowing severely handicapped adolescents to make limited choices of educational activities. (CL)",

The fourth chapter reviews the logistical aspects of the interview approach and offers  suggestions for such aspects as obtaining consent, scheduling, and using specific questioning approaches. Chapter five focuses on responsiveness and discusses the difficulties interviewees had in providing appropriate responses. Chapter six evaluates the reliability of interviewee responses over time, while chapter seven assesses the validity of responses (using correct-incorrect questions and agreement with parents/attendants as measures of validity). In chapter eight, direct comparisons of alternative questioning strategies are presented.

A subsample to rate student progress consisted of a random selection of 61 elementary students from the LDR and 62 elementary students from the LDSC samples. Analyses using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences were performed to compute frequency counts of different variables, t-tests, x squared tests, analyses of covariance, stepwise regression analyses, and T-score conversions. Results indicated  that IEP goals were highly individualized. By analyzing goal frequencies, patterns, categories and progress, the study demonstrates that each student's educational programing was developed to match unique learning difficulties. In most cases, goal categories were not associated with a particular program model (LDR or LDSC), nor was goal progress associated with a particular educational ability and achievement level characteristic. Frequency of goal categories used in the LDR and LDSC programs varied according to duration of enrollment and to reading and math achievement levels. (Author/CL)",

Five conceptual models (open classroom, Structure of the Intellect, Enrichment Triad, Bloom's Taxonomy and Williams' Cognitive Affective Model) are described by M. Karnes, P. Kemp and M. Williams in \"Conceptual  Models.\" Characteristics, selection, and training of teachers for the gifted is the focus of another paper, \"Teachers,\" by Karnes. Examples of differentiated curricula in the academic skill areas are provided and suggested approaches to encouraging creativity, divergent thinking, and higher level thinking skills are discussed in \"Differentiating the Curriculum\" by M. Karnes, S. Linnemeyer and C. Denton-Ade. The development of self concept, self esteem, and social development, and techniques to enhance them are suggested in \"Affective Development,\" by K. Abroms. \"Creativity and Play\" presents a discussion by A. Gunsberg on ways to encourage creativity through play. Research on the influences of parental attitudes and behaviors is reviewed by M. Karnes in \"The Role of the Family.\" He also  offers options for parent involvement in the education of their gifted child. In a final chapter, \"Evaluation,\" A. Shwedel discusses the importance of, and reviews models for, evaluating preschool gifted programs. (CL)",

ISFAR's staffing patterns, guiding philosophy of helping parents become more adequate in their interaction with their children, and positive organizational climate are discussed. Program operations are viewed in terms of intake and screening procedures, case assessment, parent's commitment, use of consensus as a decisionmaking tool, problem identification, case planning, individualized client services (including parenting education, home visits involving close friends and extended family, and group activities), case monitoring and evaluation, and  followup. Project evaluation findings focus on system impact, client perceptions of services, and measures of individual and family functioning. Comparison with the county protective services revealed that ISFAR cases had lower rates of recidivism and resulted in fewer days in foster care. ISFAR cases were found to be more expensive, at least in short-term consideration. Process analysis underline the importance of support in casework decisionmaking. Characteristics of clients and of the services leading to successful outcomes are analyzed. More than half of the document is composed of appendixes: the actual project evaluation report, ISFAR entry criteria, a copy of a family interview instrument, a description of treatment groups, guidelines for staffing and restaffing, and descriptions  of dissemination activities.

Demographic factors (age, sex, institutionalization, and geographic distribution) are reviewed, and varying definitions of deaf-blindness are cited. Descriptions of the type and range of services offered are provided and gaps in service delivery are identified, including lack of staff skill in the more sophisticated communication methods (such as fingerspelling or signing). Concerns were voiced by federal officials and state and local administrators over funding, especially when programs are called upon to service increasing numbers of deaf-blind  persons with additional severe disabilities. Teachers expressed dissatisfaction with their preparation and predicted low level accomplishments for the students. Parents, for their part, were pessimistic about their children's future development. Deaf-blind adults indicated vocational preparation, communication training, and financial aid as the top three desired services, with social life and recreation most frequently cited as a problem. Data and relevant literature are summarized according to 14 topics, including the education process, the habilitation/rehabilitation process, and alternative living arrangements. A final chapter offers recommendations, including the need for a continued federal presence in the education of deaf-blind youth and for parent education and respite care.  (CL)",

Professionals' skills were also assessed with the inventory and found to be at criterion level.

The four studies are O'Malley, 1981; Oxford, et al., 1981; Barnes and Milne, 1981; and Milne and Gombert, 1981. Reviews of the various reports reveal at least four major reasons why the results differ: (1) the purposes underlying the estimates vary, (2) definitions of target populations differ, (3)  methodologies used to determine language minority or limited English status differ, and (4) underlying data bases vary. The problems involved in defining, measuring, and estimating language minority, limited and/or English proficient children are highlighted.

These tasks include an analysis of question types, response modes, and the role of cues. Communication events, such as turn-taking, depict the communication of an integral segment of information in classroom exchanges.  The typology describes these events by their source, medium, purpose, and by a special group of descriptors for communication strategies and affective aspects of classroom interactions.

Data were collected through site observation and interviews, and questionnaires completed by institute participants and their supervisors. Overall, 75 percent of the respondents stated that the curriculum was adequate to their needs. Several instructional practices were identified as particularly successful, including language immersion settings and the opportunity to practice the assessment techniques with actual students. The participants' information needs were influenced by their background characteristics. Recommendations were made regarding assessment instruments  and institute curriculum design. (Author/RW)",

Three alternatives perspectives on language use are discussed: structural, functional, and communicative. Taken together, these perspectives highlight the goal of foreign language learning: teaching the ability to use the language system creatively and to relate forms to functions appropriately in situations involving real meaning, real time, and actual interaction. Two models of language learning which might have different implications for language teaching methodology are considered: the skill learning model and the natural learning model. Practical suggestions for a communicative teaching methodology are offered. Four basic features of such an  approach are: readiness to learn, insight into significant features of whatever behavior is to be learned, practice in producing the behavior, and feedback about the success of these attempts.

        "description":"Criticism of education has brought with it a reduction in the status of the teaching profession. The effects of this on faculty have been worsened by changes in career rewards and responsibilities brought about by the economic problems of higher education institutions. Colleges can no longer overlook the needs of faculty. Both life cycles and careers move through a series of identifiable stages. Among careers, the academic profession is unique. It is a solitary, unchanging activity with a reward structure that emphasizes research rather than teaching. Faculty development programs that have evolved have shown limited effectiveness. A new type of program, Faculty Career Development, includes faculty retraining, career changes, and early retirement incentives. This new focus raises  questions about the future of academics as a career. To promote a healthy climate, educators must become more knowledgeable about adult development and career stages. A reform of the academic reward system is needed. The present crisis can be turned into an opportunity for revitalizing faculty careers.

        "description":"Improving the quality of learning is basic to raising academic standards. Research on postsecondary learning improvement has provided a base of practical knowledge to guide faculty and planners. Successful learning improvement programs share two essential characteristics: they are more comprehensive in the range of students' needs met, and they are better institutionalized into the academic mainstream. The four basic types of programs, in ascending order of effectiveness, are: (1) isolated remedial skills courses; (2) learning assistance to individual students; (3) course-related supplementary learning activities; and (4) comprehensive learning systems in academic courses. There are 26 critical variables for learning improvement related to goals and rationale, instructional  methods and content, staff, and program evaluation. Obtaining an interdependence of learning improvement and instructional change is the purpose of the Decision Guide for Effective Programs. The Decision Guide offers greater control over educational processes and outcomes through more effective techniques of management, delivery, and evaluation.

        "description":"There is an increasing interest by government in accountability for higher education. Efforts such as performance budgeting, performance auditing, and state review of academic programs are becoming more common. Opponents of government involvement assert that regional accreditation reviews are sufficient to maintain quality standards. However, critics of the current accreditation process contend that it is an ingrown process in which denial of accreditation is virtually impossible. Some observers feel that the best way to guard against an increased state role in higher education is for the institutions themselves to strengthen their own evaluation activities. Self-evaluations should be comprehensive, include broad participation, and be designed to enhance program quality. Both  quantitative and qualitative data should be included. The findings should be submitted to an external consultant for review. Conclusions should be made public so that the community can see that the institution is concerned about quality, that its efforts are worthy of public funding, and that state evaluators are unnecessary.

The recruitment process, which should employ a search committee, involves several steps: (1) receiving notification of a vacant position; (2) receiving authorization to recruit; (3) determining salary; (4) organizing the recruitment effort; (5) screening applicants' files; (6) conducting campus visits; and (7) making an offer.

Questionnaire responses were obtained from 27 academic institutions. Criteria included publications, institutional committee activity, research, clinical practice, and involvement in professional organizations. The effects of institution size, type, and level as well as program administrative placement within the institution were studied. There were some differences that related to institutional size, but generally, requirements for positive personnel decisions paralleled those of the liberal arts and sciences faculty: research and publication. The need for additional requirements of  professional practice and for activity within a professional organization were apparent. It is concluded that medical technology faculty who must maintain professional competence along with the standard teaching and service responsibilities have less available time for traditional scholarly activities that are rewarded with positive personnel decisions. A questionnaire is appended. (Author/SW)",

Similar trends are noted for the information era, but with some important differences: the growing importance of information as an economic good in its own right and the changes in market demand for worker skills. It is suggested that since the industrial revolution, the university has provided three major types of products for society: an educated and  socialized worker, knowledge in the form of basic research, and knowledge in the form of applied research. The university's role in providing continuing education and industry's involvement in employee development and training are also considered.

Medical school research can be categorized as basic, clinical, socioepidemiological, and related to health service, while the services medical schools provide can include general and tertiary patient care, specialized centers, consultation, and miscellaneous services such as staff development or public information programs. The cost of medical education is complex  because of the blend of missions and because activities for the different areas may be carried out by the same staff persons. States often base funding on formula concepts and on the notion that the medical schools' only mission is undergraduate medical education. The complexities of medical schools and their related academic health centers often are not realized. Additional consideration is given to factors which affect medical school funding and costs: missions; sponsorship; medical schools' relationships with parent universities, academic health centers, and teaching hospitals; demographic characteristics of medical schools; and local administrative decisions.

        "description":"Regional training activities of campus-based women's centers, and needs assessment and evaluation studies of the National Women's Centers Training Project are discussed. The women's centers project at Everywoman's Center, University of Massachusetts, was designed to provide staff training in the following areas: power and leadership issues in women's groups, organizational issues, program planning, budget development, and communication skills. The establishment of training sites in four federal regions during the second funding year is discussed, and information is presented on site selection, training of regional staff, and the results of training in these regions. Follow-up study (1978-1979) results are presented concerning the impact of training on center operations and on 15  individual participants in 12 centers not affiliated with the University of Massachusetts center. In addition, 1978-1979 National Needs Survey results are presented for 99 women's centers. Information is presented on center characteristics, program planning and implementation needs, internal organizational problems, and relations between centers and campus administrators. Finally, key issues facing higher education and women's centers/women's programs are identified, based on a 1979 women's centers and higher education conference. (SW)",

Population trends and the effects of ethnicity, region, and age on the population pool are reviewed to provide estimates for future postsecondary education enrollments. In addition, the need for education and training investment in America's human resources is examined by looking at current labor force profiles, the structure of employment, and technology trends and their implications for workers and worker education. The federal role in providing access to postsecondary education from the  post-World War II era until current times is also traced. Information for the postsecondary sectors covers enrollments; revenues; resource allocation; tuition; federal financial aid; sources of financial support; academic departments offering degrees by level; distribution of financial assistance by selected financial assistance programs for proprietary vocational schools; courses in adult education by type and provider; civilian federal training costs, courses, and participation; and military training loads and expenditures.

The bill, the Challenge Grant Amendments of 1983, would amend the Higher Education Act of 1965, Title III, Part C, in order to: (1) encourage the development of endowment funds by developing institutions, (2) provide additional incentives to promote institutional fund-raising activities, and (3) foster increased independence and self-sufficiency of the institutions. The endowment to any such institution in any fiscal year would not exceed $200,000 and would not be less than $50,000. Stipulations for the use of such grants, selection criteria, and the application for challenge grants are addressed, along with a Congressional Budget Office cost estimate, the legislative history of the  bill, and a section-by-section analysis of the bill.

The study group was a national sample of high school seniors who participated in the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972. Both college type and major had a significant effect on educational attainment, and college type had a small but significant effect on occupational attainment. Interactions of college type with race and sex were also found. College major significantly affected  educational attainment of four-year colleges students versus a negligible effect for two-year students. Educational expectations had a stronger impact on educational attainment for Hispanics and Whites than for Blacks, and for females than for males. Educational attainment was the major determinant of occupational attainment for Blacks and Whites, while sex and educational expectations were the most important factors for Hispanics. Finally, college major had a significant effect on occupational attainment of females versus a negligible effect for males. (Author/SW)",

The most successful components of the program involve a personalized advising system and a departmentally-defined contract between the student and faculty sponsor. An integral part of the program is an advising and consultation procedure. Each prospective intern selects a relevant \"pre-course,\" which serves as the theoretical base from which to pursue the field experience. After an information meeting for all prospective interns, each student talks individually with the internship coordinator, and a brief proposal is formulated. After departmental approval, students work with the university's Office of Internships, which help students in preparing resumes and making agency connections.  Through additional meetings with the internship coordinator, the internship prospectus and academic contract are developed. The prospectus describes the internship duties and the relationship of the internship to the psychology major, the pre-course, career plans, and personal interests. The student must keep a weekly journal, submit a summary report, and maintain contact with the faculty sponsor. A internship contract form and internship guidelines are appended. (SW)",

The views of Kohlberg, Perry, and others who have studied ethical and moral development are briefly reviewed. These psychologists suggest that there is a hierarchy or continuum for the development of moral reasoning. Colleges and universities may also be viewed as representing a continuum, with some having an orthodox view of right and wrong, and others being more concerned about expanding the horizons of their students and providing them an opportunity to develop an ability to make reasoned ethical decisions. Higher education institutions see their roles and responsibilities for the ethical and moral development of their students in different ways depending  on the institution's mission and character. To help students learn to raise questions and to examine moral issues, the faculty and administration may wish to take thoughtful and examined stands on moral and ethical issues and engage in open discussion and deliberation about difficult moral problems.

It is noted that, by and large, state governments have left colleges alone until the past two decades. State intrusions have taken the form of accountability statutes, budgeting, performance audits, program review, minimum standards, sunset laws, and more powerful state governing boards. Because of changing demographic, economic, and social trends, the public still wants proof of better management in higher education. Such demand should be limited to appropriate topics and should be expressed through a mechanism sensitive to both public and institutional interests. Both society and higher education would be assisted in this oversight partnership by an attitude adjustment, better staffing,  adequate information, and improved communication. Higher education's best chance is in candid assessment of the problems that lie ahead and in frank discussion of the decisions. Six current events affecting California's community colleges are described that are departures from the past treatment of this sector. These developments include the following: a reduction for the curriculum of about $30 million; a narrowing of the community college mission; a plan to implement tuition; and basing state aid on new standards.

The objective is to stimulate renewed thinking and action more consistent with stated policy goals in higher education. One of the primary functions of a mentor or sponsor is to exercise personal power to ensure the allocation of organizational resources and rewards to a protege. Related to the colonial analogy is the competition among women and minorities that results from the scarcity of mentors from the organization's establishment who are interested in and willing to work with these particular newcomers. There is a point at which the severity of competition can undermine cooperative networking among colleagues. Another vestige of  colonialism concerns the price to be paid for selection as a protege, since selection may be determined by the protege's willingness to subscribe to the social and intellectual legacy of the prospective mentor. In addition, socializing proteges involves subscribing to the \"rules of the game\" in academia, rules that may be questioned because of their historically discriminatory applications. The strategy of networking within the university and across institutions is also addressed. (SW)",

This check-off option allows students to indicate that they are applying only for federal aid. The 1982-1983 Financial Aid Form (FAF), sponsored and processed by the College Scholarship Service, not only excludes the check-off option but does not mention that there is no fee for applying for federal aid or that there is an alternative form available for which no fee is  required. The Department ruled that an institution and/or state agency might require additional data elements to determine eligibility for nonfederal aid, and that students could be charged fees for the collection and analysis of such data. The new multiple data entry mechanism allows students to apply for state, institutional, and federal funds with one form.

The final regulation makes three changes: calculation of the federal capital contribution, which is the amount of new federal dollars allocated to institutions each year; the eligibility of institutions to receive awards based on default rates; and the method of appealing an award determination made by the Department. The regulation would end new NDSL funds for the 1982-1983 academic year at schools with NDSL default rates of more than 25 percent and could reduce funds for schools with NDSL default rates from 10 to 25 percent. Schools with default rates of less than 10 percent could get a larger share of federal funds. Concern is expressed  concerning: the effect on schools of the late publication of the final rule; the disproportionate impact of the final regulation on black colleges and universities, which serve low-income populations; and the potential that the regulation reduces the incentive for institutions to make substantial progress in reducing default rates.

        "description":"This preliminary report describes part of NKI-Skolen's planned contribution to a cooperative study on student non-start and early withdrawals in correspondence education, which was created by the Norwegian Association of Correspondence Schools. A project is explained which will examine the organization of the initial phases of a student's correspondence study by assigning students in an experimental group to personal tutors who will integrate the normally-separated administrative, teaching, and counseling tutor functions. A background section provides a research review on the drop-out problem in distance education, non-start and early withdrawals, and student reasons for discontinuation. Further experimental studies with special relevance to the research problems and procedures  are briefly presented. Under experimental procedures, the tutors' role in the study is examined in detail. Finally, research design and procedures are explained, including the courses, student selection, questionnaire design and data collection, and a summary of the research problems. A five-page bibliography is included, as well as a questionnaire (in Norwegian) designed for both experimental and control groups, which contains items on correspondence study in general, the tutor's work, and counselling, to contrast their perceptions on different aspects of distance study.

Advice is given on how to avoid destructive conflict while nurturing creative conflict, and a model is presented which assumes that every task has a particular art, science, or technology associated with it. Each specialist's relationship to other team members is articulated throughout four production process phases: (1) conception through the first draft script, (2) final scripting, (3) production, and (4) post-production and utilization. Project team  members discussed are the project leader, instructional designer, academic specialists, researcher, producer, director, utilization specialist, writer, and supporting technical and project staff. The tasks and interactions of the major team members are analyzed in depth, including characteristics, roles, relationships, and new, job-related techniques. Briefly-stated conclusions complete the guide. (LMM)",

It is noted that today's students are generally unprepared to work in an information society. Three educational goals related to careers in science and engineering that have been assigned a high priority by the National Science Board are outlined. An identification of educational problem areas mentions the  shortage of qualified science and math teachers, the inadequate amount of time for classroom instruction, the outdated nature of science and math curricula, the need for change in instructional approaches, and the lack of public perception of the need for scientific and mathematical literacy among all students. It is recommended that the state legislatures establish comprehensive plans for upgrading education; secure financing to purchase new school computers, software, and science equipment; improve teacher training; revise classroom policies that detract from student achievement; and improve the science and math curricula.

Data collection methods included circulation system monitoring and the administration of 10 sets of surveys. It was found that: (1) efficiencies in production caused by automation resulted in increased quality of service to patrons; (2) this new level of service decreased after a period of time (probably due to the Hawthorne effect) but still remained much higher than the level of service under the manual circulation system; (3) patron response to changes produced by automation  varied over time, beginning with unfavorable attitudes during the period of transition from the manual to the online system, moving to more favorable attitudes after the transition period, and returning to original attitude values as patrons cycled out of the student body; and (4) patrons did not make increased use of the automated system even though it was easier to use. This report describes the Oberlin automated circulation system and research methodology and findings. A 34-item bibliography and sample data collection instruments are provided. (Author/ESR)",

It is noted that the online system, known as the Library Control System (LCS), was designed to be fully operational in July 1982. Steps in LCS development from November 1970 to 1981 are presented in chronological order. Four problems with LCS are then discussed: (1) LCS is a full online catalog for only 20% of OSU titles; (2) the card catalog must still be used to obtain full records of pre-1974 and non-Roman alphabet materials; (3) LCS has design problems related to terminal operation, the use of complicated search keys, and the interpretation of different types of online  displays, primarily because it was originally designed for staff use only; and (4) the gradual development of LCS and resulting system changes have necessitated much retraining of staff and library users. A brief discussion of LCS advantages follows, noting that LCS provides circulation status information for each title, remote access to the library catalog, the opportunity for economically feasible catalog change and expansion, and functions that speed technical service operations. Sample online records and searches are provided. (ESR)",

These factors indicate that libraries will play an active support role in the future. Historically the  three main functions of a library have been to collect, preserve, and retrieve information. Fundamental changes are occurring in library procedures due to networking and the development of online cataloging, interlibrary loans, acquisitions, and information retrieval. A cooperative network of resource sharing libraries will probably evolve in the future with service, not storage, as the primary library function. An extensive bibliography is included.

        "description":"This report summarizes the proceedings of a conference that brought together 35 librarians, network representatives, and system vendors to exchange information on the training of users of online public access catalogs. Three papers are presented: &quot;Historic Concerns in Library Instruction: Teaching the Card Catalog,&quot; by Evan Farber; &quot;The Nationwide Computer Catalog Study: Training Issues,&quot; by Douglas Ferguson; and &quot;Psychological Factors in Online Catalog Use, or Why Users Fail,&quot; by Christine L. Borgman. Also presented are summary descriptions of current online catalog user training programs at Northwestern University; Mankato State University; Pikes Peak Library; Dartmouth College; University of California, Berkeley; Iowa City Public Library; Guelph University; University of  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and the Library of Congress. A transcript of a panel presentation on the communication between public service and systems staff in building the online catalog is followed by a brief summary of the conference, which focuses on its four main themes: communication, diversity versus standardization, system enhancements that facilitate user training, and the use of goal-oriented training versus the provision of a learning environment. Conference recommendations are also recorded. Appendices provide a list of conference participants, the conference agenda, and a list of handouts distributed to participants. (ESR)",

Project results showed that dissemination programs developed by the National Institute of Education (NIE) and other federal departments substantially increased the ability of state officials to assist local school districts to improve. Recommendations based on survey results from 50 states and 6 territories, as well as other major dissemination studies include: (1) the State Dissemination Leadership Project, ERIC, the R&amp;D Exchange, and the National Diffusion Network should be continued; (2) special purpose grants for completing key dissemination functions in state education authorities (SEAs)  should be made available; (3) NIE should continue to fund major programs to help state staff understand the processes of change; and (4) the Education Department should create an internal Dissemination Policy Council to coordinate the development of rules and regulations for dissemination/school improvement activities. This report describes project goals, events, accomplishments, and conclusions. Extensive appendices include a briefing book given to persons attending the formal presentation of project recommendations to the NIE director with survey results, project descriptions, and other material provided; a report on an Appalachia Educational Laboratory (AEL) review of dissemination in southeastern states; and additional related documents.

Background to the project is provided first, delineating TOP's objectives of examining general educaton assumptions; making the humanistic spirit more pervasive in the general education curriculum; producing a series of interrelated course outlines; and completing the integration of a model general education program. The next section describes project activities for each of the following phases: (1) Pre-project (i.e., organization and planning); (2) Phase I (i.e., criteria development and formation of a study group and advisory  committee); (3) Phase II (i.e., course restructuring, preparation of course outlines by faculty, formation of a general education committee, and application of criteria); (4) Phase III (i.e., teaching and refinement of course outlines); and (5) Post-project (i.e., evaluation and dissemination). The next section describes the evaluation process and findings for each phase of the project; faculty, student, and external evaluation; and project conclusions. Finally, the impact of TOP and its current status are discussed. The bulk of the report consists of appendices providing detailed information on the general education courses, a site visit report, four course outlines, and evaluation findings. (LAL)",

Following background information and a brief introduction to the nature of financial assistance, part 1 explores major trends and issues in financial aid, revealing: (1) an increase in student indebtedness as loans rather than grants become the new dominant source of current financial assistance; (2) a substantial rise in district and state contributions to student aid; (3) evidence that only 60% of student aid applicants receive assistance; and (4) the disproportionate  impact of student aid recipients in generating average daily attendance. This section provides historical comparisons of California community college financial assistance, discusses the implications of trends in financial aid for low-income students, highlights the growth of Guaranteed Student Loans (GSL's), and discusses the decline of need-based aid programs. Part 2 examines selected characteristics of student aid recipients and financial aid administrators. Operating costs, staff, and workload are considered in part 3. Finally, part 4 discusses the implications of study findings. A description of five major federal aid programs and a list of financial aid regional representatives are appended. (LAL)",

Case studies highlight instances in which community colleges' open access policies, teamed with inadequate advising and hard-sell recruitment tactics, can frustrate the goal achievement of underprepared students. A response by community colleges to the issue of open access should resolve questions related to: (1) defining the competencies needed for a reasonable chance of success in each program offered; (2) assessing students to determine if they have the requisite competencies and to place them appropriately; (3) providing alternative programs for students lacking minimum competencies; (4) analyzing the length of time students must pursue  remedial programs and other alternatives before they are told if they qualify for their first choice programs; (5) providing accurate information regarding pre-programs and chances of admission to programs of original choice; (6) offering skills programs to help improve student employability; and (7) obtaining adequate funding for services provided for underprepared students. Attempts to serve all students without regard to their preparation for the services offered increase the difficulty of providing the educational quality and depth needed by those with the ability to derive the maximum benefit from the community college.

Study findings revealed: (1) respondents felt the major purposes of community colleges to be job/career development, improvement of basic skills, and preparation for transfer to a four-year institution; (2) 49% of all adults had attended at least one class at a community college; (3) 67% of the respondents felt that more money should be spent on higher education; (4) over 7O% opted for local rather than state policy control; and (5) 12% of the  households interviewed had one or more unemployed members; and, of those unemployed persons seeking re-employment, half expected to look to their local community college for all or part of their skill training.

        "author":["Tschechtelin, James D."],
        "description":"A study of community college funding in Maryland found that the Community College of Baltimore (CCB) faces unique educational circumstances warranting additional state aid. These circumstances largely result from the special needs of Baltimore City, which has a disproportionate concentration of the state's poor and dependent citizens, the greatest noneducational demands on its limited resources, the highest real property tax in the state, the least ability to increase local revenues, a historic lack of adequate resources for elementary and secondary education, an intense need for remedial training, and a growing demand for educational services. Low family incomes, high unemployment, and low student attendance and promotion rates in Baltimore have special consequences for CCB.  Compared to similar colleges, CCB has: (1) the highest proportion of remedial students; (2) massive requirements for student financial aid administration; and (3) the lowest level of funding for current operations. Many challenges faced by CCB can be accounted for by the heavy population density of Baltimore. The State Board for Community Colleges therefore recommends that the state provide an additional $150 per full-time equivalent student to the CCB and any community college in an area with a population density of more than 8,000 per square mile. Data tables contrasting Baltimore with other political subdivisions in Maryland and comparing CCB with other Maryland community colleges are included. (HB)",

For the college as a whole, and for each of its four campuses, longitudinal data are provided on student ethnic background, gender, and age, and re-enrollment and graduation rates. Selected findings include the following: (1) each of the student cohorts contains over 5,000 full-time students, representing approximately 50% of the total first-time-in-college students; (2) the male to female proportions have shifted over the 6-year period, so that slightly more than half of the students in each cohort are females; (3) the ethnic  proportions have also shifted across the years, with an increase in the proportion of Hispanic students evident; (4) for both Blacks and Hispanics, the proportion of students over 26 years of age has gradually increased; (5) in general, after 3 years, 25% of the students remain enrolled and 25% have graduated; and (6) the implementation of standards of academic progress in 1978 had an initial effect of depressing re-enrollment and graduation rates among all ethnic groups, though a recovery in these rates was evident in later cohorts among White and Black students. The report concludes with questions for further research. (HB)",

        "description":"To determine whether support systems ameliorated the impact of divorce on family stress and child adjustment, the present study examined the availability to divorced families of various support systems, including the extended family, church, work, and community groups. Specifically, the study addressed the impact of parental support systems on children's academic achievement and intellectual and social competence. Additionally, the study identified those specific support systems that were most highly related to diminished adverse consequences of divorce. Data gathered from an ongoing nationwide study begun at Kent State University in 1981 by the National Association of School Psychologists served as the basis for the analyses. Findings demonstrated the utility of at least three  clusters of support variables: (1) availability of helpful relatives, including in-laws; (2) availability of friends and paid child care assistance, such as that provided by nursery schools and baby sitters; and (3) a positive relationship between child and noncustodial parent. Repeatedly, the custodial parent's activities in both occupational and educational endeavors also emerged as significantly related to child performance. Results confirmed that several support systems were related to the divorced mother's effectiveness in interacting with her children and illustrated the substantial effects of support systems on the child's school adjustment.

        "description":"This study investigates the relationship of parental consistency, both between parents and in each parent separately, with respect to socialization attitudes and their longitudinal impact on the developing personality of children. A total of 83 sets of parents completed the Child-Rearing Practices Report (CRPR) when their children were 3 years of age. Forty-five girls and 38 boys were assessed at the ages of 3, 4, 7, ll, and l4 on the California Child Q-Sort (CCQ). When the children were l2 years of age, the parents of 18 girls and 22 boys were re-examined on the CRPR. Objective and broad-ranging measures of mother/father agreement in childrearing values (CRPR) and child personality (CCQ) at the various age levels yielded relationships between parents' consistency and the  psychological characteristics of their children. Parental agreement or consistency had a much greater impact on boys' developing personality than it did on girls'. The differences were consistent and detailed over time for both sexes. Results were interpreted in terms of boys' need for structure and girls' need for less inhibition. In comparison with intraparental consistency, interparental consistency had a greater impact on the child's personality. Individual consistency in both parents had its largest influence at adolescence; this finding was interpreted as reflecting an adolescent need for structure in the child/adult period of transition.

A total of 51 sixth-grade children (23 boys and 28 girls) were administered the following measures of social competence: four sociometric questionnaires, a role-playing test, behavior observation in a simulated small-group activity, two teacher rating scales, and three self-report questionnaires (self-concept, empathy, and assertion). In addition, standardized achievement scores and ratings of physical attractiveness were obtained. Intercorrelations among the measures were made. Peer ratings, acceptance nominations, and rejection nominations were  employed as criterion variables. For girls, the content of their responses to role-playing scenes, negative behavior interaction, and teacher ratings predicted performance on sociometric measures. For boys, no assessment approach consistently predicted sociometric status. Longer responses to role-playing scenes did correlate with social rejection for boys. Peer ratings of athletic ability correlated with social acceptance ratings for boys and girls. Sex differences in social skills and the importance of determinants of popularity other than social skills are discussed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"To compare disciplinary techniques within families spanning three generations, 24 maternal grandmothers and 24 mothers independently selected rewarding and punishing consequences for their children's correct and incorrect responses on an age-appropriate learning task. The children's behaviors were experimentally controlled so that performances always appeared to worsen. As children's performance ostensibly declined from 80 to 50 percent &quot;success,&quot; mothers and grandmothers increased both rewarding and punitive intensities. When success subequently decreased to 20 percent, mothers continued increasing rewards and punishments, but grandmothers' behaviors leveled off. Results extend earlier findings with mothers and their sons to mother/daughter and grandmother/grandchild  disciplinary interactions. Overall, grandmothers' and mothers' discipline was more similar than different; however, despite the preponderance of similarities, differences that were found tended to favor the stereotype that grandmothers are more giving, less punitive, and more forgiving than are mothers. The intensities of both reward and punishment by grandmothers were related to their levels of involvement with their grandchildren. (Author/RH)",

The initial sample consisted of 321 low-income women; all mothers were interviewed during the third trimester of pregnancy, and approximately 83 percent were interviewed at 4- and 12-months following birth. During the children's kindergarten year, interviews were completed with 233 mothers. A locus of control scale was included in interviews conducted during pregnancy, at 4 and at 12 months, and during the kindergarten year. Mothers were observed  in child care situations during 4- and 12-month sessions and were rated on an attachment inventory. During 12-month and kindergarten interviews, maternal childrearing values and beliefs were measured on a version of Kohn's (1977) rank-order instrument of parental self-directing versus conforming values for children; and maternal beliefs about childrearing and education were measured on the Parental Modernity Inventory. The Classroom Behavior Inventory was used to collect teacher ratings of child academic competence and social adjustment at the end of the kindergarten year. Results indicated that maternal demographic variables, maternal locus of control, and maternal childrearing variables were intercorrelated predictors of child academic competence. (RH)",

To develop such a model, a study was conducted in which teacher ratings were collected on two cohorts of kindergarten children (numbering 110 and 119, respectively). Several measures were used, including the Classroom Behavior Inventory, Bipolar Trait Ratings, Conners' Teacher Rating Scales, and global ratings of social adjustment and academic competence. Factor analysis and multidimensional scaling were used to isolate major dimensions and regions of configurational organizations of measures. These analyses identified three  dimensions and conceptual regions related to major diagnostic syndromes: extraversion versus introversion, considerateness versus hostility, and academic competence. Adaptive and maladaptive behavior scales, psychopathology scales, bipolar trait-rating scales, and academic competence scales were integrated by a spherical model of adaptive behavior. In general, the model integrated major dimensions of social adjustment and academic competence with major syndromes of psychopathology. The model also integrated diagnostic categories of mental retardation and learning disabilities with conduct problems and personality problems associated with patterns of social and emotional behavior.

However, at present a great discrepancy exists between what this tool for the mind is capable of doing and what child care centers, schools, and society allow it to do. Two computer-related activities that may be implemented with very young children are (1) developing programing abilities and (2) using word processing computer systems to develop writing abilities. Although prior to 1980 interactive programing was largely inaccessible to adults as well as children, researchers using languages such as Papert's LOGO now demonstrate that computers are a medium through which children can be generators of information rather than merely recipients. Word processing appears to have a great deal of  promise for supporting a shift in the teaching of writing toward an emphasis on prewriting, composing, and rewriting (three major processes used by effective writers). While the educational potential for computer use is gaining widespread support, a number of serious drawbacks associated with this technology need to be addressed by early childhood educators; such drawbacks include an absence of supportive research, the poor quality of software programs, fear of computers, and lack of computer literacy among early childhood personnel.

Of the 105 preschool children studied, 60 attended the Culver City Children's Center (CCCC) and 45 attended a comparable, geographically distant center that differed from the CCCC in not providing social work services to families. From entry to the 24-month point, daily and at least weekly process data were collected on each family and each child; cross-sectional assessments were also regularly made at the entry point, after 6 weeks, and after 5, 12, and 24 months. Ratings of  the child's development were supplemented by various test assessments. Once children were in kindergarten or primary grades, teachers assessed them twice each school year on 16 behavioral ratings. Cross-sectional assessments for the comparison center families and children were made available. Depending on the year of project operation, social workers used psychoanalytically oriented techniques with families in one of three different parent interventions: open-ended, problem-oriented, or consultative with selective use of social work services. Attempts were made to assist children of single working welfare mothers, who were at risk for adapting unsuccessfully to kindergarten. (RH)",

Based on mothers' responses to a parenting attitudes questionnaire, two factors were selected which measured openness to communication (open expression factor) and hostility (hostility factor). These factors were found to be related to mothers' and children's reports of physical and mental health, and to qualitative aspects of their relationship as measured in a videotaped play observation session (play interaction). The scores of mothers of sons vs. daughters did not significantly  differ for either the open expression factor or the hostility factor. Mothers who rated themselves high on the open expression factor were more supportive and their children responded more positively to them. Conversely, mothers who rated themselves high on the hostility factor were less interactive, at least with boys, and their sons were non-interactive or negative in turn. Parenting attitudes were also related to mothers' self-reports of adjustment, to their ratings of their children's adjustment, and even to their children's self-reports. The direction of effect is unclear, but the issues that surround mother-son relationships are clearly shown to differ from those surrounding mother-daughter relationships. (BJD)",

Because they represent a transitional period in cognitive development from heteronomy to autonomy, a total of 25 male and 38 female third-grade students of approximately 9 years of age were selected for participation. The effect of perspective taking on moral judgment was measured by having subjects make judgments from their own perspectives as well as from the perspectives of their mothers and fathers. Since the literature indicates that moral judgment is influenced by sex-role identification and parent identification, measures were included to assess these dimensions. The major concern, however, was the examination of sex differences in moral reasoning. Each subject was given a  series of three tests presented in random order: the Goodenough-Harris Drawing Test, Piaget's Moral Maturity Scale, and the Parent Identification Scale (a 23-item scale designed for the study and including questions about the child's favorite toys and best friends, the mother's and father's favorite items, and selected parent behaviors and characteristics). Results yielded no significant effect for gender on moral judgment at this age level.

In the first phase of the study, copies of an inventory entitled &quot;My Biggest Problem Today&quot; were sent to both national and state (Wisconsin) samples of prekindergarten programs. The problem inventory asked personnel to describe, on each of 10 working days, the problem that caused them the most concern or difficulty. Synthesis of the problem accounts resulted in 102 unique problem statements, which were subsequently used to construct a Prekindergarten Teacher Problems Checklist. In the seond phase of the study, checklists were sent to other Wisconsin and national samples. Factor analysis of checklist responses identified  seven problem areas: subordinate staff relations, control and nurturance of children, remediation, relations with supervisors, parent cooperation, management of time, and management of routine. Comparison of findings with research on kindergarten through 12th-grade teachers' problems suggested four areas of difference: Prekindergarten teachers express important unmet needs with respect to (1) supervision of subordinate staff, (2) relations with parents regarding compliance with program policies and procedures, (3) relations with supervisors, and (4) management of routines. Implications of the findings for early childhood teacher education are indicated. (RH)",

        "description":"The popular media extensively covered Benbow and Stanley's (1980) reported finding of a major sex difference in mathematical reasoning abilities among gifted seventh-grade students. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of that media campaign on parents' beliefs regarding their sons' and daughters' math aptitudes. Two sets of parental beliefs were studied: (1) parents' beliefs about the mathematical abilities of their own children, and (2) parents' general stereotypes about sex differences in mathematical ability. A sample of predominantly middle-class parents had responded to questionnaires in the spring of 1979 and 1980. Approximately 3 months after the media campaign, a third questionnaire was sent to a subsample of 250 parents with children in the seventh, ninth,  and eleventh grades. Included in the survey was a question describing the media coverage of the research and asking whether the respondent had heard about it. Approximately one-quarter of the parents were aware of the study. Results indicated that exposure to the media reports of the Benbow and Stanley study did affect parents' attitudes. As predicted, exposure had its largest impact on mothers of daughters and fathers of sons. Both became more stereotyped in their beliefs. Unexpectedly, media exposure also had a positive effect on fathers of daughters; whereas the attitudes of fathers unexposed to the media campaign became more sex stereotyped than before, fathers exposed to the campaign thought their daughters had slightly more ability than they had previously believed.

Reported here is one aspect of the study, focusing on the nature of sex-typing of parental attitudes toward math and the extent and consistency of such views. Data were obtained from parents by questionnaires on two occasions 1 year apart. Questionnaire items concerned (1) parents' own math attitudes, abilities, and performances; (2) parents' perceptions of their children's abilities and attitudes toward math; and (3) parents' general sex stereotyping of math abilities. Results indicated that parents strongly sex stereotype both their self-assessments of and subjective experiences with math as well as their  daughters' or sons' math achievement. Mothers were more likely than fathers to hold a sex-differentiated view of their child's math achievement. In general, parents also strongly held math stereotypes for females and males, although these stereotypes were greater on issues of performance and utility than on aptitude. It was additionally found that (1) having a daughter may make a parent less likely to sex stereotype math; (2) parents who are positive or negative toward math are likely to hold such views about math for their child, particularly in the case of mothers and daughters; and (3) parents' general stereotypes about math do not relate to the sex differentiation of math for their children.

As used here, the term &quot;professional judgment&quot; refers to cognitive processes involving the use of advanced knowledge (such as diagnosing and analyzing events, weighing alternative courses of action, and estimating the potential long-term consequences of momentary actions and decisions). Types of professional judgment processes a teacher might engage in can be thought of in terms of three interrelated categories: (1) skills and knowledge that could be taught in the problem situation, (2) clinical questions related  to individuals in the problem incident, and (3) curriculum and management concerns. The nature of professional judgments can be clearly seen when such judgments are contrasted with nonprofessional and unprofessional responses, which might be made by untrained individuals. (RH)",

        "author":["Sackney, L. E."],
        "description":"Organizational theory offers rural school administrators several ways of thinking about retrenchment made necessary by declining enrollment. Obstacles to innovative responses to retrenchment include a shift in how organizations are perceived: from closed systems in which rational decisions are made about changes, to open systems in which administration is a highly politicized activity, with a tendency to favor encrusted organizational practices over innovative solutions. Under such conditions, rural school districts tend to cut back existing programs and services (the \"efficiency\" option). These difficult decisions are often postponed until no other visible alternatives are available. Some factors contributing to the choice of efficiency measures over innovation are that  quantitative results are easier to ascertain; the most innovative members are the first to leave during difficult times; and, in such times, espousal of traditional values, including \"core programs,\" predominates. To counteract these contributing factors, rural schools should establish priorities through planning, using such strategies as system development planning, quality circles, and opportunistic management. Approaches for improving delivery of programs include use of community members to assist teachers; new technologies such as computer networks; mobile laboratories for specialized courses/services; and shared services within/between school jurisdictions. Universities can help with teacher training specifically oriented toward rural practice. (MH)",

Also the text helps teachers design for themselves a relevant stress reduction plan. Following an introduction to stress and stress management, the text is divided into three major sections which discuss stress causes for rural special educators and stress reduction through cognitive, affective, and physiological methods. The three sections use worksheets contained in an appendix to  help teachers explore various stress reduction methods. Suggested cognitive activities include identifying stress patterns, recognizing emotions, applying an emotional continuum to stress reduction, identifying currently used stress reduction methods and resources, and practicing new methods. Suggested affective stress reduction activities include structuring appropriate releases for anger, structuring a social support group, building positive attitudes, and desensitizing oneself to anxiety-producing situations. Physiological methods of stress reduction focus on increasing circulation, relaxation techniques, and nutrition. The text includes a reading list. (SB)",

The well-implemented project was welcomed as a needed resource in the rural areas it served and the volume of service activity exceeded anticipated first-year levels. Because the  volume increased as more people became aware of the project, decisions about staff use and management were necessary. An independent consultant evaluated the project and offered improvements. Recommendations included using a simplified management-by-objective approach to planning, managing, and documenting project activites; establishing the project's role as a delinquency prevention/youth development resource in the county; developing significant youth and parent involvement in project planning, operation, and evaluation; and developing an ongoing in-service staff development program.

        "description":"The meteoric rise of the computer age is a challenge for public educators, many of whom are still unfamiliar with basic computer technology. Yet many educators are finding that they can correct their misconceptions about computers by becoming \"computer aware.\" Computer awareness comes from gaining a knowledge of computer history; a basic understanding of how computers work; an awareness of the different types of computers, their peripheral hardware, and their software; an understanding of computer capabilities and limitations; and some experience in using a computer. For computer awareness to be a reality for educators, computers must be available in schools. However, a 1982 survey shows that only 58% of all public school districts have computers. Also, according to a 1983 study,  only 60% of rural school districts with a maximum of 900 students offer computer science in the secondary curriculum. In addition to using computers for instruction, schools can use computers for calculations, recordkeeping, word processing, control, simulation and gaming, and creative arts. A glossary of 90 computer terms and a microcomputer resource guide listing organizations, books, booklets, periodicals, articles, and other documents published since 1979 are included. (SB)",

        "description":"A grant to develop a model child care licensing code for Indian reservations gave Southwest Educational Development Laboratory a chance to determine whether realistic licensing standards were possible for reservation child care programs. Beginning in 1976, a task force composed of 14 federal and tribal representatives drafted licensing standards for centers providing early childhood day care. The standards, which contained both training and site operation codes, were tested at an Office of Indian Education meeting and on existing reservation buildings and programs. The training segment received generally positive responses, but the site testing was unsuccessful due to tribal schedules and test cost underestimation. The greatest problems with the grant project arose from staff  turnovers, the question of Indian involvement in standards development, and the difficulty of presenting licensing standards to tribal officials. Recommendations included fully testing the standards, developing comparable standards for infant and home-based care, and educating tribal officials about licensing. The proposed standards covered the basic items necessary for the safety and protection of children, day care operations, and staff. Areas to be regulated included: basic program administration, health requirements, building and vehicle regulations, safety and sanitation, staff and training requirements, and education. (SB)",

Return rates were 78.7% (642  questionnaires) from the nationwide survey, 67.7% (84) from Texas, 73.9% (17) from New Mexico, and 80% (4) from Arizona. Findings indicated that status and conditions of rural American schools differ between geographical regions and within the same region, and that in the Southwest, particularly Texas and New Mexico, rural school districts comprise a sizeable portion of public school districts in the region. Comparisons of the statistical data from the Southwest states with those from the national survey are presented in a 3-page table. (MH)",

In the 1970's overall New York state population declined nearly 4% (about 700,000 persons), but rural areas gained about 100,000. Rural New York school districts now serve a population of about 2.5 million, a 5% increase since 1970. During the 1980's, Americans will continue to disperse into rural areas. The number of preschool children will increase (probably 5-10% in rural New York), but since the birth rate is at a record low, probably only modest increases in elementary school population will result. The number of teenagers is declining (probably by 25% in rural New York), which will mean fewer high school students and that some colleges located in rural areas will have difficulty  surviving. A larger majority of the adult population and a larger fraction of the labor force are women, many of whom are single parents, so it will be harder to find school volunteers, and the need for after-school programs will be greater. The number of students may diminsh, but the number of students with emotional problems because of separation or divorce at home is likely to increase. (MH)",

The Bank's involvement in education projects is described, from support for upper division schooling (beginning in 1963) to a shift to an emphasis on non-formal education when Robert McNamara became President of the Bank in 1968. McNamara's concern with rural education and functional literacy programs for adults, and his broadening of the scope of educational projects supported by the Bank are noted, as well as his emphasis on teacher training, curriculm development, and educational innovation/experimentation, rather than  physical construction. Specific Bank-funded non-formal education projects are mentioned briefly, with an analysis of impacts and obstacles to project effectiveness. The study concludes that few persons writing about or orchestrating non-formal education policies agree on the intended beneficiaries or whether intended benefits are received; that the Bank's strategy evolved from &quot;trickle down&quot; to &quot;growth and equity&quot;; that presidents of the Bank have had major impact on funding priorities; and that the minimal impact of McNamara's push for primary and non-formal education was due to the fact that he was fighting an uphill battle against many obstacles.

Teachers at six elementary schools on the Navajo Reservation were interviewed to determine the features they considered rewarding and the drawbacks associated with their place of work. The countryside itself and the cultural characteristics of the children were cited as the most rewarding aspects. Isolation in some form was the major drawback. Long distances had to be traveled for services of any kind. Medical services were not available on the reservation, although the Public Health Service had  clinics established there. Because of lack of competition on the reservation there were high prices in the local area for food and automobile repairs. Social life was especially restricted. Job related problems were most frequently concerned with administration. A fourth of those interviewed, all Anglo, were dissatisfied with the BIA's implementation of the Indian Preference Policy; they felt some Indians were given preference for jobs for which they were not fully qualified. The BIA reward structure is complicated by the need for substantial documentation and reward is not given consistently enough to affect teacher attitudes. Recommendations to increase level of satisfaction among BIA teachers conclude the report. (DS)",

All subjects were in remedial reading classes; 48% were male and 52% were female. Mean age was 24.1, with a range from 17 to 49 years. Also, the Achievement Motivation Scale was randomly administered to 102 students (56 Native Americans, 46 Anglos), and the Academic Expectancy Scale to 109 students (56 Native Americans, 53 Anglos). Native Americans attributed their school achievement more to effort than did Anglos, and attributed school failure more to lack of effort than did Anglo students. Native Americans who attributed their success  to ability tended to be more achievement-motivated. Those with greater expectancy of success were those who attributed their school success to their effort. A greater attribution of failure to lack of effort may result in greater frustration for Native Americans than for Anglos. Although effort is modifiable, continued low achievement coupled with a greater attribution to lack of effort may result in lack of motivation and lowered expectancy of success. (MH)",

This handbook encourages elementary school principals to begin thinking about science as a fourth &quot;R&quot; in their school's curriculum, a subject that teaches basic skills while enhancing those learned in other curricular areas. The handbook stresses the benefits of teaching science and identifies the basic skills that may be learned from science instruction. In addition, it relates science process skills to other areas of the elementary school curriculum and provides models for integrating and relating science to reading, language arts, mathematics, and other curricular areas. Issues are addressed in the 12 sections of the handbook under the following headings: (1)  What are basics?&quot;; (2) What's so basic about science content?&quot;; (3) What's so basic about science processes?&quot;; (4) What's so basic about science attitudes?&quot;; (5) Science promotes creativity; (6) Science encourages creative thinking; (7) Science with health; (8) Science develops math skills; (9) Science motivates art and music; (10) Science develops reading skills; (11) Science builds social studies skills; and (12) What happens when science isn't considered a basic?

The handbook can be used as a resource for disseminators as they prepare for meetings with principals' groups and as a reference that can be used by principals in the day-to-day operation of their schools. Major emphasis is on the role of the principal as a: science leader; science curriculum analyst; force in selecting/developing new science curricula; provider of inservice instruction; monitor of science program progress; and as a troubleshooter. In addition, the importance of principals, importance of science, and relationship of science and principals are considered. Recommendations to  improve the principal's leadership role in science are included. Some, like letting teachers know that the principal is interested in science, can be done easily. Others, like visiting classrooms to observe science teaching/learning, take time. And, still others, like ensuring that children have science supplies/materials to work with, cost money. While it may not be possible for principals to try all suggestions, if they begin with one or two that seem to have the most promise for success, the result could be an improved science curriculum.

Although scientists would agree that they are indeed animals, findings indicate that many students of varying ages did not consider them to be animals; similar findings were reported for students' views of &quot;plant&quot; and &quot;living.&quot; In addition, it is suggested that meanings many children give to these words indicate that their hierarchical categorization may not be the same as that of scientists. One possible explanation may be that teachers have assumed students have scientific meanings for these commonly used words and have not focused their teaching on them. Therefore, this booklet was prepared to serve as background  information for suggested teaching activities by providing discussions of both scientists' and childrens' views/conceptions of &quot;living,&quot;&quot;animal,&quot; and &quot;plant.&quot; Included in these discussions are selected student comments obtained during the second (in-depth) phase of the project.

Data were collected from individual interviews (N=40) and from a questionnaire administered to 221 students. Findings (including interview transcripts) indicate a conflict between the views of soil seen through the eyes of children and adolescents when contrasted with views of soil scientists. Although there was general  agreement in interviews/survey on the question of soil depth, several differences of a virtually bi-polar nature were noted for other areas (soils formed via environmental factors versus soils always there or dynamic versus static soils). These results indicate that the more important ideas concerning soils should involve a focus on the nature/origin of the age of soils, and the idea that soils are changing with time.

Sample responses are presented related to such questions as: What  is a mountain? Is Mount Egmont a volcano? When did Mount Egmont appear? How do volcanoes develop? What is a range? How did Mount Cook develop? Responses indicate that children/adolescents hold views about the two mountains which are likely to be different from scientifically accepted ideas. For example, approximately 63 percent were not aware that Mount Egmont has the potential to erupt again.

This investigation focuses on the views that children (N=34) may have about rocks and minerals. Information was obtained from interview protocols, word responses, and sorting tasks to examine ways in which: (1) children and adolescents view and describe rock/mineral samples and how they relate these ideas to rock/mineral origins and composition; (2) learners tend to categorize rocks/minerals; and (3) learners respond to key stimulus-words that are considered by earth scientists to be important in the study of rock/mineral  samples. Results of the investigation indicate that the children focused on different attributes than those of earth scientists. In addition, their approach to developing categories for rock/mineral samples was in stark contrast to the approach likely to be taken by earth scientists (such as using appearance, origin, weight, and composition to categorize samples as either &quot;rocks&quot; or &quot;not rocks&quot;). (A discussion of earth scientists' views of rocks, minerals, crystals, and classification of the 15 samples used in the study is included.) (JN)",

        "description":"During 1974, materials developed by the Australian Science Education Projects (ASEP) became available in final published form. The publication of these materials was an especially important undertaking since ASEP was the first national curriculum project, in any subject area, to be developed in Australia. This report presents research into four aspects of ASEP evaluation. All studies were conducted at the seventh grade level and involved students in Victoria high schools. Questionnaires were used in the first study (chapter 2) to investigate teachers' understanding of ASEP philosophy and the impact of ASEP materials on their ideas about science teaching. In the second study (chapter 3), a battery of learning outcome measures were administered to ASEP/non-ASEP students at the  beginning and end of the school year to examine the effectiveness of ASEP/non-ASEP materials in promoting learning changes. The impact of the learning environment as a focus for curriculum evaluation and research related to the learning environment in ASEP classrooms was investigated in the third study (chapter 4). The fourth study (chapter 5) made a comparison between classroom climate perceptions of ASEP/non-ASEP students and looked at the relationship between those perceptions and student learning. Objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions are provided for each of the studies. (Background information, origin/nature of ASEP, contemporary scene in science education, and first/second generation curriculum projects are discussed in the introductory section of the report. Appendixes  present results of two 1974 surveys of science teachers' knowledge and use of ASEP, sample items from scales measuring learning outcomes, and examples of student activity charts.) (JN)",

The report includes a program plan, summary of project operations, summary of lesson units with related objectives and activities, and project evaluation. Key project accomplishments are noted: (1) development of a curriculum guide, (&quot;Do-It-Yourself Energy Guide&quot;), consisting of nine energy lessons; (2) assembling of materials required by the instructional activities of the energy lessons; and (3) provision of periodic inservice workshops  for participating teachers. Teachers assessed lessons for degree of relevance, practicality, and adaptability to home use while students evaluated them for clarity, quantity of new knowledge, time allowed, and overall usefulness. Teachers also rated the quality of inservice support. In addition, parents responded to energy activities tried in the home. All ratings by students, staff, and parents were markedly favorable.

Student disengagement is defined as the extent to which students refrain from participating in activities offered as part of the school program, tasks of scholarship and citizenship, and extracurricular activities. The project focuses on the processes for the evaluation of student performance in the areas of academics, social behavior, and extracurricular activities through a study of four incompatibilities which are contradictory, uncontrollable, unpredictable, or unattainable. The incompatibilities of these evaluation processes were linked with three forms of student disengagement: lowered effort engagement and lowered effort assessment, participation  in negative activities, and withdrawal. Four high schools in the Rushton School District in Missouri were studied. Research methods included interviews with all administrators and a sample of teachers as well as a survey of a 5 percent random sample of the students. Findings showed a positive relationship between the incompatibilities in the authority and evaluation systems for all three areas and the three forms of student disengagement. Recommendations included that policies and practices be modified to alleviate incompatibilities in the evaluation system, that consistent and reasonable goals and standards be set, that structural changes be made which would facilitate compatibility, and that teachers spend more time setting student expectations and communicating criteria and procedures  for evaluation.

Data for the study come from 80 teachers and administrators and 293 students in 4 high schools in a suburban mid-western school district. Teachers and administrators were interviewed to determine the practices used in the schools for the evaluation of student academic performance, social behavior, and extracurricular  activities. The students completed a survey designed to collect information on the levels of incompatibilities they experienced in the evaluations systems for these three areas. In addition, the students provided information on the levels of the three forms of disengagement. Results showed that students who experienced higher levels of incompatibilities in the evaluation systems would also report higher levels of disengagement from school.

A person is judged to have aged successfully if he has adjusted to society's definition of an &quot;elderly person.&quot; Similarly, most studies of programs and options for the aged reflect the view of the service providers rather than the perceptions of the target population. A more realistic approach is to evaluate the needs and determine the success of a group of aging individuals from that group's perspective. Operating from within this framework, a study was conducted of the elderly in two communities in Aalborg, Denmark, and Loehne, West Germany. During the summer and fall of 1981, 200 interviewees responded to an open-ended questionnaire concerning social  and recreational activity. Findings discount the generally accepted idea that the elderly withdraw from active life. Almost all those surveyed engaged in low or medium strain pasttimes such as walking, traveling, or playing cards. About one-fourth also enjoyed more strenuous activities such as swimming, gardening, and biking. Moreover, respondents maintained a high level of involvement with other people through these activities and family visits. While based on a small sample, these findings indicate the need for continued research in this area. (LP)",

To understand how social studies reached this point, and analyze where it needs to go, it is useful to consider the evolution of the discipline in relation to significant social and intellectual periods in American history. Social studies curricula began to emphasize citizenship training as a response to the population shifts and immigration of the post-Civil War era. The growth of professional social studies organizations and increased standardization of the curriculum were a reflection of the social reforms of the 1800's through the 1930's. During these years, educational leaders proposed a variety of approaches to social studies teaching, including the civic-centered  approach, the social problems approach, and the individualized approach. A &quot;New Social Studies&quot; emerged in the late 1950's as a by-product of the Cold War. Characterized by an &quot;anything goes&quot; attitude, it spawned creative innovations but also divided method, content, and ideology in the field. This lack of definition has reached a critical point with the current back to basics movement. The development of a nationalized framework of instruction is essential to correct the present situation. The necessary nationwide revisions in social studies curriculum scope and sequence require cooperation from all levels of the profession. (LP)",

Part 1, media resources, presents 6 sub-sections on foundations and the visual expression areas, ceramics, drawing and painting, graphics, sculpture, and textiles. Part 2 discusses themes of media resources and includes 6  sub-sections entitled Circuses, Fairs, and Carnivals; The Figure; Main Street and the Built Environment; Phantasmagoria; The Sun; and Trees. The final section presents additional resources relating to the foundations and visual expression areas of the curriculum. Because of the varied nature of the foundations levels of study, titles in Parts 1 and 3 are cross-referenced. The titles in Parts 1 and 2 are available from the Provincial Educational Media Centre; the titles in Part 3 are available from a variety of sources. (LH)",

        "description":"Intended for use in Roman Catholic seminaries to educate in their ecumenical and interfaith responsibilities those in training to become priests, this handbook discusses the manifold implications of Jewish-Christian relations. It is recommended that the topic of Jewish-Christian relations be integrated into the existing areas of seminary study. There are four chapters. Chapter 1 examines the basic perspectives of the Roman Catholic church today regarding Jewish-Christian relations. Chapter 2 raises a few of the interconnected questions concerning Christian-Jewish relations that pertain to biblical studies. Discussed are the Hebrew Scriptures, the New Testament, liturgy and homiletics, church history, catechetics, systematics, and moral theology. The chapter concludes with a  curriculum outline that provides a checklist of major topics to be integrated into appropriate courses. The spiritual tradition of Judaism is the topic of chapter 3. The fourth chapter discusses field experiences for inter-religious understanding. A resource bibliography is provided. The appendices contain the Vatican Council II Declaration on the Relation of Church to Non-Christian Religions, 1974 Vatican guidelines, John Paul II's addresses to the Jewish Community (Mainz, 1980) and to representatives of Episcopal conferences (Rome, 1982), and Archbishop John R. Roach's 1981 address before the Synagogue Council of America, &quot;A Renewed Vision of Catholic-Jewish Relations.&quot; (RM)",

        "description":"Asian-Americans are educational overachievers, and have been for many decades. There are various explanations for the high educational achievement of Asian-Americans. The most frequently cited theory is that their native culture places a premium on ambition, persistence, and deferred gratification. Other theories attribute this success to different factors such as the Asian groups' tradition of cultural borrowing, their respect for authority, and their emphasis on the collective good. An analysis of the 1960 and 1970 U.S. censuses suggests a positive correlation between American immigration restrictions and the educational attainment of three groups of Asian immigrants--the Japanese, Chinese, and Filipinos. This can probably be attributed to the fact that as restrictions  tightened, Asian immigrants had to meet high occupational criteria, which presupposed higher education. Settled in the United States, these groups found that, despite discrimination, education paid off in terms of occupational and social mobility, and this reinforced their pre-existing values. While all three groups have shown significant educational improvement across successive birth cohorts, the patterns of their success have differed. (Author/LP)",

The development, format, and evaluation of the course are discussed in separate sections. The program is seen as developing out of a need to identify and foster awareness of a wide range of illegal and deviant activities regularly engaged in by respectable individuals, such as corporate, governmental, and occupational crime and official misconduct. It is believed that these areas are often neglected in conventional sociology curricula. The format of the course is described as a combination of lecture, student oral reports, and discussion. Student requirements and their underlying rationale are explained. Assignments include a team oral report, oral critique  of one to three articles, and an optional written paper. The design of these assignments to encourage class discussion is emphasized. Student response to the course is evaluated as generally favorable. However, tedium of readings on corporate crime and the focus on concepts rather than hard data are cited as areas of student dissatisfaction. The paper concludes with a syllabus outline. (LP)",

        "description":"Problems encountered by Japanese women who participated in an American women's studies seminar have been valuable to the development of a cross-cultural women's course at Mary Baldwin College in Virginia. In the summer of 1981, the school offered a special women's study course to 30 Japanese university women. The program had limited success because the students had difficulty identifying with the problems of American marriage, divorce, and sex role inequalities that were the focus of the course. However, after returning to Japan, the women wrote to their American professor relating current experiences to issues they had encountered the previous summer. Based on this experience, the women's studies course underwent several changes, adopting a more relevant cross-cultural  framework. The 30 female Japanese students enrolled in the 1982 course developed their own questionnaire to elicit Japanese views on marriage, family, and career. This survey, included here with responses, was administered to 200 young Japanese in the spring of 1982. Students then tabulated the data and used it as a basis for discussion and cultural comparisons in their summer course. The evolution of this course points out the dilemmas and frustrations which may result when students from a patriarchal society are confronted with women's rights issues. As their consciousness increased, many women in this course felt torn between a loyalty to their own customs and a desire to relocate to a more open-ended society. (LP)",

        "description":"The development of economic reasoning in young children is examined from the theoretical perspective of Piaget's work on cognitive development. To determine a possible correlation between grade level and the type of reasoning children use to approach economic problems, 70 urban children, preschool through grade 3, answered questions which measured understanding of basic economic concepts--scarcity, choice, opportunity costs, monetary value, price and exchange, and advertising. Responses were categorized as indicating either unreflective reasoning (characterized by linear, literal responses) or emerging reasoning (characterized by flexible responses and an awareness of reciprocal relationships). Findings indicated that the type of child's reasoning was statistically different by  grade level for all concepts except exchange and scarcity. Moreover, the pattern of responses in all cases but opportunity costs showed an upward progression from simple to abstract reasoning by grade level. Thus, the hypothesis that economic understanding develops in a way reflective of Piaget's theory is supported. Results also indicate that economic understanding varies, depending on children's experience. This suggests that children's economic reasoning could be enhanced through class activities and field trips. The report concludes with a table illustrating study findings. (LP)",

        "description":"Regional analysis is central to applied geographic research, contributing to better planning and policy development for a variety of societal problems facing the United States. The development of energy policy serves as an illustration of the capabilities of this type of analysis. The United States has had little success in formulating a national energy policy, partly because it has failed to consider that various energy forms have regional patterns of need, availability, acceptance, and cost effectiveness. A successful policy must reflect this regional variation. Policy formulation should involve classification, mapping, and spatial analysis of regional characteristics as they relate to population densities, transportation systems, and socioeconomic variables. Several volumes on  geographic data processing systems and computer programs are available to facilitate such analysis. Geographic analysis of local factors such as urban clustering are also relevant to energy policy formulation. Implementation of planned settlements would enable energy saving measures such as transportation cost cuts and district heating systems. Because of the uses of regional analysis in applied geography, greater emphasis should be given to this approach in graduate and undergraduate programs, both in methodology and substance courses. The paper includes samples of regional analysis maps and computer programs. (LP)",

        "description":"Nationalism and worldmindedness are social cognitions that have both culture-unique and culture-universal aspects. To compare cross-cultural manifestations of these 2 sentiments, 270 Japanese and 210 American university students in Tokyo and Los Angeles answered questions on national resources, self-sufficiency and interdependence, communication, global priorities, world government, and war. Japanese and Americans were chosen for this comparison because while both countries are technological, affluent societies, they differ in geopolitical status, degree of global interdependence, and societal makeup. Findings revealed that nationalistic feelings coexisted with worldmindedness in both groups but that their different manifestations reflected national political and social  realities. For example, although both groups valued the United Nations and war prevention efforts, more Japanese expressed identity with a global community while more Americans felt that war was inevitable. Also, although both groups expressed love of country, Americans put stronger emphasis on fighting for their country right or wrong. The strong showing of worldmindedness by Japanese is explained by World War II and its aftermath--the effects of Hiroshima, demilitarization, and resource dependence.

        "description":"Studies have indicated that teacher stress is a major occupational hazard of teaching. Little system research attention, however, has been focused upon concern to this point in Alabama. Through use of questionnaires, an effort was made to document the current status of the teacher stress/burnout phenomena in an Alabama setting and explore the relationships among occupational stress, responses to stress, and selected personal and situational variables of classroom teachers. The study was conducted in Huntsville City, Alabama and included 573 subjects. Three instruments were used for the study: (1) a demographic questionnaire; (2) the Teacher Occupational Stress Factor Questionnaire; and (3) the Personal Lifestyle Survey. The study found that teachers in Huntsville were operating  under some degree of occupationally related stress and that teachers' general responses to stress and occupational stress were related. Results indicated that teachers' responses to high occupational stress tended to be more maladaptive than adaptive. Perceptions of inadequate planning/preparation time and a general feeling of &quot;never catching up&quot; were identified as significant stressful elements. The profile of a teacher with high stress tendencies, based on study data, is presented, as are multiple recommendations for use of study instruments and data. (JMK)",

The assumption underlying the instrument was that learning is enhanced when teaching strategies and materials take into account the student's natural tendency toward action or reflection. AORO categorizes these two preference types as action oriented (extraversion) or reflection oriented (introversion). AORO is a low-inference, systematic observation instrument which requires the teacher to record observed behavior to determine students' learning styles. Action oriented students focus mainly outward toward people and things around them, while reflection oriented students focus primarily inward toward the private world of ideas. The  use of AORO may help the teacher develop a new frame of reference for planning curriculum for the individual learner which is appropriately matched to the student's learning style. A review of research findings on AORO indicates that it is a valid instrument for improving teaching styles which contribute to increasing capabilities of the individual learner. (JD)",

An interest in what happens to beginning professors in the field of education was the motivation for the study, which was begun in 1979. The purpose of the study was to gain better understanding of new education professors' work. Three questions were investigated: (1) How do new professors spend their time with respect to their job-related work? (2) Are there some kinds of work new professors believe they should spend more time doing? and (3) What insights do new  professors have about their jobs and themselves in the professoriate? The sample was selected from doctoral graduates of 14 highly ranked colleges of education. A six-item questionnaire was constructed to survey the new professors' uses of time and was filled out by 191 professors in 1979; the questionnaire was revised and readministered in 1981 and 1982 to members of the original group. Included in the report are conclusions based on questionnaire analysis, 14 tables, and a list of references. (JMK)",

A recommended approach to research on teacher education combines a study of how education influences, and in turn is influenced by, other developmental forces and events within a national, regional, or other unifying network, such as religion or tribal identity. Economic, social, and political realities are major factors governing an understanding of how teacher education relates to national progress. Economic factors are also involved in a high imbalance between numbers of students and scarcity of financial resources for education. In the realm of politics, educational programs are  vulnerable to national political decisions and the kinds of schools the government demands. Social class values and attitudes and social differences among the educated and the illiterate are factors which determine inequalities in schooling. Studying teacher education concerns in developing nations demands a set of strategies from the combined social sciences and a balance in methodology from each. (JD)",

        "description":"The objective and subjective determinants that influence the way elementary school teachers grade students were explored. A longitudinal study was made of 213 students in 6 elementary schools as the students progressed from the first to the third grade. Possible determinants for assigning grades included student acquisition of valuable skills as reflected in standardized test scores, and classroom-specific achievement, based upon what the teacher considered important. Subjective factors in grading were seen to be teacher bias based upon individual reputations, the track level of the student, and the possibility that teacher expectations may be based on ethnic or gender prejudice. Student compliance with the teacher's preferred attitudes and behaviors was also considered. Factors  shaping student achievement included the student's previous grades and general ability, track level, compliance and involvement, and race and gender. In analyzing the study findings, the question was asked: \"Do teachers assign grades solely on the basis of merit or do other factors enter into grading decisions?\" Student conformity to teacher preferences for certain attitudes and behaviors consistently appeared to be one of the strongest determinants of grading at this level.

        "description":"Part of a series of position papers prepared by the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE), this pamphlet considers the need for extended teacher education programs. Seven alternative models of extended teacher preparation programs are described: (1) four-plus-one (B.A.); (2) four-plus-one (internship); (3) five-year (B.A. plus masters); (4) five-plus-one-year (master's degree plus internship); (5) four-plus-two-years; (6) four-plus-three-years (doctorate); and (7) three-plus-three years (doctorate). This examination discounts two commonly believed notions which have had a profound and not fully recognized impact on teacher education programs. The first is the view that teacher education programs are controlled by the entire community and not by the  schools, colleges, or departments of education. The second, persisting notion is that prospective teachers do not study the subject matter that they will later teach in the other university departments of liberal arts and sciences or subject-matter discipline. In a discussion of the extended teacher preparation program, five sets of issues and problems are addressed: (1) adequacy of teacher education knowledge base; (2) additional costs associated with extension; (3) difficulties encountered by colleges and universities; (4) legal matters; and (5) relationships with external groups.

        "description":"Many decisions made in the curriculum of life are philosophical. Few choices are made empirically. In the school/class setting, teachers and supervisors need to choose from among opposite ideas: (1) programmed learning versus learning centers or open space education; (2) basal readers versus individualized reading programs; (3) stated objectives versus general goals in teaching learners; (4) teacher choice versus heavy learner input; and (5) a textbook/workbook framework versus teacher developed units. Educational philosophy has much to say in terms of implementing objectives, learning activities, and evaluation procedures in the curriculum. The experimentalist educator believes that learners need to identify and solve relevant problems in a changing society. Realists advocate  using methods of science to obtain precise information involving the world as it truly is. Existentialists emphasize the importance of the individual making subjective moral commitments within an irrational world. Idealists believe that universal standards and generalizations need discovering in moving from the finite to the Infinite Being. Educators need to be students of philosophy. Diverse philosophical strands provide guidance in developing the curriculum. (JMK)",

        "description":"This module was developed to offer direction and knowledge of resource support to elementary school teacher educators. It offers suggested objectives and resources that will enable education students and beginning teachers to achieve competence in communication with parents and other adults. The module works from the assumption that preservice and beginning teachers will be most involved with parents who are involved in governance through advisory councils, school site committees, and service on selection or curriculum groups. Focus is on communication with the home, parent-teacher conferencing, and organization of events such as open house. Potential involvement with parent aides and/or volunteeers in the classroom, or for special events, such as field trips is also covered. It  is assumed that more experienced teachers and administrators will be involved in governance activities with the community and that inservice education should give continuing attention to this area. Proposed goals and objectives in effective communication are listed along with the suggested program level (foundations, methods, and student teaching) at which they should be initiated. A bibliography of reading resources keyed to specific learning objectives is included. (JD)",

The difficulties in arriving at a consensus on a valid definition of merit pay are pointed out, and examples are presented of various merit plans, such as master teaching plans, career ladder programs, or systems for teacher ranking. Arguments for and against merit pay plans are considered, focusing on the two major issues of the validity of using money as a motivator, and complaints against evaluation processes. Counterproposals offered by critics of merit pay are outlined and include such suggestions as across-the-board pay increases for all teachers, improvement of the work environment, and public recognition for  doing good work. Reasons for success and failure of merit pay plans are analyzed and a brief overview of the status of current performanced-based programs is presented. A description and comparison is given of three merit pay plans at the state level (Tennessee, Florida, and California) and three at the local level (Los Angeles, Houston, and Charlotte-Mecklenburg). Appendixes provide information on the effects of single salary and merit pay in achievement of educational goals, and the current status of merit pay programs in selected school systems. (JD)",

Analysis focused on five study questions: (1) What desirable condition or outcome is called for by the mandate? (2) In the absence of the mandate would the condition or outcome be achieved? (3) Can the mandate yield the desired results? (4) Could desired results be achieved if the mandate were defined or implemented differently? and (5) Does the mandate reflect a compelling state interest?

The students were later administered a special TOEFL consisting of items from those forms and a TOEFL consisting of undisclosed items. A significant disclosure effect was determined when performance was contrasted on these two tests. Scores for the test containing disclosed items were greater than those for the test containing undisclosed items, indicating that students studied the disclosed forms and recalled specific items for them. Student questionnaire data  suggested that the time spent studying the disclosed material was relatively unaffected by the number of forms given the students. Additional analyses indicated disclosure effects for items in forms that were not discussed in class as well as for items that were discussed. A disclosure effect was observed for each of three main language groups and for every item type, which attests to the robustness of this effect. (Author/PN)",

It comprises three major chapters. The first chapter reviews the social and environmental changes that demand reconsideration of NAEP. The new design was formulated to address concerns focusing on performance standards, school effectiveness questions, and broad human resource issues, thereby improving NAEP's relevance to educational policy and practice. The second chapter discusses technical innovations now possible with proven modern techniques that greatly enhance the power and value of the collected data. Sampling by grade as well as by age permits estimates of performance  and trends to be reported by both age and grade, thereby allowing direct links to state and local assessments, school practices, and educational policies. The third chapter illustrates ways the new design addresses multiple policy questions, communication with multiple audiences in an effective fashion, linkages to other data sources, enhancement and extension of NAEP services, and engagement of the public on the important educational issue of performance standards.

During the 1980-81 school year the Department of Educational Accountability, at the request of the Office of Continuum Education and the Mark Twain School, conducted a follow-up evaluation of 121 former Mark Twain students who had returned to regular MCPS programs during 1978-80. This evaluation was conducted for two purposes: (1) to provide data on the success of these former Mark Twain students, and (2) to develop a set of evaluation instruments and/or procedures which could be used in subsequent follow-up efforts. Data were collected via telephone  interviews with parents, surveys of administrators, behavior checklists completed by teachers, report cards, and student records. Analysis of the data indicated that many of the former Mark Twain students are performing satisfactorily in their current school with only minimal support in the form of special education services, and some are doing very well. Additionally, current returnees are performing somewhat better in the regular school environment than were earlier cohorts of returnees. A four-page executive summary is included. (PN)",

The hearing, which was to clarify issues related to MCT, was modeled after adversarial and judicial evaluation approaches. The Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory was responsible for the overall evaluation which was divided into two phases: a process evaluation and an outcome evaluation of the Clarification Process. This report incorporates findings from Phases I and II. It appears that the Clarification Process is a viable approach for studying major education or policy issues. The information produced from this application appears to be most useful for summative or general information purposes. It is recommended that future studies or efforts  attempt to begin addressing the extent to which the adversarial nature of the Clarification Process, rather than individuals' testimony and videotape presentations, contributed to the positive evaluations of the Clarification Process.

Ordering theory of Krus and Bart (1974) and an extended Takeya's item relational structure analysis (IRS) by Tatsuoka and Tatsuoka (1981) were used to extract the hierarchical item structure from three datasets. Directed graphs were constructed and both methods were assessed as to how well they reproduced the theoretical structure of the data. It was discovered that the Krus and Bart (1974) procedure more adequately represented the complex interrelationships among test data than did the extended IRS method. Simulated data were found to present many problems and to be inappropriate for research in this area. Research in this area should include a large scale sampling distribution study to determine the distribution  properties of simulated data. A more sophisticated method of generating binary responses which accounts for the distribution of theta needs to be developed. Also, a significance test and possibly a test of the differences between two item characteristic curves should be investigated. (Author/HFG)",

Second, there is a discussion of problems in the current use of the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) and of problems in the use of multiple cutoff scores based on small sample data. Third, there is a discussion of the dimensionality of the GATB in traditional factor analytic terms. That is, there is an analysis of the correlations between specific aptitude scores over persons. This culminates in a breakdown of each of the nine specific aptitudes and the three general ability composite scores in terms of general factor variance, specific factor variance, and error  variance. Fourth, there are the data on the correlation of aptitude validity coefficients across jobs. These data tend to support the general ability theory. Further evidence for the general ability theory is presented in connection with spatial aptitude. The practical implication of these findings is that the search for applications of specific aptitudes to the prediction of job performance will require either very large sample size studies (N=1,000) for particular jobs or the identification of special job families.

Although unemployment remains a major concern, almost one-third of the county's households cite high taxes as their main problem. A distant third (6 percent) is the concern for quality schools and education. Two weeks after its release, of the 37 percent of the residents aware of the federal report, 43 percent offered agreement with either its accuracy or results; 9 percent disagreed with the report. Among all county residents, 83 percent think the nation is risking the well-being of its people because  of educational shortcoming, and 71 percent give improvement in education a high or top priority. County residents support: (1) an increase in the number and extent of basic required courses; (2) required standardized exit exams for high school graduation; (3) a greater amount of student homework; (4) a longer school day, but not a longer school year; and (5) increased and performance-based teachers' salaries, tied to an effective evaluation system.

The purpose of this investigation was to compare the reliabilities and the validities of both formats when the items were identical except that the MC format presented examinees with a correct and incorrect option while the TF format included one of these two options in the stem. On the TF forms, students responded to a TRUE or to a FALSE option. Items in both formats were further analyzed by developing a MC and TF form having high point biserial correlations; another set of items used distractors chosen at random (all items had been administered  previously). A one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was significant at the .01 level with the MC items yielding the higher means. No differences were found among the Kuder-Richardson reliability coefficients or among the validity coefficients (measured by correlating test scores with overall grade point average). Additional subjects have been tested, and data are being analyzed with a 2X2 factorial ANOVA (MC-TF and two levels of discrimination). (Author/PN)",

The testing program was initiated in the spring of 1976 with the administration of criterion-referenced tests in reading, mathematics, and career development to students in grades 4 and 8. The program was extended to include reading and mathematics tests for tenth-grade students in 1978. The tests administered in 1981 to tenth-grade students were developed in response to revised statewide graduation requirements. The new tests, referred to as the Basic Skills Tests, measure competency in reading and mathematics. An additional area of problem solving is measured as a subskill of both reading and  mathematics. The tests were first administered in the fall of 1981, after which the State Board of Education established the minimum passing score. Beginning with the tenth-grade class of 1982, all students must pass the test in order to receive a high school diploma. This report presents the results of the testing programs at the three grade levels during the 1982-83 school year. In addition to the results for Atlanta students, results also are presented for students throughout Georgia. (PN)",

The results indicated that although teachers were skillful in the measurement part of the system, they were unsuccessful in applying the evaluation components; students' instructional programs seldom were changed. In terms of the structure of the lessons, only one of the 12 structure variables (controlled practice) yielded significantly higher ratings for  experimental than for control subjects. The remaining 11 variables favored experimental subjects, but were not statistically significant. No statistically significant differences in achievement were found between the two groups. All students improved over time. The results suggested that the implementation of a frequent curriculum-based measurement system is feasible and successful in improving the structure of instruction. Achievement effects may be manifest if the evaluation components are applied. (Author)",

Students were rank ordered in two ways: first by the degree of implementation of a technically adequate curriculum-based measurement and evaluation system, and second by the degree of structure in their instructional programs. The top 27 percent were compared to the bottom 27 percent for both variables. The t tests on the mean z scores indicated no difference in achievement due to the structure of instruction.

This study used survey data to investigate the reactions of both elementary students and teachers to the use of a formative evaluation system in reading. Specifically, this study examined students' knowledge about their performance, teachers' decisions regarding student programming, the use of assessment procedures, and teachers' general reactions to the usefulness of a direct and continuous measurement and evaluation system. Results indicated generally positive reactions toward the direct and continuous measurement and evaluation system: students were more aware of working toward a goal and were more optimistic about their progress, and teachers were better able to  realistically judge their students' progress.

Sixty-four subjects (16 language-handicapped and 16 nonhandicapped preschoolers and 16 language-handicapped and 16 nonhandicapped school-age students) were tested twice during a period of 2 weeks, once by a familiar examiner and once by an unfamiliar examiner, within a crossover design. A significant interaction was obtained for examiner familiarity and handicapped status, indicating that whereas nonhandicapped subjects scored similarly when tested by familiar and  unfamiliar examiners, handicapped children scored higher with the familiar tester. Thus, findings indicated that examiner unfamiliarity negatively affects both language-handicapped preschool and school-age children's performance relative to a normative population; it appears to depress selectively handicapped children's test performance, thereby indicating that an examiner's unfamiliarity constitutes a negatively, systematically biasing condition and threatens the validity of handicapped students' test performance.

The present investigation inquired whether this finding is due to examinees' actual differential performance across the two examiner conditions, or whether it is the result of testers' biased scoring of similar examinee performances. To make this determination, videotaped testing sessions, in which language-handicapped preschoolers were awarded higher scores by familiar examiners than by unfamiliar examiners, were shown to two certified speech clinicians who were blind to all purposes of the study. These individuals rated each examinee's performance in the familiar and unfamiliar examiner condition.  Results indicated that the videotape raters, as the examiners, gave higher scores to examinees' performance in the familiar condition, corroborating the notion that language-impaired children actually perform more strongly with a familiar examiner.

This examination of NAEP data showing changes in levels of achievement during the 1970s leads to a number of conclusions. The overall picture for 9-year-olds is promising. The outlook for 13-year-olds, (with the possible exception of mathematics) is less encouraging, and that for 17-year-olds is quite disturbing. Despite these declines, repeated gains have been achieved by student groups that typically fall below the national average. A vexing problem that appears regularly is the uneven achievement in tasks requiring more than recall of information. This paper concludes with proposals for steps to be taken to improve higher-order  learning. These steps are to be taken within the classrooms, within the schools, and within the communities. (BW)",

        "description":"Even though several national testing firms have developed measures to evaluate the effectiveness of baccalaureate education, there continues to be a general reluctance on the part of faculty in colleges and universities to accept these measures as criteria on which to evaluate educational programs. Some of the resistance appears to lie in the lack of validity of commercially prepared tests as measures of their competencies (often 50 to 100 in number), the amount of cost and effort to evaluate these competencies with the kinds of performance tests they seem to prefer, and questionable psychometric rigor of locally made performance tests. A series of three prototypical real-life problem solving exercises and rating criteria were developed to address these limitations. A theory of  human performance provides a rationale for the development of the generic skills test. The stimuli are in the form of real-life scenarios, and require short-answer essay responses. Rating scales use descriptions of high, medium and low performance attributes to evaluate responses. The results of a field test indicate that the difficulty level of exercises appears acceptable, the problem-solving constructs are independent and meaningful, and that the interrater and alpha reliabilities are sufficiently high to warrant its use as a program evaluation instrument. The contribution of basic intellectual factors, maturation and educational experiences to generic performance should be ascertained through further research. (Author)",

The alternative schedule was approved by the Wyoming State Board of Education on two conditions. First, the State Attorney General must affirm the State Board's right to permit alternative scheduling. Second, an outside evaluation of the approach must be made. The services of the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory were contracted by the District to plan and conduct an impartial evaluation. The overall purpose of the evaluation was to provide information which would be of value in weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the alternative schedule. The most apparent effect of the four-day schedule was the generation of interest, enthusiasm and support  for quality schooling on the part of all segments of the educational community--parents, teachers, students, and administrators. While the findings hint at benefits to be realized from the Sheridan plan, neither positive nor negative outcomes in student achievement could be shown. The community impact was split: most parents saw Fridays as positive opportunities for family activities, but families where both parents were working and the children were of elementary age viewed the four-day week negatively.

This paper reports the results of a longitudinal study designed to provide data on the stability of the HHI over a four year period. The 44 elementary school children studied were drawn from middle and lower class Anglo, Black, and Mexican-American families. Variance in scores is observed between the two administrations of HHI. Means change somewhat, test-retest correlations generally are moderate and lines of best fit for the two sets of data suggest change in scores. Although some variance may be attributable to health incidents which occurred between the two  administrations, some variance also is attributable to respondent inconsistency as noted on questions that should receive the same answer across administrations. Despite this variance, &quot;at risk&quot; and &quot;not at risk&quot; classifications made from each Health History Inventory generally are stable. (Author)",

However, until now, data on the Scale's stability have not been available. This paper reports the results of a longitudinal study which examines the stability of the Sociocultural Scales over a four year period. The 44 elementary school children studied were drawn from middle and lower class Anglo, Black and Mexican American families. Although some variance in scores is noted, the Sociocultural Scales generally are stable. The magnitude of change in individual and in mean scores is not large, and test-retest correlations are moderate to  high. While actual changes in family conditions may have contributed to score variance, scores on items which should have been the same across administrations suggest that respondent or interviewer inconsistencies also may contribute to variance in scores.

        "description":"This is the first report on a nationally representative sample of the 32.9 million civilian young people who were ages 14-21 on January 1, 1979. This first survey shows that young Americans are very much interested in work; more than half of these young persons were either working or looking for work. Many young persons carry both school and work responsibilities. Race and sex discrimination in the labor market continued to cause problems for youth. Minorities had equal aspirations for education, were more willing to work, and were seeking employment as conscientiously as white youth. The difference appeared to be that employers discounted their contribution as employees because of their race or ethnic background. Many young persons drop out of school and begin immediately to  have employment problems. About 2.6 million young men and women had participated in government training programs between the first day of 1978 and their interview date in 1979. In this report further details are provided about the employment and unemployment status of these young persons, their reactions to school, their assessment of Federal Government training programs, their vocational training, their attitudes toward work and their aspirations and expectations for the future. A seven-page executive summary is included. (BW)",

Chapter One uses the longitudinal capability of the NLS to examine those youth who were unemployed at the 1979 interview to determine who among them became employed within various time intervals. Chapter Two investigates the relative positions of black and white young men in 1971 and 1979 who were out-of-school, 18-21 years old, and who are not in the military. Chapter Three deals with changing patterns in black/white wage and reservation wage differentials. Three schooling decisions are studied in Chapter Four: the decision to drop out of  school without finishing the 12th grade, the decision to return to school after having dropped out, and the decision to go directly on to college after completing 12th grade. Chapter Five is a study of the effects of high school curriculum on the labor market experience of young men and women who do not go on to college. The final chapter treats delinquent behavior by youth. An executive summary is included. (BW)",

These data were collected for a nationally representative sample of 12,686 youth in 1979, 12,141 in 1980 and 12,195 in 1981. This report contains four analytical chapters. Chapter One investigates those characteristics of jobs that make them desirable to youth. In sum, youth jobs that are satifying should provide security, genuine skill acquisition, and a healthful work environment. Chapter Two examines the relationship between crime and employment using a model that combines economic and sociological approaches. Chapter Three investigates the effects of two determinants of educational aspirations and delinquent behavior: high school students'  participation in their school's informal social system (measured by non-class and non-studying time spent at school) and their expression of positive sentiments towards their schools. The final chapter tests the findings of Coleman, Hoffer and Kilgore who conclude that public secondary schools provide an inferior education relative to private schools. The clear conclusion was that being in the college preparatory curriculum in either public or private secondary school is much more critical than the type of school for maximizing the two educational outcomes.

This paper advances the thesis that the Glass effect size estimator represents only one dimension in the assessment of mastery learning experimental outcomes. The second dimension of effect, relevant to mastery learning outcomes, is the variability of the effect. The index to be proposed is directed at assessing this condition, in addition to the information provided by the effect size estimator.  (Author)",

Dropouts are defined in this study as students who withdrew from AISD schools prior to receiving their high school diploma and are not known to have attended other schools. The dropouts were interviewed to find out the issues that may have influenced their decision to withdraw. The Dropout Study had three major purposes, which were to: (1) examine the reasons dropouts stated for withdrawing from school; (2) examine the decision-making processes dropouts pursue prior to withdrawal; and (3) ascertain whether there are commonalities among dropouts, the identification of which may assist AISD in developing dropout prevention programs and/or  activities. Ninety-five young people were interviewed from a total sample size of 566; this represents nearly 17 percent of the total number of dropouts. Contact was attempted with nearly 400 dropouts. Hispanic school leavers were given special emphasis in this study. The results are reported in detail. (PN)",

When results were analyzed by different areas of political knowledge and attitudes, gains were most apparent on categories dealing with knowledge about government and the political process, while categories concerned largely with attitudes typically showed little change over the 6-year period spanned by the assessments. It is interesting to note that males  and females performed about equally well on political knowledge and attitude items, with the exception of a sizable female advantage on items measuring respect for the rights of others. Blacks and disadvantaged-urban students were typically farthest below the nation on items dealing with knowledge about the structure and function of government and closest to national levels on items concerning respect for the rights of others.

        "description":"Three aspects of the match between education and the demands of our changing economic situation are examined. First, the skills students will need for the future are identified. These skills included competencies in reading, writing, speaking and listening, mathematics, science, reasoning, basic employment, economics, and computer literacy. Second, current levels of achievement with respect to these skills are explored. The data are drawn from the results of the National Assessment of Educational Progres (NAEP) in reading, mathematics, science, writing, literature, and consumer competencies. The overall NAEP findings were not particularly encouraging, especially for 17-year-olds. This paper concludes by making suggestions for correcting this mismatch between current achievement  levels and necessary skills. It is recommended that educators first examine the lists of skills needed, determine which are appropriate for individual states or communities, and sort through those skills with business and industry leaders and parents. Then these groups should act in concert to remedy the problems they face. Primary type of information provided by report: Procedures (Analysis). (BW)",

        "description":"To investigate the relationships between television watching, spare time reading, homework, and scholastic achievement, the National Assessment of Educational Progress gathered data on television viewing habits. Younger students were more avid viewers than older ones. Half the 9-year olds watched over 3 hours of television daily; most 13-year-olds watched one to two or three to four hours daily; among 17-year-olds, 38 percent watched less than an hour a day. Television has a differential relationship to reading achievement at different ages. Over 4 hours of daily watching proved detrimental at all ages. Highest reading performance was typically associated with one to two hours of spare time reading and three to four hours of television for 9-year-olds, one to two hours of  television for 13-year-olds and under an hour of television for 17-year-olds. For 13-year-olds, one to two hours of television and one to two hours of homework a day were associated with highest levels of reading performance. Only for 17-year-olds did television have a direct negative relationship to reading performance. Spare time reading and television do not appear to compete for students' time; television and homework may compete for some students' time.

In simplest terms, the analysis can be characterized as establishing baseline estimates of the percentages of young Americans possessing certain skills, knowledge, understandings, and attitudes and producing estimates of changes in these percentages over time. The baseline estimates permit comparisons of various subgroups. This paper begins with brief descriptions of key activities. The first sections generally describe the methods used to develop objectives and exercises, select the assessment sample, prepare material for the administration of an assessment, administer the booklets, and score the items. The later sections contain  discussions about the NAEP analysis including computations used and potential secondary analyses. Appendices cover a variety of topics including adjustment procedures used in the analysis such as balancing and weight smoothing, methods for equating scores across booklets, and an approach for studying response patterns and bias.

        "description":"In an effort to foster better understanding of the crucial role of the courts in protecting all persons from legislative and executive overreaching, this report examines and evaluates the Helms-Johnston Amendment, one of many efforts Congress is making to limit the authority of federal courts in cases involving the controversial issues of desegregation, abortion rights, and school prayer. The Johnston portion of this Amendment would impose limits on court-ordered busing to a student's nearest school or to a school within 5 miles of his or her home. The Helms portion would prohibit the Justice Department from bringing or maintaining any action directly or indirectly to require busing beyond the proposed limits of this bill, and would charge the Justice Department to enforce the  new bill, even to the extent of reopening previously decided cases. The report attacks the Amendment on the following grounds: (1) it is unconstitutional; (2) it limits the role of the courts in protecting citizens' rights; (3) in addition to mandating continuation of unconstitutionally segregated schools, the Amendment bars the implementation of desegregation programs that have been effective in improving educational opportunity; and (4) enactment of the Amendment would seriously impair racial harmony in the United States by recreating racially dual school systems and promoting the perception that the government is repudiating its commitment to racial justice.

        "description":"This final report describes the Lawrence Children's Health Project (LCHP), set up in Lawrence, Massachusetts in 1979, in order to demonstrate and evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of an interagency approach to providing health care to children through a school-based local resource network. The LCHP service delivery is said to have met the mandates of both Federal (Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment) and State (Special Education Chapter 766) laws. The project enrolled over 85 percent of the students in six schools and screened over 2,000 children. The major project elements are described: enrollment, screening--physical and developmental, referral, follow-up, client flow, training, billing, management information system (MIS), and brokering. A short  discussion of future project activities is followed by a section dealing with the major milestones for each of the project's objectives: broker model; service delivery; MIS; training; and evaluation and dissemination. A financial statement is followed by detailed appendices: (1) a list of major project products and reports; (2) an early childhood pamphlet (English/Spanish); (3) an organizational chart; (4) a school health-policy guide ; (5) a summary report (Spring 1982); (6) a description of the microcomputer information system ; and (7) the Merrimack Education Center's letter of agreement with the Lawrence public schools. The report concludes that the LCHP has demonstrated that brokering of children's health care can be coupled with school-based EPSDT (Early Periodic Screening,  Diagnosis and Treatment) services as a realistic alternative to conventional models of health service delivery for children.

(2) Existing policies at the Federal, New York State, and New York City levels are reviewed, as are relevant judicial decisions. (3) Three public policy options--a  managerial fiscal model, a community development model, and an ethnic model--are examined in terms of administrative control of programs, source of funding, nature of services delivered, forms of support, and program specificity. (4) The most promising policy options for improving mental health services in Hispanic neighborhoods (the ethnic and community development models) are discussed in terms of economic costs, values represented, public acceptability, political feasibility, ease of implementation, and unintended consequences.

In the first section of the guide, the literacy problem, the problem as it manifests itself at Hunter College in the City University of New York, and Hunter's approach to the problem are described. In the  second section, practical suggestions for dealing with writing problems are made in chapters on integrating writing and learning, assigning writing, and evaluating writing.

Research techniques consisted of nonparticipant observation and study of documents and school routines from the perspective of the Organizational Process Model. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with principals, teachers, and parents. Findings indicate that the &quot;anomaly&quot; of success in these schools began with the selection of moderately authoritarian principals who generated a climate of high expectations for student performance, mobilized consensus around achievement as the highest priority, chose functional routines, and were willing to disagree  with their superiors regarding these choices. The most important functional routines were (1) assumption of responsibility for student discipline, attendance, and parental conflict through publication of procedures enforced by selective sanctions; (2) close contact with and supervision of teachers and staff; (3) consistent monitoring of students' skill mastery; (4) involvement of parents as an instructional support group; (5) establishment of the school office as a central command post; (6) use of skill mastery grouping as a means of placing students in self-contained classrooms modified by nongrading and team teaching; (7) expansion of the school day by using subject, preparation, and after-school periods for reinforcement; (8) refusal to place students in classes for the retarded until  other alternatives had been exhausted; and (9) refusal of additional programs which would consume regular school time.

The report is divided into two parts. Part one considers the setting and the sociocultural context for schooling in &quot;Valleyside.&quot; Drawing from interviews with Punjabi and non-immigrant residents, parents' views of life in America, job opportunities, family structure, social relations, and child rearing are described. Background on Punjabis in India is provided. Their reasons for immigrating to the United States, their theory of success, and their life strategies are explored. In addition, social relations between Punjabis and members of the mainstream majority are  discussed. This section closes with a comparative analysis of child rearing, emphasizing those patterns most directly related to school performance at the secondary level. The second half of the report focuses on schooling itself by examining social, structural, and cultural factors which influence educational opportunity, home-school relations, and school response patterns. The ways in which the high school curriculum structure and various academic &quot;tracks&quot; create barriers to educational opportunity are explored. Social relations among students are also discussed. The study demonstrates that immigrant minorities may do well in school even when cast as subordinate by a dominant group and that cultural differences do not necessarily inhibit educational achievement. Specifically, findings  indicate the importance of high self-esteem, self-reliance, and parental support. All of these aspects of Punjabi culture strongly contribute to success. (GC)",

Part I is an introduction, &quot;The Desegregation Situation,&quot; written by Jeffrey Prager, Douglas Longshore, and Melvin Seeman. Part II, &quot;School Desegregation in Context,&quot; contains articles written by Gerald Suttles and John Ogbu. These place the study of school desegregation in the larger context of American racial and ethnic stratification, and criticize &quot;micro&quot; studies which fail to appreciate how &quot;macro forces&quot; become operationalized in the school setting. The articles in Part III, &quot;New Theoretical Directions,&quot; represent the search for new  theory in desegregation research and, in contrast to Part II, point to the limitations of solely macroscopic explanations of desegregation. Authors in this section include Mark Granovetter, Hubert Blalock, and Walter Mischel. The main focus of the four essays in Part IV, &quot;A Reconsideration of Methods,&quot; is an evaluation of the major methodological approaches to desegregation research: attitude research, small group research, demographic and ecological analysis, and quasi-experimentation. Morris Rosenberg, Bennetta Jules-Rosette and High Mechan, Harold Rose, and Thomas Cook assess these approaches with respect to their ability to measure the importance that situational features hold for desegregation outcomes. Finally, in Part V, articles by Herbert Hyman and J. Milton Yinger consider new  directions in, and the implications of, situational analysis for future research on school desegregation. (GC)",

This report presents a brief program description and results of an evaluation of student achievement and teacher participation in 1981-82. During this school year, LTRTA served 677 regular students and 107 special education students in all five boroughs. Students participated in reading-oriented workshops which used theater arts, fine arts, and/or music to emphasize listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. They also attended a diagnostic/prescriptive reading workshop. In addition, program students attended various exhibitions and performances that  culminated in a special festival. Results of the California Achievement Test, used to measure changes in reading levels of the regular students, indicated that all grades surpassed the program objective of five normal curve equivalents. Bilingual and Special Education students also surpassed program objectives, as measured with the Wisconsin Design Skill Development Test. Observations and interviews of classroom teachers indicated that they were actively engaged in hands-on participation in the workshops. Classroom teachers' responses to a questionnaire, designed to assess ways in which LTRTA practices have been carried into the home classroom, were also positive. A number of program recommendations are included in this report. Sample observation forms, teacher interview forms, and  teacher questionnaires are also appended. (GC)",

The spacial-temporal dimensions of foreign language publishing in the United States are closely associated with immigrant history and the settlement geographies of ethnic Americans. In New York, newspapers are published in 20 languages, in California, 12, and in Illinois, 10. The American South and the Great Plains, Northern Rockies, and Great Basin regions, on the other hand, do not support a single foreign  language newspaper. The number of Romance (except for Spanish), Germanic, and Slavic language publications is declining. The future of the established newspapers and periodicals would be brighter, however, if they could become ethnic presses serving the needs of the third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation immigrants who neither know the mother tongue nor care about events in the &quot;old country,&quot; but who do take pride in their ethnic heritage.

This final evaluation report for the 1982-83 school year shows that the project successfully provided project teachers and aides with training, and that they provided STAR students with individualized support. Preservice sessions for teachers and aides took place as planned, but because of budget limitations only two of the scheduled inservice sessions were conducted.

Following an introduction, Section II defines what is meant by school improvement programs, principal effectiveness programs, and teacher effectiveness programs in order to distinguish them from more effective schooling programs. An increase in low-income and/or minority students' standardized achievement scores towards the national norm was found to be the chief criterion of effective schooling. Components for realizing this outcome were identified as strong  administrative leadership, positive school environment, high expectations, emphasis on basic skills, ongoing assessment, and staff development. In Section III, eight programs chosen on the basis of these criteria are described and evaluated. The programs are in Connecticut, New Jersey, Missouri (two programs), Alaska, Wisconsin, Chicago (Illinois), and New York City. From the models described in this section a methodology emerges for effective program implementation, a generic process described in Section IV as having four vital stages: assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation.

In an attempt to provide more information, the research reported on here describes the &quot;periods&quot; of adolescence as they are structured in the various social-institutional contexts of the family, the school, the workplace, the media, the criminal justice system, and the peer group. Also discussed is how these social systems interact to produce a code or codes of rules internalized by individual adolescents. Data from ethnographic fieldwork in urban, suburban, and rural communities in the United States, from psychodynamic interviews with youth in these same communities, and from the research and practice  literature in each of the institutional contexts illustrate the connections and conflicts between and among the institutional contexts and how youth internalize this pattern of organization. The findings of the research lead to the development of a model of the psychosocial organization of adolesence. This model emphasizes linkage among social institutions in a community approach to youth in order to help the adolescent make the transition to adulthood without unnecessary delays and confusion.

YIEPP offered Federal minimum-wage jobs (part-time during the school year, full-time during the summer) to 16- to 19-year-olds from low-income or welfare households, with the condition that they complete their high school education, either through traditional or alternative education programs. Analysis of the impact of the demonstration found that (1) over 56 percent of the eligible youths participated in YIEPP at least once; (2) YIEPP increased the employment/population ratio for  eligible youth by 67.5 percent over the ratio expected in the absence of the program; (3) YIEPP was particularly successful with black youth, whose employment, increased by 102.8 percent, became nearly equal to the employment percentages of white male youth; and (4) the smallest statistically significant YIEPP effect was found for Hispanic females, and there were no significant effects for Hispanic males. Additional effects were that total school enrollment increased significantly, the dropout rate decreased, and the rate of return to school (whether in traditional or alternative programs) for out-of-school youth increased. Finally, YIEPP caused a positive joint increase in schooling and work behavior among the key groups of program youth. (CMG)",

A comparative case study methodology combined the collection of quantitative and qualitative data from 15 school districts. Major findings were that magnet schools (1) can and do provide high quality education in terms of instructional quality, curriculum, student-teacher interaction, student learning opportunities, and resource use; (2) provide high quality education without using highly selective methods of student admission; (3) need strong district leadership and innovative and resourceful school  leadership; (4) have a significant positive impact on district-wide segregation under certain conditions, including strong policy commitment and effective implementation of a district-wide plan; (5) have slightly higher total costs per student than nonmagnet schools but increase the quality of education and racial integration; and (6) benefit from active community involvement in program planning, design, instruction, and support. The educational issues of the 1980's and the evolution of the magnet school in American education are summarized in this report. Following a presentation of the study's findings, the report outlines a set of 10 key steps in developing a successful magnet program. Finally, policy options applicable at the federal and/or state level and at the local level are  discussed. (CMG)",

A review follows of important state and national studies on adult educational activities. Areas discussed include the participation rate; demographic variables that influence participation; differences between actual and would-be learners; reasons for participation; barriers to participation; subjects studied; choice of instructional methods, services, and resources adults would like to have available; preferred location and time; importance of credit; sources  of instruction; and funding sources. A 1981 survey of California adults to determine their learning activities and interests is then reported. Results are compared with national and state surveys and with a 1974 survey of California adults. The final section presents these observations about adult learners: they are not a homogenous population; they behave in a highly traditional manner; and their attitudes keep them from participating in education. Issues that may serve as the basis for policy discussion are identified. (YLB)",

        "description":"Based on data concerning disabilities that were obtained from the 1981 and 1982 Current Population Surveys (CPS), it appears that the average working-aged disabled American is about 50 years old, has a high school education, is not in the labor force, and subsists on a low level of income. Also evident is the fact that disability is much more common among Blacks than among Whites or Hispanics, more common among males than among females, and more common among persons with low education and income levels than among those with higher levels of schooling and income. Furthermore, disabled persons tend to reside in the South. These data have a number of implications for vocational rehabilitation program administrators. For example, rehabilitation should place more emphasis on  recruiting those persons who become disabled while working into the federal and state partnership program and should begin to provide more service for older disabled individuals. For most disabled persons of working age, the major need is for retraining rather than for basic training. Particularly in need of training are women and Blacks with disabilities. Perhaps the most encouraging news from the 1981 and 1982 CPS is that full-time employed disabled persons earn almost as much as do full-time workers with no disabilities. (MN)",

The materials are designed for use by teachers-in-training, working individually or in groups under the direction of teacher educators or other resource persons. The learning experiences in this module are designed to help prospective teachers to develop competency in preparing the kinds of lesson plans needed for an effective manipulative skill demonstration. In addition, using the module will help  prospective teachers to gain skills in actually preparing for and demonstrating the manipulative skills needed by students in their occupational specialty. The module is comprised of a terminal objective, enabling objectives, prerequisites, a list of outside resources, and three learning experiences. Learning experiences relate to one of the module's enabling objectives and contain several activities and self-checks with model answers. The final learning experience is an actual teaching situation to be assessed by a resource person. (KC)",

        "description":"A project was undertaken to assess the needs for skills and knowledge among Georgia's high technology teachers and to develop a model for meeting those needs. During the project, 52 teachers involved in teaching electronics, electromechanical, and mechanical courses at six pilot high technology schools were assessed. Included among the processes used to gather information on the teachers' deficiencies in high tech subject areas were a review of existing program information, a review of state-of-the-art programs, a review of literature, a consultation with industry, and a series of meetings with the 52 teachers themselves. While these data sources indicated that Georgia's technical school teachers involved in high technology programs are educationally well qualified for their  jobs, a considerable need exists to provide teachers with experiences and support services to maintain their level of expertise and to stay up to date in their field. In response to this need, it is recommended that the Georgia State Department of Education conduct routine skills assessments and staff development activities for high technology teachers and that the state adopt a student to teacher ratio formula and class schedule that will permit at least one high technology teacher per quarter per department to be free for research, study, and/or update activities.

As part of the longitudinal study, High School and Beyond, the National Center for Education Statistics surveyed 30,000 sophomore and 28,000 senior high school students in 1980 from a representative sample of 1,015 schools; then the center recontacted 12,200 of the seniors and all of the sophomores who remained in their same schools in 1982. The survey also included about 50 percent of those sophomores who had left the schools they attended in 1980, including dropouts, transfers, and early graduates. Response rates were very high, amounting to about 90 percent. Dropouts were identified and asked to  complete a questionnaire inquiring about their reasons for dropping out, their plans, and their activities after leaving school. Some of the findings were the following: (1) about 14 percent of high school sophomores of 1980 left school during or after their sophomore year before completing requirements for graduation; (2) by the spring of 1982, many of these dropouts (more than 27 percent) were unemployed or dissatisfied with their work and were looking for work; (3) the majority of those who worked full- or part-time were engaged in low-skilled jobs; (4) most of the dropouts regretted their decision to leave school prematurely; (5) reasons for dropping out included dislike of or expulsion from school, desire to work full-time, or plans to get married, and (6) students from lower  socioeconomic backgrounds. The survey authors surmised that knowledge of these findings may help school administrators to devise plans to curtail dropping out. (KC)",

        "description":"Five strategies have been identified as particularly promising as the most useful ways government can spend money to aid dislocated workers. The mix of income support programs can be enriched for workers who have been unemployed for a long time but who are not permanently dislocated. For most dislocated workers, only limited job searching assistance should be provided to help them to find their own employment. One currently fashionable mode of such assistance is the job club, a temporary alliance of job seekers who meet regularly to provide aid and mutual reinforcement. High school level basic education should be offered to all undereducated, unemployed adults. When providing skill training, it should be targeted on shortage occupations, not on dislocated workers.  Already-employed workers with somewhat higher skill levels than most dislocatees can be trained to move into new, emerging occupations and thus create job vacancies dislocated workers could fill. Financial barriers to workers seeking training should be removed. Unemployment compensation should not be withdrawn during participation in training, and financial aid for tuition, fees, and books should be made available. (YLB)",

        "description":"Market-oriented industrial nations other than the United States have experienced rapid structural changes in their economies and reemployment problems among dislocated midcareer workers. The Swedish active labor market approach is a socialized one. This system has been criticized for excessive reliance on microeconomic labor market programs to address unemployment problems to the neglect of macroeconomic approaches. In Canada, the Manpower Consultative Service, an agency of the national government, exists specifically to deliver temporary worker adjustment assistance to communities undergoing economic crisis. Essential elements of this system include mandatory advanced notice of massive layoffs or plant closures, economic development as a major part of its approach to aiding  communities, serving of the needs of disadvantaged individuals through the same agency serving the mainstream work force, and assistance with job searching and placement. The French Further Vocational Training System obligates employers to make annual contributions to the financing of training courses. Targeting would overcome the difficulty of disproportionate funding for nonblue-collar workers. The degree of similarity of social, cultural, and institutional backgrounds between Canada and the United States makes Canada the most likely base for providing a program idea to transfer relatively intact to the United States.

        "description":"Undertrained workers, not dislocated workers, are the real problem in the American economy. The vast majority of the workers affected by structural change in the American economy appear to make employment transitions fairly swiftly and smoothly, with no need for public intervention. Undertrained workers, mostly employed and scattered in all industries, result from underinvestment in training by both employers and the workers themselves. In addition, worker-financed training at the beginning of a career and on-the-job training in midcareer will no longer be adequate. Midcareer formal training will become a necessary part of success, but it will be difficult for workers to finance. Since 1971, the French have operated a national system for financing training that creates an  effective public-private partnership to address these problems. The key element is an &quot;obligation to spend&quot; whereby each employer must expend funds to maintain and expand the skill level of the French labor force. A national system should be set up in the United States that embodies a sustained level of investment in all human resources. (YLB)",

        "description":"The federal government needs to provide employment and training assistance to help dislocated workers to become reemployed. Worker mobility assistance should not be focused upon as a major thrust of reemployment programs, since American workers are remarkably resistant to pressures to move to more promising labor markets. Efficient and effective forms of federal aid to dislocated workers are job searching assistance in the period immediately following dismissal and financial assistance for specific skill training for a subset of workers who will be making a major occupational transition. The Comprehensive Employment and Training Act delivery system designed to serve disadvantaged persons should not be the delivery vehicle for serving dislocated workers who share employment and  training needs in common with the mainstream work force. The service delivery institutions for meeting these needs should serve the entire work force. Appropriate delivery institutions are a short-term job development and placement operation that would move temporarily into locales of massive layoff or substantial long-term economic decline modeled on the Canadian Manpower Consultative Service and a national training fund for workers seeking midcareer retraining modeled on the French Further Vocational Training System.

        "description":"Data from a survey funded by the National Institute of Education involving 3,847 employers were analyzed to examine the relationship between school-provided vocational education and employer-provided on-the-job training. Employers reported that school-provided vocational training was required for 9.5 percent of the jobs studied and &quot;important but not required&quot; for another 37.9 percent. School-provided vocational training seemed complementary with on-the-job training. Jobs that have school-provided vocational training as a prerequisite for hiring offered newly hired workers greater amounts of on-the-job training. A comparison of occupants of the same job at the same firm showed that new hires with relevant school-provided vocational training required about 7 percent less  on-the-job training and were significantly more productive than new hires with no training. New hires with a good deal of relevant job experience took less time to train and had higher productivity indexes than those with none. On-the-job training created externalities--social benefits not captured by the trainer or trainee. (Appendixes, amounting to approximately two-thirds of the report, include alternative measures of the impact of occupationally specific training and the Gallup organization's report on survey procedures and the survey instrument.)

The system is defined in terms of three major functions: (1) data file editing, in which the user defines the scheduling parameters and constraints, (2) scheduling, in which the user builds the training schedule while using the system to monitor all of the defined constraints, and (3) data output generators for formatting and printing hard copies of the resulting schedule and documenting the supporting data files. Following an introduction (section 1), the guide contains three sections and two appendixes.  Section 2 provides a general description of the master training scheduling problem. A brief overview of BOOTS is provided in section 3. This is followed in section 4 by detailed step-by-step instructions on how to use the BOOTS system to prepare new and/or revise old master training schedules.

Chapter 1 introduces the subsidy programs and the data set and tabulates how participation in each program varies with industry and establishment size. Chapter 2 examines which employers are familiar with the programs and addresses employer awareness of program existence. By studying determinants of firm participation in the program, chapter 3 explores reasons why so few employers are familiar with a program participant. Chapter 4 examines the impact of these programs on employment levels of participating firms. Relevant research on employment and  training subsidies is reviewed in chapter 5, and changes in program design are recommended. Chapter 6 analyzes determinants of the employer's investment in selecting a new employee--the number of applicants interviewed and the number of hours spent recruiting and interviewing for a position. Rates of resignations and dismissals are studied in chapter 7. Chapter 8 examines the amount of training provided to new workers and the resulting productivity growth. The determinants of wage growth are analyzed in chapter 9. The survey instrument is appended. (YLB)",

Chapter 1 discusses the purpose and uses of this assessment of long-range career commitment, short-range motivation to achieve on a particular task, and level of education and career aspiration. The next chapter provides information on the administration and hand scoring of the C-MAP. Some suggestions for counselors/teachers for interpreting the C-MAP profiles are presented in chapter 3. Suggestions are made for interpreting students' scores on the occupations list that contribute to their aspiration scores. Student instructions for interpreting their C-MAP profiles are reprinted, and additional suggestions for counselors/teachers  are given. The chapter closes with four case examples. Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7 cover the sample and norms, computation of reliability, and the analyses for scale independence and C-MAP validity. The final chapter discusses the development of the C-MAP. The theoretical model guiding the development is described, including the factors included in each aspect of the model.

        "description":"The role of women's college peer groups in aiding women to continue along or in encouraging them to drop out of certain career paths was investigated. During an ethnographic phase, freshmen were interviewed; during the survey phase a survey instrument was administered to sophomores. Respondents were from predominately black Bradford University (BU) and predominantly white North Carolina University (NCU). Peer relationships were important primarily as opportunities to enact valued role-identities. Noncareer peer relationships competed with career concerns for time and attention. Few black women changed plans for a major, while whites viewed changing majors as acceptable. Changes in major were more likely to result either in women staying in or moving toward nonmath/science majors.  Ambivalence of BU women in career choice focused on questioning the worth of the credential relative to its costs. Nonacademic peer-related identities and rewards competed with career goals. NCU women were uncertain about their choices of majors. Peers' approval of NCU women's goals translated into greater commitment to pursue training in their majors. Recommendations to increase women's participation in math or science careers were identified. (The survey instrument and code book and summarized career identity histories are appended.) (YLB)",

        "description":"The Ohio Task Force on High Technology (TFHT) was formed in 1982 to make recommendations in four areas: (1) the development of future scenarios for Ohio; (2) human resource development of providers and consumers of postsecondary educational services; (3) equipment and capital plan expenditures; and (4) implications of high technology for academic program development, approval, and evaluation. Through a series of meetings and creation of working papers and models, the TFHT developed 11 recommendations under these four goal areas. In general, the committee noted that the United States is experiencing the onset of a transformation from an industrialized to a technical society based on information. For Ohio, this trend will mean the loss of jobs unless the postsecondary  establishment, in concert with other parts of society, accepts a commitment to strategic planning and management. Collection and analysis of data should begin with the Ohio Board of Regents undertaking an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities in order to clarify the role of technical education in economic development. From there, a multi-year action plan could be derived. The commitment to strategic planning and management should be paralleled by a commitment to human resource development. With regard to capital planning, additional money is required to support high technological equipment, and program development must be synchronized with such equipment purchase. In the area of program development and review, more emphasis should be placed on the requirements of high  technology programs and the development of more innovative programs. Pulling together these four aspects of the educational process should result in a better system for Ohio to meet the challenges of an information-oriented technical society in the years to come. (A summary of recommendations is attached.) (KC)",

The monograph is divided into two parts. Part A, containing four chapters, gives suggestions for how to plan, implement, and evaluate community collaboration to improve career guidance. Part B presents 10 case studies that illustrate successful community efforts in cooperative programs of career guidance. In part A, chapter 1 reviews the thinking underlying community collaboration and the encouragement provided by federal, state, and local laws and policies. Chapter 2 turns the focus to additional decisions the planning team will face  and presents sample strategies for monitoring and evaluating the efforts of the community agencies. Chapter 3 introduces the reader to ways other communities have made the programmatic decisions presented in the previous chapter. The chapter summarizes data on the results of community attempts to implement career guidance collaboration. Chapter 4 includes conclusions and recommendations intended to facilitate community collaboration to improve career guidance for all target populations. Each recommendation is followed by a review of findings that support it and an outline of steps that could be followed to implement it. Part B contains actual case studies summarizing team activities, both by regions and by individual communities for 10 sites (four in the Northeast, one in the South, two  in the Midwest, two in the Northwest, and one in the Far West).

        "description":"A study focused on the extent to which women undergo a spell of unemployment upon reentering the labor force and the factors that determine whether they undergo this spell of unemployment. Data were from two samples of female reentrants constructed from the National Longitudinal Survey for 1972. The sample of young women included those 20-28 years of age, and the sample of mature women included persons 35-49 years of age. A search model was used to examine reentrant behavior and the probability that this will lead to a spell of unemployment. Results showed that only one of every three women undergoes a period of unemployment upon reentrance. Determinants considered included education, certification, work experience, marital status, young children at home, migration, potential  market wage, race, unemployment rate, and prior intentions to seek work. The significant variables for the mature women indicated the importance of flows of labor market information (education and work experience) and the importance of prior decision making in formulating plans for reentrance. Significant variables for young women came from the information vector (certification, work experience, migration) and prior search plans. Also significant were the variables of number of children at home and race. (YLB)",

Dental assistants and dentists met at three DACUM workshops to develop a definition of the dental assistant and an outline of clinical competencies in the form of tasks and duties specific to the dental assistant in New Jersey. Once the DACUM profile had been developed and reviewed, the product served as the basis for the development of instructional content and curriculum materials that focused on student attainment of the specified skills identified. These tasks were accomplished: project staffing, development of a curriculum materials format, establishment of an integrated sequence of instruction (a curriculum  content outline), development of clinical competency statements, and development, review, and revision of materials for printing.

        "description":"This document is a transcript of a fact-finding hearing conducted to evaluate the prospective impact of robotics (the use of sophisticated programmable or computer-controlled robots to perform routine and repetitious tasks) on employment in this country. Testimony and prepared reports were given by John Andelin, assistant director of Science, Information, and Natural Resources, Office of Technology Assessment, and by Robert U. Ayres, professor of engineering and public policy, Carnegie-Mellon University. Mr. Andelin's testimony stressed four points: first, robots are but one component of a larger programmable automation phenomenon; second, specific employment impacts are hard to predict, and he lacks confidence in those predictions currently publicized; third, changes in the  number of jobs are only one of the consequences of increasing use of programmable automation, another important one being changes in the quality of jobs; fourth, and finally, while new instructional programs for persons who may use or produce programmable automation are emerging from several sources, curriculum development, change, and delivery are not proceeding in a coordinated fashion. Mr. Ayers said that, to date, about 5,000 robots are being used in U.S. industry and that their use has caused little displacement of workers so far. However, it is important to consider the potential for future job displacement by robots in industry over the next several decades. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that displaced workers are likely to be concentrated in regions of the country that  are already depressed, are unable to move because of difficulty in selling their homes, and are likely to be middle-aged and, therefore, fearful of change. These factors could cause social problems or noncompetitiveness in the world economy if they are not addressed. (KC)",

During the project, researchers assessed the current state of the role of nursing home training coordinators and the performance competencies needed by them. In addition, curriculum guidelines were designed to meet the needs and requirements for a position as a nursing home training coordinator. Also developed during the project was a training manual for use in helping other educational institutions to replicate the project-developed nursing home trainer coordinator curriculum. In the fall of 1979, a project-sponsored course entitled \"Inservice Coordination in the Health Care Setting\" was developed and offered to 14 students at the  School of Allied Health Sciences of the University of Texas Health Science Center in Dallas. The final phase of the project involved the development and approval of a minor in gerontology that was made available to students in Allied Health Education. The questionnaire, field survey results and curriculum guidelines are appended. (MN)",

        "description":"Unemployment among young people is a serious and persistent problem in this country. Unemployment rates are especially high among members of minority groups, for high school dropouts, and in economically depressed areas. Vocational education can help to alleviate the problem of unemployment, and a close link between schools and employers can help ensure that vocational education programs are teaching students the skills that employers will need. The public elementary and secondary schools should offer noncollege-bound students a thorough grounding in language skills, reasoning, and mathematics, along with the mechanical and technical skills and work habits that will prepare them for working life. This responsibility should not be shifted to the private sector (although ways  employers can help significantly are outlined in this report). Although some vocational education and training programs do improve the employability of their graduates, the quality of vocational education programs is highly variable, and the access of disadvantaged students is not ensured. Expanded collaboration between vocational educators and private sector employers and improved cooperation between vocational education and employment training programs are recommended. Work experience programs should help, as would strengthening the capabilities of vocational education teachers through changes in certification requirements, training, use of part-time teachers, and pay scales. Three policy changes could improve the financing of vocational education: modifications in the formulas for  funding programs, strategies for pooling equipment, and supplemental funding for program improvement. Other approaches include experimentation with vocational incentive grants to disadvantaged students and attention to consumer protection in vocational education programs. Selected tables on youth employment and unemployment are appended. (KC)",

Following an argument for maintaining a flexible middle school curriculum which contributes to the social development of students, the five school districts currently participating in the program and the criteria under which they were selected are listed. Sample activities from the Teacher's Ideabook are presented for the three levels of the program: (1) infusion of work concepts into the traditional curriculum; (2) classroom-based experiential learning including the use of community resource people, peer teaching about personal work roles, a decision-making unit, and team learning projects; and (3)  community-based learning including preparation, group visits to local sites, small group projects, and shadowing (a student spends one-half day with a worker at a job of the student's choice). A fourth level involving community internships is outlined although it is not yet part of the program. Possible concerns of educational and community groups regarding the program are presented along with responses to those concerns. Three planning steps are then offered. Comments and news items from the five current sites are provided as well as names and addresses of contact persons. A bibliography of selected resources cites 5 organizations and 11 print resources.

An introductory section lists the general goals of the curriculum, i.e, to provide factual information, to increase awareness, and to provide decision-making practice, and describes the desired core social skills outcomes, i.e., social understanding/perspective taking; cognitive problem solving, (alternative and consequential thinking); communication; and evaluation. The 24 lessons in the manual cover general drug related information and  specific drugs (e.g., caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine). Information portions of each lesson focus on terminology, how drugs are made, their effects on the body, and relevant laws. Awareness activities explore the effects of advertisers, peer pressure, role models, and drug pushers in drug involvement. Decision activities anticipate situations involving drugs and provide students with opportunities to practice decision skills. Suggestions for needed materials, handouts, student evaluations, and lesson evaluations are included for each lesson and at the end of the manual. (BL)",

An introductory section lists the general goals of the curriculum, i.e, to provide factual information, to give students an opportunity to anticipate, practice, and reflect on decisions they face or will face about sexual behavior, and to legitimize student questions and concerns. Lesson format and suggested teaching strategies, e.g., role plays, collages, brainstorming, are also described in the introduction and suggestions for staff training, and parent and  community involvement, and a list of audiovisual materials and references are provided. The 23 content lessons cover anatomy and puberty; changing relationships (decisions, parents, friendships, dating, sex roles, homosexuality); sexual activity (readiness, pregnancy, birth control, disease); and parenting and lifestyle. Each lesson lists goals, activities, needed materials, and references. Activities and materials include vocabulary lessons, confidential question boxes, worksheets, strategies for decision-making, homework, and lesson evaluations. A final student assessment and course evaluation complete the manual. (BL)",

The first section provides the rationale and conceptual framework of the curriculum including a developmental model of adolescent decision-making which involves five core skills, i.e., social perspective-taking, alternative and consequential thinking, communication, and evaluation. Section 2 provides an overview of decision-making as a core school program component. Sections 3-10 describe specific approaches to  decsion-making including: (1) assessment and evaluation; (2) the adolescent decisions curriculum (guidelines and areas covered in other volumes of the program); (3) classroom meetings; (4) school climate and discipline; (5) parent involvement; (6) community outreach; and (7) a \"whole school\" model approach to decision-making. Section 11 provides guidelines for starting the program and case studies of program approaches. The four appendices include a needs and interest assessment for school staff, sample needs and interest tools for parents, parent evaluation ideas, and the Interpersonal Negotiation Strategies Interview form.

        "description":"Provided in this book is a legislative and administrative history of the National Science Foundation (NSF) during its formative years (1945-57). The 15 chapter book is organized into three parts. Part 1 (&quot;The Long Debate, 1945-50&quot;) narrates the legislative history of the Foundation's creation. Part 2 (&quot;Beginning, 1950-54&quot;) discusses the appointment of NSF's first board, director, and staff; their early decisions on research and fellowship programs and means of administering them; and conflict over the agency's policy responsibility, culminating with the issuance of Executive Order 10521 in which NSF's duties and role in policy development and evaluation were defined. Part 3 (&quot;Cold War Growth, 1954-57&quot;), beginning approximately with the executive order and ending, again  approximately, with the orbiting of the first Soviet Sputnik in October 1957, discusses NSF's expanding educational and research programs, including ventures into international cooperation, and the continuing effort to determine the Foundation's role in the making of national science policy. The text of Executive Order 10521 concerning government scientific research, excerpts from an interview with William E. Benson (June 12, 1975) on peer review in the earth science program, and NSF organizational structure (1950-57) are included in appendixes.

        "description":"Decimal numbers have become an increasingly important topic of the elementary and junior high school mathematics curriculum. However, national and state education assessments indicate that students have incomplete and distorted conceptions of decimal numbers. This paper reports initial data from a two-year project designed to elicit and describe students' understanding of decimals. Students in grades 3, 5, 7, and 9 were given written tests and interviewed individually on a variety of decimal tasks. Of primary interest here are tasks that considered decimals as (1) quantities that have value; (2) extensions of whole numbers; and (3) equivalents of common fractions. Results indicate that students perceive decimals primarily as symbols upon which to perform syntactic maneuvers.  Although many students have significant hidden understandings, they rarely connect these with the procedural rules they have memorized. (JN)",

Additional data (in table format) are provided for the years 1973-74 and 1978-79 on science teacher distribution by subject area taught, educational background, and school district size, and on teachers (by subject area and school district size) with undergraduate/graduate majors in their area of teaching responsibility. Major findings indicate a decline in mathematics/science teacher supply from 1970-82, a change in the job market due  to competition in hiring from business and industry, critical shortages in sciences (especially earth science, physics, and chemistry) and mathematics, and serious long range consequences of continued critical shortages on the total educational system. Also presented are results of a national telephone survey on the estimated supply of secondary biology, chemistry, physics, general science, earth science, and mathematics teachers by state (1980-1982).

Findings indicate that parents of women engineers were more likely to hold college degrees and to be employed in professional positions than were the parents of male engineers. Among those who had received their degree more than 5 years ago, more women than men had obtained advanced degrees. Younger engineers/men made their decision to pursue engineering sooner than did older engineers/women. Work-related factors were rated as most important in influencing decisions to pursue engineering degrees. While men and women reported  comparable levels of technical responsibility in current jobs, women reported lower levels of supervisory responsibility and lower salaries than did men, the descrepancy most apparent among engineers receiving the bachelor of science degree more than 10 years ago. Women also rated their jobs lower than did men on career advancement opportunities and were less satisfied with progress made in their careers. However, the vast majority reported satisfaction with current jobs, with older engineers reporting greater satisfaction than younger engineers. (Author/JN)",

Designed for both adults and junior/senior high school students, the game: (1) demonstrates the interrelationship between the natural marine environment and human systems; (2) teaches about coastal processes and resources by focusing attention on benefits and vulnerabilities of these systems; and (3) provides an opportunity to become involved in decision-making in situations related to management of coastal resources. The game, which takes approximately 90-120 minutes, proceeds from neighborhood meetings of common interest groups (fishermen, developers, conservationists, tourists, and others) and concludes in a  county commission hearing to decide policies regarding such common issues as fishing in canals, dredging of a ship channel, and coastal water supply regulation. Game instructions, player materials (provided in four appendixes), and a cartoon booklet (&quot;Man Meets Coast&quot;) are included. (JN)",

        "description":"This document provides the first comprehensive, in-depth review of the National Science Board (NSB), the governing board of the National Science Foundation (NSF). The report, which covers the period 1968-1980, includes a detailed picture of how the Board sought to define and exercise its role in policy matters (such as support for basic/applied research and science education) and in management matters (such as budget formulation, the agency's internal organization structure, and the Board's relationship to the NSF director). The Board is today the only prominent survivor of the concept that government science is best managed by giving such a board of part-time, outside advisors a strong policy and management role. For Congress, the fundamental question is whether the continuation  of that role will best serve the national needs and interests in the future, or whether a modified or alternate statutory arrangement will be more advantageous for the country in coming years. The report, which has led to the identification 13 major issues of potential congressional concern (including NSB role, NSB role in budget process and basic research, attention to science education, policy versus management roles, programs approval function, and others), provides information and analysis to assist Congress in forming their views on that question.

Recognizing that most of these students are mainstreamed and do not take science laboratory courses, the program focused heavily on the outdoor laboratory setting at an environmental center. In addition, mindful of the attitudinal, informational, and communicative barriers experiences by these youngsters, a curriculum was chosen which minimized these barriers as much as could be practicable. The program was designed to give students optimal exposure to concrete examples of theory while minimizing the amount of time spent in lecture and textbook study. This document discusses: (1) program philosophy/objectives, participant selection, and  instructional staff/counselor training; (2) the curriculum and specialized adaptations; (3) the recreational program; (4) evaluation (including pre-/post-test and student/staff evaluation); (5) assessment of outcomes; and (6) dissemination efforts. Provided in the curriculum section are lecture/film outlines, abstracts of environmental/ecological activities used, with complete copies of selected activities (including grade level(s), goals, concepts/skills fostered, behavioral objectives, background information, and instructional strategies). Supporting documentation (including pre/post tests, staff evaluation forms, and handouts distributed at inservice workshops) is included in appendixes.

The present research focused on the use of the SCII in occupational counseling of prospective engineering students or of professionals. Specific objectives were to identify an interest profile of engineers using the revised SCII (Campbell &amp; Hansen, 1981), to compare/contrast interest profiles of meaningful subgroups of engineers, classified according to sex, ethnic background, current career field, level of career satisfaction, and number of years since obtaining the bachelor's degree, and to examine the extent to which standard score means of independent samples on the SCII's two &quot;Engineer&quot; scales differ from the means of their respective  norm samples. Data were collected from 488 engineers (174 females and 314 males). Results indicate that the &quot;typical&quot; engineer is a composite of rather heterogeneous groups of engineers and that SCII scales have a major utility for differentiating engineering specialities and for counseling potential engineers. Sex, career field, satisfaction, and experience differences were also found, indicating that although engineers tend to differ from non-engineers in interests, major subgroup differences within the engineering profession also occur.

Although the National Science Foundation and other agencies do not see a shortage of college faculty in the other sciences, faculty in some of these colleges of science do indicate that such a shortage will exist at some time in the future. The recognized shortages, and those still unrecognized, stem from the same source: the higher salaries paid to university-trained scientists and engineers at all degree levels by industry. Industry also possesses better research equipment for engineers. Suggestions have been made to have science and engineering schools upgrade themselves, and/or  have industry and the Federal government adopt policies that would help these schools accomplish the same purpose. These policies include raising faculty salaries to competitive levels with industry, industry support of faculty workshops, and a tax structure allowing corporations better tax deductions for gifts to universities (including gifts of expensive research equipment). It is suggested that whatever is done must be done quickly since the training of professionals for university faculty positions is a long time affair. (JN)",

        "description":"In an effort to broaden the audience for the performing arts, attitudinal, life-style, and socioeconomic data on marginal and regular attenders of theater and symphony concerts in Atlanta (Georgia), Baton Rouge (Louisiana), Columbia (South Carolina), and Memphis (Tennessee) were collected. Telephone interviews were conducted with 1491 respondents 14 years of age or older randomly selected from households with telephones in 4 cities. Four major factors were found to predict attendance at both theater and symphony: attitudes toward attendance, attendance in the past year, interest in the art form as a child, and membership in the Culture Patron life-style group. For both theater and symphony, the two highest impact strategies were to offer second tickets at half price from time to  time and to include famous performers in the production. The report concludes with recommendations of interest to arts managers who would like to translate the study results into concrete actions and with methodological conclusions of interest to those doing further audience studies. Appendices contain statistical tables, a note on factor analysis, and the survey questionnaire. (RM)",

        "description":"Although the importance of entrepreneurship to the American economy has been documented, a review of research reveals that knowledge about entrepreneurship education is sparse and that research on entrepreneurship education for women is almost nonexistent. A summary of this research indicates that sex stereotyping in schools inhibits women from acquiring the insights, motivation, and skills to become entrepreneurs and that entrepreneurship education for elementary and secondary school students tends to be extremely limited in quantity and deficient in quality. Also, although research does not distinguish between entrepreneurs and small business managers, data indicate that psychological characteristics which separate entrepreneurs from others seem to be determined outside the  educational structure, with family influence being the most dominant. Further, considering the important role of mentors, exposure of women to female entrepreneurs is important in encouraging women-owned businesses. Based on the findings and national reports, an agenda for entrepreneurship education for women should include research to determine needs of women business owners, an evaluation of current educational programs, development of educational materials at the elementary school level, continued enforcement of legislation and programs to reduce sex bias and stereotyping in the schools, and development of materials which accurately portray the role of women business owners.

The return rate was 43%. Results were compared with similar surveys conducted in 1952 and 1965. The status of geography in North Dakota's secondary schools has diminished since 1952. At that time 53% of the schools had one or more geography classes; in 1978-79, only 42% taught geography. The bulk of geography enrollments continues to be in world regional courses.  Traditional texts continue to be popular, and maps and films are widely used by teachers today as supplementary aids. Current professional memberships are not high among teachers. Since 1952, teachers have expressed an interest in teaching specific regional geography courses. The majority of teachers in 1978 were willing to train student teachers.

Major emphasis was on social R&D in the major policy areas of income security, health, early childhood, and the living environment (i.e., policy area that encompasses the patterns of growth and change in agricultural, urban, and metropolitan areas). One central insight revealed in the agency  studies, all of which are summarized in this report, is that there is an enormous diversity of practices in all areas studied. In the concluding sections of the report, key conclusions, generally critical of current practices, are discussed, and a framework in which to analyze the actions of the social R&D managers is developed.

The groups are explored from the perspective of archaeological inquiry using information from prehistory, linguistics, tribal traditions, and other sources. Activities include data gathering, hypothesis testing, analysis, and drawing conclusions from evidence. The 10 modules currently being developed focus on methods of the archaeological study of the past, culture areas in North America, the use of computers in  archaeology, American Indian language families, the origins of corn, the techniques of pottery making, religious practices, pueblos, the cultural sequence of North America, and the archaeology of the Colonial Period. Teaching guides provide background on the relationship of prehistory, ethnology, linguistics, and physical anthropology to archaeology; basic techniques of building a sandbox site; directions for making representative pottery; introductory lessons in American Indian linguistics; and recipes for a typical meal. Some units are suitable for art and science education. (KC)",

A nationally representative sample of 2305 married persons (1762 females and 543 males) were interviewed at length. Findings showed that socioeconomic and cultural factors affect the perceptions, values, and attitudes of people and are reflected in relations between spouses. Values, perceptions, and attitudes, in turn, as social-psychological mechanisms, affect fertility behavior. Analysis of the cross-sectional data suggested that with socioeconomic development and especially with increased education, children's economic value decreases, whereas  their psychological value increases. Correlational and regression analysis also revealed that where children's economic value assumed importance, son preference was prevalent, women's status in the family was low, the old-age security value of children was high, and fertility was high.

Findings showed that among the local-born, the most notable recent development has been the rise of the Orientals (essentially Japanese and Chinese) to equality with the haoles (essentially non-Portuguese and non-Puerto Rican Caucasians) on some social and economic indices and clear superiority on others. In contrast, local-born Filipinos and members of other groups remain disadvantaged on all dimensions. Mainland-born haoles initially suffer from high unemployment but are characterized by moderate income and high educational and occupational levels. Their income and homeownership levels appear to improve markedly with increasing  duration of residence. Among Asian immigrants, recent arrivals are characterized by occupational and income levels far below what would be expected given their educational levels. Cultural and historical explanations for these and other findings are examined. A projection of the Hawaii population to the year 2000 demonstrates slower than expected growth for the haole population, a large increase in the proportion that is Filipino, and a large drop in the Oriental share of the population.

In the first paper &quot;Identity, Conflict, and Survival Mechanisms for Asian Americans,&quot; the author discusses how the observable patterns of mobility through education and community development are consequences of meaningful action and interaction among millions of Asian Americans over time. Cultural identity and the process of assimilation of Caribbean Americans is the focus of the second paper. The barriers to assimilation faced by many Caribbean migrants have caused many of them to question the viability of this goal and to turn to ethnic bargaining as a way of competing for political strength and survival in  the United States. The third paper examines British racial and educational policies in the 1960s and 1970s. The evolution of Britain into a multiracial society has been marked by ambiguity in policy that has been both welcoming and resistant (and sometimes racist). British education has, most of the time, paid lip service to the goals of multiracism, while being less than positive in its pursuit. (RM)",

A total of 93 editorials, guest editorials, and letters to the editor from 1971 through 1975 were examined. The material was classified as either pro or con on the issue and was then categorized according to the basis of argumentation: politics, fairness, efficacy, or legality. Variables included year of study, basis of argument, format (editorial, guest editorial, or letter), and position pro or con. Of the 93 pieces, 76 were pro on the issue and 17 were con; editorials written by the &quot;Times&quot; staff were 100 percent pro. The most frequent arguments were based on efficacy (i.e., amnesty  was an effective way of reuniting those in need of it), followed by those based on fairness. The total number of opinion pieces was greatest in 1974 (38) and declined to 18 in 1975. Conclusions are that opinion pieces were basically a reflection of the existing opinion (of staff and readers) rather than a cause of this opinion. Also, most of the opinion material was reactive; none of the material examined was neutral. Finally, the format type forecast the content; letters to the editor were more likely to include arguments against amnesty, while editorials reflected the newspaper's position only. (KC)",

It is noted that, because NDN certified trainers can help in information dissemination and program implementation in many ways, all processes used by certified trainers are not described in this guidebook and that those described are not necessarily used in each case. Material is organized according to a set of components generic to certified trainer systems: (1) identifying; (2) training; (3) certifying; (4) funding; (5) supporting; (6) coordinating; (7) recertifying; and (8) evaluating. In the first section, an overview describes the  guidebook's audiences, purposes, and contents and defines certified trainers and certified trainer systems. The current status of certified trainers and certified trainer systems is also discussed. Section 2 lists project assessment procedures, the results of which are used in the design or refinement of a certified trainer system, the topic of section 3. The fourth section contains descriptions of strategies for use in certified trainer systems. Section 5 highlights and discusses several important issues concerning certified trainers and certified trainer systems. The sixth section is an appendix, containing information about: (1) certified trainer operations; (2) criteria for identifying certified trainers; (3) problems, issues, and learnings involving certified trainers; and (4)  selected references on dissemination.

A method was developed for reducing the amount of data to be analyzed. FMO data from observations of nine second-grade classrooms was categorized by combinations of &quot;who&quot; and &quot;to whom&quot; codes found to occur most  frequently. These categories were further divided into teacher-initiated and student-initiated interactions. It was felt that this system of categorization captured the major classroom interactions and excluded information of little educational value. A teacher profile created on the basis of categorical FMO can provide a basis for discerning the effects of various teaching styles on student behavior. (JD)",

Collaborative research in teaching can be defined as research conducted inside the classroom by two or more individuals with different role orientations and professional concerns. The collaborative effort can be seen in the mutual work and ideas of the Ecological Perspectives for Successful Schooling Practice Project (Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development, San Francisco, California) and of another research project, Interactive Research and Development on Teaching (Tikunoff, Ward, and Griffin). Three general characteristics of collaborative research are: (1) Collaborative  research requires the establishment of parity among collaborators; (2) It demands the maintenance of reciprocal relationships among team members representing different professional orientations; and (3) It requires the establishment of a common language among its participants. Three collaborative research activities found particularly productive are: (1) open-ended interviews; (2) collaborative data analysis; and (3) collaborative planning. Collaborative research on teaching has a central role to play in staff development programs. It provides an important core of activities in which teachers and researchers come together and examine the problems and possibilities of teaching. (JM)",

The Ecological Perspectives for Successful Schooling Practice Junior High School Transition Study tapped the perceptions of students in transition using data from two instruments that were administered by cooperating school districts. Students completed the Student Opinion Survey (SOS), an instrument measuring general attitudes toward school, at the end of the sixth and seventh grades. Students also completed a Concerns Questionnaire during the fifth week of seventh grade. For this instrument, students responded to a list of potential transition concerns by indicating the degree of their concern both  when they first entered junior high school and at the present time. Results from the two instruments are different in that students expressed fairly consistent dissatisfaction with junior high school on the SOS, but indicated few problems in the transition to junior high school. Explanations for this discrepancy are considered. The report contains 62 tables, and the SOS survey and Concerns Questionnaire are appended. (JM)",

These foci can be further subdivided into themes. When discussing their academic work, students mentioned: the quantity of the assigned work, the difficulty of this work, and the grading standards that the teacher used to evaluate the work. When students considered the instructional facility of their teachers, their comments centered  around the quality of explanations provided by the teacher, and the individual assistance the teacher was willing to provide. In describing their classroom experiences, students mentioned: (1) disciplinary strategy employed; (2) tolerance for inappropriate behavior; (3) degree to which students were encouraged to manage their classroom activities; and (4) overall affective character of the class. Students also talked about teachers' personal characteristics, including temperament, displays of temper, and relationships established with students. (JM)",

        "description":"Schools, colleges, and departments of education are becoming increasingly accountable for the training and evaluation of competent teachers, and are developing new ways to evaluate their graduates and their programs. The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) has identified three areas for evaluating teacher education graduates: competency, entry, and effectiveness. Data for evaluation of teacher education graduates could be obtained from four categories: (1) career line data; (2) direct classroom observation; (3) pupil, peer, and supervisory evaluations; and (4) standardized measures. Each of these categories relates to an NCATE evaluation standard. At present, standardized measures seem the most efficient and reliable evaluative data available to  teacher educators for determining the quality of their graduates and their teacher education programs. These standardized measures take the form of competency examinations (before certification) and student achievement measures (after entry into the profession). Other measures of teacher performance include classroom observation and pupil, peer, and supervisory evaluations. More refined measures need to be developed to be used as admission standards to schools of education. (JM)",

The two major questions for research were: (1) Is there an interaction between individual characteristics of teachers and supervisory approach with regard to preference and performance? and (2) Can supervisors acquire greater flexibility in using different approaches? Answers, drawn from prior research, include: (1) Experienced teachers do vary on their preferences between non-directive and collaborative supervisory approaches; (2) Beginning teachers prefer a directive supervisory approach; (3) A correlation between teacher conceptual level with preference of performance with certain supervisory approaches has not been found; and (4) There has not  yet been research conducted on supervisory flexibility in acquiring new interpersonal behaviors. Research on supervisory flexibility is about to begin. At least three studies will be conducted in 1983-84 to find further answers to the aforementioned questions. Several diagrams, references, and a list of studies in progress and to be undertaken are appended. (Author/JMK)",

Such invitational education, it is noted, stresses the importance of teacher behaviors which intentionally bid students to see themselves as valuable, able, and responsible persons who can behave accordingly. Using pilot study data from interviews with primary school teachers, part I of this paper examines how they handle difficult human relations situations, what they perceive as the ideal way to deal with these situations, and what perceived constraints prevent them from behaving in this ideal manner. Part II looks at written critical incidents submitted by teachers to see if there is a shift in their basic perception of self, others, purpose, and frame of  reference in relationship to non-moral and morally transgressing situations. The final part of the paper attempts to bring together the implications of the first two parts to provide suggestions for inviting moral development. The study contains five charts, references, and seven appendices. (Authors/JM)",

It is noted that recent research has suggested that many biological and physiological effects of growing older--the physical decline which occurs in many older adults--are primarily the result of such lifestyle factors as disuse or simply being \"out of shape.\" Research reviewed in this paper points toward the critical role of lifestyle in the maintenance of health and the prevention of some of the disabling conditions often associated with age. Changes in attitudes towards physical fitness programs for older adults are discussed, and it  is noted that, several years ago, medical experts, physiologists, and educators might have ignored or written off physical fitness programs for older adults as somewhat pointless. Cited research suggests that some of the symptoms of old age may be controlled or partially reversed through good physical conditioning. Implications for lifespan educational organization and design and for older adult educational programs are discussed. (Author/JM)",

A review is given of the decision, by the United States Supreme Court, upholding use of the NTE by South Carolina in that state's teacher certification system. The points are made that it was not the intent of the testing system to discriminate and that graduation from an approved teacher training program was not a viable alternative to the use of the NTE for certification purposes. A review is also presented of Educational Testing Service (ETS) validation procedures that determine the validity of test questions as they relate to job requirements rather than to the quality of a teacher  training program. The point is made that Uniform Guidelines on Employment Selection Procedures require identification of competencies important to a successful performance in the job for which candidates are to be evaluated. Actual directions given to educational experts who served as judges for the Arkansas NTE study of area examinations are presented. Also included in this paper are descriptions of data analysis procedures used in the Arkansas study. (JD)",

The model was applied in arithmetic classes through a weekly testing program. The teacher specified the generic task being taught, tests were constructed using a table of random numbers to select the numbers for addition or subtraction, and results were reported to the teachers. The results were used in three ways: as information about individual and class performance, for planning further instruction, and for providing feedback to students. A miniature study of subtraction was undertaken to illustrate the use of conventional analysis of variance procedures with these tests. The results of the study suggest that short tests  developed without preliminary item analyses and primarily for use in monitoring classroom instruction can also be used in a more conventional fashion. The final section of the report contains an annotated bibliography of related research studies. (PN)",

        "description":"The feasibility of using item response theory (IRT) as a psychometric model for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Aptitude Test was addressed by assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions of item response theory for GRE item types and examinee populations. Items from four forms and four administrations of the GRE Aptitude Test were calibrated using the three-parameter logistic item response model. Three equating methods were compared in this research: equipercentile equating, linear equating, and item response theory true score equating. Various data collection designs (for both IRT and non-IRT methods) and several item parameter linking procedures (for the IRT equatings) were employed. The IRT methods produced quantitative scaled score means and standard deviations that  were higher and lower, respectively, than those produced by the linear and equipercentile methods. The most notable finding in the analytical equatings was the sensitivity of the precalibration design (used only for the IRT equating method) to practice effects on analytical items, particularly for the analysis of explanations item type. Since the precalibration design is the data collection method most appealing (for administrative reasons) for equating the GRE Aptitude Test in a test disclosure environment, this sensitivity might present a problem for any equating method.

While the main body of the report describes the particulars of the present application and delineates the essential features of the approach, a technical appendix describes the standardization approach in detail. The primary goal of the standardization approach is to control for differences in subpopulation ability before making comparisons between subpopulation performance on test items. By so doing, it removes the contaminating effects of ability differences from the assessment of item fairness. Of  the total of 195 items studied, the standardization approach identified only a handful as meriting careful review for possible content bias. Of these few, only one item exhibited a clearly unacceptable degree of unexpected differential item performance between males and females that could be attributed to content bias. (Author)",

The phrase &quot;item deletion&quot; refers to the process of changing the original key of a flawed item to either all options correct, including omits, or to no options correct, i.e., not scoring the flawed item. There are two aspects to the present analysis. The first aspect is analytical, focusing on the development of a formal model for the item deletion effect by decomposing it into its constituent elements. The second component of the analysis is empirical, involving the use of actual Scholastic Aptitude Test data to illustrate and supplement the analytical results. The analytical decomposition demonstrates how the effects of item properties, test properties,  individual examinee responses and rounding rules combine to produce the item deletion effect on the equating/scaling function and candidate scores. In addition, the analytical component of the report examines the effects of not scoring vs. scoring all options correct and the effects of re-equating vs. not re-equating, as well as the interaction between the decision to re-equate or to not re-equate and the scoring option chosen for the flawed item.

The candidates provide this information on one side of their answer sheet, according to instructions given in the handbook sent to each candidate upon registration. In view of the extreme heterogeneity of the TOEFL candidate population it seems likely that additional information would be valuable. Foreign students (39 undergraduate and 18 graduate) were interviewed at four institutions. Four  variables emerged as being the most promising: total number of years of formal study of English; reading of English-language newspapers, books, and magazines; number of years of father's education; and number of years of mother's education. Collectively, these variables offer the promise of enhanced research on various aspects of the TOEFL candidate population and on foreign students generally.

Five areas that affect the potential for producing effective program evaluation form a framework for discussing factors related to perceived success. The areas include inappropriate conceptualization of what an evaluation can accomplish, what to evaluate and how to evaluate. Inappropriate recognition of the limitations of existing program data and inappropriate training of most evaluators also affect the evaluation. There is little consensus about what constitutes a successful evaluation, beyond the recognition that success is related to the utilization of the information generated through the evaluation process. Some consider success to be the extent to which information  generated on the impact of the program affects policy decisions regarding the future of that program. Some view an evaluation as \"successful\" if the program is better articulated. Others expect the information generated by the evaluation to lead to more effective management. In other words, perceived success of program evaluations has a variety of meanings for the same and different audiences. (Author/CM)",

It was hypothesized that poor paired associate learners would benefit from picture adjunct aids to a greater extent than good paired associate learners. A secondary aim was to assess the effects of requiring children to act on pictures. Data were gathered from two experiment phases: trials of paired associate tasks using noun pairs presented as words or line drawings to classify learner types, and three story reading and recall tasks in &quot;No Picture&quot; or &quot;Picture&quot; adjunct conditions. A fourth story involved a multiple-choice picture task and oral free recall test. Overall mean performance for picture and word pair learners were  classified as high picture-high word (HH), high picture-low word (HL), low picture-high word (LH), and low picture-low word (LL). Although the Learner X Picture Interaction was not significant in every analysis, the significant interactions that were found and the general pattern of results support the hypothesis that picture adjunct aids help LLs more than HHs on a constructed response task. Factors of &quot;Reading Ability&quot; and &quot;Picture&quot; were also examined. (CM)",

        "description":"While there is a recognized need for new and better ways to train soldiers to fight, many training programs developed in response to this need are used poorly or not at all. In part, the failure to use these training programs stems from the lack of established procedures for monitoring implementation and evaluating use. Effective monitoring can provide information that improves the implementation process, thereby increasing the use of new training programs. Routine evaluation of use issues can result in guidance for modifying existing programs and developing new programs. In this paper a framework for the Life Cycle evaluation of Army training programs is presented. In the Life Cycle framework it is recognized that evaluation issues change as the program &quot;ages.&quot; The paper  provides an overview of the Life Cycle framework and then focuses on issues important during the process of implementation. The goal is for the &quot;evaluator as monitor&quot; to take actions and make recommendations that will increase the likelihood that the implementation process is successful and the program is routinely used.

A distinction is made between schools which are maintaining an exceptional level of achievement and those which are improving their achievement in an extraordinary way. More schools were found which consistently exceeded expectations and fewer schools were found which improved extraordinarily, than would have been expected under a random model of school achievement. It was hypothesized that a strong tendency to persist in school practices and a great difficulty in altering them significantly would have this result. Results for mathematics were found to differ from those for reading and written expression. The greater opportunities for extracurricular learning in reading and written expression,  compared to mathematics, were hypothesized to account for this. (Author)",

Two levels of tests are given in grade 7 to monitor progress, and in grades 9 to 12 to determine whether each student has met the state minimum competency level. Students must pass the higher level of the Maryland Functional Reading Test to be eligible to graduate from high school. There are retest requirements until the test is passed. Graduation requirements apply to handicapped students (mainstreamed or in regular classes) on a different schedule. Test security requires several test forms, therefore test scores have been put on a scale that can correct for differences in difficulty. Scale scores transformed to performance-related  scores, and estimated percent-correct scores are used to adjust to the different forms. Scores reported for the total test determine graduation eligibility, and scores for each domain determine areas needing further instruction. The results are reported to students, parents and school staff with pass/fail and performance indications. (CM)",

A secondary analysis was performed on the data collected by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The sample involved Caucasian students in grades four, eight and eleven (ages 9, 13 and 17 respectively). The achievement data included mathematics, science and reading. The predictor variables were relative age, class age, sex, parental education, home environment, and type of community. Relative age described a student's age relative to the other students in the classroom, while class age was a control for states with different school entrance cutoff dates. The predictor  variables were entered in a stepwise multiple regression analysis, with class age and relative age entered first. The combined achievement data indicate that the significantly higher achievement found among the oldest students at age nine decreases but remains significant at age thirteen, and disappears by age seventeen. A second analysis of the proportion of students retained one grade revealed significantly increasing proportions of retained students as relative age becomes younger.

The present validity study examined the level of performance of 284 students on the combined CLEP test on political institutions; federal, state and local governments; and the University of Texas, Austin test on state politics and government. The tests were scored separately, then a total score was used in determining final course grades. The validity study analysis and adoption of a decision score for credit used the total scaled scores on the 20-80 scale  of CLEP examinations, related to preliminary course grades. Analyses of total scores, expected total scores, performance, decision scores, operation of the placement system, and guidelines for credit indicated that little change in student performance had occurred.

A Validity Network Schema (VNS) developed by Brinberg &amp; McGrath (1982) is extended and elaborated in order to describe the components of the research process and their interrelations, and draw out some implications of the schema for the acquisition of knowledge. VNS describes research as a three-stage process, whose outcome is some structural combination of concepts, methods, and substantive events. In stage 1, researchers develop, clarify, and select elements and relations from the three basic domains--conceptualization, methodological, and substantive. Stage 2, the research study proper,  involves two steps: the researcher combines elements and relations from two of the three domains to form an intermediate structure; and the researcher integrates that structure with the elements and relations from the third domain. Stage 3 of the research process involves the reduction of uncertainty associated with the findings of Stage 2 by exploring the range of respondents, events, contexts, methods, and concepts over which the stage 2 results do and do not hold. In stage 3, validity takes on the meaning of robustness and generalizability. (PN)",

This paper critically analyzes the current utilization of needs assessment in continuing education programs in nursing. It is argued that the cost benefit of a needs assessment can only be realized when the needs assessment is utilized as a framework for subsequent development of a total marketing scheme. More specifically, the paper discusses and illustrates by example, strategies for how a marketing plan can be employed in continuing education programs in nursing in order to: (1) define objectives; (2) examine opportunities and threats; and (3) perform situation and competitive  analysis, with relatively low cost to the administrator of continuing education. In this manner it is possible to achieve a more desirable balance between organizational and market needs. A set of guidelines are presented for conducting a comprehensive yet cost efficient marketing analysis to serve as a basis for decision making in a continuing education program in nursing. (Author)",

EAP's mandate is to provide crisis intervention, prereferral evaluation, information, referral, and follow-up services. From its inception to March, 1981, EAP provided services to 943 employees with the following types of problems: job-related problems, substance abuse problems, family problems, and others. The present study was initiated by the Employee Assistance Program to determine the program's impact upon employee clients and the supervisors who had referred employees to EAP. The study's major purposes were to determine: (1) To what extent did EAP enable troubled employees to function more  effectively because of program intervention? (2) To what extent did EAP reduce time-consuming activities of supervisors and other personnel related to the problems of troubled employees? (3) To a limited extent, the study also examined selected aspects of EAP's organizational procedures, including intake and referral functions, confidentiality, and recordkeeping procedures. Telephone interviews were conducted with a sample of employees (n=80) representing 21 percent of the population that had used EAP services from the fall of 1979-1981.

The State Education Agency (SEA) evaluation unit is responsible for (1) conducting the statewide evaluation and (2) exercising quality assurance over, and providing technical assistance to, the local evaluations. State Board of Education policy requires that both evaluations apply the Standards for Evaluations of Educational Programs, Projects, and Materials. This paper is written from the point of view of evaluation management and discusses the accountability uses of the processes and information for statewide and local evaluations. It identifies the organization and  management relations developed to carry out the evaluations and discusses the issues arising in implementing evaluations that affect more than a single program or organizational unit. The issues discussed include maintaining the legitimacy of the evaluations and other SEA efforts, balancing the needs of other programs, using the evaluation information, balancing the dual role of the SEA evaluation unit, and assuring quality in the evaluation.

        "description":"The paper focuses on the Title I Evaluation Technical Assistance Centers to illustrate issues of measuring costs and deciding on outcome criteria before promoting &quot;cost-effective&quot; approaches. Effects are illustrated for varying resource allocations among personnel, travel, materials, and phone costs as a function of emphasizing workshops, on-site consultations, phone consultations or material mailouts as assistance strategies. Accounting for staff time by type of activity such as workshop preparation/presentation, travel, and materials development is illustrated as another method to analyze resource allocations or costs. Outcomes which might be indirect indicators of effects such as number of workshops provided, clients served, or consultation hours provided are contrasted with  more direct indicators such as number of districts with &quot;high quality&quot; reports, number of cases in which evaluations are used or client satisfaction with services. Finally, the feasibility of actually conducting cost-effectiveness studies is questioned. Sponsors, service providers and clients will value different outcomes. It is helpful to make explicit the relationship between resource allocations and desired outcomes to minimize potential conflicts among these groups. (PN)",

        "description":"Four procedures were used to estimate a criterion-referenced standard for a multiple-choice examination developed by the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME). Two experimental procedures, the NBME method and a modification of the Guerin method, and the Angoff and Ebel procedures were evaluated on the consistency of the estimates they yielded, the plausibility of the failure rates, and the standard-setters' confidence in their judgments. The NBME and modified Guerin procedures yielded the most consistent and least consistent estimates, respectively. The failure rates associated with the standards obtained using these procedures were higher than the failure rate associated with the test's norm-referenced standard, but only the failure rate associated with the modified Guerin  procedure was obviously unacceptable. The standard-setters said it was difficult to judge the success rate of &quot;minimally knowledgeable examinees&quot; with the test questions, but even more difficult to make those judgments for the hypothetical classifications of items used with the Ebel procedure. The estimates obtained using three of the procedures were relatively consistent and the failure rates associated with them, although higher than the rate experienced with a norm referenced standard, were plausible.

        "description":"This report discusses five issue areas in which it is believed substantial improvements in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) might be achieved. The unifying themes among these issues are to increase the visibility of NAEP, its relevance to policymakers, and its utility to state and local agencies. The first of five substantive chapters deals with the critical need for an overall framework for NAEP objectives. The second chapter deals with the design of test administration and focuses on the costs and benefits of a unified, integrated assessment given each year. The next chapter indicates that exercises are the wrong unit of analysis for NAEP and compares latent trait and latent class approaches to the development of meaning in assessment, pointing out the  special applicability of the latent class analysis for achievement indices. The fourth chapter reviews existing studies of computer-based testing, seeks out predictions of future technological advances, and proposes a gradual series of studies aimed at the ultimate infusion of computer-administered tests throughout NAEP. In the final chapter, a concept and plan are described for an Educational Assessment Institute.

To obtain the congressionally required public comments on the conduct and usefulness of the National Assessment, NIE surveyed chief state school officers, state assessment directors, professional education associations and organizations, and educational researchers. In addition, prior evaluations of NAEP were reviewed and selected papers which address various aspects of NAEP were commissioned. This report reviews the origins of the National  Assessment (Chapter 1), describes its present procedures, design, and methodology (Chapter 2), summarizes its major findings (Chapter 3), discusses its uses (Chapter 4), presents reactions to NAEP (Chapter 5), and sets forth NIE's recommendations (Chapter 6).
