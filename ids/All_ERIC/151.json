        "description":"A study was conducted of children's expression of social as well as spatial relations in their placement of dolls. The study was designed to determine how both face contact and physical distance varied according to the social relationship ascribed to the dolls. It was hoped to find out, through this, whether' children's working definitions of front, back, and beside are composed of social as well as purely spatial elements. Ss were 72 boys and 72 girls between 8-10 years. Each S was tested individually by being asked to make a series of \"in front,\"\"in back,\" and \"beside\" placements of one doll (the mobile doll) in relation to another (the stationary doll). Placements were recorded. Social relationships were manipulated by telling the Ss that the dolls liked each other, disliked  each other, or by making no comment (control). Results showed that: (1) closest mean physical distance occurred when the dolls liked each other and farthest when they disliked each other; (2) \"in front\" placements were farthest,\" in back\" placements were intermediate, and \"beside\" placements were closest; (3) sex differences were found not as a main effect but in complex interactions with other variables such as the sex combination of the dolls; differences did not follow any consistent pattern; and (4) placements were based primarily on the bodies of the dolls; patterns for different types of placements were analyzed.

It emphasizes violence and illegal action; it perpetuates a system in which groups of people are devalued because of sex, race, age, and other such criteria. There is good reason to believe that this type of television content affects children's moral behavior. It frequently leads to increased aggression; there is also reason to believe that it results in lowered self-control and greater likelihood of morally deviant behaviors. Nevertheless, television as it exists now is a large commercial enterprise that is not likely to change even with the extensive evidence that violence may be harming children. It might change if alternatives were  presented to it. There is good reason to believe that many positive moral values and behaviors can be conveyed to children through television presentations. If such presentations draw audiences, they provide some alternative for commercial television producers. What we as researchers can do is to identify the components that help to make a program effective both in attracting children's interest and in producing some positive effects on their behavior.

After one year of the program, comparisons with grades 1-5 of a matched control school in the same community were made. Open classroom teachers were found to be more flexible in their use of space and organization of classroom activities, more creative, more warm and accepting. Pupils did not differ on achievement or problem solving, but open classroom children had more positive self-appraisals and attitudes toward school than control children. Open classrooms were concluded to be effective in many respects. (Author)",

The program involves a Learning Booth equipped with an electric typewriter and staffed by a trained attendant, a sequence of child-paced instructions, a training program for Learning Booth attendants, and other related materials. Two main objectives were evaluated: (1) offering a child an experience where he can learn to solve problems and find answers by himself--it was expected that some would complete the program, reach Phase V, and that 75% would complete Phase III by the end of the year; to evaluate this objective, information was obtained from 2,454 1970-71 kindergarten and first-grade child performance records from 15 Follow Through districts using the Learning Booth; and (2) providing training--two approaches were  evaluated. In the first, Senior Booth Attendants came to the Laboratory for 5 days of training, returned to their districts, set up a booth, and trained attendants; the criterion was that 80% would perform at acceptable levels. The second training approach was to give attendants only the guide. The child performance data showed that 91% of the children completed the year typing at or above Phase III. The data also showed that for kindergarten children, performance in the booth is directly related to the effectiveness of the booth attendant. Evaluation of training was based on observation. For the first training method, 82% of the booths were judged \"good to excellent.\" For the second method, half were considered excellent. (For related document, see PS 006 669.) (Author/KM)",

This method provides a satisfactory basis for operationally defining amount of challenge to cognitive structures, a means of developing humor stimuli that sample a single measurable concept, and a means of determining whether emotionally salient content is necessary to demonstrate the operation of the cognitive-congruency principle. Ss were 96 white females at four age levels: 16 nonconservors and 16 conservors of mass in grade 1, 16 nonconservors and 16 conservors of weight  in grade 2, 16 sixth graders, and 16 first-year graduate students. Ss rated each joke on a five-point funniness scale and were observed for spontaneous smiling and laughing. Support for the cognitive-congruency principle was obtained for funniness ratings but not for smile-laugh ratings. For conservation of mass jokes, a peak in funniness was reached among second graders who were nonconservers of weight but conservers of mass.

The emphasis of the experimental section is upon research findings, while the emphasis of the non-experimental section is upon the curriculum and its implementation. Six studies are discussed in the experimental section: the findings suggest that bilingual instruction is not superior to English or Spanish instruction in terms of student achievement. However, one study showed successful social adjustment on the part of Mexican American children involved in bilingual programs. Findings also showed integrated classrooms to facilitate achievement gains for Mexican Americans. Seventeen programs are discussed in the non-experimental section.  Findings indicate that in some cases acquisition of a specific English vocabulary enables a greater percentage of Mexican American children than normal to progress to subsequent grades in school. Three outstanding features of these preschool programs are a bilingual approach, a greater degree of parental involvement than in most preschool programs, and an awareness and appreciation of the Mexican American cultural heritage.

The model is based on the traditional child development curriculum, with three major differences: (1) thinking is emphasized rather than factual knowledge or sensory learning; (2) the principles of teaching are modified to encourage an active environment, self-initiation of activity, problem-solving directly from physical objects, and the freedom to be &quot;wrong&quot; so that correct  answers can be self-discovered; and (3) the role of the teacher is to create the environment where these learning activities will naturally take place.

In the observation sessions, each infant was approached in a standardized manner by a male and female stranger, both while the baby was on the mother's lap and while he was at a feeding table four feet away from her. In  each approach episode, the stranger systematically varied his behavior, moving from sitting silently across the room to picking up the infant. Results were analyzed and discussed in terms of differences between stranger episodes, consistency across stranger episodes, universality of fear of strangers, relationship between mothers' reports and direct observations, age trends, and stranger fear as a useful variable in developmental research.

A theoretical discussion of the capacity of children to mourn is included. Am empirical assessment of the therapy suggests that immediate ventilative help at a time of great stress was provided, but that there was little effect on the children's capacity to sustain prolonged mourning processes.

Experiment 1 examined the sequence of the ability to discriminate relative numerical magnitude, numerical equivalence, Arabic numerals, absolute size of a set, and numeration, with 90 children, aged 3 1/2 to 5 1/2. Quantity and numeral discriminations and the magnitude concept were significantly easier to learn than numeration, but the equivalence concept was not easier than numeration. Experiment 2 was designed to determine if the lack of familiarity with numerical symbols accounted for children's failure in the numeration task. The subjects, 63 children aged 3 1/2 to 4 years, 11 months were trained to  associate either geometric shapes, realistic pictures, or numerals with sets of objects. Both the realistic figures and the geometric shapes were significantly more difficult to associate with the appropriate numerical set. Experiment 3 compared performance on numeration tasks with linear homogeneous, non-linear homogeneous, or linear heterogeneous sets, using 90 children, aged 4 - 5 1/2. Numeration was significantly more difficult with heterogeneous stimuli than with the other stimulus arrays. (Author/ST)",

Thirty five five-year-olds attended the program three hours a day, five days a week, for six weeks. The Vanguard Instructional Model used involved contingency management, individualized instructional materials and the extensive use of student tutors as primary instructional agents. The Vanguard program was divided into task areas, during which children worked on prepared learning programs, and recreational or reinforcer areas (RE) which motivated students since students could go to a recreational area after completing a period of work. Diagnostic tests were used to assess the level of achievement that the students had attained upon entering the program. Evaluation of progress  consisted of a built-in, pretest and post test system for each stage of the learning process. A child had to achieve 80% mastery of each stage before he could advance to a higher level task. The Metropolitan Reading Readiness Test (MRRT) was also administered to each subject before and after the program. Results indicated that mean scores on alternate forms of the MRRT rose 15.13 percentile points and that student attendance averaged 90% on any given day of the program. Also, it was found that back-up rewards could be deferred for as long as two days; rotating the students through task and RE areas aided efficiency, and co-ordinating learning task and RE activity facilitated learning.

The desirability of school integration is emphasized, with heterogeneous class groups based on sex, class, race, ethnicity, achievements, and adjustment suggested, Special school services to meet the dental, nutritional, medical, social, and emotional needs of children are encouraged. The importance of adequate funding for educational  tools and supplies, and for the hiring of auxiliary assistants to release teachers from non-professional duties is discussed. Expanded cooperation between public school and local universities in staff training is proposed. Also noted are the importance of democratic staff involvement in decision-making policy, and the need for research by teachers and outside evaluative agencies. Finally, the cost of implementation of these guidelines is estimated at $450-600 per child, per year. It is argued that improved education will reduce the need for expensive corrective programs.

Subsequent measures were gathered by individual case studies in homes, with children and examiners matched by race. Tests used were the Preschool Attainment Record, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Results of data analysis suggest that readiness considered as cognitive maturity has two contradictory aspects: (1) it is demonstrably influenced by identifiable elements in the preschool years, (2) the degree of influence exerted by  identified influences is less than that exerted by unidentified influences. To some extent, all three predictor domains: child, maternal, and environmental data, have a role in shaping readiness. Social class appears to have the greatest influence. (ST)",

Subjects were 623 elementary and junior high school students from small towns in Northwestern Ohio. The children provided experimenters with riddles and each riddle was scrutinized for possible inclusion in the following categories: (1) pre-riddle, (2) implicit reclassifications, (3) riddle parodies, (4) non-criterial relationships, (5) explicit reclassifications, (6) non-criterial classifications, and (7) multiple classifications. A riddle was defined as a puzzling question with an answer made arbitrary because the subject was expecting to react to meaning A but was given meaning B, and systematic because meaning A and B shared another semantic relationship. Results of the  study indicate that riddles typify: (1) the preoperational period, (1st-2nd grade), (2) the two dimensional (3rd-4th grade), and (3) the focus on behavioral expectancies (5th and up). The riddle can be seen as a working model of the child-adult relationship of oral interrogation, ambiguity and humiliation. (ST)",

Another type of involvement in which parents were paid employees in Head Start programs was also studied. This report gives a summary of the project's methods and results, and includes the statistical data gathered from the 20 Head Start centers studied. In general, results are supportive of high parent participation in both roles in relationship to all dependent variable areas. Results also indicate that  extensive parent involvement in Head Start centers appears to be related to the degree of involvement parents had in recognizing, planning and implementing improvements in the centers.

During the fall of 1969 and the spring of 1970, questionnaires were given to a random sample of 9,065 adult migrant workers in Florida counties with significant migrant activity. In Dade County, 643 Spanish speaking workers were interviewed along with supervisors and officials of state and local agricultural and migrant agencies. This paper divides the general agricultural scene in Dade County into 3 groups: (1) migrant workers, (2) growers and farmers, and (3) supervisors or intermediaties between the growers and migrant workers. Some differences between Puerto Rican and Mexican American  migrants are pointed out and analyzed. An overall picture of local agriculture from the growers' and farmers' viewpoint is given. Major ideas are (1) Puerto Rican migrants are numerically fading from south Dade's agricultural scene and (2) patron-client relationships are markedly absent among migrant workers and work supervisors.

The aim was to develop French education and to promote French culture for these secondary students. Subject areas were psychology, sociology, and comparative religion. Sixty-one students in grades 10, 11, and 12 from 5 school divisions in Manitoba participated. The seminars were conducted on Saturdays from 10:00 a.m. till noon. The participants evaluated the seminars by (1) writing their reactions to the first sessions and (2) completing an evaluation questionnaire after the ninth session. Parents were also given an evaluation questionnaire. The overall student reaction was extremely positive and parents were satisfied. Some of the  recommendations were: more dialogue should be included; the seminars should be extended to 1:30 p.m.; local administrations should participate more actively in diffusing information to students; and the project should be continued.

Findings from the first objective showed: average age of household was 46 years, average education 9 years, employed in agriculture, family size of 6 persons, average family income $2,300, poor housing and facilities, and social isolation. The second objective showed that 14 characteristics of the Culture of Poverty concept were not distributed homogeneously. The significant characteristics of the 3 poverty types were education,  occupation, unemployment, mobility, status, anomie, isolation, organization participation, family stability, and attitudes toward education. It was noted that the following areas should be considered in research and program planning: retraining, median age, residence, mass media, organizational participation, isolation, health, and family size.

Investigating the stability and reciprocal linkage of 2 status projection variables in a subset of a Southern Youth Study, the dynamics of educational and occupational aspirations and expectations in a 3-wave, rural youth panel are analyzed using the Heise 2-variable path analytic technique.

Findings include: mean aspiration measures at each of the 3 waves were consistently larger than the expectation measures; prior levels of  projections yielded a moderate level of predictions for subsequent measures; cross-lagged effects indicated that occupational decision-making occurred primarily after high school, and that educational decision-making occurred during high school.

Data were collected through questionnaires sent to leaders and decision-makers interviewed during the first phase of this study. The data were analyzed for age, length of residence in the county, educational attainment occupation, social participation, communications, leisure time use, community orientation, military service, flexibility, and political orientation. A profile of the &quot;typical&quot; Gaston County leader was presented. It was noted that since  this leader was probably in a managerial role, leadership is not as tied to family status as it would be in an agrarian society. A major conclusion was that in the future, the Extension staff will probably become more involved in the organization, development, and maintenance of various problem centered groups and less involved in direct service.

A systematic random sample of 362 homemakers from an Anglo-Saxon Protestant community and a French Catholic community was used. Communities were selected for being representative of a distinct subculture; a trade center for a surrounding farming area; and with a population between 4,000 and 8,000. Seventy-one statements related to attitudes about food, its selection, preparation, and service were developed to theoretically fall into the following indexes: propensity to change, convenience, frugality, concern for health, concern for social status, and sociability aspects. Religious  locality, race, locality by race, age, age by race, education, and family income were used as independent variables. Some of the findings were: (1) homemakers in the Protestant community scored higher on the quality of product and concern for social status indexes; (2) women under 45 scored higher on the convenience index; and (3) increasing educational levels were positively associated with the concern for health, quality of product, and sociability indexes.

A stratified random sample of 301 full-time, undergraduate, unmarried Mexican Americans at UTEP during 1970-71 was used. The sample was subdivided into 16 homogeneous groups according to age, sex, year of school, and other factors within the Mexican American and the Anglo population. The Sociolinguistic Background Questionnaire and the College and University Environment Scales (CUES) were administered. The CUES consisted of the following: practicality, propriety,  community, awareness, and scholarship. A sub-sample of 30 students was used to measure the linguistic portion of the study. Some of the findings were: (1) performance was in general lower in Spanish than in English; (2) as socioeconomic status increased, so did English skill; (3) attitudes toward the desirability of English were correlated with school performance; and (4) skill in written English was positively related to academic performance.

Some language arts activities for the out-of-doors and the classroom are listed in this paper. Activities overlap from one area  to another. (NQ)",

Phase I (1971) discussed urban Indian experiences and trends; compared differences and highlighted issues of Indian urbanization. Phase II focused entirely on the urban Indian community. The thrust was aimed at determining the major topics and themes of importance in urban Indian life. Data was gathered primarily by interviewing. Over the 3 months of Phase II, 40 people were interviewed, including numerous organizations, agencies, and departments within the city and state government. Findings indicated that the state employment office does not have anyone to work directly with Indians. Statistics on Indians living in Metropolitan  Phoenix were few. Some 7,000 Indians were arrested annually for charges such as drunk and disorderly, driving while intoxicated, and drinking under age. Other findings covered education, health, housing, and welfare. Six major recommendations were made, such as developing further social service programs in relationship with the existing Indian Center. (FF)",

The models used were the continuous-time Markov chain model, the discrete-time Markov chain, and the Poisson distribution. The sample of 635 students responded to questionnaires from 1966 to 1969 as part of an ongoing research on rural industrialization in northern Illinois. The students were drawn from both the experimental and the control area of the study and were grouped as cohorts based on the year of graduation. Educational aspirations over time were treated as separate variables and were cross-tabulated. After the parameter values for each model were computed, data were tested for fit to the model. It was found that the data fit the  discrete-time Markov model. The general pattern analysis carried out prior to the model test appeared to coincide with the actual data analysis. (PS)",

The study was conducted in 4 high schools in Georgia. Treatment preparation for the experiment consisted of the development of 2 versions of a unit entitled &quot;Education for American Indians&quot;--a book of readings and an expository essay. The upper secondary students who served as subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of the treatment materials within each class in each school. All were given the word meaning section of the Iowa Silent Reading Test to determine relative reading ability level. The study lasted from 10-17 days in each  school. There were originally 169 students in the study but 61 dropped. The type of statistical analysis used was a completely randomized multivariate analysis of variance. All materials and tests were pilot tested at Greene County High School in Greensboro, Georgia. The main finding did not indicate a statistically significant superiority for either treatment across ability groups. Upper ability students performed better using self-instructional expository materials than any other combination of treatment and ability groups. Future research suggestions included using a larger, more representative sample. (FF)",

Its major aim is to make the student aware of what is happening around him as well as being aware of what he is doing to his own surroundings. A three-stage program was utilized consisting of a cooperative learning project aided by an innovative seating arrangement, a study of peoples in other societies, and a \"closed week\" in the classroom. Each phase is described, with major emphasis on the closed week, designed to simulate Spaceship Earth. A timetable for the first through fifth days of this experiment is compiled together with supplies and equipment available in the classroom, and an explanation of the follow-up activities and evaluation.

An environmental encounter approach is adopted, focusing all of one's senses on the particular environment he is experiencing at the moment, analyzing how he perceives it and how he feels about it. The ideas presented are examples of incorporating environmental learnings into the treatment of subject matter already being dealt with. Several encounters are briefly annotated for use in developing perception of self. For learning about the world through the use of the senses and as an aid in achieving the goal of self-perception, three units from TV series are also summarized.  Activities in many curriculum areas that could be used to help develop and deepen the children's environmental perception are explained. These activities make particular use of cameras and environmental encounters. Some of the problems characteristic to this educational approach are related together with recommendations ragarding follow-up programs. Appended material includes examples of students' original poems. (BL)",

Competencies were measured but no attempt was made to equate the presence of the competencies with effective teaching. The assumption was made that these competencies are part of the larger domain of effective teaching. Data were obtained from a population of pre-service elementary teachers enrolled in an undergraduate course in elementary science education. Most had completed their science courses and many their teacher education courses. Data included material from student academic records, interviews, and use of Welch Science Process Inventory (Form D). Significant correlations were noted between laboratory  skills, science process competencies and the understanding of science processes, with the university science grade averages; between set induction competency and the pre-service teacher's attitude toward science, and between the understanding of the science process and the college science grade average and attitude toward science.

        "description":"The study examined relationships between personal characteristics and achievement in and attitude toward an audio-tutorial (A-T) biology program. The central question of the investigation was: Is there a different profile for (1) high and low achievers, (2) students with positive and negative attitudes toward the instructional method, and (3) successful and unsuccessful students? The population studied consisted of 119 students in a one-year A-T biology program at Elizabethtown College, Pennsylvania. Eighteen variables were measured using standardized indices: CEEB scores, Nelson Biology Test, Moore's Scientific Attitude Inventory, and the Guilford Zimmerman Temperament Survey (GZTS), plus an attitude questionnaire developed for the study. Based upon an analysis of the results it  was concluded that: (1) since the abilities, attitudes and personalities of the majority of students were compatible with A-T instruction, the approach provided a desirable alternative to large group instruction in biology; (2) personality factors on the GZTS were poor predictors of achievement and attitudes toward science and A-T instruction; and (3) the discriminant technqiue was better suited for predicting membership in high or low groups than was regression analysis. The techniques used in this study might provide a means of identifying students for whom the A-T method is an inappropriate instructional atlernative. (JR)",

Each teacher was requested to present a lesson at the front of the classroom. About 20 minutes of one of their classes were videotaped. Two 5-minute segments (episodes) and one 15-second segment of teacher behaviors were edited and extracted. Coding symbols were used to identify and categorize individual behaviors by different observers, and interobserver agreement coefficients were computed by Scott's method. For each behavior, data on frequency and duration of occurrence were collected. A total of 879 students in a remote community was asked to react to five episodes, and 395 students, in addition, reacted to brief tapes.  A semantic different scale was used to record responses, and teacher characteristics were described by students. Response means were computed for boys, girls, and boys and girls combined. Computer analyses showed that nonverbal behaviors measured in terms of duration are good predictors of student affective responses. Students preferred some kinds of teacher behaviors. Boys and girls responded differently to teachers. Students tended to make their affective judgments in the absence of consciously perceived awareness. Included in the appendix are categories of teacher nonverbal behaviors. (CC)",

One hundred eighty-four teachers were selected from a large geographical area, having widely differing backgrounds and varying education and/or experience with SCIS programs. The Predicted Role Measure (PRM), consisting of a color, motion picture sound film, was used, and teachers were asked to indicate on a response pamphlet their degree of agreement with six possible and common teaching behaviors - all independent of one another. The participants included teachers with no SCIS experience, teachers with no SCIS experience but beginning SCIS cooperative college school science training programs, and teachers completing such  programs. The longitudinal study allowed the study of 45 teachers who had taught the SCIS program with training and without for one or two years. General results showed: (1) selection for a training program was not associated with a particular score on the PRM; (2) significant differences were found with post-instructed members when compared with pre-instructed members; (3) no significant differences were found in PRM scores between post-instruction teachers and those who had at least one year teaching experience with SCIS; and (4) significant differences were noted in comparing teachers who had activity-centered classrooms with those of book-centered classrooms.

Each member studied a four hour, multi-media, self-instructional program called \"Teaching for Mastery (TFM)\" with objectives, practice problems, feedback on exercises, self-tests, and answers all given. A 24-item attitude measure, designed to assess teacher attitudes toward tests, grades, and diagnostic teaching, was taken by the members before and after studying TFM. The class members, concurrently employes as teachers, implemented mastery teaching in either a science or mathematics class. The results from five teachers were analyzed, using a posttest-only control group design. Each of the five  teachers split their class to form the experimental and control groups. Data analyses showed the presence of a highly significant difference between the pretest and posttest attitude measures. Attitudes of all class members were improved by TFM study. Pupil posttest results favored the mastery-teaching experimental group for each teacher. Teachers were able to produce higher achievement when using skills. (CC)",

Four task groups, 30 subjects (Ss) each, were formed by randomly assigning four task arrangements to Ss in answering a genetics problem. The task varied in number of information items (hints) presented, either four or eight, and amount of \"learning structure\" used. The structure was made different by instructing Ss to read either in an arbitrary order or mandatory order. To reduce errors, a researcher-constructed machine was used to present the problem and hints and record students' responses and verbal expressions. Two revised efficiency formulas,  respectively equivalent to Snyder's two original formulas, were introduced. Data about the four groups were analyzed to compare the revised and original formulas, and pooled results were used to study students' performance. The revised formula was proved equivalent to Snyder's expression for transaction mean needed by a teacher-student dyad to solve a problem. Both hint and learning structure had no effect on Ss performance. Extension of the present study was recommended. (CC)",

Science teaching is considered as occurring on three levels: the fact level, the concepts-process level, and the values level. The fact level was often stressed prior to the 1960s, the concepts-process level received added attention during the 1960s, and the values level will gain increasing importance in science teaching during the 1970s. Value education in the sciences must be built on the sound understanding of science concepts and processes. It will require innovative strategies, a new perspective on science education, and different roles for teachers. A number of strategies, including simultations, role  playing, sensitivity modules, values continuums, and the use of attitudinal surveys are described. Appropriate teacher behaviors in the classroom (e.g., asking evaluative questions and promoting a classroom climate conducive to value exploration) are also examined. Science education must make the exploration of value systems paramount in order to produce a scientifically literate and aware citizenry capable of making proper decisions on such questions as population control, radioactive fallout, pesticide usage, and industrial effluencts.

        "description":"Many elementary classroom teachers must overcome the following problems in order to teach science effectively: (1) a lack of background in scientific concepts and general information; (2) a scarcity of science equipment and supplies on hand or insufficient funds to purchase them; (3) little basic knowledge of the skills, processes and attitudes that differentiate science as a body of knowledge from science as a way of finding out things. This paper suggests a teaching technique for overcoming these problems. A commonplace topic is chosen (such as footwear), and using student suggestions, a number of possible activities are compiled. A flow chart is provided outlining many suggested student activities relating to footwear. The \"science\" occurs in the methods devised by the  children to investigate their suggestions. Small groups of children thoroughly plan how they will carry out their investigation, discuss their proposal with the teacher, and then collect their data. Results are presented to the class by a variety of means such as transparencies, the blackboard, and charts, and a class discussion and analysis should follow. Often these discussions lead to the need for a formal lesson presented by the teacher, and suggest new interesting topics and avenues of investigation to the students. (JR)",

It is an individualized curriculum utilizing a multi-sensory systems approach, and is presently taught by a team of three teachers and one para-professional to 458 general biology students and 36 advanced biology students. Each student must complete 24 units; however, students work at their own optimum rate, and credit for the course is issued on the basis of units completed rather than on the traditional time basis. At the conclusion of each unit, students participate in a seminar and are tested on the material. All laboratories, audio-visual presentations, and tests are given concurrently and continuously throughout the class period. After completing eight fundamental units, students may  choose any 16 of 36 alternative units to complete the course requirement. This freedom of choice enables students to select material according to their particular interests and abilities, and allows for more complete individualization of the curriculum. (JR)",

        "description":"Reported is a study on effects of early classroom teaching experience upon the attitudes and performance of teacher candidates from a student group primarily composed of science majors or minors. The subjects were paired mainly on their choice of a credential or noncredential program. One of each pair was randomly assigned to the experimental group and the other to the control group. An attitude inventory was given to both groups as a pretest and posttest. After taking the pretest, the experimental students were individually placed in the grade level and science area of their choice and spent a minimum of 3 hours per week in classroom for 12 weeks. Both elementary and secondary classes were involved in the study. The classroom assignment was observation, tutoring, small group  teaching, developing and teaching one or two complete lectures or labs, and aiding master teachers. The experimental group also discussed their attitudes toward teaching career and received an evaluation by master teachers. The overall attitude changes were found to be statistically significant. The career decision and attitude development were independent of age, sex, class level, or grade point average. A realistic view of teaching was obtained by the experimental group. (CC)",

The study was done to assess the correlation of the two variables, science knowledge and science attitude of third year preservice elementary teachers. The population for this study was 92 third year elementary education majors enrolled in a science education course. The subjects had completed at least four university science courses. The Science From Concepts Achievement Test (SFCAT) was modified for use in assessing the science achievement level  of the preservice teachers and the Science Attitude Scale for Preservice Elementary Teachers was used to measure the science attitude. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was used to establish the relationship of the two variables. The correlation was low. The author stated that this study weakens the assumption that a teacher's cognition level in science affects his attitude toward the subject. He suggests that teacher educators should explore other variables in addition to that of science knowledge as a means of improving the attitude of preservice teachers toward science. (EB)",

An attempt is made to describe how perceptions, values, and feelings affect him and how he attempts to protect or reveal himself. In relation to his contact with students, he concludes that the classroom is, before anything else, a place where human beings come together to learn about themselves and the world they live in. If it is to accomplish these purposes, then it must be something more than a microcosm of life - a setting supportive of the development of humanness - an environment of emotional involvement where both student and teacher risk the exposure of real feelings  and values in a mutual effort to enhance the quality of human interaction.

The New Elementary Program (NEP), now renamed Childhood Education Program (CEP), consists of a Seminar, considered the heart of the program, Field Experience, Substantive Panel which is built around the learning activities which students are to complete, and Evaluation. The Science Education component sets a requirement of six learning activities in  science. Included are: (1) attendance at Science Orientation Sessions and demonstrate competence in science content, (2) learn to use the Science Teacher Observation Rating Form (STORF) and demonstrate competence observing two taped situations, (3) learn about such programs as AAAS, ESS, SCIS, and perform activities from these, (4) develop and plan materials, (5) carry out laboratory investigations in the various sciences, and (6) demonstrate an understanding of the \"Processes of Science.\" The program is considered much stronger than the traditional program.

It is pointed out that while much is known about the toxicity of airborne lead at high concentrations, there is disagreement concerning the biochemical effects at the lower concentrations found in the atmosphere over urban areas and on sensitive  groups in the population. Studies have shown, however, the deposition of lead in the body is related to the intake by inhalation of airborne lead and the ingestion of lead in foods, beverages, and water. While there is not a consensus on the health consequences of the lead deposited in the body, it is widely believed that an increase is undesirable.

Three forms of an inventory were developed to test knowledge of specific facts and general concepts of the environment, as well as attitudes about certain aspects of the environment. The inventories were administered to 10,264 students in 199 schoolslocated in 11 states of the mid-west and far-west. Results indicated that males scored significantly higher than females on items requiring knowledge of facts, but not on items dealing with general environmental concepts. Twelfth grade students scored significantly higher than tenth grade students on the  environmental concept items, but not on the items requiring knowledge of environmental facts. In regard to attitudes, differences were found based on sex and grade level. The size of the community and the state of residence were found to be positively related to what was considered to be the major environmental concern in the community. Californian respondents selected air pollution, those in Wisconsin were more concerned with water pollution, and in Hawaii land use was considered to be of greatest importance. (JR)",

Performance objectives facilitate: (1) directions for the learning context, (2) selecting learning opportunities, (3) fitting the learning context to the learner, and (4) assessing success. They force the teacher to be clearer and more specific in intentional outcomes which result in the teacher having a greater insight into the total tasks, and they help both the teacher and student to spot trivia in the learning context. Performance objectives provide clear goals and help to focus on the consequences or matter of the learning context rather than on the manner. Perhaps their greatest impact is in helping to fit  the learning context to the individual child. Personalizing learning means greater freedom for the child to decide pace, style and substance of his learning. With performance objectives, a greater clarity and mutual understanding about the intent of the learning context between the teacher and the student is possible. In assessing student success performance objectives are also used, since judgment is based upon observable behavior. (JR)",

A flow chart provides an overview of the curriculum design, and brief notes are given to clarify the procedures to be taken at each stage on the chart. Programs designed in this manner should fit into a larger framework of science offerings carefully planned for grades K-14, and should contribute to the principal purpose of science education by developing scientific literacy in future citizens. Six components basic to scientific literacy are listed. In designing a science curriculum, it is suggested that the five approaches outlined by the Ontario Ministry of Education should be considered. These approaches provide structure to the course according to: (1) the  discipline, (2) conceptual schemes, (3) domains, (4) themes, and (5) processes of science. Examples of the conceptual schemes approach, the domain approach, and the theme approach are discussed in some detail, and in each case flow charts are provided to illustrate the procedural steps in structuring a science unit.

The author argues that the traditional evidence supporting evolution is circumstantial in nature, whereas a major prediction from the creation model (that gaps exist between distinct kinds of living animals and plants) is confirmed by conclusive evidence. Evolution, like creation, is a faith and not open to scientific investigation. Yet evolution is taught as a dogma in the public schools as evidenced by: (1) indoctrination in the belief of spontaneous generation, (2) indoctrination in the belief in transitional forms between different kinds of organisms, and (3) indoctrination in the belief in mutations as the raw material of  evolutionary change. It is suggested that science teachers admit that there are sound scientific and pedagogical reasons why both the evolution model and the creation model should be taught, as objectively as possible, whenever teachers and students are discussing origins.

Activities were developed for each concept, classifying them into learning level (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, or evaluation) and  grade level (K-3, 4-6, or 10-12). They cover the broad areas of economics and culture, ecology, and management.

        "description":"This study investigated graduate students' perceptions of ideal and actual instructor behavior, the match between ideal and actual behavior, and relations of these variables to student and course characteristics. A review of over 300 psychological and educational articles identified four basic dimensions of leader and teacher behavior: Consideration, Interaction Facilitation, Motivation, and Work Facilitation. These were used in constructing the Instructor Behavior Description Questionnaire (IBDQ), which was administered to 137 graduate students in diverse classes. Instructors responded to a questionnaire describing the degree of student involvement and responsibility in their classes. Seven weeks later, student descriptions of ideal and actual instructor behavior were collected  together with responses to six course assessment items. It was concluded that the four dimensions listed above are appropriate to describe instructor behavior, and that the IBDQ is a reliable and valid instrument that can be used across different subject areas to compare instruction. Course assessment scores were highly correlated with actual instructor behavior on the Work Facilitation dimension, while satisfaction scores on the Interaction Facilitation and Consideration dimensions were significantly correlated with student involvement practices. Among student characteristics, only sex and need for dependence were correlated with descriptions of ideal instructor behavior. (Author/JR)",

All facets of each country are considered -- the land, people, history, customs, government, religion, education, festivals and holidays, art, and music. More coverage is given to China, India, and Japan because many books on these three countries have been published for children. The majority of the books listed were published in the 1960's. Selective criteria for the books focused on including readable, informative books with acceptable literary quality, authentic content, and quality illustrations and format; availability  of books in the United States; books for use in kindergarten through junior high school; and consideration of the reading level ability of children. To help those teachers who wish to expand their own knowledge of a country, a number of books including some of a textbook nature are included. The overall arrangement of the guide is by country.

        "description":"The primary objective of this study was to survey the Colorado social studies curriculum at the secondary level for its inclusion of international education content. A questionnaire including a list of 31 topics was designed to determine which topics would be covered, the relative scope of coverage, frequency of treatment, and time allotted to various international topics. In the spring of 1970, the questionnaire was mailed to 1276 social studies teachers, 25% of whom returned the questionnaire. Respondents indicated the courses in which they taught each topic the most and least, and how much time was devoted to each. Data indicated that 80% of the respondents covered eight topics in at least one of the courses they taught. The frequently taught topics were more traditional, of a  general nature, somewhat ethnocentric and well established in the social studies curriculum. Only half of the teachers said they covered the least frequently discussed topics which were more theoretical and newer topics. History courses were most frequently mentioned as those in which international material was presented. Limitations of the study are the applicability of the findings at the state level to the national level and stated weaknesses of the mail survey. Recommendations emphasize the need to recognize the significance of history courses as transmitters of international education information; to internationalize the history courses; and to focus on and to teach in depth topics less frequently taught.

Emphasis is placed on how access to school and school attainments are related to social background. Chapter 1 is an attempt to clarify what is meant by equality of educational opportunity. Three different stages in the development of this concept are distinguished and certain inherent incompatibilities are brought out. Chapter 2 sets out to show that the concept of ability has to be conceived of in a sociological and not in an individual -psychological context. In a comprehensive review of the research on the reserves of talent conducted  in Europe and the United States, Sweden is presented as an illustrative case of how the methodology in this particular area of study has developed. Chapter 4 demonstrates how various, mainly structural, features of the formal educational system affect educational opportunity. The author makes recommendations implicit in the findings reviewed and briefly discusses strategies by which they might be implemented. (Author/SHM)",

Although designed primarily for use by social studies classes, Dig was expanded by Glen Ellyn teachers to include language arts, mathematics, and science. The objectives of the one-month unit were to: 1) teach techniques and procedures of archaeologists; 2) introduce students to the work of archaeologists in Illinois; 3) encourage creativity in the development of cultures; 4) encourage cooperation in working with others; and, 5) meet people in different fields connected with archaeology. The teaching team wrote their own units for each of the four content areas. The unit began with a one-week introduction to each of the four phases of culture. The second week centered on several outside resources. The 133  students were then divided into four groups, each representing a different culture. Each group decided on themes for their culture and developed certain cultural universals. They created artifacts to fit these universals. Students finished their artifacts and prepared the burial pits during the third week. Each team developed and buried the artifacts of their own culture and excavated those of a different culture. The first days of the final week were spent analyzing the artifacts and forming hypotheses about the culture they represented. This was followed by a session in which each group presented the analysis of the culture it had excavated to the team that created the culture. The dig experience was concluded with field trips and a museum open house. Only $40 was spent on the project.  (JLB)",

It focuses on concepts and values from the social sciences, history, the arts, and a variety of brief-value systems. Individualized instruction provides a framework for participation in which students are offered a wide range of learning experiences in a variety of settings. Such experiences include field projects and trips, self-teaching packets, audio-tutorial and audio-visual resources, debates, simulation games, role-playing, problem-solving, one-to-one discussions, and independent study. ISS is a three-year social studies curriculum with two years required for graduation. The third year consists of electives, built on the content and methods of the first two years. The main  focus of the first year's program is on enabling students to recognize and evaluate the influences and institutions that help shape individual personalities. The second year's program begins with emphasis on the nation-state and the involvement of the student as a citizen with the processes of political institutions, and proceeds to the consideration of man and his role in the world. Personnel resources for the program involve the faculty, citizens, experts from the community, and the school's audio-visual coordinator. Staff responsibility for ISS is taken by 9 teachers, 3 paraprofessionals, 2 aides, 3 interns, and 5 student teachers. The entire team is involved in the planning process. Student evaluation may take the form of special projects, oral evaluation, objective tests or essay  tests. (JLB)",

Each semester 16 seniors from four high schools in Salinas work in community agencies and receive credit for both government and work experience. The major objective of the program is to provide students with personal experience with governmental agencies so they might develop a more positive attitude toward state and local government. To achieve this, the project organizer. Robert Bilek, asked each agency participating in the program to indicate the type of process they would like interns to experience. Initially, there was difficulty in getting agencies to participate in the program. After the first semester; however, agencies who had heard about  the program began to call to volunteer their services. The participation of 25 agencies makes it possible for students to alternate between about 6 agencies in one semester. There are no grade requirements for the program, but students do need parental approval to participate and must furnish their ouw transportation Because students receive academic credit, Bilek must visit them on the job and talk with their supervisors. Students are also asked to keep anecdotal records of their experienes. which are taken into account when assigning grades. Bilek notes that the cost for the program is minimal; only his time is necessary to coordinate the program. (JLB)",

The social studies textbook is described as a tool to be used in conjunction with other supplementary instructional materials, such as audio-visual materials, reference books, periodicals, and lectures. Before study begins, teachers are encouraged to have students examine the textbook to thoroughly acquaint them with its organization and, moreover, prepare them with lifelong skills in the use of books applicable to all materials. Considerable focus is upon the functions of the textbook: to provide course organization, to supply basic content, and to furnish common learning materials. Other suggestions are given on textbook selection,  adaptation of textbooks to the abilities of the readers and how to use the textbook to teach the techniques of intensive reading.

The need and nature of discussion as a necessary force in the democratic way of life is stressed. General information is provided on how discussion aids the individual; the purposes of discussion; seating arrangement of participants; size of groups; and other factors contributing to successful discussion groups. Five steps of the thought process analyzed by John Dewey -- recognition of the problem; location, definition, and analysis of the problem; solutions; consideration of solutions; and verification -- are discussed. In addition, common pitfalls are examined such as minority domination, keeping on the subject, and  lagging discussion. Because variations exist within the group structure a variety of techniques are included to ensure cooperative group discussion along with a checklist which can be used as a guide before discussion and afterwards as a means of self-evaluation. The teacher's responsibilities and an evaluative checklist toward good group discussion conclude the guide. (SJM)",

The chapter  concludes with a review of possible changes in U.S. educational policies, structures, and organization. Chapter V endeavors to examine the question of whether, and if so, how, the USOE can make better use of the Educational Policy Research Centers at the Stanford and Syracuse research institutes.

The central purpose of this study is to identify a set of processes that may be used to plan instruction in the social studies. A review of processes that should be emphasized in instructional planning includes a summary of processes in selected professional publications that deal with inquiry, thinking, and cognitive activities and a summary of processes in social studies textbooks and accompanying teacher's manuals. A cohesive set of processes is identified and teaching strategies and related techniques for each of the processes proposed  for instructional planning are described. The investigator makes a critical assessment of strengths and weaknesses of the proposed set of processes. Ways in which the processes may be used to improve instructional planning and to analyze materials are also considered. (Author/SHM)",

An experimental framework for syllabus construction based first on the conceptual structure of history and second, on a taxonomy of educational objectives was abandoned in favor of a framework founded on &quot;the uses of history for the adolescents.&quot; For example, units within the framework correspond to the specific uses of history (explain the present) and bear general relation to some of the other uses, (understand human development). Thus greater variety of content and ways of looking at history with an emphasis on inquiry in depth and the development of investigative  skills were identified as educational objectives to be pursued in the implementation of the project. Since examinations were regarded by the teachers as of paramount priority, the Project suggested an examination program based on various methods of assessment which test historical skills as well as historical knowledge. The recommendations of the council will be carried out (September 1973) in trial schools. Teaching materials will be produced and tested. Case studies of the individual schools will operate as the mode of evaluation of the Program. (JRB)",

The basic assumption of this paper is that the several existing approaches to learning and development can account for a significant portion of political learning. A selective picture of concepts and empirical knowledge about the four processes that jointly and simultaneously account for learning in the natural situations in which human individuals grow and develop are presented: 1) classical conditioning; 2) reinforcement; 3) modeling; and 4) cognitive assimilation and accommodation. The four processes are explained separately and linked to the aspects of political learning each serves to explain, while trying to keep salient the fundamental premise of the  conception that the four processes are not separate but completely intertwined. Finally, the paper offers the concept of progressive differentiation as a fruitful way of viewing the process of political development, that is, political learning across the life-span. (Author)",

The problem facing educational policy-makers who desire the further educational achievement in a way dictated by explicit normative theories spelling out purposes and empirical research is explored. Alternative explanations for null educational research findings on student achievement are discussed and intervention strategies associated with each explanation are noted. It is concluded  that the most salient alternatives in social education fall largely into the same general approach to problem-solving and that the significantly different social action alternatives require a complex set of decisions regarding implementation and potential effects on achievement.

        "description":"During the spring of 1972 training workshops for 88 elementary and secondary teachers of the Great Neck Public Schools held to examine four hypotheses: 1) workshops in training teachers to observe classroom behavior would significantly increase these same teachers' positive classroom interactive behaviors consisting of teacher, pupil-pupil, teacher-pupil, and total behavior; 2) secondary teachers would show significantly more gain than elementary school teachers; 3) as the time between training sessions and post-observations increased, the total positive classroom behaviors would also increase; 4) teachers would continue to independently train themselves after the conclusions of the workshop. Pre-training and post-training observations were made, and a questionnaire distributed.  Findings supported hypotheses one and two. Other findings are that secondary teachers caught up to the elementary teachers as a result of the training, and that teachers will not independently train themselves. A questionnaire revealed that teachers considered classroom visitations as the most useful aspect and films as the least useful aspect of the workshop; that public relations need to be improved; and that the workshop was better than other typical workshops and should be continued with a number of changes.

This report provides background information, descriptive and objective outside evaluative data for the school, the central purpose of which is to foster growth in interpersonal communication and to build community involvement. During the first year 118 courses were offered in the curriculum which included 43 community internships. Over sixty community people were involved in teaching programs focusing on student involvement. Tutorial group programs were organized so that students could plan their education and develop interpersonal relationships.  In a comparison with other high school parents and students, City School students were found to be equally creative, more open, and more satisfied with their school. Achievement levels were equal. Other evaluative findings show that there were several problematic issues facing the school; out of 105 students 6 graduated early, 11 returned to their previous schools, and 5 dropped out of school completely; elementary teachers in other programs were pleased with their relationship to City School; and the school cost less than other public high schools during the first semester.

Major objectives of the project are to provide an inter-disciplinary, objective approach to the study of the American heritage, and to incorporate methods and procedures in the high school program to provide a more individualized approach to the learning process. Instruments and methods with which to evaluate objectives included the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal (CTA); pre-post tests and questionnaires; random samples of students; subjective evaluations of teachers and students; and outside observer reports. The instruments measured the extent to which students: 1) discussed and analyzed  the interrelationship of the elements that make up a culture; 2) demonstrated an appreciation of the multi-disciplinary approach to human problems; and 3) recognized the reciprocal relationship between the humanities and the social sciences in the context of a culture; and other objectives. The extensive evaluation section, based on how well each objective was fulfilled, is stated in positive and negative terms. For example, although objective 1 (above) was effectively achieved when measured by comparative random samples of students by units, findings from CTA pre-post testings were shown to be statistically significant in a negative direction.

Emphasis is upon describing positive activities which foster process skills such as creative thinking, problem-solving, and critical thinking but at the same time promote active involvement, cooperation, communication, and self-awareness. Activities, arranged topically, are built around: establishing rules and procedures; community building; brainstorming; summarizing, and drawing inferences; positive focus;  achievement motivation; feedback; identifying concerns; developing open communication; identity; interpersonal relationships; non-verbal and sensory awareness; and teaching content.

The optional patterns of study available to social studies education majors are described. In the Foundations Component traditional courses are organized into five-week, highly specific courses. This modularization encourages students to by-pass their areas of strength and to concentrate on their weaknesses. The  model for the Methods Component is designed to allow students who possess the basic skills to demonstrate their proficiency with little or no additional work.

What are its limits? How does law work? Four teaching modules, each of which deals with a basic concept of the legal system, are included. The core of each module is contained in a statement of understandings to be gained through the study. An explanation for the teacher follows the statement, providing a  background of legal knowledge and delineating the importance of each understanding. Objectives, general questions useful in reaching the understanding, and suggestions for use of visuals are listed. Classroom strategies are described and resources are noted.

This guide is divided into learning activities that will enable the student to: 1) identify the political boundaries and the surface features of the provinces and the states of the region; 2)  understand the effect of the sea on people in the Maritime Provinces, and how they depend upon it; 3) explain the effect of glaciers on the soil and ways of life on the land that was once covered by glaciers; 4) show that there is a relationship between the use of resources and the availability of transportation and growth of cities; 5) describe the use of Canadian Shield resources by man; 6) contrast the past and present in Maritime Provinces; 7) construct an overlay map showing principle towns and cities, land or seaways, and vegetation; 8) explain why political boundaries are sometimes made with consideration for geographic factors; and 9) plan a new community using skills learned in this and other LAPs.

Issues in the upcoming election center on fighting pollution, building a new school, and supporting a new highway. Certain groups in the town feel that several major problems exist. Those who want a representative on the ballot include a non-political group, groups who have a point of view on particular issues, and dissident groups. Step by step procedures lead students into three rounds (taking approximately 50 minutes) where they: 1) assume the role  of a citizen who decides to run and seek main support for the nomination; 2) obtain signatures on the petition to get their name on the ballot; and 3) actually campaign. After the game students discuss their plays (strategies, methods of operating, etc.). Materials consist of a content outline, various forms such as descriptions of job duties; petitions; instruction sheets; and others. A one page evaluation form and instruction sheet for developing simulation games are appended. (SJM)",

Diversity in philosophies suggests their generic function, which is a potent factor in the preparation and professional improvement of a teacher. A consideration of different theories of philosophy leads to the conclusion that philosophic functions are generically ongoing clarifications of cultural orientations. With such a definition in a course concerned with philosophies of education, aspirant teachers will be better prepared for their work and will be able to interpret what they do as teachers and what is being done to them by others. Obviously, no student can perform all functions possible in a  generic treatment of philosophy of education, but they will all think and experience differently. Thus, a generic assumption concerning the nature of philosophies of education would give the greatest assurance of particular student identifications with a function in education that is philosophic.

The essay by Marian Martinello (University of Florida) is a review. Martinello finds that the pamphlet lacks continuity and a unifying theme and ultimately that it provides little direct assistance in dealing with the problem of selecting content for curriculum courses. The second essay is Ronald Maertens' (Associate Superintendent, Independent School District No. 316, Coleraine, Minnesota) response to Martinello's review. He questions several of her points and suggests that it would have been better had she provided a rationale for her own view of the domain of curriculum. Judging that formal modes of inquiry would result from her view of  curriculum, Maertens suggests that judgments should be based on knowledge of the alternatives and their consequences rather than disciplined modes. Edmund Short, the editor of the original pamphlet, provides the last essay. Answering Martinello, Short writes that the reason the pamphlet does not provide immediately applicable guidance is that not all courses have the same objectives and functions. The articles in the pamphlet are, he states, devoted to the formal methods of research, not to issues to which an immediate answer is needed. (JA)",

In addition to providing a financial base for implementing programs mutually advantageous for CMTEC area public schools and the college, one of the greatest advantages of CMTEC is its unity. As a result of this unity, Council recommendations are supported by all participants; thus, change takes place much more smoothly. (JA)",

The competencies listed were identified by using a combination of four methods: polling; poaching from prepared lists; observing; and, mainly, analyzing the teaching act. The paper states that the analysis was strongly influenced by Freider's work in which six teaching functions are identified. It is indicated that to date thirty-seven clusters have been identified and grouped into three experience levels.

        "description":"Three problems have plagued the traditional methods of evaluation of student teachers: the imposition of a supervisor's philosophy on the student, semantic vagueness in a supervisor's checklist of a student's performance, and determining each student's level of achievement. Wheeling College revised its field-based secondary teacher preparation program to overcome these problems. The competencies of a master teacher were identified and became the goals of the students in the program. Each goal emphasized the student's developing his style of teaching and shaping his curriculum consistent with his philosophy and theory of learning, thus avoiding differing educational philosophies. Semantic vagueness was dealt with by identifying a progression of more demanding behaviors that  culminate in each particular goal behavior. The final problem of determining each student's level of achievement was accomplished by providing tools to document student teacher performance (audio and video tapes, clinical supervision feedback) with the responsibility for utilizing these tools resting with the student teacher.

In the chapter on batting the importance of body mechanics, grip, and body rotation to the need for power is discussed. Pitching considerations that are treated include body mechanics, common faults, stride, and speed of pitched balls. Chapter three, concerned with baseball for young Americans, concludes that competition in organized baseball programs is not detrimental to the youngster, with the possible exception of injury to the pitcher's arm. Chapter four discusses baseball strategy, concluding that presentations of research on baseball, such as this, historically are not well heeded  by baseball organizers and administrators. Chapters five and six give baseball potpourri, that is, brief discussions of other aspects of the game, such as throwing, reaction time and movement, physical demands of the game, antitrust laws, and the ball.

The paper briefly reviews research on teachers and evaluation and places the research into three thematic clusters: teaching methodology, effective climate of the classroom, and characteristics of teachers. On the basis of generalizations drawn from this research, the model suggests that the proposed evaluative data can be derived from four sources: career line data (systematic collection of data on wastage from teaching, promotions, advanced degrees, writing, and research); direct classroom observations (two  suggested systems: the Classroom Observation Record and a 14-category modification of the Flanders system and Hough variation of interaction analysis); student, peer, and supervisor ratings (for example, the Student Evaluation of Teaching developed by Heldman and Peck); and standarized measures.

None of the possible responses of a student teacher are conducive to effective learning, especially the decision to \"get by.\" This conflict can be avoided by the adoption of several measures. The supervisory team should be quite explicit with each other and the student teacher about their role ideals; overwhelming role dissension should result in a rematch of supervisors. The consequences of enacting certain roles should be made clear to the student teacher. The student teacher should then be allowed to enact these roles experimentally in a nonevaluative atmosphere and ultimately be  allowed to choose and practice the teacher role which is most congruent with himself.

The report is divided into six chapters on the following topics: factors to be taken into account in constructing a curriculum for the 1980s; the implications of changes in subject fields (specific fields that are discussed include mathematics, science, native language, foreign language, humanities and social studies, and  physical education and expressive arts); the implications of new teaching/learning methods and the systematic approach to change; implications of curriculum change for the school and the community; and the problem of evaluation. The report concludes that framing a curriculum for the 1980s cannot begin until consideration has been given to changes in society that are likely to influence schools. (JA)",

Experimental Group II, consisting of 44 elementary education majors, had no contact with pupils in the social studies area of the curriculum prior to student teaching. A control group of 18 students had no social studies instruction or student teaching experience. The groups were compared in two areas: a) knowledge regarding the techniques, strategies, and methods for teaching social studies and b) teaching proficiency in the social studies area of the curriculum during  the student teaching experience. Analysis of the data indicated that Experimental Group II made statistically significant gains over Group I in the first area of comparison. In the second area of comparison, there was no significant difference between the two groups, but Group I showed a significant gain in proficiency when tested at the end of the teaching experience.

Results of this study have implications for predicting the success of students in teacher education programs. Generally, it has been  recognized that ACT scores are reasonable predictors of success in work taken in the first 2 years of college. Results of the present study indicate that students who were more successful in courses normally taken in lower division work tended to complete the teacher preparation program successfully as measured by overall QPA and scores on the NTE. By examination of all variables included in the study, admission counselors and academic advisors can guide students into appropriate teaching areas, elementary and secondary. (Author/JA)",

In competency-based education, teaching acts are given priority over principles that guide the act. If we do no more than prepare teachers to respond to specific stimuli in predictable ways, we are producing teachers who are obsolete as soon as the stimuli change. Competency-based education is cannon fodder for the educational establishment, perpetuating technical expertise rather than educational methodology that sets the mind free to question and probe. Too often the need for acquiring information demeans the individual, and while it is possible to build the individual's assimilation of his experiences into programs of  competency-based teacher education, too often it is not done. More importantly, competency-based education is based on the assumptions that there is no controversy about what is important for teachers to know and do and that man needs to be manipulated by those in authority in order for him to do what he should. The cry for accountability coupled with the financial squeeze in teacher education institutions has caused educators to seek easy answers. Perhaps good teacher education programs can be defined by those easy devices it refused to accept. (JA)",

The study views teaching not only in the context of the classroom but also in the organizational context of the school and school district and in the sociocultural context of the community. It is an ethnographic study concerned with the interdependence of teaching behavior, beliefs about the teacher's role, and institutional settings. Specifically, it deals with the cultural processes that define and structure the role of the teacher as technician and socialization agent and with teachers' responses to such processes. The impression produced by the study is that teachers evolve responses to all levels of their occupational experience--ideological, organizational, and  interpersonal--in relative isolation. This contextual isolation is shown to exist because there is no functioning relationship between the process of teaching and the ideological and organizational framework in which teaching takes place.

Generalized social psychological measures were employed to eliminate one individual rating or perceiving another. The second study, \"Assessing a Teacher Education Program,\" assessed the needs perceived by prospective teachers. The study considered choice of vocation, quality of the teacher preparation program, student teaching experience, and suggested improvements. The final study, \"A Study of the Verbal Behavior of Creative and Less Creative English and Social Studies  Student Teachers,\" was concerned with a) differences in verbal behavior between student teachers rated creative and those rated less creative, b) differences in pupils' verbal initiative and response to these groups, c) differences in learning activities employed by the two groups, and d) differences in selected personal and professional characteristics between the two groups.

Later reports will discuss the effect of instruction on the children's movement processes and the relationship between velocity and movement process. Forty-five children from two intact kindergartens in a Madison, Wisconsin public school were randomly assigned by sex to one of two groups: an experimental group that received a movement program including 120 minutes of guided practice in the overhand throw or a control group that received no exposure to the throw. A third group, randomly selected by sex from a comparable school, received no movement experience. Ten side-view, filmed trials of each  subject's throw for force were taken before and after the 6-week period. Ball velocities for each trial were recorded simultaneously with the Roberts' velocimeter. No significant velocity differences between groups were reported, though boys throwing had significantly greater velocity than girls at both pre- and post-practice testing. One hundred twenty minutes of guided practice in the overarm throw did not significantly change the ball velocities of kindergarten children compared to two groups with no formal throwing experience.

        "description":"This report presents national estimates of the intellectual development levels of noninstitutionalized children 6-11 years of age in the United States. These estimates were determined by scores on the Vocabulary and Block Design subtest of the WISC obtained in the Health Examination Survey of 1963-65. Findings are shown by age, sex, and grade in school in the form of scaled scores, raw scores, and percentile distribution of raw scores for each subtest and as standard scores or deviation IQ estimates of the Full Scale IQ based on this dyad short form of the WISC. Comparisons for the two subtests are made with findings in Wechsler's standardization group. Mean scores on the Block Design subtest were higher in the present study than in Wechsler's at both 7 and a half and 10 and a  half years, the difference being statistically significant only for the younger group. On the Vocabulary subtest, the present study means were significantly lower at 7 and a half years but slightly higher at 10 and a half years. Variability in scores was greater in the present study. Boys were found to outscore girls, on the average even more consistently on the two subtests used in the survey than on the entire test in Wechsler's original standardization study. Since the present findings are based on a larger, more representative sample than the original study, it appears that there is a sex differential in performance that cannot be attributed to a factor of bias in sample selection.

Sixty-one seventh graders from an urban public school were selected as subjects; fifty-one were randomly assigned to eight treatment groups and ten were assigned to a control group. All subjects were administered Form 1M, Level E of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test as a pretest measure. The treatment conditions were: (1) like materials with reinforcing comments and daily practice for five consecutive days, (2) like materials with reinforcing comments and only one practice, (3) like materials with non-reinforcement and daily practice, (4) like materials with  non-reinforcement and one practice, (5) unlike materials with reinforcing comments and daily practice, (6) unlike materials with reinforcing comments and only one practice, (7) unlike materials with non-reinforcement and daily practice, and (8) unlike materials with non-reinforcement and only one practice. The results substantiated the use of verbalizing or thinking aloud techniques as an instructional procedure in the classroom, and practice efforts should be reinforced by comments from the teacher.

The subjects were 120 first grade students selected from two public schools in the same community. The experiment involved an Experimental Treatments X Age X Time of Testing factorial design. All subjects learned two paired-associate lists consisting of picture-number pairs. In the rule treatment, list 1 consisted of five picture-number pairs; list 2 consisted of identical stimuli and responses, except that the integer paired with each stimulus was larger by one unit. Thus, list 2 could be learned rapidly if the subjects used a rule of add 1 for each pair acquired on list 1. The lists for the interference treatment were identical, except  that the responses and stimuli from list 1 were randomly repaired on list 2. In the control treatment, list 1 and list 2 involved new stimuli and responses. The lists were presented on a Stowe memory drum at a 3:3-second rate by the anticipation method. Four random orders of the lists were presented to minimize serial learning. The result confirmed that transfer performance, either from extra-experimental or experimental sources, is the major determinant of learning performance for young, school-aged children. (WR)",

Experiment 1 examined the independent and interactive influences of school experience and chronological age in kindergarten children. Experiment 2 compared the effects of kindergarten and first grade curricula on performance on visual perception tests. In experiment 2, a test-retest design was used with kindergarten and first grade children whose birthdays were close to the December 1 cut-off date, so that the two groups were less than one month apart in age. The tests used were the Developmental Test of Visual Perception, the Visual Memory Test, the Visual Motor Gestalt Test, the Visual Sequential Memory  subtest of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, the Southern California Figure-Ground Visual Perception Test, and the Visual III from the Reading Aptitude Tests. The results of experiment 2 suggested that the interaction effects indicated a greater change in six months for the kindergarten children in comparison to the first grade children. Also, the present normative groups based on age penalize the child who is among the older children in his grade. (WR)",

These years of research have indicated that the advantages of i.t.a. are that it permits the child to: advance more rapidly in reading and writing experience; achieve significantly superior reading skills at an earlier time; read more widely; write more prolifically, more extensively, and with a higher degree of proficiency; develop high spelling skills fairly early; show a lack of the inhibitions in writing which are commonly found early in the first year; and write more creatively in terms of the number of running words and the number of polysyllabic words used. An analysis of subsidiary  characteristics indicated a marked reduction in letter confusions, fewer restrictions on adhering to a particular structure in a published series, reduction in the need for remedial reading posts, and a reduction in failure rate.

The reading themes represent both a variety of reading materials and the variety of behaviors these materials require. The themes were developed by members of the National Assessment staff and reading specialists to cluster the reading exercises into reporting categories that are meaningful to persons concerned with the reading skills of various groups of young Americans. The themes are numbered such that the lower numbers designate skills that are usually associated with early reading and the higher numbers designate high order skills. The themes are: (1) understand words and word relationships, (2) graphic materials, (3) written directions, (4) reference materials, (5) read for  significant facts in passages, (6) main ideas and organization, (7) drawing inferences, and (8) critical reading. Results are given for each theme for four age levels, 9, 13, 17, and 26-35. Within each age level across the nation results are also given for the four regions of the country, for the two sexes, for blacks and whites, for four levels of parent education, and for seven sizes and types of community.

A field experiment was designed in which each school was assigned to a test condition: (1) obligatory use of all the textbooks and guides, (2) use of the textbooks to whatever extent deemed appropriate by the teacher, and (3) use of other textbooks or no textbooks. A pretest and posttest were administered to each student in each subject about seven nonths apart. Comparisons of schools according to urban-rural, grading type (graded, more than one grade per teacher, and one room-one teacher), and field condition were made. No significant differences were found between urban and rural schools  or among field conditions in any subject area. Significant differences were found in four of nine comparisons between types of grading, and, while most of the graded schools were urban, the grading organization was more important in accounting for differences in achievement than location. A number of recommendations were made to the Ministry of Education regarding textbook revision, teacher training, and educational organization. (TO)",

Six junior and senior high school students, identified as being among the best readers in their school, were used as subjects. Each subject read sixteen 500-word passages taken from a high school psychology text. Each passage was divided into six pages, displayed a page at a time, double-spaced, for the reader. Six mutilated versions of the passages were also prepared. For two of these versions each letter or number was replaced with an X. For two versions each letter or number was replaced with a letter or number which tended to be visually  confusable with it. In the final two versions each letter or number was replaced with a letter or number not usually confused with it. Eight window sizes were used: 13, 17, 21, 25, 31, 37, 45, or 100 character positions on the line fixated. Results indicated that there is a clear effect due to window size. Reducing the window to thirteen characters increases the fixation duration by 30 percent, decreases the saccade length for forward saccades by 26 percent, and increases reading time by 60 percent, as compared to a window size of 100 character spaces.

        "description":"Random telephone surveys in a northern and a southern city were initiated to determine attitudes toward &quot;informative&quot; and &quot;direct reference&quot; mass media political advertisements. Responses were organized in regional, social, and racial categories. The results quantified reactions to the two types of political messages of blacks and whites from various socioeconomic levels in the North and the South. Statistical analysis of the responses indicated that the strictly informative advertisements were favored by a majority of the respondents over messages which attacked political opponents. However, whites were more tolerant of direct reference (attacking) advertisements than blacks, and southerners objected less to aggressive messages than did northerners. It was concluded, however,  that attitudes toward types of political advertisements cannot be best appraised on regional, social, or racial grounds without consideration of the complete value systems held by individual respondents.

In a specific case, a Pennsylvania newsman was prosecuted in 1972 on charges of wiretapping his own telephone conversations without notice to the other parties in the calls. A review of the cases applicable in Pennsylvania showed that the tape recording of one's own telephone communications may violate the privacy of the other party, but it is possible that &quot;implied consent&quot; or &quot;fair use&quot; legal precedents could be applied if judges and/or lawmakers choose. The general practice of unannounced telephone tape recording by police and fire departments as well as by newsmen and others as yet remains unexamined in the  nation as a whole.

Of the types of appeals used in television commercials--informative, emotional, &quot;establishment&quot; (or status quo), and fear--the establishment appeal had the least favorable effect on a test group of 248 sophomore college students. In fact, both the establishment and information-based appeals elicited decidedly negative attitudinal responses from those surveyed, although older, more socially secure, and female respondents tended to favor such appeals. Emotional appeals were most effective with all the respondents, even overcoming fatalism.

Behavioral objectives and educational accountability are a result of public pressure and reflect a broad social movement originating in business, where the emphasis has traditionally been upon efficiency, rationalization, and engineering. For over half a century education has been frantically trying to measure the results of teaching so it may answer a society which gets very impatient at what it deems as unsatisfactory performance. And yet, if we had spent that time on teaching itself--what it is, how it works, who the learner really is, and what his needs are--perhaps we would now be riding fewer hobby horses  and spending much less time bumping around in the dark.

The survey results were inconclusive, however, in that there was no universal agreement on professional standards, no clear answer to the problem of journalist certification, and no agreement on the extent of &quot;editorializing&quot; allowable in &quot;straight news&quot; stories. Too, there emerged  no clear way of predicting which newsmen hold high professional standards, since educational level and &quot;prestige,&quot; the expected indicators, failed to show linear results.

Originally proposed in 1947 by the Hutchins Commission, but never implemented, the idea gained renewed interest in the late 1960s. Its scope would be limited to national suppliers of news: wire services, &quot;supplemental&quot; news services, weekly news magazines, newspaper syndicates, daily newspapers, and broadcasting networks. The council has not gone unopposed. Many in the news media view the council as an apparatus to intensify  external control over journalism and serve in the role of unofficial news censor. Other problems involve the council's definition of news and its purview of national suppliers of news. Whether the council succeeds depends upon its first year performance, the positions it will take on government-press relationships, and the support of its membership. (HOD)",

It was learned that secondary teachers reached consensus only on the very broadest levels. They all agreed that literature, communication, and expression should not be treated as separate studies; that reading and literature continue to be relevant; that the curricula must consider individual differences; and that some provision should be made for informal discussion in the classroom. Division of opinion occurred in discussing how goals were to be achieved and priorities ordered. Primary teachers gave wide support to the preeminence of oral language, creative writing, and teacher  autonomy. On other issues, however, there were differences of opinion. The second paper examines current curricula and teaching practices in the Australian states (Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia) and is organized under the following headings for each state: introduction, aims and objectives, structure and orientation of courses, current approaches and materials, current methods of assessment, and summary.

It is suggested that the subject could be offered as a semester's work on the college or junior college level, and, with a more restricted scope, it could be adaptable to the high school mini-course. Most of the discussion is devoted to a consideration of an approach to the study of the novels of Ellen Glasgow. The second article examines women's studies that have been offered on the college and university level. Against this background, women's studies on the high school level are discussed, particularly the challenges and opportunities they present to the English teacher. (HOD)",

Results showed that the DP group was superior to the HP group of three of the four TOEFL subtests and on two SAT subtests and that  the parentage variable accounted for 53 percent of the variance in total test scores. The item-by-item comparisons showed the DP group performance to more like that of the hearing, foreign students than was the performance of the HP group. Whereas the correlations of the Paragraph Meaning SAT subtest scores with the TOEFL scores failed to discriminate between the DP and HP subjects, the DP subjects' scores correlated better than HP group scores on the Language subtest of the SAT.

This gap in journalistic investigation should be filled by considering the two conflicting roles which ethnic newspapers fill: assimilation of the ethnic group into the mainstream of American culture and maintenance and reinforcement of the readership ethnicity. By realizing that America is not completely successful as either a melting pot or a land of genuine cultural pluralism, the scholar of journalistic traditions can understand the needs of ethnics who support the contunuance of ethnic newspapers. Newspapers for ethnics are similar to their English counterparts in their coverage of the news but differ in their closer ties to the communities that  they serve. The ethnic press tends to supplement the news in other major newspapers, but it provides a touch with the ethnic's, and especially the immigrant's, \"old country\" in his own language as other newspapers cannot. The evolutionary nature, the relationship to the dominant press, and the expression of distinct cultural, social, and political values must be considered in studies of the ethnic press. (CH)",

The analysis led to a number of recommendations for improving the objective reporting of science news. To verify their stories, reporters should not rely solely on interviews with scientists or on publicity handouts but should also use journal articles and published reports. In writing their stories, reporters should attempt to find the angle of the stofy, avoid oversimplifying or exaggerating the lead sentence to attract reader interest, quote accurately and in context, use language and terminology accurately, and interpret technical  conclusions properly. A special problem in science news coverage which must be overcome by reporters is sensationalizing information. The words &quot;cure&quot; and &quot;breakthrough&quot; should not be used unless the scientist himself approves the words in describing his work. Information sources might also be given an opportunity to review articles for accuracy before publication. Finally, it is important for editors to realize that the practice of cutting news stories from the bottom to fit available space may not apply to science stories, which often need to be reported completely to make sense.

As early as May 1846, these editors were &quot;pooling&quot; their energies in response to newly developed modes of communication--the wire and wireless telegraph and the trans-oceanic steamship mail services. The officially organized New York Associated Press (NYAP) was created in 1848 with a formal agreement among the member newspapers to use common telegraphic lines and other communication modes in gathering and passing news dispatches. A comparison of similar stories in widely separated newspapers demonstrates that the NYAP sold its news stories to newspapers throughout the United States. The Associated Press, as it currently exists, evolved from  the NYAP. (CH)",

Development of communication channels is closely interrelated with the complex processes of political, social, and economic evolution in the new countries of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Schramm has been concerned with how communication development can serve to accelerate political, economic, and social growth. He asserts that communication assists in public understanding and acceptance of national goals and the individual's responsibilities for attaining them. Economic development is especially dependent upon communication channels but must also provide the financial and  material support for communication media. Schramm's theme has been that the mass media can be used for explaining goals, raising aspirations, and creating a climate for national development. Further, the media assist in providing more widespread education through teacher support (or substitution). Schramm also indicates that development of the media encourages political democracy with its attempts to involve the public in decision-making processes. (RN)",

Important research of this nature is being conducted in the  Department of Communication and Organizational Behavior at the General Motors Institute, which is participating in a multi-faceted organizational development program in numerous General Motors facilities. The emphasis is on a general systems approach that stresses organizational development in addition to management training and development. The approach employs a survey feedback methodology.

Rights that are well-defined demonstrate that allegedly libelous statements do not forfeit constitutional protection because they appear in the form of  paid advertising; broadcasters are not required to sell time for editorial ads as long as they treat issues fairly; and the individual is restricted in his ability to express views directly to an audience, but he can advertise on municipal facilities such as buses and subways since the courts have forbidden public agencies to prohibit such advertising.

        "description":"Message strategies relating to information about social problems such as drug abuse have been based on the assumption that exposure to relevant information via mass media will result in behavior modification. There is need, however, for scientific inquiry into methods of information acquisition and perceptual response to information. A two-part study in Connecticut was designed to utilize objective and subjective measurements of viewer response to public service drug abuse commercials. The first experiment provided comparative evaluations of the qualities of five television commercials according to their potency, conventionality, realistic qualities, predictability, and informational values. In the second experiment, galvanic skin response measurements were used to determine  message-generated attention as subjects were looking at one of the commercials; this was followed by posttest ratings. Results indicated that &quot;hard sell&quot; messages against drug abuse use (threatening, emotional, or disturbing approaches) appear to be most reliable for measurement of viewer perception regardless of the amount of attention generated during the actual viewing period. Attention arousal is important as a determinant of communication-generated behavior but is not necessarily related to the receiver's perceptual response and degree of persuasion. (RN)",

This volume is a tool for assisting a planning group in using the last mentioned source of ideas. Cited are books, articles, pamphlets, films, and television videotapes that describe and analyze various types of  new learning programs. The items are arranged under the topical headings: (1) Education Today--What's Wrong with It; (2) Education and the Future; (3) What Needs To Be Changed To Change Schools; (4) Equal Educational Opportunity; (5) Evaluating New Learning Programs; and (6) Additional Sources for Planning Groups.

        "description":"In September, 1969, a radically innovative program for middle school children was undertaken at Theodore Roosevelt Junior High School, one of eight junior high schools in School District 4J, Eugene, Oregon. Because the Roosevelt program is one that goes far beyond the usual idea of innovation, it is anticipated that this program description will be useful in providing incentives for educators to pursue new concepts in curriculum construction and program planning. This analysis was limited to the initial three years of the program development and to its first year of operation, 1969-1970. First, some background information about the program is presented. Then, the authors discuss the development of the program--detailing both the formal and informal actions which led to the  program inception--and describe the initial summer workshop. The presentation next covers the implementation of the program, the first year of operation, problems encountered and solutions formulated, and analyses of actual student choices. Following these analyses are an evaluation of the first year, some conclusions reached in the second workshop, examples of student and parent reactions, and a discussion of the direction for the second year. A summary and an overview of the program after the first year conclude the publication. A short bibliography is included. (Author/EA)",

Five exemplary innovative approaches in secondary education are chosen to match each of these issues (although all schools are comprehensively designed to serve multiple purposes). These schools include the Calexico Intercultural Design, established to insure equality of educational opportunity for Spanish-speaking youngsters; the Philadelphia Parkway Program that stresses curricular activities with relevancy to a  student's interests; the Alternate Learning Program of Providence, Rhode Island, which treats each high school student as a unique human being; the Advancement School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, geared to the treatment of youngsters with special problems rather than to an interest in its own survival; and a Joint Committee on Educational Goals and Evaluation, established by California legislation which is concerned with the establishment of a mechanism through which student, parent, and community participation in educational goal setting will be assured.

Although the study results exist on three levels of specificity, this report represents only the summary portion of study findings. The populations sampled consisted of public school, area school, county unit, and DPI personnel. An analysis of pretest sample returns indicate in part that, in general, teachers and school borad members were too little informed about the DPI to comment about their attitudes toward it, their perceptions of functions in which the DPI is  engaged, or their desires for activities in which the DPI should engage. A positive general attitude toward the DPI was evidenced by superintendents, principals, administrators, and student service personnel in school districts, county units, and area schools, as well as by the professional staff of the DPI; and a positive correlation was found to exist between the overall attitude displayed by respondents in both their desire for and their perception of DPI involvement in activities denoted by items in the instrument.

        "description":"This report recommends the formal organization of a cost reduction program for a school system, outlines a structure, and suggests some techniques for implementation. It defines a cost reduction program as a formal, systematic effort of major status designed by an organization to keep its operating costs at a minimum, while providing predetermimed quality products and services. It suggests that such a program is valuable to management even if costs are not excessive and individual organizational units observe normal concern in controlling expenditures. The report considers the purposes and functions of a cost reduction program and the responsibility for and the methods of program implementation. It details the structure of the program committee and explains the program's  monitoring and reporting systems. The document also considers some specific techniques with cost reduction implications for school systems, and provides a manual of regulations for cost reduction and estimated costs and a time schedule for program implementation.

He suggests that, to survive in educational and political change, it is necessary to have what may be thought of as a map of the territory, together with some notion of the desirable directions and the available paths. He links the discussion of educational change to past, present, and future changes in society as a whole. He considers the historical basis underlying the present educational structure and considers directions in which that structure has been moving. The author suggests that the educational matrix--the structure supportive of learning--consists of time, space, subject matter, and social and administrative organization. He describes each of these  elements and then classifies current educational alternatives in terms of the variations they make in one or more of the four elements of the matrix. The document concludes by examining what the patterns of education will be in the future and what the relationship between society and the schools will be. (Author/DN)",

Attention was also given to the legislative authorization providing for such State facilities planning units. The first phase of the study involved a review of the literature pertaining to the services provided by State education agency facilities planning units as well as the literature pertaining to theories and principles of organizational patterns. Case studies of facilities planning units in the States of California, Florida, Minnesota, North Carolina, and  Washington provided another source of information. A preliminary model for a State education agency facilities planning unit was then constructed and presented for refinement and approval to a jury of State educational facilities planners. The model provides for both regulatory and leadership services, but emphasizes leadership services. It also includes organization and staffing patterns, based on a functional division of work of recommended services. (Author/MLF)",

In this paper, the authors present the point of view that in the future, the nonteaching personnel in the public schools should be encouraged to participate in learning activities using resources already available within the school plant. The participation of such personnel is seen as part of a program of career development involving lifelong learning, job upgrading, and career mobility. The authors also  present a Career Development Model and describe a Career Development System which can, it is believed, provide more satisfied and productive workers (though perhaps fewer in number) and assure greater utilization of school facilities. Implications for facility planning are explored, with emphasis on a specific element of the Career Development Model: the Career Development Learning Center. (Author)",

First, business education is so organized that the interchange of subject matter lends itself to team teaching, individualized instruction, and other aspects usually incorporated into an open classroom concept. Second, business education is a terminal curriculum preparing pupils to enter the business world where work is conducted under conditions similar to those in an open classroom, and inversely, the direct antithesis to a curriculum of segmented instruction offered in a traditional high school. The senior high school, usually more conservative and traditional in its outlook, has been slower to accept and to adopt this  new concept. However, in recent years, a number of open classroom high schools have been built or are presently under construction. The information contained in this publication is, to a large extent, based on the experience and the outcome of a 3-year vocationally funded research study conducted at the Pennridge High School, Perkasie, Pennsylvania. These guidelines should be helpful to those educators interested in initiating an open classroom, student-oriented vocational business education program. (Author)",

Conclusions indicate that by extending the school year, space can be saved and capital expenditures postponed.

If an optimum design for lowest cost is to be provided, and if the structures are to be successful, they must be of  quality design; the design must fully coordinate methods of fabrication, handling, and shipment; and the installation procedures should be fully explored as part of the design with a fabricator experienced in working with large fabric structures.

It is expected that such a framework will provide a basis for data processing decisions and direction for future data processing activities. The model presented cross classifies the means of data processing--manual, mechanical, electro-mechanical, and electronic--with three levels of data processing--clerical, control, and analysis. The authors then relate this framework to school systems and other educational systems and discuss some of the implications inherent in each level of data processing.

        "description":"The consortium was formed in the summer of 1971 as a means of implementing William Glasser's philosophy and methods. The program was implemented in two parochial elementary schools and in nine public elementary schools located in eight school districts. The evaluation discussed in this report included questionnaires to measure pupil self concepts and attitudes toward school. Also, since classroom meetings are a major part of the program, teachers were asked to fill in a Classroom Meeting Evaluation form after holding a meeting. In the analysis of pupil attitudinal data, it was found that, when data from all project districts were analyzed together, no significant differences were found between SWF school and control school pupils in either attitude toward school or self concept.  It was also found that when SWF school and control school pupils were compared in their Spring 1972, responses to specific items, SWF school pupils held more positive attitudes than did control school pupils on items highly related to the objectives of the SWF program. The analysis of Classroom Meeting Evaluation forms revealed that, in general, teachers felt their meetings were effective. However, meetings held near the beginning and end of the school year were rated as more effective than were those held during the middle months of the year. (Author)",

A detailed method of allocating instructional costs and other costs directly related to instruction, such as Social Security and retirement and employee benefits, is given in order that other school districts may use the method to calculate their own costs. Secondary per pupil costs in 1971-72 for the three districts ranged from $82.42 for mathematics in the 5,000-pupil district to $123.81 per pupil for science in the 14,000-pupil district. Size of district did not appear to be a major factor in the results. Findings revealed that pupil-teacher ratios, education and experience of the faculty,  district salary schedule, use of aides, supervisor salaries, amount of teaching supplies, and administrative and school board policies were largely responsible for differences in per pupil costs between subject areas and among districts.

Several school administrator credentials were reduced into one--the Administrative Services Credential. Three avenues have been proposed for securing the credential. This article sets out the proposed guidelines and accompanying implementation statements for two avenues, these being the approved program and the internship. (Author/WM)",

These aspects are competency identification, competency organization, competency analysis, competency units, competency evaluation, and competency feedback. The Rocky Mountain Regional Resource Center, in cooperation with the University of Utah Department of Special Education, is field testing a competency-based training program designed to maximize the effectiveness of classroom teacher skills in providing remedial services to handicapped children. The training program is designed to prepare the \"generalist\" as the agent best  to develop and expand these functions. Hopefully the model will show relevance not only to the special educator, but also to other personnel types. (Author)",

The intent in providing policy samples is to encourage thinking in policy terms and to provide working papers that can be edited, modified, or adapted to meet local requirements. Note is made of the fact that in 12 states statutes prohibit minors from smoking on school property, and in other communities, that local fire ordinances take the decision away from the school board. Sample policy statements show that some boards prohibit smoking on school grounds altogether and provide penalties for infractions; others designate smoking areas or times when smoking is permitted; still others permit smoking, but deliberately restrict smoking areas available to students in order to discourage  smoking. One school district requires parental permission for students to smoke in school and provides for informing parents when a student is found smoking who has not received parental permission. Most board policies require education programs on the dangers of smoking. (Author/JF)",

Each of the States involved in the Southeastern Day Care Project developed its playground according to its own needs and resources, but certain overall purposes of the Project were considered. Centers were to be adequately equipped but not extravagantly, so that the programs would be replicable and could provide ideas for other programs.

However, science instruction is still in the logarithmic phase of change. Curricular and instructional styles alter so rapidly that often reference points are blurred and communication tends to break down. If these changes are to be truly significant, they must be fundamental, involving the whole learning spectrum--physical environment, teaching options, and learning patterns. It is the intent of this publication to cast some light on the possible physical arrays or options that would complement a school or a science department philosophy. Three types of secondary schools are considered: small  (600-800 students), large (1500-1800 students), and the middle school (5-8 grades). Two general types of physical plans are presented: the classical plan (self-contained classrooms) and the innovative plan (experimental schedules, flexible-modular alternatives, and individualized instruction). Most of the layouts presented are based on the assumption that the greatest portion of the science student's time will be spent in the laboratory and in the science resource center. (Author)",

These descriptions are a by-product of the information gathering effort to document the first year's instructional strategies and resource use, and are based on discussions with mini-school faculties, supported by some  observation of classroom activities. Teachers supplied information about instructional materials and field trips, using printed forms; and two staff members did all the classroom observation using a prestructured checklist. Program goals were taken from the mini-schools' own descriptions, and other descriptions were developed from checklists and discussions with teachers. Examples of the iterations involved in developing each program description are included. (Author)",

The test attempted to determine what effects the introduction into a school system of specially prepared information on the relative achievement levels of schools and grades serving students of similar economic levels would have on school system management, decisions, and operations. Two results were expected: the production of different management decisions and better information on how the school system management actually attempts to influence performance. The report also describes the reasons underlying the development of signals of relative performance, the techniques used in that development, and properties of the signals.

Five States--Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, and West Virginia--were selected for the study on the basis of their shifts to a board-appointed CSSO. Data were gathered by interviewing persons who held key positions in the State at the time of transition. Each of the five chapters of this report is devoted to one of the five study States and is a complete entity with text and the corresponding appendix. The text of each chapter is divided into (1) a brief history of the SEA up to the year selected by  the author as being the &quot;jumping off&quot; point for the change, (2) principal studies or processes that led to the change, together with information about what followed immediately after the implementing statutes were enacted, and (3) a review and an appraisal of the current governing structure as seen by study participants. A separate chapter summarizes some of the findings. (Author/JF)",

This study of the Chicago and Los Angeles Catholic school systems sought to redress this ignorance. The study first gathered and analyzed school data from central (diocesan) sources, then described and analyzed the internal policymaking structure of each local school, and lastly surveyed and analyzed parental motivation, with the following question as the basis of the survey: Why do parents initially send and ultimately maintain their children in nonpublic schools? The report concludes that the systems vary in their character, but are locally controlled; and that parents support schools despite differences with  religious, racial, or pedagogical policy--with or without formal participation in policymaking institutions. The research points to the important role of local school vulnerability in drawing support and to the role of parental confidence in teachers, which may be aided by the character of the local school's educational bureaucracy.

This document presents the Laverne Proposal and compares it with several others. The Proposal recommends the adoption of a 2-tiered operational system for elementary and secondary education and the decentralization of the State Education Department into regional offices. Each regional office of the department would support and advise the two operational tiers. The role of each operational tier would be designed to complement what is done by the other. Programs that could best be handled at the local level would be assigned to tier one. Those that could be  carried out more economically or more effectively on a multi-district basis would be assigned to tier two.

This is true in part because teachers confronted with such discrepancies often experience anxiety. Teachers who wish to change often find it difficult to behave differently in the classroom for a variety of reasons. This paper discusses some psychological reactions that can be expected by teachers when they are confronted with information about their own classroom behavior. It also suggests some actions that a facilitator might take to help a teacher focus energies on self-improvement. (Author)",

The author here expresses concern that the persons conducting that study are focusing on a structure for governing education without regard to the functions to be performed at various levels of government. He argues first that the form of governmental structure in education should naturally flow out of a definition of functions to be performed. Secondly, he proposes that in any administrative structure, the guiding principle on the locus of decisionmaking should be to place every decision at the lowest level of the structure in which the decision may be safely made in the public interest. Finally, the author suggests that there is a necessary relationship between authority and  responsibility. (Author/JF)",

A long-range purpose is to help bring consistency to the way school districts develop goal structures for instructional planning and evaluation. The collections are designed to be used when school  administrators make decisions about individualizing instruction, planning cross-disciplinary education, and establishing accountability. The collection can be used in long-range planning and educational development, evaluating effectiveness of regular and experimental instruction, teacher education, and diagnostic-prescriptive instruction. The Project provides both knowledge and process goals, and in this way offers alternative learning outcomes of both the traditional meaningful-reception/content-mastery type and the increasingly important rational thinking process type.

Such mandates, however, do not necessarily stipulate the precise form of evaluation. It is therefore not surprising that traditional procedures outnumber newer approaches because school administrators, supervisors, and teachers are accustomed to viewing appraisal as a one-day rating process. However, it is more sensible to design evaluation procedures that call for performance objectives, specify a cooperative plan of action to achieve these goals, engage in both self-evaluation and evaluator assessments, and conduct a conference between teacher and evaluator to discuss implications of the evaluations and make plans for the future.

Teachers are provided with guidelines for responding to parental concerns such as inability of the maturing child to understand and connect the  sex act with pregnancy and its social consequences. A program is described in which a home teacher helps parents to establish individual goals for the family and the handicapped child and to eliminate the child's inappropriate behaviors by applying principles of reinforcement and shaping.

The introduction gives an overview and includes incidence of handicapped children (7 percent to 12 percent of the population) a definition, types of school programs, and information relating to supply, demand, and the federal role. Described as major influences on requirements for SE personnel are definitions of the handicapped population and kinds of services the population needs. Personnel supply is discussed in terms of the quantitative and qualitative impact of federal legislation on the supply of qualified SE personnel, characteristics of current personnel, and SE training for regular classroom personnel.  Assessment of future SE personnel requirements is said to depend on probable effects of educational trends and new approaches such as to improved data collection at the federal and state levels. Assessment of future SE personnel supply is said to depend on such factors as the funding of institutional training programs and strategies affecting training alternatives.

Examples are given of techniques used to teach creative thinking skills through mind stretchers (puzzles), creative activities (such as writing poetry), hypothesizing (about problems such as why an igloo doesn't melt inside), group dynamics activities (such as finding creative uses for unusual objects), analyzing propaganda, sentence  reasoning, and logic elimination problems. Suggestions are given for effective questioning techniques for group discussions. Mini-courses on topics such as archaeology or the heart are seen to be particularly appropriate for gifted students.

        "description":"The procedures, analyses, results, and discussion of a project which compared three methods of physical education programing for 96 emotionally disturbed children (6 to 14 years of age) in an 8-week summer camp program held during two summers are presented. The first year's program is seen to have served as a field test, with the most reliable data resulting from the second year's program. Four groups, each with eight aggressive, eight hyperactive, and eight withdrawn children are reported to have been assigned to four treatments; control, physical fitness, general coordination, and specific coordination. Detailed training manuals used in the program are provided for each of the three treatments. It is explained that the physical fitness group received activities aimed at  improving strength, endurance, speed, and flexibility, while the general coordination group received activities to improve a child's ability to maneuver his body, and the specific coordination group received activities to improve performance in selected games. The following major findings are reported: the specific coordination group exhibited superior performance on the strength criterion, the Bender developmental age scores, and the Deverux measure; though the general coordination group excelled in having the least impatience and equaled the specific coordination group in coordination. It is concluded that restructuring the physical activities of the disturbed children raised the quality of motoric behavior but had little effect on emotional adjustment or academic aptitude.  (DB)",

Compared in the first study are performance patterns of hearing impaired students on the Intermediate I and Advanced batteries with patterns of hearing standardization groups on the same test levels. Content sub-areas within the subtests are analyzed and areas in which hearing impaired students performed better or worse than the standardization group are identified. Technical problems relating to test construction are noted. In the second study, the discriminative validity of items in five selected subtests of the Intermediate I battery is examined and whether the items effectively distinguished  between high and low achieving students is determined. Examples of items for each of the five subtests are presented to show high and low discrimination coefficients. The paragraph meaning and science subtests are said to have the highest proportions of low discriminating items and thus the lowest average discrimination coefficients.

A study was therefore devised to investigate two different ways to control such branching (student controlled or program controlled) and also to test the effects of remediation using a no-remediation control group. Subjects were 108 trainees in a basic Naval electronics course, each of whom participated in 11 lessons (one half were subject and the other program controlled branching), responded to a questionnaire assessing attitudes about the branching modes and about remediation, and completed a final examination. Results showed no significant differences between  branching conditions or remediation conditions for training time or final examination performance. However, because students preferred student controlled training and because these lessons are simpler to prepare, it was concluded that the student controlled CAI training materials should be developed and used wherever possible.

Four instructional teams at BYU, each having an instructional psychologist, subject matter experts, an instructional design technician, an evaluative technician and packaging specialists, are developing courses in remedial algebra, elementary functions, remedial English, and freshman English for junior colleges. The system uses a color television to display digitally generated characters and graphics and also employs audio and video tapes and alphanumeric entries from a typewriter. Major courseware features include three  levels of student-machine communication, a modular approach to courseware structure designed in accordance with a taxonomy of instructional variables, and learner-controlled interfaces between the student and the system. The courseware seeks to present the required content to students at a low cost in such a way that they develop content mastery in an effective manner and also acquire improved learning strategies, a positive outlook to learning and greater responsibility for their own development. The courseware will be field-tested at two junior colleges in 1974. (PB)",

LCI allows the student to specify goals, to control significant resources to attain them, and to choose learning strategies, thus enabling him to learn how to learn. It appears that the environment needed to support this model must rely heavily upon computer-assisted instruction (CAI) and computer-managed instruction (CMI). Time-shared terminals and sophisticated hardware are required, and it is necessary to reorganize content fields for learner-controlled manipulations. Additionally, research needs to identify those who are unlikely to succeed in LCI, to discover how to remedy this problem, and to determine how to structure CAI so that it equalizes the  achievements of poorer students without penalizing the better ones, rather than merely amplifying the advantages of the gifted. The TICCIT system at Brigham Young University is being used to field test an LCI program in which learners control the pace, sequence, and mode of instruction, specify the depth and detail of instructional interaction, and determine access to support facilities and advice. Evaluation after two years will determine the success of the system in making operational the theoretical model. (LB)",

Aspects of the system, constructed to assist counselors in guiding undergraduates in the selection of academic majors, which are discussed include: problem definition, system analysis, design rationale, methodology, measurement specifications, data base compilation, mathematical modeling, statistical results, and validation tests. Counseling application directions and capabilities are considered, computerized academic counseling in the context of career success likelihood is analyzed, and recommendations for extending the approach to additional aspects of career guidance are made. A concept for an Air Force (AF) career counseling system which permits individuals to shape  their careers is developed. Its functional components include. a) an AF personnel needs and resources forecast model 2nd, b) an AF mechanism which permits personnel to select and assure careers of their choice. Preliminary analyses are offered which indicate such a system is feasible and could have a significant impact on AF enlistment and turnover rates. Finally, recommendations are presented suggesting future research and development. (Author)",

Various levels of realism, with various costs, are available in different presentation modes. The simulations can aid in communication about and the resolution of environmental issues, serve as planning tools and as the basis of educational films, depict technological innovations and fantasy futures, and assist research in environmental psychology. Simulators also further environmental impact assessment by acting as a means for monitoring public responses, estimating safety, stress and pollution, measuring potential problems of intrusion of privacy, access and distribution, relating identity, scale and  diversity, and studying esthetics. As such, simulators can be used by committees and design teams, in public hearings, and for television presentations, although it must be recognized that simulation is still a developing science and therefore is still a tool with limitations.

The idea of data analysis as an experimental science involving data-gathering and theory building is developed. Language's role as a determinant of meaningful theory and the informativeness of a language and data base pair are studied, along with the static and dynamic aspects of data analysis. Computer systems useful for data analysis are surveyed, with special attention paid to language restrictions. Next, the Rapidly Extensible Language (REL) data analysis system is discussed and its major limitations considered. The problem of paging of data is investigated and two classes of data structure representations are reviewed. Following this, the implications of data representation for fundamental process of data  analysis--the quantification of variables--are presented. Two implications of quantification are compared, with indications found that the use of the &quot;lable class&quot; method results in orders of magnitude improvement over the low predicate calculus technique.

The discussion is set within the context of the Rapidly Extensible Language (REL) System, a question answering system with underlying relational data bases. Major topics covered include individuals and predicates, the problem of verbs, and verbs in REL English. The essential points stressed are that the meaning of a sentence depends upon the contents of the data base to which it refers, that the tying string of a sentence is its verb, and that the sentence patterns take on meaning as they fit within the broader fabrics supplied by context and reality. Examination of examples shows that verbs radically shift their semantic content with shifts in the context in which they  are used, and it was concluded that it was doubtful that there was any single method analyzing the complex webs that verbs set up among their assiciated nouns in any sentence.

The course used the Coursewriter III language and an IBM System/360 computer; students received self-paced instructional programs at typewriter terminals. All teaching was done by examples, the stress was on spelling patterns rather than individual words, and the goal was to have students reach a level of acceptable orthography. An experimental-control, pretest-posttest design was employed. Results from the Lincoln Intermediate Spelling Test showed that the experimental group made significantly greater gains. In both control and experimental groups there was no appreciable difference associated with  socio-economic status (SES), but there were significant differences between control and experimental groups for all SES levels. In addition, the control groups improved significantly in five of 20 categories of spelling errors, the experimental in 11 of 20. It was concluded that CAI was an efficient means of teaching spelling, that it was sensitive to individual needs, effective for weaker students, and useful for remedial work. (PB)",

Sequences of instructional episodes are designed for each objective; these are flow-charted, thus providing documentation not only of curricular material but also of the instructional logic. The advantages of the course as it is structured are that it offers self-paced individualized instruction and that it gives feedback for continuous modification of the program.

The purpose was to determine if it was possible to identify a set of interactive BASIC dialects in which translatability between different members of the set would be high, if reasonable programing restrictions were imposed. It was first established that the four programing capabilities of: 1) computational ability and precision, 2) execution of a large-sized program, 3) accession to creation of external files, and 4) generation of formatted output were necessary if complex projects were to be undertaken. It was found that translation of most statements in BASIC was easily accomplished. Operands, relations, names, strings, arrays, functions, input and branching were among these.  Difficulties were mainly encountered in file handling, chaining or subroutine calling, and output formatting. Detailed reports on the translatability of these elements have been compiled, a roster of 21 fundamental rules for translatability provided and three categories of dialects identified. These are: 1) BASIC dialects missing one critical element, 2) dialects lacking only formatted output capability, and 3) preferred dialects. Therefore, BASIC translatability is a fact and can be performed easily if a few rules are followed. (PB)",

The original programs were subsequently expanded and a CADA monitor constructed to aid their use; a search was then undertaken to find a means of facilitating the monitor's application on diverse computer system. Since no entirely transportable language for all interactive systems existed, a strategy of interdialect translatability was pursued and BASIC was selected for use. A BASIC version of CADA was written and proved to be easily translatable. The monitor itself was designed so that no user programing skills were required and so that it was self-documenting and readily  modifiable. In addition, the system was built so as not to leave its unsophisticated users hanging suspended when errors occurred, but to direct them ahead on the basis of available information. The two system features which most limited translatability across several systems were chaining and formatted print statements, but these were so desirable that they were retained. (LB)",

Following this is an examination of the evidence to date of the University's success in reaching its target student population. Included are data on the social and educational characteristics of the student body and a discussion of the staying power of students from different backgrounds. The third section of the paper provides an analysis of the instructional system of the University and the place of correspondence materials within that system. Also described are the fail-safe strategies aimed at helping students to avoid dropping out. Next, some studies are  cited which compare costs in the Open University with those of conventional institutions in England. Finally, an assessment of the Open University's potential as an instrument of democratization is offered. (Author)",

The author believes that language is a uniquely human phenomenon developing mainly in response to maturation in the midst of confusing linguistic input, varying in style and language according to situation. However, there seems to be no reason to expect the bilingual setting to produce a condition of linguistic deficiency. A child may acquire two linguistic systems in a general sense, or a single system overlapping two languages. A working system can, nevertheless, be the result. The report includes a bibliography.

The responses of 53 bilingual junior high school students with strong Spanish language histories were classified as qualitatively higher or lower definitions. Higher level definitions were considered more abstract and conceptual in nature. No significant differences were found between the proportion of higher level definitions given in Spanish and those given in English, nor for the same proportions when the sample was grouped by sex and by Spanish language history. It was inferred that students could profit equally well from instruction that used Spanish or English as the  vehicle of communication. (Author/SK)",

Following an overview of the study, Chapter II traces the history of the early beginnings when the tasks of the security officer were the responsibility of many individuals of both high and low order. The chapter describes the events to date which brought about the formalizing of the campus security directors. Chapter III emphasizes in tabular form the state statutes from which the campus security officer derives his authority as well as the court cases and attorney general opinions  interpreting these statutes. Chapter IV, by use of a questionnaire to the campus security directors, examines personnel characteristics, the availability and use of specialized training and equipment, the relationships with other components on campus and the security force liaison with off-campus police. Chapter V, by utilizing an appraisal and role perception instrument, enables the campus security director, the faculty, the students and the administrators to appraise the conduct and to estimate the needs of the security force. Chapter VI summarizes the available data and offers a model security force suited for the performance of major control functions not inconsistent with a supportive, integrated relationship with students.

The conference concentrated on the implications of mass higher education in the world. It is clear that many countries' education systems will have to change to undertake mass higher education successfully. This change will be implemented by the three main environmental forces acting on higher education: customer demand, manpower needs, and patron's influence. However, one of the most important characteristics of the system of mass higher education is that of offering opportunities for the intellect to be stretched to its capacities. The skill of working with people should be emphasized in mass higher education by giving lectures on  noncognitive affective approaches to experience. Finally, there is a need in higher education to help people to learn the art of decisionmaking that includes scientific data, estimates of practicality, and a framework of ethical principles. To achieve this however, part-time teachers must be brought in from the world of decisionmaking to the world of the academic. (Author/PG)",

Data indicated: (1) Only 5% of the entering freshmen in 1967 were 20 years or older. (2) Older students tended to enroll in public rather than private institutions. (3) Nearly three out of four older students were men. (4) Older students made slightly lower high school grades than did average-age students. (5) Older students differed from average-age students in their undergraduate activities, aspirations, achievements, and in some of their attitudes. (6) Older students made lower  college undergraduate grade-point averages than did average-age students, except in two-year colleges. (7) A greater proportion of older students planned to get no more than the baccalaureate. (8) Among older students, men enrolled in universities were more likely to attain the baccaulaureate in four years than were women. (9) Older students in highly selective institutions or in four-year colleges were more likely to complete the B.A. than were older students enrolled in other types of institutions. (Author)",

As in the past, variety and diversity continue to contribute to the vitality of postsecondary education. Its general availability to virtually all Americans also steadily increases, and this should continue. However, while vitality and availability flourish, there is the danger that questionable practices may exploit the manner in which postsecondary education is offered and conducted. Since the legal responsibility for authorizing the existence and continuation of  postsecondary educational institutions, programs, and courses of study rests fundamentally with the states, it follows that a logical step for controlling questionable practices in degree authorization would be the enactment of statutes of amendments of existing state laws for this purpose on certain guidelines or models. This report includes such model legislation, and a list of members of the task force that wrote the legislation. (Author/PG)",

The research is being conducted on the campuses of five traditionally black colleges who are experiencing a racial shift in their student population. The primary objective of this project is to improve the ability of certain unique, biracial colleges in terms of clear description and interpretation of their program results concerning student development and to employ this improved ability as the basis for rational institutional planning, development, and change. A second objective of this project is to investigate the adequacy and accuracy of the measuring instruments in the evaluation of various cognitive and effective characteristics of black  students. To meet these objectives, the study, in conjunction with the colleges, propose to: measure entering characteristics of the students; gather measures of student development and change at certain time points in college careers; document the predominant characteristic of the institutions and patterns of academic and biracial interaction; and develop multivariate descriptions of development by race, retention and withdrawal, and academic program involvement.

        "description":"The banking industry has recognized an increasing need to recruit, hire, and train minorities for positions within the industry. Following this line of thought, the American Bankers Association (ABA) formed a task force composed of bankers and black college educators to develop a program mutually beneficial to industry as well as colleges. A Black College/Banking Industry Symposium resulted in October 1972. The purpose of the symposium was to identify ways for the banking industry and the nation's black colleges to develop mutually beneficial programs to increase the flow of minority college graduates into banking careers. One of the recommendations made at the symposium was the establishment of Centers for Banking Education at predominantly black colleges. The symposium felt  that these centers could serve as a catalyst in the development of curricula for banking and finance in colleges. The objective of the Centers for Banking Education is to create a learning environment in the field of banking that will attract, train, and produce highly-qualified minority men and women for officer-level careers in banking. The centers would provide: high quality curriculum suitable for developing superior students; distinguished faculty; opportunities for black professors to undertake relevant banking research projects to improve their understanding of banking and their teaching skills; major impetus to attract outstanding bankers to advise, lecture, and meet with faculty, students, and administrators; and focus for attraction of additional resources from individual banks  and other business groups.

Student assessment and grades have typically been emphasized. The purpose of this study was to determine if achievement could be improved by providing an increase and choice of contingencies following academic performance. The options included events that many instructors often dispense noncontingently such as postponing quizzes and allowing extra credit. Student performance on practice quizzes was compared under a contingency and a noncontingency condition. If students performed better when these events were made contingent on measures of achievement, then it would be concluded that the events were reinforcing. Results were mixed. The contingency  condition was effective in producing higher scores for one class but not for the other. (Author)",

When the Union applied for Correspondent Status in the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, it was agreed that the decision should be based on the evaluation of teams visiting 8 of the 20 UWW units now active. Their findings can be generalized as follows: (1) Still in their first, pilot year, most of the units enroll far fewer students than they expect to next fall. (2) In all the units the staff and student morale is very high. (3) In many units, the enthusiasm, conviction, and willingness to work seem to be inspired by a director of unusual talent and dedication. (4) In some respects,  there is a fair degree of consistency among the units, in that they all give meaningful education to people of all ages off-campus and outside of the classroom. (5) Because the union does not dictate administrative procedures, in this regard the units show great variety in recordkeeping, attrition rates, and general objectives. One recommendation made was that UWW define its procedures and objectives more precisely and establish methods to measure its graduates against the graduates of more traditional programs. The reports submitted by the evaluation teams are included in the appendices of this report. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"The need for expanded less-than-baccalaureate opportunities for the citizens of Maine has been identified. This paper presents two methods to respond to this need. The first model presented, SMRCC (Southern Maine Regional Community Learning Centers), is designed to provide geographic access for the students of two southern Maine counties, York and Cumberland, with financial rates set at $20.00 per course and $100 per semester. Any person who holds a high school diploma or its equivalent will be allowed to enroll, and associate degrees in a variety of fields will be made available. To implement this model, interinstitutional cooperation of physical facilities, computers, and personnel will be necessary with public and private institutions in the area. This model offers great  flexibility of learning, individualization of learning for each student, opportunities for people of all ages and abilities, a diverse high quality curriculum and credit for life experiences. SMILE (Southern Maine Initiation of Low Cost, Post Secondary Education) is designed to be the initial instructional phase of the SMRCC model. SMILE is an immediate response to identified educational needs and demands in Maine. When the SMRCC model is fully operational, the SMILE project will be incorporated into SMRRC. This document contains the guidelines for the SMILE project, the proposed courses, the proposed time schedules, budgets, and a proposal for the rennovation of a building for the SMRCC learning resource center.

The goal of the project was to develop curriculum studies in aging for Federal City College undergraduate students, interested community persons, and workers employed in services to the elderly. The planning of the curriculum and general program of the Institute was required to: (1) relate directly to the needs of older persons in the Washington area; (2) identify and relate training to specific employment possibilities in services to the aging; (3) meet in-service training needs of direct service workers, owners, managers and supervisors of long-term care facilities; (4) present tentative training plans  leading to A.A. and B.A. degrees with identified field placements; (5) develop possible short courses; and (6) locate potential faculty for teaching in the program. Three surveys were undertaken to gather information relevant to the planning of the curriculum: one on senior citizens, one for employees working with the aged, and one on agencies serving the aged. Perhaps as important as the surveys, the development of the curriculum has been influenced by the actualities of possible implementation.

        "description":"Testing is a commonly used method of evaluating student achievement. In addition, results from testing are often intended to be useful as feedback to the student, helping him to identify his areas of achievement and deficiency. In a typical class, a test on a given unit is administered once at a time when it is believed most students should be prepared for it. Students are usually then ranked and graded according to their test performance relative to other students, or graded in accordance with some present standard. Repeatable testing is an alternative to the typical procedure. This approach makes use of several equivalent forms of each test, and students are permitted to attempt to improve their scores by taking tests on a given topic or area more than one time. This study was  designed to explore the experiences of students and faculty who had used repeatable testing. Five faculty members and twenty students comprised the sample for the study. The general attitudes toward repeatable testing was favorable among both students and faculty who have had experience with it in their classes. Comments by students indicated that repeatable testing did relieve pressure and anxiety, and facilitated learning. The educational purposes of repeatable testing seem to be realized in courses using it. Since both faculty and students who have had actual experience with it prefer repeatable examinations to standard testing, it appears to achieve the purposes of both groups. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"Higher Education is charged by its critics with increased irrelevance and continuing inflexibility. Defenders of tradition, on the other hand, often see the university as a shambles of innovation and disorder. The perspective offered by the graphic tables in this document of enrollment trends and patterns over several decades offers some middle ground of truth. The social changes of modern times often outrun the capacity of postsecondary education to adapt; by the same token, colleges, universities and their constituencies have contributed to the balance and continuity that orderly change requires. Enrollment patterns and trends for the Southern states appear to reflect continuing and gradual adaptation of the educational structure to societal needs. It is the responsibility of  educators and public policy makers to assure that postsecondary education remains responsive to those changing needs. The graphic presentations include: percent increase in college age population and college enrollment in the South; women as percent of total enrollment in the South; college enrollment growth by race in the South; percent in college by family income levels in the U.S.; enrollment by institutional type in the South; and enrollment percent graduate and undergraduate in the South.

        "description":"Any program or division which does not have its own faculty must relay on the faculties of the schools and departments to provide quality education for its students. The Honors Division is in this category. Having no faculty of its own, the Honors Division must find methods of gaining support from the faculty and must encourage them to add a commitment to the Honors Division in terms of teaching, advising, etc., to their already heavy work loads. The purpose of this survey was to find out just how the Honors Division is perceived by faculty members, how the present honors program is evaluated, the extent of faculty involvement with the Honors Division, and how the faculty believe the Honors Division ought to be changing in the future. Fifty-one faculty members constituted the  sample. The most startling data to emerge from the survey was the lack of knowledge and information about the honors program. The faculty varied greatly in their degree of commitment and willingness to support the honors program. More faculty members would be willing to teach for the Honors Division if other teaching loads were reduced and if there were greater rewards for teaching. The faculty believed that the Honors Division should be more innovative. The appendix contains the interview schedule. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"This report documents the findings of a questionnaire survey conducted in Delaware during the spring of 1973. Senior students in a sample of Delaware high schools were asked to provide certain information concerning their educational and occupational plans for the immediate future, and the extent to which these plans had been implemented at the time of the survey. Additional questions focused on several related matters, including student perceptions of higher education in general, and of Delaware institutions of higher education in particular. The sample results indicate that four out of five respondents plan to continue their formal education beyond high school. Those planning to attend college immediately following graduation from high school accounted for more than half of all  respondents. A summary of the major findings includes: (1) More than three-forths of the respondents expressed the belief that obtaining a college education is generally important and specifically affects lifetime earnings and employment security. (2) Almost nine out of ten students planning to attend college in Delaware would select a public institution. (3) When seeking information about colleges and universities, four out of five students planning to attend college consult a guidance counselor. (4) Seven out of ten respondents planning to attend college expect to use money from their parents to finance their education.

The paper traces the development of PPBS in higher education and discusses some of the commonly observed deficiencies. It concludes that although its application can assist institutions in the management of their operations by supplying better measures of optional courses of action and providing an interrelated view of both the present and the future, it is likely to raise the level of conflict and  to provide an apparent mechanism for increasing centralized control and direction.

Two questionnaires and a personality inventory were used in the collection of data that was obtained from a stratified random sample of 282 students of the University of Alberta. An analysis of data indicated: the use of drugs other than alcohol and tobacco among resident students is essentially limited to about one-fourth and in experimental sessions only. For hard drugs like LSD, heroine, etc. the reported percentage is much smaller at only 2%. Students, in general, seem to be quite aware of drug-sources and to be aware of the &quot;drug-culture&quot; and its attributes. The variables, &quot;sex,&quot;&quot;year of studies,&quot;&quot;family  socio-economic level.&quot; users &quot;concept of God,&quot; and &quot;sibling marijuana use&quot; were found to be significantly related to drug usage. The profiles of drug-users differed significantly from those of non-users in the personality inventory indicating the drug user to be individually more &quot;expedient&quot; and socially &quot;undisciplined.&quot; Drug users were generally more liberal in their social attitudes than non-users.

Because it concerns a twenty-two campus system of a single university, it not only constitutes an institutional application but also represents a prototype of a state-system of higher education. Markovian in concept, the model is based upon the premise that at a point in time a given group of students, possessing a set of institutionally-assigned characteristics distinguishing them as unique from all others, has an associated set of probabilities, which describe their distribution at the next point in time among similar sets of unique categorizations.  When suitably classified enrollments at one point in time are provided as input to such a model and multiplied by appropriate sets of probability distributions, the output constitutes a projection of enrollments at the next point in time.

Study findings indicated that the present level and form of State assistance is not adequate in terms of the private institution's needs and that both should be altered. Also an ongoing aid program should be developed which might more adequately preserve the viability of these institutions. Recommendations suggest the amount of annual assistance be computed by multiplying $243 by the fall semester Full Time Equivalent enrollment at private institutions of higher education and accumulatively adjusting the $243 yearly after fiscal year 1973-74 by the consumer price index computation applied yearly to the State of Maryland Retirement Systems. This recommendation would in  the first year increase the State assistance to these colleges and universities from $2,700,000 to approximately $4,800,000. (Author/MJM)",

Summary and recommendations indicate: (1) Budgetary stringencies at Stanford require that the faculty size remain essentially fixed. In view of this situation, a properly designed early retirement program should be adopted as a means of increasing the turnover rate of faculty positions. (2) The plan proposed in this report is based on the premise that early retirement should be available as an option to every older faculty member to be requested at his or her own initiative. (3) This retirement income provided by this plan doubles in amount during the individual's final six years of service. Furthermore, final pensions are directly related to salary levels. (4) In designing an  early retirement program, special attention should be paid to identifying the group of faculty members who the institution would most like to see avail themselves of this new opportunity. (5) A financial incentive scheme is developed which attempts to abate some of its undesirable features; the effect is to offer a greater supplement to low-salaried than to high-salaried professors for volunteering to withdraw from active service. (6) The proposed plan should be offered to the faculties of all Schools except the School of Medicine with the proviso that participation is to be only by mutual consent of the faculty member and the university. Estimated overall effects of the early retirement program on the numbers, flows, and costs of faculty are included. (Author/MJM)",

The following recommendations were offered: (1) Faculty replacements with relatively rare exceptions should be made at the assistant professor level. (2) Guidelines should be formulated for the determination of the proportion of total faculty  budget positions assigned to the several academic units which could be committed for &quot;permanent&quot; faculty appointments. (3) The tenure review process should include consideration of the degree of structural flexibility in the academic unit. (4) Implications of the present tenure system for faculty staffing policies and institutional structural flexibility should be analyzed by appropriate faculty and administrative bodies. (5) A high priority should be assigned to obtain an improved retirement program. (6) Every means possible should be used to achieve a high level of awareness regarding the importance of achieving and maintaining an adequate degree of structural flexibility in the faculty resource base.

        "description":"A comprehensive and integrated basic studies program formulated in 1970 at a community college is discussed. To examine the effects of the program, applicants who graduated in the lower four-fifths and five-fifths of their high school class were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. Students in the experimental group were interviewed by basic studies counselors; those interested registered for one or more courses. An overall comparison was made between the basic studies group and the control group with regard to grade point average, rate of success, persistence, and the number of credits earned, failed and withdrawn, and the grades for English composition I and mathematics earned in the second semester. Specific comparisons were also made for students in  each group who ranked in the lower four-fifths of their class and for those who ranked in the lower five-fifths of their class. In the overall comparison, there was little difference in academic performance between students in the basic studies and control groups. In English composition I, success rates were comparably independent to warrant inference of an experimental effect. There was a significant difference for success rates in mathematics by students in basic studies. It was suggested that more use of the results, of the Comparative Guidance and Placement Tests be made. It was recommended that basic studies students continue in group counseling. (Author/CK)",

Its goal is to improve the quality and availability of occupational education in California community colleges by providing: (1) easily administered procedures and instruments for studying all aspects of occupational education, and (2) competent professional assistance in applying the system. Simplicity and unity are characteristic of its design. In the application of COPES, there  are five essentials to its success: (1) involvement of the top leadership of the college, (2) careful advance planning, (3) participation of knowledgeable persons from the college, district, and community, (4) report of results to college participants, and (5) planning and action as a result of the study.

It is pointed out that the attitudes and knowledge that university faculty possess often affect their actions relative to community college transfer students. At the 1965 meeting of the All-University Faculty Conference, the need for University leadership with respect to its lower division was left unmistakably clear. The potential of the University to strengthen its partnership with community colleges depends on the willingness of the faculty to participate. A survey was conducted to measure the present level of such a commitment of the UCLA faculty. Information was specifically sought with respect to individual involvement in community college education as student, teacher,  administrator, parent of student, researcher, and consultant. Approximately 60 percent of the respondents to a questionnaire indicated some involvement with a community college or offered an opinion. Fifteen percent had attended a community college. Statements about community colleges included such comments as &quot;smaller classed,&quot;&quot;more individual attention,&quot;&quot;better instruction,&quot; and &quot;superior faculty.&quot; Areas in which the community college were rated include: services to students, academic preparation, counseling, disadvantaged students, and community colleges, university articulation.

Phase I involves the development of a tentative system-wide statement of goals and objectives, together with examples of program steps needed to implement the objectives in Washington's 22 community college districts. The purpose of Phase II was the development of 22 district long-range plans that would articulate with the Phase I system-wide statement. Phase III calls for consolidation of the planning reports from the 22 districts with the Phase I statement into a  final system-wide plan for 1973-75. Phase IV will utilize the systems and procedures for planning developed in Phase I through III. Other data given in this monograph include the background for the six-year plan, the plan itself, the basic elements of a long-range plan, and additional considerations. Conclusions are given. (CK)",

The purpose here is to bring together an overview of the essentials for a systematic program of staff development and continuing education of library personnel. These practical guidelines and criteria may have value for those who are interested in developing competent library personnel--themselves or others. This is intended to be a working tool of principles and precepts on which to base sound programs aimed at the  development of the manpower resource, the human potential, within the library profession. The need of manpower development programs in many areas of librarianship is great. This tool is one response to that need. Hopefully these guidelines can be utilized in many different situations where they can help those wanting to develop a new program or to reassess one already existing. The guidelines address planning, implementing, and evaluation a manpower development program. (Author/SJ)",

The aim of the project was to explore the technical and economic feasibility of providing selective notifications of current books, by extraction from MARC tapes, to specialized libraries. Typical of the potential customers envisaged would be Aslib member organizations. A comparison would be made of the utility of the various elements in the MARC record as search keys. The project was planned in six phases: (1) planning and program specification for MARC file creation and searching; (2) programing; (3) exploratory work with test file; (4) pilot operation with users; (5) analysis of results, conclusions, report; and, (6) market survey. This report covers the first  five phases of the project. (Author/SJ)",

In Sweden the main provisions pertaining to this matter are to be found as from 1 July 1973, in a special agreement and no longer in law. The agreement refers also to the right to make copies of photographs for the schools. The above-mentioned agreement is probably the first of its kind and is therefore described in this document. Copies of literary and artistic works as well as of photographs have for a long time been made on a considerable scale within the frame of the educational system in Sweden. This copying has generally been made without the consent of the persons entitled to grant the right to photocopying (the title-holder). The legal support in the Swedish  Copyright Act and Photography Act being considered insufficient, negotiations began in 1967 to regularize questions of copyright within the frame of the educational system. These negotiations have resulted in an agreement concerning graphic and photographic reproduction for the schools. As regards copying at the universities the negotiations are still going on.

The Ohio Project for Research in Information Service (OPRIS) was designed to meet the following objectives: Provide information and research aid, through existing library organizations, to government agencies; develop effective communication among libraries and government agencies by enlisting their cooperation in satisfying information needs; demonstrate a functioning model of an  information network; and, collect data useful for the design and operation of a statewide multi-function reference and information network. The Project was further seen as a development tool with interfaces to aspects of the Ohio Library Development Plan through its potential for contributing to: strengthening the State Library's services to state government; providing a prototype model for a statewide information network; and, building a resource of immediate availability to the State's ALSOs (Area Library Service Organizations).

        "description":"A total of 34 children, ages 2 and a half to 6, were presented with sentences for imitation that either violated or honored a prenominal adjective ordering rule, which requires that size adjectives must precede color adjectives. Two response measures were evaluated in terms of these sentence types: latency to begin a sentence imitation and recall errors. For both the older and younger subjects, latencies following adjective order violations were significantly longer than following correct adjective order. This indicated the existence of a perceptual strategy in noun phrase segmentation which occurs at the time the sentence is comprehended. The recall error measure indicated that a different strategy is reflected in the output phase of a sentence imitation task: this strategy was  called a \"shift-to-grammatical-output.\" Older subjects were found to employ this latter strategy, whereas the younger subjects did not employ it. These results were interpreted in terms of Bever's developmental theory of prenominal adjective ordering acquisition, the empirical work of Martin and Molfese, and a more general developmental theory suggested by the work of Danks, Glucksberg, and Schwenk.

The roles of the teacher and therapist are clearly differentiated, and the 6-8 children in the class are helped to understand the difference in roles. The teacher is responsible for creating an atmosphere of open communication, straightforwardness, and clarity. An important part of the teacher role is to report information, based  on day-to-day observation, to the therapist.

After completion of a pilot study, 22 kindergarten children were chosen as subjects. Half of the groups received orientation to provide a clear replicable procedure for introducing the materials. A criterion test was developed. The apparatus was then placed in the classroom with no restrictions as to who could use it or for how long. Observers noted the children's behavior,  recording anecdotal information and use of the balance. On the fourth day, all children were posttested. Results indicated that both groups (with or without orientation) performed similarly on the posttest.

Of the 84 subjects, 42 were males and 42 females. They were brought to the laboratory at least 2 hours after each feeding and placed supine in a bassinet. Rocking at 60 cycles per minute resulted in a greater reduction in activity than rocking at 45 cycles per minute. The direction of rocking (up and down, side to side, and head to toe) was not related to changes in activity. The finding that direction is unrelated to the soothing effects of rocking appears to be inconsistent with assumptions that rocking is soothing because it is similar to movements \"in utero\". The soothing effects produced by rocking and other forms of stimulation may be related  to brain stem inhibitory mechanisms. (DP)",

However, both groups attributed low or descending performance to situational factors more often than they did high performance.  The Low-High child was evaluated higher on measures of sentiment and skill than the High-Low child, who in turn was evaluated higher on sentiment, skill and effort than the Low-Low child.

High quality programs already in existence at Gathersburg, Maryland, Mt. Desert Island, Maine, Los Angeles, California, Dallas, Texas, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Battle Creek, Michigan, are described. An extensive survey of all existing programs is now being taken by the Education for Parenthood Project, with the long range goal of developing a comprehensive  curriculum model. General subject areas for the model and general educational objectives are described. Also emphasized is the need for an instructional technology to make the content relevant and universal for youth.

Background on aggression is provided through a discussion of the problems of definition and ontogenesis, which have led to a general shortage of relevant developmental data. This study involved 102 children, 64 between the ages of 4 and 6, and 38 between 6 and 8. They were involved in six groups operating under a common program philosophy. Each aggressive act was coded as to general function: (1) Hostile, or person-directed, and (2) Instrumental, or object-directed. A finer analysis of function involved nine categories ranging from bodily injury and property destruction to rejection, derogation, and defiant non-compliance. Antecedent events  were coded into three basic types: blocking, bodily contact, and derogation. Results are discussed in terms of age, sex, and race comparisons. It is concluded that the results support the hypotheses that the developmental course of human aggression can best be studied through a differentiated \"functional analysis\" of the problem, and that the instrumental-hostile differentation is useful in such an analysis, at least for studying early childhood.

Choice of the human target was assumed to indicate low inhibition; choice of the object target, high inhibition. Age differences were as predicted; second graders were more inhibited than nursery school children. Sex differences were as predicted for the older children; in the younger group, girls were more aggressive than boys. Session effects interacted with age and sex to form different patterns of response for the four groups. Differences between nursery school and second  grade girls were larger than differences between nursery school and second grade boys. (Author/SET)",

In contrast to previous research, subjects in the sentence condition had little difficulty producing sentences when asked. Of interest was the finding that the quality of sentence production was poorer in the manipulation-plus-sentence condition than in the sentence  condition.

In Study I, 30 lower class and 30 middle class five-year-olds were presented with affective, cognitive and perceptual role-taking tasks. Task performances were then examined in relation to four dimensions of moral judgment--blameworthiness, restitution, intentionality, and intent-consequence. Analysis of the data suggests that affective and cognitive role-taking may emerge before perceptual role-taking in young children. Also, 5-year-olds seem to best understand the notion of blameworthiness, followed by restitution, and to a lesser extent, intentionality. Study II investigated the relationship between role-taking and moral judgment in 34 kindergarten and 38 second  graders, using age as a variable. Affective, cognitive and perceptual role-taking were studied in relation to the moral judgment dimensions of intentionality and restitutive justice. A significant correlation was found between role-taking and moral judgment, especially cognitive role-taking. In addition, 7-year olds had higher scores than 5-year olds on all areas of role-taking except the perceptual tasks, and 7-year-olds had higher scores than 5-year-olds on total moral judgment and intentionality but not on restitution.

These results were also without significance at either the .01 or .05 percent level. Since there was no significant difference between the Sioux children and the norms, it is  possible to assess the learning problems of Sioux Indian children by the VKT.

The major conclusion was that the sample parents did not approve of aggression toward parents but did tend to approve of aggression to peers. The techniques used to bring about these specific behaviors were generally punitive. On the rating of punitive techniques used for misbehavior, mothers scored higher than fathers on all counts. The implications of the findings from this as well as  other pertinent studies in the literature were discussed. An 18-item bibliography and additional statistical information were presented.

Enrollment in EFNEP was most likely to occur when: (1) the homemaker was either under 30 or over 45 years of age, (2) the family income was less than $3000 and the husband was unemployed, and (3) the family participated in other public programs designed for the poor. It was observed that program assistants  were more successful in enrolling homemakers when varied enrollment techniques were used. (Author/PS)",

        "description":"The study investigated why Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) teachers leave the Bureau schools on the Pine Ridge Oglala Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. The BIA Aberdeen Area Office was contacted to obtain information on teacher turnover. Records were examined to learn the number of teachers teaching on Pine Ridge Reservation during 1965-67 who are no longer employed there. Questionnaires filled out by the former teachers (51) revealed that most (57%) resigned because of the administration, isolation, or for personal reasons. The majority of the teachers who left the profession were women, mainly for personal reasons, retirement, health, or marriage. Administration was the reason men listed most often for leaving. The principals of the schools played a decisive part in their  satisfaction or dissatisfaction with teaching experiences. Records indicated that approximately 41% of the new teachers, if they complete their first year, do not return for a second year. The teachers ranged in age from 21-75 with an average age of 45. This study showed that more than half of the vacancies were created by the teachers under 30 or over 50. One recommendation for teacher retention was that a realistic picture of living in a small isolated Indian community be presented. (FF)",

A path analytic model was developed to include mother's and father's education, breadwinner's occupation, residence, amount of significant others' influence, occupational aspiration, educational attainment, and occupational attainment. Data were collected from a specially selected sample who had attended one of 17 Northeast Alabama high schools both in 1966 as sophomores and in 1968 as seniors and had responded to questionnaires at both times. A third contact in 1972 measured the attainment of those who were employed. Regression analysis was used to test 87 males and 67 females. Major results were that 38% of  the variance for males and 26% for females was explained by the model; that the breadwinner's occupation contributed most heavily for males and occupational aspiration for females; that the model was more applicable to migrant than non-migrant males; and that home environment factors and personal value commitments were important.

This study was designed to test the following hypotheses: (1) the Title IV in-service training program will have no effect on the attitudes of classified participants; (2) the Title IV in-service training program will have no effect on the attitudes of professional participants; and (3) the Title IV in-service training program will have no effect on classified and professional attitudes as a whole. A sample of 129 employees in the Ogden City School District (4 administrators, 9 principals, 87 teachers, 8 teacher aides, 5 secretaries, 12 lunch workers, 2  maintenance personnel, 1 counselor, and 1 nurse) was taken. A pretest and posttest of the Short Form, Multifactor Racial Attitude Inventory were used. Data were analyzed by a &quot;t&quot; test for non-correlated measures. The in-service program consisted of 3 125-hour sessions conducted every 6 months between January 1972 and June 1973. Findings indicated that positive attitude modifications in school personnel can be developed through a Title IV in-service training program; however, classified participants as a group did not show significant change.

Total income transferred would have ranged from $1.5 million to $2.3 million depending upon coverage provisions. About one-half of the transfer would have been from outside the region. The average income of the eligible agricultural employee would have been increased by $311. Employment effects from increasing agricultural output in the Lower Rio Grande Region were estimated. Although high direct total employment effects were obtained for the agricultural production industries, much of the increase was due to expanded seasonal employment. Only the vegetable,  citrus, and irrigated crop industry ranked among the top 20 industries in employment generating ability, exclusive of seasonal workers. In addition to unemployment insurance, policy alternatives designed to minimize the adverse economic effects resulting from rapid expansion of seasonal employment were discussed. (Author/NQ)",

The Cuiva build no permanent houses and have no permanent settlements. They do not practice agriculture, obtaining their food from hunting and gathering. For more than 4 centuries after their discovery, little has been known about this indigenous population. Until recently the Cuiva have resisted Eurpoean influence within their territory. Although most settlers in Cuiva territory are recent immigrants, cattle herders first entered the area at the end of the 19th century, and began exterminating the Indians. Settlement has also continually taken away Cuiva hunting areas, greatly depleting food supplies. According to the laws regulating land ownership,  it is sufficient for a settler to build a fence around the part of the savannah required for his cattle and to exploit this land for a few years, to acquire legal title to it. The Cuiva see as their most pressing problem at this time the protection of their right to their own land. The solution is to provide the Cuiva with the means to purchase their own land. Professional legal advice from Colombia could be arranged on how the purchase of this land can best be arranged (perhaps by setting up a board of trustees). Also, the Colombian government must be convinced of the urgent need to protect Cuiva territory from new settlers. (FF)",

In 1968 the revolutionary military government initiated a series of structural reforms which aimed at transforming Peru. This article poses and attempts to answer certain questions which anthropology has generally dealt with on the basis of an analysis of inter-ethnic relations, emphasizing in its methods the aspects of crosscultural contact, but neglecting the national context and its political factors. It is assumed that the answers to these questions must also be derived from an analysis which recognizes that inter-ethnic relations are also class relations. Therefore, such  factors as the socio-economic situation of the native society within the national framework, and its differential access or lack of access to the means of control of political and decision-making power, necessarily enter into the analysis. It is in this perspective that the subject is examined, since an analysis of the micro-situation attains its full significance only insofar as it is linked to the total context. Contents include (1) historical notes; (2) outline of the present situation; (3) geographic distribution of the tribal groups; (4) a tentative diagnosis; and (4) present measures. (FF)",

All respondents were interviewed by black female adults who had been trained by the researchers in interviewing procedure. Major areas studied included role patterning, composite power configurations, and interaction patterns.

A random sample of 122 Indians and 525 whites who returned a mailed questionnaire during the spring and summer of 1973 were interviewed. The sample was selected from the telephone directory. Adjustment was determined by the individual's income, education, occupation, current employment status, number of friends, membership in social organizations, degree of political activity, number of arrests and legal problems,  marital stability, and 4 standardized personality scales. It was discovered that (1) Indians were poorly adjusted economically and only slightly better adjusted socially and psychologically when compared to urban whites; (2) economic, social, and psychological adjustment were not associated; and (3) neither the length of time lived in the city nor &quot;Indianness&quot; were related to adjustment.

In this paper, some Chicano perceptions of Southwestern b/b education are reviewed. Bilingual bicultural education is viewed in the framework of the Chicano's cultural experiences; the different educational philosophies reflected by Chicano educators; and the expectations of Chicano educators. Life histories of 15 Chicano teachers and their relatives and interviews with 40 of the 125 b/b teachers trained in the Mexican American Education Project at California State University (Sacramento) during the last 5 years were used. The  topics discussed include: the sociocultural experience of the Chicano; types, scope, and impact of b/b education; the new b/b education program in the planning stage; the legitimacy and acceptability of b/b education; and unresolved problems of b/b education for Chicanos. The views of the teachers who participated in the Mexican American Education Project during 1971-73 are summarized. (NQ)",

Such movements as urbanism, self-determination, cultural pluralism, tribalism and institutional relationships each have special meaning in the affairs of the Indian communities. It is difficult to predict what the major significance will be of these movements. As Indian communities undergo complex changes (while maintaining a fundamental continuity of culture) in response to the vast array of forces, it becomes more apparent that the Indian community may hold the only expertise for designing an education system that maintains its cultural integrity. The project offers the Indian people the opportunity to organize  (including selection and interpretation) materials and other resources they alone possess. (FF)",

The fundamental purpose of PC-L was to assist selected rural communities to improve the social and economic well-being of rural adults through expanded, more comprehensive basic educational opportunities and related programs, and to more effectively mobilize and utilize existing and potential community resources when identifying and fulfilling complex adult needs and wants. Effort was also initiaged in several states toward the ultimate goal of a state-level interorganizational linkage system which could provide an integrated response and delivery system to community integrative programming actions in pilot areas and throughout the state. Four means for  achieving this were given, such as the continuing provision for consultative services by Colorado State University Project Community Services Coordinators. Essential outcomes for the second year of PC-L operation were assessed on a community-by-community basis in 26 communities and 14 states. General conclusions drawn from the first 2 years of project operations revealed that the rationale, design, and basic operations were effective. (FF)",

The paper also suggested research developed around a more inductive approach to social indicator research with 3 methodological phases representing increasing levels of methodological sophistication. The first steps attempted to conceptualize social indicators that reflect the human meaning of societal change and development by examination of the life experience of nonmetropolitan people. Second, attempts were made to work inductively toward the macro-level, by combining these empirical indicators into more abstract indicators that provide multidimensional profiles of individuals and subgroups. Third, attempts were made to develop relational models of community systems and to  draw causal inferences by the use of controlled indicators designed to measure the social effects of major demographic changes as one strategic force in societal change.

The 59 selected Indian children were from the Fort Thompson school, were between the ages of 5-9, and in grades K-3. The findings indicated that the overall performance of this Indian group missed the norming population by only 11-12 percent. There was evidence that many Indian students are top performers in vocabulary and associative word meanings. It appeared the ITPA can be a valid diagnostic instrument for Sioux Indian students, if it is understood that the scores may be skewed slightly toward the low end of  achievement. Three major recommendations are (1) further studies using the entire ITPA with Indian students are warranted and necessary for more accurate comparisons with the norming population; (2) the ITPA should be used for diagnosis of psycholinguistic abilities; and (3) the ITPA could be best used for determining individual strengths and weaknesses within a battery of tests.

Instruction in each of six first grade classrooms was in the form of 18 audio-tutorial lessons, each taped to last about 15 minutes and involving the child with worksheets and many manipulative materials in which no reading was required. The \"cloze procedure\" technique was used as a means for measuring readability of both general and specific comprehension of textual materials used. The science concept test was scored by judging each of the child's verbal answers as correct or incorrect. The sight recognition test was scored by counting the number of words said correctly.  The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used for correlations made. High correlations were found between degree of concept attainment and verbal predictive ability in those concepts. Low correlations were noticed between reading ability and degree of concept attainment or verbal predictive ability. (EB)",

The purpose of this study was to measure the influence of content structure (mathematical structure) of the text on the subjects' cognitive structure. Control and experimental Ss (W=181) were sixth-grade, eighth-grade and high-school (grades 9-12) students. Experimental Ss read the probability text while the others  read a programed text unrelated to probability. Ss were pre- and posttested and given retention tests. Results indicated that the experimental Ss' measured cognitive structure highly resembled the text's content structure following instruction. The WA and PC test also appeared to be useful for formative evaluation of the programed text and gave different information than did achievement tests. (JP)",

Section 1 of the paper specifies the geometric framework; section 2 develops the background material on formal languages, grammars, and automata; section 3 is concerned with geometric predicates; section 4 covers invariance theorems; and section 5 indicates areas for further investigations.

        "description":"A three-factor design was used to determine the effects of testing frequencies and feedback delays on college students' achievement in a beginning calculus course. Four test-period frequencies--daily quizzes (5-10 minutes), weekly quizzes (20-30 minutes), three midterm exams, or one midterm exam--were used. Two feedback-delay-levels for test returns were set at next class meeting or three-day delay on quizzes, and one week for exams. Subjects were blocked on ability level (SAT scores) yielding the third dimension of the design. A constructed achievement test with .78 reliability was used as a criterion measure; the test was multiple-choice. Data from an attitude measure and a chi-square test for differences in dropout proportions are reported as well as the results of the  three-factor analysis of covariance. In general, classes given short daily quizzes had higher achievement scores and classes with the delay in feedback were significantly better than the class receiving results the next meeting. No attitude differences were found nor any interaction due to aptitude level. (JP)",

This report describes the procedures used to (1) identify structural variables that affect students' performance on arithmetic word problems presented at a computer terminal, (2) identify variables for structuring a computer-based problem-solving curriculum, and (3) assess the usefulness of the identified variables as predictors of student performance on the newly structural curriculum. Fourth-, fifth- and sixth-grade students who were from one to three years below average in arithmetic computation skills were used as subjects for developing  and testing the program and variable predictors. Approximately two-thirds were black students from an economically depressed area and the remainder came from schools for the deaf. Results of several regression analyses revealed that it is possible to account for a substantial portion of the variability in student responses using significant correlation between the deaf and hearing students on a rank-order of the problem difficulty level.

The need for a policy statement from the local board of education is noted as the first step in allowing the free exchange of ideas. Considerations in deciding to study an issue are suggested: whether the issue is beyond the maturity level of the pupils; if it is of interest to them; if the teacher feels he can handle it from a personal standpoint; if adequate study materials can be obtained; if there is adequate time to justify its presentation; and if it will clash with community attitudes. A possible approach to controversial problems is broken into four aspects: preparation, introduction, investigation, and culmination. Special  emphasis is on introductory techniques. The topic of appropriate pupil action in school and community is discussed as a natural outgrowth of the study of these issues. The teacher's role in working for consensus is observed as important in dealing with diverse opinions. A selected bibliography lists journal and yearbook articles from 1938 to the present.

The current status of citizenship education and implications for changes in citizenship education are considered in Chapter II in relation to curriculum development. Chapter III presents an example of the curriculum for the evolving individual, and discusses definitions of curriculum and  its components. A curriculum model for action is developed in diagrammatic fashion, the learning encounter envisioned with components adjustable to individual needs. Issues in evaluating the model are discussed in Chapter IV; implications for continuing teacher education in Chapter V; and reflections on the challenge of pursuing an education for evolving individual conclude Chapter VI.

The object of the units is for the middle-class, teenage American to discover his identity in an imperfect society to which he would like to make a contribution. He does so through an empathetic study of the values of earlier epochs which set the model on which we now function. Four approaches to the content are used: 1) history as a process; 2) a tentative attitude towards historical circumstances; 3) an observance of dynamic tension between change and continuity in society; and 4) replacement of emphasis on chronological detail  by a sense of general development of societies. Sources for teachers are listed under categories of world order, simulation, law, economics, and peace studies/international relations. Seven curriculum projects and materials for history, economics, values education, and social issues are briefly discussed and details given for further information. Three professional resources for history and the social sciences are suggested. (Author/KSM)",

A model by which educators can identify general objectives necessary for a humane survival social studies curriculum is presented and each prerequisite for a curriculum based on education for survival in a civilized and changing world is discussed.

Innovative methods of content analysis and evaluation of textbook presentations were developed and applied to the subject of Hawaii to attain the widest scope of appraisal possible. The textual content was identified, categorized, and synthesized into a questionnaire. Based on the appraisal of the questionnaire by a jury of eminent scholars on Hawaii, the textual content was quantitatively evaluated for its accuracy, importance, and acceptability. The results of the individual textbook evaluation can help teachers and curriculum developers decide, both quantitatively and  qualitatively, which textbook is preferable in such aspects as: the amount of coverage, accuracy, and distribution and importance of content. The structure of the paper is as follows: Introduction; Procedures; Quantitative Evaluation of the Textual Content; Qualitative Appraisal of the Textual Content; Summary and Recommendations; Tables; Selected References; and Appendix (bibliography of elementary social studies textbooks investigated).

Teachers and coordinators field tested and evaluated the materials in thirty-four school districts. Children, from urban, suburban, and rural areas, used materials in the form of slide sets with scripts, narrative tapes, guidebooks, pictures, charts, bulletin board displays, and other resources which were designed to make them aware of their community, of community problems, government, the natural environment, the arts, history, and vocational opportunities. Different types of evaluation consisted of classroom and community advisor's evaluation, telephone  surveys, and workshop evaluations by principals and teachers. Unpredicted outcomes for the 1969-70 year included a growing number of requests from outside the project area, and 31,470 persons using the materials within the project area. Teachers, in their favorable and enthusiastic comments about the project, stated that changes occurred in ways that students perceived their community, more parents were involved, and students gained more specific information on which to base their decisions. The project will be continued with local support under the Madison Public Schools' Curriculum Department. (SJM)",

A substantial portion of the questionnaire sent to listed music instructors in the state of Rhode Island was composed of applicable minimum optimum standards for music programs. Results were shown in a respondent profile, a job description profile, music facilities profile, and scheduling factors, accompanied by tables itemizing the level and area of teaching responsibility. To summarize the results, the level-area profiles were compared to standard models, and a model of each level area category was offered in numerical order with interjected standards. Broad conclusions drawn from  the results point to the major observation that the music education in Rhode Island elementary and middle/junior high schools, for the most part, is poorly supported in terms of staffing, equipment, materials, and scheduling considerations. Copies of the questionnaire, covering letter, and follow-up letter are appended. (Author/KSM)",

The programs are discussed at two levels: individually in terms of their own objectives, curriculum, faculty, performance, and self-evaluation; and collectively in the larger context of university education and the city planning professions. The four programs are located at universities in Puerto Rico, Florida, North Carolina, and California. Two types of training programs, instrumental and clinical, are differentiated, and the associated strengths and weaknesses of each general type are analyzed. The  assessment observes that the programs have not constituted major advances in graduate planning education, nor fully met their own objectives. It is argued that the programs reflect a consistent pattern of thinking regarding the nature of social structure and social problems that carries with it an implicit orientation to the status quo.

The topics of the conference are summarized under thematic headings. One theme, the need to develop priorities for China study, focuses on how to integrate China studies into existing programs. A teaching demonstration and a panel with high school students emphasize the theme of meeting teachers' and students'  needs. Other themes are multimedia materials, multi-organizational cooperation, and financial support. Suggested recommendations are the development of demonstration program packages, collaboration with other organizations, and the urging of inservice and preservice training involving China study as part of teacher education curricula.

The courses are grouped under two headings: Interim Course Offerings (Academic and Avocational) and Career Research Laboratory Program. The mini-courses vary in length from 45 minutes to three hours, each student taking a minimum of 4 1/2 hours per day. Courses are taught by teachers, students, administrators, and community people. Remedial courses are also offered. The Career Research Laboratory Program is open to seniors who spend the twoo weeks working, on a one-to-one basis, with a member of an occupation of their choice. Each student is observed once a week by a staff member;  participants complete a diary-type report at the end of the experience. The program development process involved teachers, students, and parents. Informal and formal evaluations indicate a secure future for the program. Two appendices explain the interim pre-registration procedures, course offerings, and registration forms.

Activities dedicated to a better comprehension of American culture follow a humanitites approach in the use of music, literature, art, architecture, photography, history and the social sciences. Units are organized on a thematic approach with learning outcomes specified for each topic and subtopic. Although a required course which meets state requirements for American history, the students choose a learning pattern for each unit from four offered: a traditional teacher-led classroom situation, a small group independent project, an individual independent project, or a one-to-one tutorial relationship with a teacher. Multimedia resources and a special American  Studies library are available. Students evaluate the program and their own progress; a narrative evaluation jointly prepared by the teacher and student has replaced teacher assigned grades. The program has been regularly and systematically evaluated and recommended improvements implemented. Questionnaires have documented positive attitude changes in parents and in students.

The topic of the six articles in this newsletter is an examination of free evaluation (GFE). Michael Scriven discusses the role of goal free evaluation in formative and summative evaluation, especially in the evaluation of unintended effects, observes favorable considerations of this method, and presents methodological analogies of GFE in fields other than education. Daniel L. Stufflebeam criticizes Scriven's position and develops four questions he feels to be important in assessing the merit of GFE. Marvin C. Alkin writes that GFE does recognize goals, but that they are  wider-context goals rather than specific objectives of a program. W. James Popham proposes that the GFE concept emphasizes results rather than rhetoric and provides a useful caution to educators who are overly enamored of instructional objectives. George P. Kneller argues with the logic of Scriven's argument and finds the issue one of taste rather than of theory. (KSM)",

Two experiments are described that analyze what fourth grade pupils can tell about their activities during the instructional period when they are aided by an immediate videotape replay. These experiments are part of an investigation into the instructional processes, the first of which consisted of constructing a comprehensive taxonomy for describing the instructional process, especially in its interactive phase. The procedure for data collection and analysis is described. Both experiments indicated that pupils and experts perceive interactive study behavior in group work very similarly. This behavior is characterized by a clear role  differentiation: goal related behavior of pupils remains quite stable from the beginning to the end of the lesson. The accuracy of these perceptions, however, decreases when more complex patterns are to be assessed. References and tables of data are included.

The study has previously determined that more educated individuals behave as if they are more proficient consumers, and that, in particular, more educated couples systematically select more efficient contraceptive techniques. The recent research effort has focused on two questions: 1) the relationship between schooling and the household's capacity to predict its purchases of durable good within the near future (12 months), and 2) the relationship between schooling and marital behavior, and in particular the interaction between schooling and measured I.Q. as determinants of marital behavior. Both studies are in the early stages of analysis. Initial results on the second topic  suggest that at very high levels of ability men and women with more schooling marry at later ages, select more educated mates, and are more maritally stable. These results suggest that the observed influence of schooling on marital behavior for the population at large persists at very high levels of ability. (Author)",

The meaning of planning in a modern democratic society is examined. From distinctions drawn between the meaning of private and public goods in economic theory, some useful categories are constructed for public goods and services. The categories are then played off against alternative delivery mechanisms for these public commodities, in the process of which the voucher concept emerges as rather desirable. Areview of the advantages and disadvantages of the voucher/market mechanism leads to some suggestions for ways in which it might be improved. It is argued that, when considering appropriate organizational devices for  providing goods and services, the virtues of citizenship are more likely to be preserved when people are thought of as consumers instead of as clients.

Provided are thirteen guide units designed to help teachers: 1) recognize the need for promoting mental health in the classroom; 2) understand the causes and effects of behavior; 3) change behavior in the classroom; 4) teach students the causal approach to behavior in different curriculum areas; 5) develop curricular materials for the  classroom that will promote mental health; 6) promote individualization and self-directed in learning; 7) understand group dynamics and inter-group relationships. Included in each unit are objectives, purpose statements, group activities, and suggested readings for the exercises, reading assignments and discussions. (Author/RM)",

In each study, preschool children were asked to engage in an activity of initial intrinsic interest in individual experimental sessions. The children agreed to engage in this target activity under three different reward conditions. After these sessions, unobtrusive measures of the children's subsequent intrinsic interest were obtained during a series of free-play periods. In each of the studies, results indicated that asking children to engage in an activity of initial interest as a means to some ulterior end proved a consistently effective method for undermining these children's intrinsic interest in that  activity. In addition, the results indicated that close adult surveillance also produced a similar decrement in subsequent intrinsic interest. Suggestions to maintain children's intrinsic motivation included: 1) systems of extrinsic reward systems should be employed only when nesessary to elicit the desired behavior pattern; and 2) when necessary, such programs should attempt to employ the least powerful rewards when required to produce the desired behavior change.

The first focus of the study was the development of cross-cultural understanding. Three measurement instruments were administered to eleventh grade English and history classes to show that cross-cultural contacts, under normal circumstances at least, seem to lead to increased cross cultural awareness and understanding, but that the progression from understanding to acceptance is much more problematic and needs special nurturing. The second focus of the study was achievement. Information gathered by a questionnaire on students' extra-curricular involvement and their educational and occupational expectations  and data on students' grades indicated that cultural diversity within a school fosters a higher level of academic achievement and more demanding educational occupational plans for the future. Footnotes and references are followed by appendices containing role-taking scoring guidelines, tables of scores of the three tolerance measures, and a report of some feedback on the study.

Four general course objectives listed and discussed are: to familiarize students with the basic works and theories of Velikovsky; to examine some of his theories in light of historical, scientific, cultural, and religious evidence and cources; to review the chronology of ancient history as presently constructed and compare it with  the revisions suggested by Velikovsky; and to review the reaction of scientific and literary critics to his published works and theories. Through use of both the expository and inquiry modes of learning, the unit emphasizes the students' efforts to identify and articulate the inconsistencies which present themselves, and to make decisions to reconcile these discrepancies.

Personal interviews were conducted with several Masters of Foxhounds and other notable individuals. Questionnaires were mailed to Masters of the 117 hunts registered for 1970; 55 percent were returned, providing data concerning the current status of foxhunting. Major influences, such as urbanization, suburbs, inflation, barbed wire, and modern transportation, which appear to have affected the popularity of the sport, were analyzed. Sixty-one tables were compiled during the study to present the growth of foxhunting by decades from 1830 to 1970; they show the number of hunts  founded and disbanded in the six divisions of the United States during this period. Findings show that foxhunting experienced its greatest popularity from 1930-1939. Since 1940 the popularity of the sport has decreased in the Eastern and Central State, remained the same in the Midwest, and increased in the South. At present, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and New York have the greatest number of registered hunts. More women in 1970 engaged in foxhunting than men. (Author/JA)",

Among the reasons listed for teachers assuming leadership roles in change are the following: a) as professionals, they have a vested interest in the schooling process; b) since teachers are members of and identify with the system, they have a sense of prehistory about the school organization; c) teachers are constantly on the scene in the schools, where the action is. Some factors that prevent teachers from changing schools are identified as the role of a teacher-as-a-worker and consequent poor teacher self-image, teacher fear of reprisal from administrators and colleagues, and lack of administrative support for teacher-generated innovation. There  are a case study of successful teacher-initiated change and a brief description of the course that prepares teachers for this expanded role. The types of projects teachers choose to implement in a guided practicum in planned change are reported as well as teachers' reactions, both good and bad, to their new role as linking agent between school, community, and the department of education in a neighboring college.

It was also planned to test the adaptability of an inner-city teacher training program to a rural environment (Ottawa) and to continue the pursuit of more effective student teacher training at Ottawa. A 2-week workshop brought the three types of school personnel together daily. During the first week, the supervising teachers met to confront issues related to effective teaching. Various video and audio materials were used, along with standard lectures. The second week was designed to allow the cooperating and student teachers to discuss various teaching techniques using miniteaching formats. A third  week (spread out over the '72-73 fall term) included presentations by administrators, modulation diagnostic center personnel, classroom teachers, and college personnel. Results indicated that the students in the model program were quicker to express more positive and open feelings to their supervising teachers than students not in the program.

Individualized instruction, for which a teacher as tutor is not essential, aided by some technological system, can bring the educational model into a better balance between the expense demands of capital and labor. Recent technological developments of possible service to education include the following: audio cassettes, holography, microfiche, miniature electronic calculators, one-half inch video tape equipment, broadband communication (cable TV), and electronic data processing (for student records and also for possible linkage with cable TV to produce a multidimensional mass communication  system). In the school of the future, the teacher may no longer be clerk, disciplinarian, and presenter of subject matter, but rather may attempt the tasks of subject matter monitor, psychologist, recreation specialist, librarian, and creator of instructional software. Gradual preparation of teachers for the pluses and minuses of technological systems will ease us over any such transition that may occur. (JA/CL)",

The checklist contains 60 items or criteria, which are distributed within the following six general areas of competency: a) goal-priority orientation--5 items; b) open-mindedness--8 items; c) willingness to work--4 items; d) human relations--7 items; e) personal characteristics--7 items; f) professional skills and competency--19 items. For each item there is a choice of six possible responses (with accompanying point values) which may be checked. The responses and point values are a) N/A--no points; b) totally  unacceptable--1 point; c) poor--3 points; d) average--5 points; 3) above average--7 points; e) superior--9 points. The total point value revealed through the administration of the PSEC merely provides a frame of reference within which a specific person's competency may be viewed in light of the total points possible.

This document is a preliminary statement of the findings and recommendations. The interest in assessing effectiveness is not confined to education. The following developments show the important role assigned to evaluation of federal activities generally: a) increasingly, in new legislation enacted and in amendments to existing statutes, explicit provision for evaluation has been made; b) the executive branch's emphasis on \"cost-effectiveness\" assumes the capacity on the part of the agencies to carry out appropriate and  effective evaluation; c) there has been a very substantial increase in the funds allotted for evaluation in the executive branch. The importance that has been assigned to evaluation, and the influence that such studies have exerted to date, prompts a question that must receive serious consideration: Is \"evaluation,\" as an aspect of social science research, capable of responding adequately to the extraordinary demands placed upon it by the developments cited above? The council will continue to investigate this question, but it has concluded that there is a need for a full-scale examination of the evaluation procedures of federal programs in education. (JA)",

Findings of a three-part evaluative form administered to each student at the conclusion of the field experience are discussed. Supportive tables are included. The conclusions indicate a strong mandate in support of pre-student teaching field experience and increased student  confidence about their readiness for student teaching. It is admitted that the implementation of such a program would involve increased planning time by the college instructor and a shifting of his role from supervisor to resource consultant.

The variables of joint angle reproduction (JAR), muscular tension reproduction, and limb load discrimination were measured in random order for each subject individually by the investigator and one assistant. It was found that the group as a whole was much more accurate at joint angle reproduction and weight discrimination than at muscle tension reproduction; between the two primarily proprioceptive tasks, JAR and muscular tension reproduction, no relationship  was found.

The report states that the emphasis was on modern concepts in psychiatry and psychiatric nursing and in supervised field experience with school-age children. There are five chapter divisions. Chapter I is the introduction. Chapter II contains information on the workshop participants. Chapter III is a condensation and summary of the proceedings of the first workshop. Topics covered in this chapter include the concept of mental health, the concept of anxiety, the child and sex, and the child and death. The chapter also  describes the field experience of the participants with material from the reports they were asked to compose. Chapter IV covers advanced workshop proceedings in which the focus was shifted from the normal child to the child with a serious emotional disturbance; participants' reports are again referred to; many of the topics in chapter III are repeated. Chapter V is on the evaluation of the workshops, with conclusions and recommendations. Included as appendixes are various correspondence, participant, and evaluation data from the workshop. (JA)",

The data from interviews with 283 elementary and secondary English teachers reveal that a) teachers holding white-collar expectations for their male students report that their jobs are more rewarding than teachers holding blue-collar expectations, with a strong positive association in middle-class and city schools; b) teachers who believe that a college education is necessary are inclined to find their jobs very  rewarding in middle-class communities; and c) teachers who do not share this belief find their jobs very rewarding in working- and mixed-class communities. The two independent variables (occupational expectation and schooling needed behave differently from one another in relationship to each of the dependent variables (job reward and willingness to become a teacher again). These two indexes of teacher morale seem to measure different aspects of job satisfaction. (Four tables of data are included, along with two pages of references.) (Author/BRB)",

From the stated behavioral goal, modules were constructed. The characteristics of an instructional module were that: a) fitness  should be the focus of the program; b) objectives should be behavioral; c) diagnostic and instructional materials, and assessment techniques, should be provided; and d) the package should be self-contained.

Each module represents a single session of the  workshop. Module booklets are organized to help workshop leaders prepare for each module and act as guides during the sessions. Each module has the following form: a) contents listing; b) rationale and objectives; c) a list of background reading, preparations leaders must make, and materials needed; d) the steps of the module, indicating the approximate time to be allowed, procedures to be followed, and instructions to be given; and e) feedback questions.

        "description":"A study was conducted to test the effectiveness of center vs. noncenter student teacher training. Effectiveness was defined as the degree to which student teachers accomplished goals in one term of student teaching. Comparisons were made using four self-report inventories administered to student teachers and cooperating teachers at the beginning and end of a practice teaching term. The preterm inventory asked the student teacher and the cooperating teacher to rate what each expected the student teacher to accomplish during the term; the postterm inventory asked both parties to rate what they had accomplished. Accepted chance of false rejection of the null hypothesis (i.e., that there is no difference between the groups) was set at an alpha level of .05. On no single category of  student teacher self-reports was there a significant difference in expectations. The major hypothesis, that center student teachers would accomplish more of their learning goals than noncenter student teachers, was rejected. Further unanticipated results indicated that center cooperating teachers' expectations for their student teachers were no higher than noncenter teachers'. Hence, teacher education centers helped student teachers no more or no less than cooperating teachers who deal with student teachers on a one-to-one basis; i.e., mode of student teaching alone did not significantly improve the quality of learning.

        "description":"Findings presented in a lengthier evaluation report of a reorganized junior high program in Minneapolis during the 1971-72 school year are summarized. In the Jordan component of the program, two counselors coordinated six workshops attended by about half of the teachers who had at least one seventh grade class. Teachers reported improved contact with counselors during the 1971-72 school year from that of the previous year. A questionnaire administered to students indicated that students also had more contacts with the counselors during the 1971-72 school year than in the previous one and that the students had positive attitudes toward their counselor. Parental involvement did not increase over the two-year period. In the Marshall-University component, teacher-counselor teams were  set up to work with half of the students in grades seven and eight. All teachers felt that the team approach helped meet the needs of some students and that the counselor was a useful member of the team. The majority of the students felt that the team concept was better for students than not having teachers and counselors work as a team. Parental comment toward the team concept was generally positive. (CK)",

Four sources of information were used to pinpoint the total Follow Through pupil population: Fall rosters, Spring rosters, an April listing of all pupils present, and Individual Pupil Cumulative Record Cards. Teacher C-T data were tabulated to show the number and percentage of teachers remaining in the program in each grade for each model and then for the total program. A cumulative analysis program also was written to follow all children in the program as they progressed through succeeding years. This study accounted for  309 teachers in the total program over the first four years of Follow Through in Philadelphia.

Eighteen Title I teachers trained in special learning and behavior problems work in Target Area elementary schools. SLBP teachers provide individual instruction for children with severe learning and behavior problems which retard academic progress but do not necessitate placement in special education classes. The teachers work mainly on reading problems, but also work on math problems. The teachers also attempt to help a student who has some emotional or social problems. A total of 19 Title I schools with 325 SLBP children and 211 students who, according to teachers, could benefit by placement into the program were studied. The  third and fourth grades had the largest number of students in the program. The typical SLBP student was a white male who had been enrolled in the program for about 10 months and who had a good chance of not living in a home where both parents resided. His parents had a strong possibility of receiving AFDC assistance, and there was a larger than average number of children in the family. He performs poorly on standardized achievement tests in reading and math. He does better orn activities which are nonverbal in nature. Recommendations are made. (Author/CK)",

Responses of both teachers and parents to the questionnaires suggested that the report card afforded a high degree of individualization.

More than half of the teachers surveyed felt the new care expressed a basically different philosophy--with which they agreed--personalization, individualization, and a lack of  comparison and grading. However, most teachers felt revisions were necessary and expressly requested check lists for attitudes and skills. (Author/CK)",

        "description":"The advantages, feasibility and problems associated with a student-paced course were investigated, and a computer managed evaluation system compared to paper and pencil testing mode. The development of a self-paced course was facilitated by explicit behavior objectives, a variety of learning materials referenced to the objectives and a large pool of test items. The advantages of the self-paced course, which was given in an otherwise fixed curriculum, included a moderate reduction in student completion time, more uniform mastery of the objectives, less conflict with other courses, a strongly positive student attitude, and more use of faculty for problem-solving learning experiences compared to information transfer. Problems in operating the course were mainly associated with the  administration, grading and providing feedback on 2,000 individual tests. Half of the tests were administered on cathrode ray terminals utilizing Course-writer III language with disk storage of all student responses and scores. Major advantages of the computer administered tests over paper and pencil tests included immediate feedback to students, production of summaries of student performance and attitudes without manual manipulation of paper or figures, and less worry about test security. By the end of the course, students preferred the computer to paper and pencil tests. (Author/CK)",

Examination development is based upon the identification of health care functions which individuals within a specific category of health professional should be skilled in performing. The several hundred entries in the task inventory are organized under headings that correspond to components of the clinical problem-solving process. A subsequent stage in this methodology provides for the assignment of relative priority ratings to these health care functions, so that those receiving a high priority undergo further analysis in order to serve as the basis for the development of examination materials. Priority ratings are determined by  judgments regarding the expected frequency with which a health care function is performed and its \"criticalness\" to optimum health care delivery. Finally, the knowledge and skills components of each health care function receiving a high priority are specified and stated behaviorally. (Author/CK)",

The results of the study showed the following two consistencies: (1) males receive substantially more masculine scores on the Sex-Role Stereotype Scale and the Gough Scale than women if the women's scores across the four groups are combined; and (2) one's peer group appears to influence the expression of sex-typed behaviors and dispositions. As to the validity of sex-role assessment, current tests and scales do no distinguish among the differing degrees of significance of various sex-typed behaviors but rather sum or average across various items of sex-typed behavior.

One of them entails adding steps to the construction procedures used in building norm referenced achievement tests; the second entails using criterion-referenced achievement tests rather than standardized tests for certain purposes. The principal uses of achievement tests are to: (1) evaluate the status of a student or a set of students in a class, school, or school system; (2) evaluate programs, curricula, and instructional materials; (3) diagnose problems; and (4) provide a basis for planning individual, class, or system programs. The bias built into tests arises in the minds of those who write and edit the tests and from the procedures used to improve  the tests. It is suggested that members of each of the groups concerned with the test participate in constructing the examinations from the start and to use item writers and editors that represent all major ethnic and cultural groups in the population. Criterion-referenced tests should be designed to show exactly what the pupils have learned; these tests should be used for specific diagnosis of school and program problems. (CK)",

Applications of these include survey achievement tests, college selection tests, aptitude batteries, and armed services classification tests. The word \"criterion\" has been used with two different meanings. Psychologists and educational researchers use the term as a specific standard against which learning performance is judged. Measurement people use the word to refer to prformance in the real world against which test performance will be validated. There are also differences in approach to the word \"referencing.\" It is suggested that criterion-referenced tests can be  differentiated from norm-referenced tests in that they do not focus on the problem of individual differences. The problem of developing criterion-referenced tests is discussed. An assessment program is an appropriate place to apply criterion-referenced concepts and techniques, as specific information on students' attainment of objectives can be collected. (CK)",

Three Tuesdays each month were designated for individual school activities to be planned and implemented by the principals and their staffs. The remaining Tuesdays were set aside for meetings organized by consultants and directors. Questionnaire returns by 80 percent of the elementary classroom teachers indicated that much released time was spent on: conferring with parents, planning and discussing new instructional methods and techniques, attending faculty meetings to discuss school policies and procedures, attending grade level meetings, and  developing new materials with other staff members in the school. About 9 out of 10 elementary staff members felt students would receive a better education as a result of released time activities. Recommendations were to continue the program, continue the once-a-week schedule, provide for more staff input into planning released time activities, and provide more time for sharing ideas and working together within individual buildings.

The proposal aimed to reorganize the junior high school to better meet the needs of students and teachers. The basic procedures given in the proposal for attaining this objective were to change the role of the counselor to emphasize program coordination and teacher-counselor working relationships, to organize the program into smaller units based on more interstaff planning, and to provide students with more input into program development. The junior high was provided funds for an additional counselor and a one-week summer workshop for two counselors and 10 teachers. Increased teacher-counselor and teacher-teacher communication during the workshop and throughout the year produced a  number of objectives and activities to reach the objectives. Some of the activities and developments were a new report grading system, student elective units, circle meetings in the classroom, coordination of instruction between subject areas, less objective testing, and greater use of discussion-inquiry teaching methods. At the end of the school year, 81 percent of the teachers, compared with 51 percent of the teachers at four comparison schools, rated the counselors as very helpful. However, there were few differences between the students in the experimental school and those in four other comparison schools on rated counselor effectiveness. (Author/CK)",

The essential elements of stradaptive testing which are considered include the differential entry point, branching rules, and individualized termination criteria. Also discussed are different methods of scoring the stradaptive test, and the implications of individual differences in consistency of test responses within the stradaptive test record.

(The two-stage adaptive test consisted of a routing test followed by one of a series of measurement tests.) Comparison of the score distributions showed that the two-stage test scores were more variable than the linear test scores; the distribution of two-stage scores was normal, whereas that of the linear test scores tended toward flatness. When considering the memory of the items, the two-stage test was found to have higher test-retest stability than the conventional. The relationship between the two-stage and conventional test scores was relatively high and primarily linear, but about 20% of the reliable  variance in the conventional test scores was left unaccounted for. Further analyses of the two-stage test showed that the difficulty levels of the measurement tests were not optimal, and that 4 to 5% of the examinees were routed to inappropriate measurement tests. The poor internal consistency of the measurement tests in comparison with that of the routing and conventional tests was apparently due to the extreme homogeneity of ability within the measurement test sub-groups. The findings of the study were interpreted as favorable to continue exploration of two-stage testing. (Author/NE)",

A variety of standardized tests has been developed to measure aspects of this achievement; however, only recently have administrators attempted to use such tests to help review and make decisions about educational programs. There have been such applications of achievement tests recently, as well as associated problems. One often unrecognized problem is that for these program analysis applications, it is necessary to develop a score format appropriate to the decision context, and one which has the properties of an interval scale. There have been some difficulties inherent in past attempts to develop internal scales of academic achievement; these difficulties  carry several implications. With a more open-minded and progmatic approach research and development work on some of these issues can be done rather easily and inexpensively. (Author/NE)",

The Inventory can be easily administered and scored on a group basis to pupils in Grades 3 and up. The report includes norms tables, i.e. typical distributions of scores, for Grades 2-6 plus instructions on how to interpret them. It is suggested that the Inventory could be used to measure change in self concept on an  individual basis. A copy of the Inventory is included. (Author)",

The composite achievement scores of the 1970-71 Michigan Educational Assessment Program were used to establish eligible school districts. Minimum performance objectives of at least one month's gain in achievement for each month of instruction as measured by approved pre- and posttest instruments were established for each student in the program. In order for each school district to receive the full allocation per pupil of $200, each student must achieve 75 percent of the specified objectives. Funds were allocated to those districts with the highest concentration of students  achieving at the 15th percentile or below--112,500 children in 740 schools in 67 districts--and were used for payment of salaries for qualified teachers, aides, counselors, social workers, for educational materials and equipment, and for special training for teachers and other staff members. The program's objectives of increasing basic skills in reading and arithmetic were realized such that a lareg percentage of students who previously had performed below average can perform at an average or above average pace when programs are designed to meet their needs.

It was brought to the committee's attention during those hearings that considerable research has been conducted on the possibilities of adding phosphates to various foodstuffs--presweetened cereals and refreshment drinks--to help reduce the problem of dental decay in children. Some of the most extensive research in this area was privately conducted by the General Foods Corporation during the last decade, with the  special approval of the Food and Drug Administration. The committee's hearing focuses on these studies. Representatives of the Food and Drug Administration, as well as the General Foods Corporation, testified. These witnesses included: Dr. Lloyd B.

In trying to locate blacks in the American social and political structure politicians, scholars and laymen alike have used the concept of \"Integration\" and \"Separation\" to designate polar points on a continuum which relates blacks to the American  social structure. These two terms are elevated to \"ideals\" in the United States because the best majority of blacks are suspended on the margins of both possibilities. The predominant and recurring fact is neither integration or separation, but a state of limbo, of marginality. The Sociology of Black Separation should therefore be concerned with basically three facts: the white denial of integration, the condition of black marginality, and the ensuing imperative of black separation.

The second part of the document is the text of a presentation by Ms. Winifred Green, director of the Atlanta-based Southeastern Public Education  Program of the American Friends Service Committee. The presentation argues that grouping reinforces the effects of years of discriminatory treatment in the education of black children--locking them into classroom situations where curriculum, materials, teacher expectation and the resulting stigmas and hopelessness are the same as, or some predict worse than, the days of separate but unequal schools. The third part is the text of Dr. Kamin's afternoon presentation on the history of the use in the United States to support repressive public policy. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to present some preliminary findings on the effects of racial status, socioeconomic status (SES), and measured ability (MA) upon academic performance of students in a liberal arts college. Preliminary analyses of academic performance (cumulative grade point averages and semester-by-semester grade point averages) among black and white students by SES and Mental Ability are reported for 95 black and 263 white students from the entering classes of 1964, 1965, and 1966 at Oberlin College. Findings suggest that grades among black students are not dependent on SES or upon mental ability measures to a significant extent. Some relationship between SES and MA to grades is found in the case of white students (subsequent, unreported analyses suggest that racial  status predicts to grades when SES and MA are partialled out). The systematic, mean differences in grade point averages in the earlier semesters of a student's college career (lower mean points among black students, higher mean points among white students) is associated most closely with racial status when SES and MA are controlled. It is suggested that categorical discrimination in pre-college opportunities limits the grade attainments of black students at Oberlin College. Given the selective pool of black students, their later semester grades begin to reflect on their tested potential. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper begins with the discussion of how certain developments in psychology have influenced present educational methods, and how recent work in learning theory, developmental psychology, and psychometrics strongly suggests new directions for educational research and practice. This theme is discussed in the context of a central problem in education--the individualization of instruction, or, in other terms, adapting educational environments to individual differences. The paper focuses on the education of the young child in the preschool and elementary school years, although the discussion seems applicable to all levels of our educational system. A selective mode of education is characterized by minimal variation in the conditions under which individuals are expected to learn. A  narrow range of instructional options is provided, and a limited number of ways to succeed are available. In contrast, an adaptive mode of education assumes that the educational environment can provide for a wide range and variety of instructional methods and opportunities for success. Alternative means of learning are adaptive to and are in some way matched to knowledge about each individual--his background, talents, interests, and the nature of his past performance. (Author/JM)",

CUTE requires a cooperative effort between the participating college or university and a public school system. The program is designed to replace the regular student teaching program for those students expressing an interest in teaching in inner-city schools and consists of a 16 week, urban-based program, directed by an instructional team composed of a mental health specialist, sociologist and teacher educator. In addition to student teaching in the inner-city classroom, CUTE assumes that a prospective teacher for the inner-city should: (a) understand his own and his pupils' environment and culture; (b) understand his own and his pupils' attitudes,  insecurities, anxieties and prejudices; and, (c) understand and possess competency in inquiry teaching methods. In order to establish the desired degree of awareness and understanding in prospective inner-city teachers, the CUTE program is divided into three components: mental health, sociology and teacher education, all carried out within a framework of a series of interdisciplinary seminars and field studies. Inquiry teaching methods are emphasized. This approach strives to reduce the authoritarian role of the teacher in the classroom and encourages pupil participation.

This curriculum should  provide a situation in which teachers and students can review and reflect upon the value system inherent in the life-style of each person. The activities suggested as parts of possible curricula for the ninth through twelfth grades frequently incorporated small class groupings and students teach/learn skills as a part of the basic foundation of the activities. This procedure emphasizes the importance of the student's role in his own learning processes and allows him additional means of evaluating how much of what is being presented he has learned.

Many of the tutoring principles discussed with reference to these subjects can be applied to tutoring in other subject areas. The Guidebook discusses issues associated with tutoring across ethnic group and social class. A tutor's relationship with his tutee will probably be more successful if the tutor keeps in mind the differences between himself and the tutee, and if he deals with these differences sensibly. The manual provides a checklist of steps to take before, during, and after tutoring. Each tutor's relationship with a tutee is a unique experience and the tutor must be himself. However, he should be mindful that he is  intervening in a well-established social system which has its rules of propriety. This manual suggests ways of assessing the tutee's engagement as a means of feedback to the tutor. Engagement depends on several things at once. The tutor must develop a close personal contact with the tutee. Achieving engagement depends in part on the materials that the tutor chooses for the session and in part on how the tutor uses the materials. An annotated bibliography is included to suggest materials for use in tutoring. (Author/JM)",

The report focuses on the structure of the center and the results of the first school year. The center ran for two school years; unfortunately, following the trend elsewhere in the country, it did not re-open in September of 1972 due to drastic budget cuts. The staff consisted of one psychiatrist working half time; a full time social worker administrator; a psychologist half time; a remedial reading teacher half time; a full time case aide; a secretary and cook. Two teachers were supplied by the Board of Education, and during the second year a full time group worker  joined the staff. A research psychologist acted as consultant to the staff in developing instruments to try and determine the program's effectiveness by evaluating change in the children. Our goal was to help school failures to reach a point of maturity and educational ability which would enable them to return to the regular school system and benefit from it. Small class size was essential. The school day ran the length of a regular school day and used the regular school calendar. The children accepted represented the population of the community of Yonkers, New York, proportionately. (Author/JM)",

Two in-service programs were compared. The study design provided for ten teachers to live in the ghetto for five days and ten teachers in a classroom setting, to study about racial difference and poverty as it existed in the local community. Members of the latter group were exposed to some group dynamics training. The second week of the workshop, both groups of teachers, working separately, developed units to be taught to their social studies students. These  units were studied by curriculum specialists to determine if there were any discernable difference in their content or structure. All teacher participants were psychologically evaluated in a pre-test, post-test design, with 12 months' lapse in testing. Sixteen teachers taught their social studies students, a population of 537, a month long unit entitled &quot;Race and Poverty in the Inner City.&quot; Teachers were asked to administer to their students in a pre-test, post-test design, three questions: What is a City, What is Poverty, and Who is a Negro? A ten percent sample of students' replies was selected randomly and coded. (Author/JM)",

In a narrower sense, it is concerned with increasing the effectiveness and the efficiency of local In-School Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC) programs. This report had four specific objectives: (1) to provide a descriptive overview of the types of programmatic activities carried out by In-School NYC programs across the nation; (2) to investigate the factors causing variations in the successfulness of local In-School NYC programs; (3) to identify and describe various types of program-level and activity-level innovations that have originated at the local level in In-School NYC; and, (4) to develop a design for the  establishment of a retrieval system for the regular reporting, analysis, and dissemination of information on locally-based innovations in In-School NYC. The primary sources of data for the fundings summarized in this Final Report are the nationwide census of all local In-School NYC programs and the in-depth interviews with the 31 selected local programs. A modular framework is developed to categorize and describe programmatic activities typically carried out by local In-School NYC programs. (Author/JM)",

Simultaneously, the problem of poverty continues to plague millions, even many who are in the labor force. For those who are underemployed, for the 2 million who have given up looking for jobs, and for those unemployed, the rapidly expanding demand for public service workers constitutes an important opportunity for advancement. The expanding need for important public services and the requirements of the disadvantaged for more and better work opportunities may each carry the solution to the other. This is the rationale for a  program to stimulate public employment of the disadvantaged. Five reasons why such a program can be expected to improve the economic welfare of the disadvantaged, particularly of the urban residents, are: (1) public service is growing much faster than those private industries that have traditionally absorbed the poor; (2) government jobs pay substantially higher wages than the poor are currently earning; (3) there are important fringe benefits uniquely associated with public service; (4) the location of public work places in the central city means ease of accessibility for the vary large numbers of the disadvantaged residing in the urban core; and, (5) public service has historically served as the entry point into the world of work for many white ethnic groups.

Although concentrating funds on fewer students has been made increasingly difficult by busing pupils, because of busing, basic Title I services were extended to 78 other schools. Other instructional programs were: Art Therapy, Primary Mathematics, Keyboard Music, Business Education for Delinquent Children, Neglected Children's Programs, and Preschool Programs. Evaluation of the corrective reading program was based on a pretest-posttest comparison of results on the Vocabulary and Reading Comprehension sections of the Gates-MacGinitie Test.  Test results showed that 58 percent of the pupils achieved at least one month's gain per month of instruction on the Vocabulary section, as the same percentage did to the same extent on the Comprehension section. Results of the Primary Math Project for pupils in the kindergarten, first, and second grades showed that mean gains from pretest to posttest exceeded expectations. (RJ)",

There is no one right answer to volunteer leadership problems, but it is important to believe that volunteers are available. They have to see the need and be convinced it is worth their attention, so the image of 4-H is an important factor. So are self-interest and the public opinion of the agent's role. There are many sources of volunteers: high school youth, churches, parents, etc. These can be utilized effectively with an organized recruitment approach. Following recruitment, the individual must be trained in his job and oriented to the organization. Types of training vary with the type of job. The best use of the Extension Agent is to  provide him with organizational leaders so more people are reached. Recognition must be given the volunteer in the form of personal praise, written notes, or any of several other methods. Evaluation provides an opportunity for an exchange of benefit to both the volunteer and the agent. Through the volunteer youth leaders the world is being made a better place. (AG)",

In encouraging the student to produce quality academic work, increased work loads were assigned on an individual basis so an approximation of a fulltime course load was achieved by the last third of the term. At the end of the term, 75 percent of the sixteen students had determined their response to criterion a, 12.5 percent had not, and  12.5 percent had dropped out of the program. The staff concluded that 38 percent of the students met criteria b and c, 38 percent were still working on those goals, and 24 percent did not complete the program.

The main hypothesis is that differences in search behavior help account for youth-adult employment differences and that within the youth group, black-white unemployment and earnings differentials can be partially explained by job search behavior. Endogenous variables considered are cost of the search, the supply wage rate, the length of search, and the expected duration of work on the next job. Explanatory variables fit into four categories; economic variables, attitudinal indexes, behavioral variables, and demographic datum. The surveyed data was from 150 white and 150 black, young, urban, unemployed men from the field offices of the Indiana Employment Security Division in Indianapolis during  November, 1971. Results showed black youth to have lower weekly search costs than whites, but longer search periods and consequent higher total search costs. Supply wage declines as search length increases.

Presents case histories illustrating successful experiences, followed by the author's comments highlighting possible application to other companies. Reviews potential problems and pitfalls attendant upon work improvement programs. Presents a series of guidelines for introducing a quality of work program, based on generalizations from the above and  from works of reputable authorities, followed by an independent set of guidelines and recommendations advanced by the author. Appendixes include an outline of an evaluation procedure and a proposed supervisory training workshop on improving the quality of worklife. (Author)",

Most theories of adult learning are based on research into the learning of children, which in turn is founded upon theories of animal learning. These theories, formulated under laboratory conditions, are artificial at best--and not complex enough to apply to adult human beings. Emerging theories of adult learning, however, are based on the unique characteristics of adults as learners and result in differentiated educational practices. Human resource development (HRD) is based on many of these newer theories and serves as a guideline for action. Knowles' andragogical theory is based on four assumptions which differ from those of pedagogy: (1) changes in self-concept, (2) the role of  experience, (3) readiness to learn, and (4) orientation to learning. As a guideline for developing programs and for selecting and training teachers, the andragogical model of HRD is very applicable. Among the appendixes are \"Is It Skinner or Nothing\" and \"An Approach to a Differential Psychology of the Adult Potential.\" There is a eleven-page bibliography. (MS)",

During that pilot year, it was decided to assess the present curriculum, to strengthen the career counseling component of the school program, to develop two illustrative mini-courses, and to add in-school programs and/or develop out-of-school placements enabling students to explore career interests in functional settings. The student interns, a sampling of their parents and employers  and career advisors were asked for their attitudes toward the program at its conclusion. It was concluded that the responses were sufficiently encouraging to continue with the second phase of the program: expansion of mini-courses offered and internship placements. The third phase, planned for 1974-75, draws to completion various aspects of the program. (Among the seven appendixes, two are course outlines for the illustrative mini-courses.) (AG)",

The Position Analysis Questionnaire was used to analyze 607 enlisted and 249 officer billets in the study. Comparisons made between the naval compensation for the billet incumbents and the civilian job values revealed that naval compensation was systematically and substantially lower than civilian employees compensation on jobs with corresponding characteristics. An analysis of PAQ data as the potential basis for  the allocation of billets as pay grades reflected reasonable promise for such use in the case of enlisted billets, but not in the case of officer billets.

The results indicated that satisfaction could be predicted from job duties, and that intrinsic satisfaction was better predicted than was extrinsic satisfaction.

The investigation utilizes questionnaires gathered in the College Student Survey by the Center for the Study of Evaluation in 1968-69. It consists of upperclassman women in 38 schools who are divided into two groups--the smaller (101 respondents) called \"nontraditionalists\" because of their intended careers and the larger group of  1,537--reduced by random selection to 321--called \"traditionalists.\" Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified predictor variables descriptive of nontraditionalists. However, only approximately 29 percent of the variance was accounted for.

The State Adult Education Staff Development Plan provides pre-service and in-service training for teachers and teacher aids. Priorities and objectives are outlined. A survey of adult learning needs indicates that in fiscal year 1973 two percent of the 308,215 undereducated adults in the State are presently being served by the public schools of Rhode Island. Available resources (facilities, personnel, fiscal, advisory councils) are analyzed. A set of thirteen specific objectives has been  drawn up. An evaluation of program practices and needs assessment was performed in 1973 through separate surveys of directors, teachers, students, and dropouts; the surveys themselves and findings resulting from them are described in terms of implications for redirection of the Rhode Island Adult Basic Education program in 1974.

Essentially, the dual market theory contends that a large body of workers is involuntarily confined to substandard jobs in a &quot;secondary&quot; labor market which is separated from the mainstream, or &quot;primary&quot; sector by impenetrable boundaries imposed by institutionalized discrimination. Briefly, the study finds a substantial amount of upward mobility from time of first job to 1968--a period ranging from 2 to 10 years. Nonetheless, entry into and confinement within the secondary sector cannot be consistently explained solely in terms of deficiencies in aggregate demand, human capital, or motivation. Moreover, the evidence also suggests the existence of discrimination  against blacks in terms of earnings. (Author)",

Based on 30 responses (76.92%), the major conclusions were: a majority of the teachers felt they did not have adequate training in farm machinery mechanics; no uniform selection of students for enrollment existed and no aptitude tests were given; the teachers felt the students possessed mechanical aptitude but the most of them were not planning on becoming mechanics. It was also found that close to 30% of the students completing the pre-employment laboratory program were employed as farm machinery mechanics or in closely related occupations. Suggestions were made by the teachers for improving the program by  increasing class time, space, tools and equipment, and instructional materials. Support from local implement dealers was judged to be adequate. Five recommendations are made by the author on the basis of the information compiled. The report is intended to inform teachers, teacher educators, and Texas State Department of Education personnel of some of the experiences gained by the program teachers. (AG)",

About 200,000 public service jobs were established by State and local governments under the Act. In rural areas, the program generally served to provide additional needed public services. In urban areas, the program generally helped to prevent a decrease in city services rather than providing additional services. In discussing the program in the context of new  public services, improvement of existing services, or making possible the continuation of existing programs, the report cites particular examples from each based on agent official's subjective estimates.

The project personnel developed an evaluation instrument which consisted of 58 statements to be answered strongly agree, agree, disagree, or strongly disagree. Data were gathered in December 1972 and May 1973 for grades 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Responses are reported by grade and sex. Approximately three-fourths of all student responses to  all items from all grades were positive in May; however, grade group responses reveal considerable divergence. Effectiveness of component categories is shown. Conclusions and recommendations point the way to future career education activities. (MS)",

Two forms of the questionnaire were developed; one to be used by participants in area vocational school (AVS) programs and one for those not participating in any type of vocational training. Urban school systems were not included in the study of eight selected sample schools. The students sampled were 672 eleventh and twelfth graders, half participants in AVS programs and half non-participants. Males numbered 210 and females, 126. Almost two thirds of the participants planned to enter the work force immediately after graduation. Data compiled show participants felt their needs were met by the programs, but  non-participants felt the participants needs were not being met, and they had no need of the programs themselves. General awareness of the program is high. The two groups share views concerning the counseling and guidance procedures. The type of school from which the student came influenced his view of AVS program effectiveness, but the two sexes showed a nonsignificant difference in perception of program effectiveness.

The main goals of the project are to conduct studies involving the evaluation of vocational programs, the validation guidance instruments, and the investigation of vocational development theories as they apply to today's youth. This particular study is concerned with the stability of occupational aspirations during the high school years. Occupational aspirations were divided into idealistic and realistic, so that changes in level of aspiration over time as well as difference in level could be compared. Findings showed no change in level of idealistic occupational aspiration over time, a significant downward change in  the mean level of realistic occupational aspiration, a significant and increasingly large difference between the idealistic and realistic levels, and a steady divergence between idealistic and realistic levels. The implications of these findings for high school curriculum planning, occupational guidance, training, and counseling are discussed. (SA)",

Its operation at Churchill High School is evaluated from several angels: the likes and dislikes of users; the effect of OIAS on users' knowledge of occupational information and on their career plans; why other students did not use it; its use in instruction; administrative considerations; its costs; and reactions of parents. Half the student body used it, mostly without assistance; repeat usage was common. Afterward, 84 percent said they were satisfied or very satisfied. Being &quot;personally interested in looking for occupational information&quot; was the most frequently given reason for use. The predominant reason why others did not use OIAS was a  lack of knowledge of its availability. Most students used both the QUEST Questionnaire and the occupational Descriptions, which they described as &quot;fun to use,&quot;&quot;easy to understand,&quot; and &quot;accurate and up-to-date.&quot; OIAS helped students plan careers, and talk with their parents about their career futures. Parents had a good understanding of the System and strongly approved of its use. Direct operating costs total about $2 per student user. (Author/SC)",

Upon completion of the OIAS questionnaire, which lists occupations to explore appropriate to aptitudes and interests, fifteen new registrants were asked to complete an evaluation of the process. The evaluation was concerned with their impressions of the system, opinions toward older people entering new occupations, their consideration of professions indicated  suitable by the system, and their ratings of various sources of occupational information.

        "description":"Teenage unemployment is a critical manpower problem. Youth most severely affected are minority group members and those with limited education. Many barriers stand in the way of their obtaining steady jobs: lack of training and experience, job movement, child labor laws, minimum wage standards, and competition for jobs from veterans and middle-aged women. Special measures are needed, such as a different minimum wage, manpower programs, and most importantly, career-oriented education so that those in the potential work force are trained to meet immediate needs for technological manpower. With the growth of blue collar, white collar, service- and goods-producing jobs, career education needs to prepare all students either to take a job or to enter their next step of educational  preparation when they leave high school. The development of a career education system requires the accomplishment of differing objectives at each level of the existing school system. Although vocational education has been the largest source of formal training for occupations not requiring a college education, implementation of vocational education legislation has met with some problems. Career education is more than specific job training and results in improving the transition from school to work, consequently greatly influencing the future employment picture of the country. (SC)",

To help the teacher in his role, a booklet on group communication exercises has been prepared that can be used in coordinating these class activities. A communication exercises which this staff felt would be appropriate for use in conjunction with a particular learning activity is suggested in the course study but need not be followed. Each teacher can best judge his or her own situation and is better prepared to make an appropriate choice of exercise. Not all of the classroom activities have accompanying communication exercise suggestions. Hopefully, as a  teacher becomes more relaxed in his role he will begin to incorporate some of his own ideas into exercises.

The first type of counseling focuses on information and clarification of issues. Innovations within this context have centered on: improving information acquisition, retrieval, and interpretation; and varying the format in which information is presented and integrated. The second type of counseling deals with a specific problem by focusing on decision-making skills while the third type views counseling as a continual process of development and adaptation. The fourth type of counseling stresses an individual's use of personal resources to influence his own occupational development. The report reviews current literature, presentations at professional meetings, and  program descriptions from a recent survey on outreach programming. The report concludes that vocational counseling programs are attempting to reach larger numbers of students through groups with peer leadership which offer longer term exposure to more comprehensive career materials and processes.

First, community conditions may impinge upon a child's capability, and freedom to learn. It is argued that instructional inputs highly incongruous with prior experiences of disadvantaged children disrupt sequential learning. Identification by pupil personnel workers of target groups of pupils presenting a cluster of interrelated problems and community strains can lead to interventive strategies of pimary prevention. Collaboration between schools and other community agencies is also viewed as contributing to preparation of students to assume social  responsibility as adult citizens. The third aspect of interdependence relates to collaboration in behalf of individual children experiencing difficulty in school, stressing the necessity for involvement of parents and children in referrals to community agencies, security in one's professional role and respect for the contributions of others, and issues in group deliberation and planning. Pupil personnel workers must give effective leadership within both school and community to enhance children's motivation and opportunities to learn. (Author/CJ)",

The subjects of the study were 72 male and 78 female undergraduate students. It was predicted that females would be more concerned with equality than males. Results supported the hypothesis since males divided money equally with a co-worker with equal inputs only when the total amount of reward was congruent with an internal standard of equitable pay; when reward level exceeded this amount, they gave more than 50% to themselves. Females, however, always divided the reward equally. (Author/LAA)",

        "description":"This thesis is an analysis of data concerning drug usage among three groups of young soldiers and isolates significant factors relating to characteristic interpersonal and intrafamilial relationships prevalent in these groups. Those soldiers dependent on drugs all came from families that they considered disharmonious. The following variables discriminated drug-dependent individuals: family relationship, father relationship, neighborhood status, teacher relationships, school preference, opium usage, barbiturate usage, marihuana usage, arrests, convictions, whether the natural parents were living, and whether the individual lived at home until the age of 16. To differentiate between drug users and non-drug users, the study derived a predictive formula consisting of family  relationship, teacher relationships, marihuana usage, and arrests. The author suggests the incorporation of sophisticated testing into Army selection procedures to detect maladjusted young men. (Author/LAA)",

The general hypothesis of the study states that marijuana will impair its user's ability to form and use abstract concepts. Twelve adult, male, experienced volunteer users of marijuana served as subjects for the study. To require the subjects to form and use abstract concepts in a variety of ways, the study administered the following tests: letter series, word grouping, conceptual clustering memory, closure speed, embedded figures, size-weight illusion, water-jar, hidden word, and anagram. Of the seven tests, results partially or strongly supported five,  failed to support one, and rejected one. In general, the study demonstrated drug-induced impairments with dosage level constituting an important factor in determining the results. (Author/LAA)",

        "description":"The Curricular-Career Information Service (CCIS) was an outreach, self-managed, multi-media based career guidance program designed for lower division college students. CCIS offered students basic information about career decision-making, a self-assessment experience, a large collection of curricular-career information, and information about campus and community referral resources. Various types of media, including audio and video cassettes, slidetapes, and printed materials were used. CCIS was staffed by residence hall RA's and a Career Guidance Specialist. Both process and product evaluations were carried out. In the product evaluation, CCIS users were significantly better able to identify and use career development resources, and had learned more about the career  decision-making process than CCIS non-users in both Landis and a comparison (no treatment) residence hall. No other significant differences appeared in the data provided by various instruments. The conclusion was that CCIS had been successful in moving through its establishment phase of development and in meeting some of the important goals identified for the pilot year. The decision has been made to continue CCIS for 1973-1974, and it is currently being modified and expanded. (Author)",

Capitalizing on the crisis or stress of the re-entry, service was offered to all veterans returning to Cleveland. Counselors' initial relationships with veterans tended to be built on short term assistance with concrete problems of adjustment; the overall objective, however, emphasized preventive mental health and growth. This two-part paper concentrates on operational difficulties encountered. The outreach counselor's role often entails pursuit of a reluctant but hurting client, and the uncertainty and frustration of this role may unduly center the counselor's attention on avoiding a breach in the relationship. To maintain contact with the  client, counselors often emphasized tangible objective services (e.g. help with GI Bill) and avoided personal problems. Yet the outreach counselor, though avoiding personal issues, is in a unique position to observe the client's needs and problems, resulting in some conflict. Intensive training, support, and supervision are needed in carrying out the difficult but therapeutically pwoerful role of re-entry counselor. Some evidence was obtained to indicate that verbal facility and prior training in human relations were essential qualifications for counselors. (Author)",

As a result of the study: (1) exemplary services were established in schools with little or no service; (2) the team model emerged as the answer to need and budgetary capabilities of local school districts; (3) an increase in number of children referred indicated a growth in teacher  awareness; (4) children improved significantly in achievement, personal adjustment and attendance with amount of improvement contingent on length of time the child was receiving pupil services; (5) children referred for services did not improve on measures of aptitude and social adjustment; and (6) the team approach was found to be more effective than the isolated pupil service worker approach.

The data for this study came from the questionnaire responses of 949 girls who were seniors in high school in 1967. The self-administered questionnaire included a scale of parent-child relations as well as measures of actual achievement (average high school grades) and aspirations for achievement (educational and occupational expectations). The highest overall achievement orientation was found among girls whose mothers were loving and demanding while their fathers were  rejecting and casual. In contrast the lowest achievement-oriented girls had mothers who were rejecting and casual and fathers who were loving and demanding. This reversal demonstrates that the particular combination of relationships with both parents is an important element in the achievement orientations of young women. The combinations of parent-child relations associated with high achievement orientations for girls was markedly different from those for boys. (Author/LP)",

The specific aims of the intervention were to reduce the disruptive, negative behavior of some socially powerful students while increasing the rewards for more appropriate models and for teacher efforts to improve classroom climate. The Ss were low-income black students in grades 4, 5 and 6. Eight teachers and 280 peers identified 64 actual or potential social leaders who were randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions. Teachers classified the Ss as generally positive or negative in attitudes and behavior. The effects of the intervention upon attitudes  of leaders were determined by measures of self-concept, locus of control, social efficacy, and attitudes toward school. Periodically, subject behavior was rated by teachers and coded by naive observers. Participation as leaders did reduce the tendency of subjects with negative attitudes and behavior to become increasingly negative. Males, especially, increased their sense of efficacy and internal acceptance of responsibility. The highest post-intervention self-reports came from the most successful leaders (as ranked by the experimenter). (Author/LP)",

Each of the factors generally accepted as affecting the child's future success is discussed. These factors and the author's reaction to them are: (1) The spurious nature of the correlation between IQ and reading ability should be recognized and linguistic competence brought into the equation. (2) The correlation between socioeconomic level and reading success is as irrelevant to success in learning to read as linguistic competence is relevant. (3) It is the language spoken orally around  the child, not the literature in the home, which is the factor relevant to correlation. (4) The correlation between emotional stability and reading should be classed on its own. (5) Physical amenities of the home should be looked at in terms of language usage in the home, not whether tap water flows. (6) Maturity of the learner relates to success in reading only indirectly through language and associate experiences. (WR)",

Findings in regard to the relation of specific to broad inference were inconclusive. A significant correlation was found between a  secondary measure of specific inference and the test of broad inference.

Their programs reflect their theoretical biases concerning the nature of Black English and the type and degree of interference that may exist between the language of the Standard English (SE) text and the child's dialect. The &quot;majority&quot; approach to dialect-caused reading problems is bidialectal, which suggests that SE should be taught as a supplementary or alternative dialect without stigmatizing the child's indigenous speech. Linguists vary in their approaches to this method. Some suggest methods which focus on teaching SE prior to reading or in the lower grades; others opt for methods which permit the child to read the traditional material in his own  dialect. Still others recommend that reading materials be altered to match the child's dialect. A more recent suggestion calls for a modification of dialect readers which avoid grammatical features not found in the child's dialect. Whatever the pedagogical justification, educators and linguists must be able to recognize how the community norms of interpretation are embodied in speech to avoid negative feedback from the community.

        "description":"A child whose behavior reflects only perception of a stimulus and reaction to it is considered more perceptually bound than an adult whose behavior is also directed by theories, values, and ideas. Based on this analysis three testable hypotheses emrege: (1) stimulus complexity is a better predictor of attention for the more perceptually bound, (2) the less perceptually bound, the more likely the individual would be to recall non-perceptual attributes of stimuli, and (3) the less perceptually bound, the more likely the individual would be to respond affectively to the non-perceptual attributes of the stimuli. Television commercials were chosen as the stimuli in a study in which 120 nursery, kindergarten, and second grade children from upper-middle-class neighborhoods in St. Paul,  Minnesota, viewed a videotaped presentation of \"The Partridge Family.\" The original commercials were deleted from the tape and commercials controlled for stimulus complexity and content were inserted. During and after the program, tests were administered to measure the children's degree of perceptual boundedness and the nature of their recall and affective responses to the commercials. Resulting data suggest that the younger the child, the greater the influence of perceptual attributes of stimuli on his attention behavior. (EE)",

Study A involved students who consistently scored high or low in percentile gain in the four ability groups, to ascertain any pattern of courses selected, sequences of courses attended, the degree of orientation toward achievement and toward acceptance pursued. Study B compared the performances of students in the experimental program with those in a traditional program. Study C involved a departmental design, administered, and evaluated writing exercises. Two types of comparisons were involved: an internal comparison of the same students for each year and a comparison of them as seniors with a control population of  seniors. Findings showed the different ability groups for each sex benefited seemingly equally from the experimental program, the relationship of achievement orientation and acceptance orientation of those consistently scoring the low and high percental gain was random, the results of the comparison of scores favored the experimental population, and the nonsequential selection of courses affected the students deleteriously when they first entered English, but they scored significantly better when seniors.

Since most of the developing nations see no alternative but to regard freedom of the press as an antithesis to industrial development, many such nations suppress press freedom. The relationship between developmental efforts and curtailment of press freedom can be observed in the degree of subsystem autonomy rather than the economic indices. A taxonomy of press freedom developed according to the political systems is referred to as \"Mobilized Modern Systems with High Differentiation and Secularization\" and \"Premobilized Modern Systems with Limited Differentiation and Secularization.\" Developing nations fall under the second category and all other nations under the  first. In analyzing subsystem autonomy, data reflect that if societal differentiation is high, the press is most likely to be free and vice versa. (DS)",

        "description":"A \"suburban newspaper\" cannot be simply defined as a \"newspaper published in the suburbs\" or a \"rural publication.\" Instead, a description of the suburb and the newspaper must be combined to arrive at a more sound definition of the term. A suburb is \"an area outside the political limits of a city but in that city's standard Metropolitan Statistical Area.\" James E. Pollard wrote that a \"newspaper\" is a publication \"issued at frequent and regular intervals, with a paid following of regular readers...carrying general news...editorials...and advertising.\" The first recognition of the suburban newspaper was in 1914 with the formation of the Suburban Publishers Association, but there was no academic recognition of the term at that time. The significance of the association was that its  members acknowledged that something did exist between city and country. In 1917, at a convention of the National Editorial Association, speakers urged the publication of \"suburban weeklies.\" However, it was not until post-World War II that the suburban newspaper flourished, coinciding, as it did, with the rapid growth of the suburbs.

The process of micropublishing which is most serviceable for short-run periodicals involves the use of microfiche--a small piece of film which can contain photo reductions of up to 98 pages of written or pictorial photocopy. The greatest advantage of using microfiche is its economy compared to the cost of printing, but the reader must insert the fiche into a viewer to enlarge each frame to the original page size so that it can be easily read. During transition to microfiche it is advisable to publish short-run publications in both microfiche and standard print. Although microfiche magazines  appeal to institutional subscribers (particularly libraries), individual subscribers may consider them inconvenient and may be resistant to micropublications until they are more widely accessible and less expensive than printed equivalents. If the current trend continues, the transition to microfiche may occur despite the reluctance of readers and magazine publishers. (EE)",

Such centers should be concerned both with handling inquiries in a particular field and with producing a general catalog of current information. Automatic analysis of texts by computers will be the best way to handle material, but, until that is possible, a semi-automatic method which calls for manual analysis for key-words and syntactic relations among them is a suitable method for the retrieval of information. The use of microfiche and the publication of current catalogs of documents contribute to a more efficient operation. A thesaurus listing key-words and their synonyms is also a suggested means for facilitating research. (VM)",

        "description":"To achieve the goal of communicative competence, second language instruction should incorporate the results of ethnomethodology research. Ethnomethodologists are interested in the shared rules of interpretation which members of a culture utilize during their conversational interchanges. \"Applied ethnomethodology\" in the ESL classroom would mean inclusion of materials which explicitly point out those implicit, underlying rules for interaction used by Americans, especially where they differ from the students' own. For example, the Japanese have a very strict code for who speaks next in a conversation--the older, higher--ranking person holding the floor until he voluntarily yields it to another. Interruption is frowned upon and there is little tradition of a dialectic style. The  Japanese, then, as well as other non-native English speakers, must learn not only a new language structure but new language behavior patterns. Rules for speaker selection and rules for interrupting may be introduced by using dialogues or other oral-skill-development techniques which simulate situations where such problems of interaction occur. Triologues, with two native speakers and one non-native speaker, can produce effective results. (HW)",

The courses provide an optional activity in which the exposure to English is through a real situation in learning subject matter. After several successful attempts, and some not so successful, the faculty isolated the factors to be considered in planning such a supplementary program. These factors include: (1) Courses should be offered at a time in the semester when a psychological break is needed, and when it will not interfere with the students' regular academic work: (2) A subject matter should be found that the teacher enjoys and that the students are not likely to have been exposed to: (3) The actual  material to be read or discussed should be carefully chosen. It is advisable to use something simple and authentic; (4) Audio-visual aids should be used to make the course more appealing; (5) A series of three or four lectures in one week seems to constitute the right length for the course; (6) Not much, if any, outside work should be required, and students ought not to be forced to participate if they do not want to; and (7) Each lecture should be self-contained. Subject-matter possibilities for mini-courses are unlimited: what is important is the rewarding feeling of a shared interest or experience and a realization that English can be vehicle for real communication.

Through the use of the Delphi procedure, approximately 100 persons interacted to establish a list of functions that nongovernmental accreditation should serve or seek to serve and a statement of principles that should characterize its organization. The following recommendations and observations were reached as a result of this study: (1) Accrediting agencies should more clearly, specifically, and forthrightly state their purposes for accrediting; (2) Institutions and accrediting agencies should move  deliberately, but swiftly, to establish a national body to coordinate, monitor, and supervise accreditation of postsecondary education; (3) Nongovernmental accreditation should engage in two practices to enhance its credibility: (a) make increasing use of independently appointed public representatives, and (b) utilize a public hearing approach to the development of major policies and standards, and (4) Accrediting agencies should increasingly involve related professions in the membership of both their policy-and decisionmaking bodies and visiting teams.

The impact of the BOG program on student financial needs at seven types of institutions under current (1972-73) conditions of costs, enrollments, student financial needs, and student financial aid resources is reviewed. A summarization of the estimated impact suggests that a fully funded or partially funded BOG program would reduce the estimated financial needs at Alabama colleges and universities to $27.71 million and the unmet financial needs to an estimated $4.08 million. A partially but sufficiently funded BOG program, making a major proportion of the grant amounts anticipated in the  program, would reduce estimated financial needs in the state to $35.17 million and the unmet financial needs to an estimated $16.65 million.

This paper reports some estimates of the monetary trade-off between specialization and occupational flexibility in the Ph.D's choice of major at undergraduate and graduate school. These estimates are based for the most part on multiple regression analysis of educational background and career data for a sample of 30,000 Ph.D.'s in the sciences. These data indicate that Ph.D.'s whose education is more occupationally specific, because they took the same field as an undergraduate major as that in which they earned their Ph.D., have career mobility that is 10% lower than those Ph.D.'s whose education was less specialized. In addition, when a specialist moves out of her Ph.D.  occupation she receives a salary increment for the occupational switch that is about $800 less than the non-specialist's. On the other hand, specialists who remain employed in their Ph.D. field earn a return of about $80 per year on the extra skill they acquired in their Ph.D. specialty by taking the same field as an undergraduate major.

A random sample of 326 students, 98 faculty, and 95 staff participated in the project which was directed by Dr. John Bruce Francis of SRC. Respondents answered a combination of both \"closed\" and \"open-ended\" questions on current campus issues such as the presence of ROTC, drug use, intercollegiate football, evaluation, campus protest, minority issues, health service, and governance. Results indicated that despite a then-current stereotype, the campus community was not a hotbed of radical dissent and permissive  attitudes. Indications of this were that a majority of those polled disagree with the use of extreme protest tactics, favor a \"tough\" stance against the use and distribution of hard drugs, favor joint evaluation of course work by teacher and student rather than evaluation by the student alone, and feel that the University should make special efforts to improve its relations with the community.

Gallaudet College, an institution for the deaf in Washington, D.C., feels it has found a solution to the accountability problem in the use of &quot;measurable objectives&quot; in its program planning. The first phase from January 1 through June 30, 1972 of Gallaudet's program planning produced three and ten-year projections or program plans by all college units, based on then-current mission statements and program assumptions. A critical path method (CPM) network was developed for this first phase and reviewed with unit administrators, with chairmen of instructional departments, with student representatives, and with a group of eight outside consultants. The second phase of Gallaudet's master-plan  development involved an emphasis on three objectives: the expression of goals in measurable terms, management based on program plans expressed in measurable objectives, and computer simulation to aid in administrative decisionmaking. Gallaudet is employing the PLANTRAN II computer program in its current effort to develop long-range budget projections for each department. One element attributed to the success of Gallaudet's new planning effort is an institutional commitment to provide the necessary funds and manpower so that the master plan can be continually updated on an annual basis.

Research into student preferences has produced some basic requirements: privacy, - interaction, territory, security, safety, a sense of identity, a sense of belonging, and a sense of responsibility for the environment. These requirements have led to changes in the physical design of new residential buildings and to major renovations of existing dormitories. Some changes include space for spontaneous activities, space of pedestrians and cyclists, and good accessibility of services. Concern has been shown for the number of housing units in each campus neighborhood, the number of students per unit, and the number of people per  acre. Building entrances should be oriented to the campus center wherever possible. In renovation projects, care should be taken to preserve the character of the original design. Examples of residence hall innovations are presented including those of Bowie State College, Lawrence University, University of Denver, Calem State College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and California State College at Humboldt.

Data were obtained from a national study of 1950-1953 post-master's students; a recent pilot project in attrition conducted at the University of California, Berkeley; and on trend data in doctoral attrition provided by the Graduate Division at Berkeley. Emphasis is placed on the sex differences in the trends, particularly concerning the processes which operate to drive men as well as women out of graduate school. Some concrete ways in which graduate students can take charge of their own autonomy to become apprentices, and ultimately colleagues are suggested. (Author/MJM)",

The objectives of the program are: (1) to give manpower assistance to agencies concerned with economic and social development; (2) to provide opportunities for students to participate in the solution of social and economic problems; and (3) to encourage students to consider careers in development programs and public service. This publication is an anthology of articles written by those who first helped to start the service-learning programs and is divided into three sections. Section I deals with the development of the service-learning concept, section II with  translation of the concept into a variety of settings, and section III with attempts at evaluating both the concept and practice. A major result of this program has been the emergence of a philosophy that can apply to the broader development of off-campus experiences for students by providing students with opportunities to combine social and economic internships with their college programs.

This report is a comparative analysis of the probable major fields of study of freshmen in regard to three of the above-mentioned years at the University of South Carolina and the national norms of the other participating universities. Results indicated the percentage of entering freshmen with indicating intentions to major in pre-professional areas and the social and behavioral sciences is increasing, while there appears to be a decreasing percentage of freshmen planning to major in engineering and business administration. The  prospective major of most male freshmen is in business or professional areas, while the majority of women are planning to major in non-M.D. health professions, education, arts and letters, or social and behavioral science. Increasing percentages of entering U.S.C. freshmen are, however, undecided in their choice of a prospective major. (MJM)",

On the one hand, bargained agreements may tend to set the pace in areas of salary and working conditions that must be met by any nonbargaining institution if they desire to be comparable or competitive. On the other hand, nonbargaining institutions may generate efforts to demonstrate that more can be attained by faculty without the necessity of collective bargaining. Taken altogether there is evidence of a clear intrusion of collective bargaining in the arena of postsecondary education more than sufficient to warrant serious attention and study.The advent of collective bargaining can lead to an imbalance of power, presumably on the side that initiated the process.  If this should occur, it may be because those who receive the impact do not know how to react or are ill-equipped to do so. Yet the existence of a balance of power may represent the greater hope of the attainment of productive outcomes from the collective bargaining process. (Author/PG)",

(2) What types of manpower information are available to assist in rational educational planning? (3) What can educational institutions and agencies do to improve the adaptation of postsecondary education to the needs of society and of the individual? A mere statistical response to needs for information about manpower supply and demand provides no guarantee of operational application. Manpower projections, knowledge of new  delivery systems, know-how in techniques for speeding up or improving the training of personnel in a given profession, development of barometers for reading early symptoms of change in anticipated manpower requirements are some ingredients of a comprehensive program in manpower and education. Leadership and informed judgment in application are needed to translate them into practice. (Author/MJM)",

The stated purpose of the study was to ascertain problem areas so that New Jersey institutions could voluntarily address themselves to those  inequities. Conclusions include: (1) Women are disproportionately concentrated at the lower ranks. (2) At all ranks women are particularly underutilized at the four-year institutions. (3) Women are underutilized at upper administrative levels throughout the state. Part-time faculty should have equivalency of rank, salary, responsibility and access to tenure as full-time faculty. (5) Each college should evaluate its own committees to determine whether or not women are represented on committees in proportion to their responsibilities on the faculty. (6) Policies concerning nepotism and maternity leave should be written statements and not unwritten practices subjectively interpreted. Appendices include related tables. (Author/PG)",

The sample consists of the 346 students who appeared before the University Discipline Committee for major offenses and were not adjudged innocent. Results indicate: (1) out-of-state students have continued to commit major offenses in greater numbers than would be expected based on the percentage of these students in the total male undergraduate population; (2) out-of-state students from the Middle Altantic States committed a greater number of major discipline offenses than those from the Southern states based on the relative percentage of all undergraduate male students enrolled at U.S.C. from these regions; (3) over half of  both out-of-state and in-state offenders were freshmen; and (4) out-of-state offenders graduated almost twice as often in the lower half of their high school class as compared to their in-state counterparts. Recommendations suggest: (1) admission policies relating to out-of-state male students should be periodically reviewed; (2) the incidence of major discipline offenses by out-of-state students should be a matter of continued observation; and (3) state of residence should be considered a research variable in other student studies.

        "description":"To identify effective new practices and trends in college student development, recent literature was reviewed and nominations of effective programs were solicited from over 1,100 leaders in related fields. More than 200 programs were identified. Approximately 60 programs distributed among almost 50 colleges and universities were found to contain promising approaches for meeting student developmental needs. These approaches clustered around four primary thrusts or emerging trends: (1) serving the educationally disadvantaged; (2) providing services that personalize higher education; (3) liberalizing the curriculum to meet developmental needs in addition to those that are vocational; and (4) restoring or recreating a sense of community within the institutions. Projection of these  trends seems to suggest the probable emergence of a more democratic, less vocationally oriented concept of higher education, with student developmental needs receiving more attention. Consideration of utilization of individual new approaches led to the creation of a model of a complex institution of higher education. The model incorporates all four of the basic trends reflecting urgent student developmental needs and many of the specific exemplary programs. (Author/MJM)",

Highlights indicated: (1) More than 1.1 million degrees were conferred at the bachelor's and higher levels in 1970-71 by 1,644 institutions of higher education in the U.S. (2) Publicly controlled institutions awarded 65% of the degrees in 1970-71 and 1969-70, up from 63% in 1968-69. (3) In 1970-71, publicly controlled institutions awarded 66% of the bachelor's degrees, 43% of the first-professional degrees, 66% of the master's degrees, and 65% of the doctor's degrees. (4) Men received 59% of all degrees in 1970-71 and 60% in 1969-70. (5) The largest  discipline divisions, in terms of degrees conferred: 54% of all bachelors degrees were in education, social sciences and business and management; 57% of all master's degrees were in education, business and management, and social sciences; and 45% of all doctor's degrees were in education, physical sciences, and social sciences. (6) Elementary education had the highest number of degrees at the bachelor's and master's level; law, at the first-professional level; and chemistry, at the doctor's level. (7) All institutions to which the survey instrument was sent responded to the request for data. (Author/MJM)",

Responses from the 669 usable returned questionnaires indicated: (1) The nation's colleges and universities have implemented many policies and practices designed to meet the needs of larger and more heterogeneous student bodies. (2) The extent to which different types of institutions have implemented particular policies and practices varies considerably. (3) Many institutions give either academic credit or advanced placement for external learning experiences. (4) About 65% of the institutions have some form of open admissions. (5) Students and guidance counselors would do well to note that many institutions  favor admission on a first-come-first-serve basis. (6) Quota systems in admissions are relatively rare. (7) Nearly all institutions report that students evaluate teaching effectiveness. (8) Over three-fourths of the institutions exert some control over student publications.

The present report continues this series and focuses on the courses MLK students have taken in the college of liberal arts (CLA) from the fall 1970 through the summer 1972. The purposes of the report are the following: (1) to describe the academic records of MLK students in CLA courses, and (2) to compare CLA grade point averages for various subgroups of students. These analyses were based on transcripts of 650 MLK students. A total of 1,015 different CLA courses were taken by the  MLK students during that period of time. However, 104 of the courses had more than 10 MLK students registered during the period; of the courses, mean course grade point was &quot;C&quot; or higher in over 94% of the courses. The analysis of individual grade point averages across courses did not yield any significant subgroup (college of entrance, year of entrance, status at entrance, ethnic group, sex, age at entrance) differences.

        "description":"At the University of Maryland, 758 randomly selected incoming freshman students were administered an anonymous poll regarding their sexual attitudes and behavior. Results showed that the Maryland freshman generally resembled other U.S. college students in their sexual experience. Approximately half (52% of males, 46% of females) reported that they had had intercourse. Most students believed in sexual intercourse before marriage (77% of males and 69% of females) but most (44%) felt it appropriate only with someone with whom they were deeply involved emotionally. Students who had had intercourse tended to be older, more likely to know someone who had had an abortion, more likely to know homosexuals and less likely to feel that homesexuals need psychological or medical help than are  sexually inexperienced students. Results of the factor analysis showed that sexual attitudes and behavior appear to be relatively independent dimensions that should be studied and discussed separately. Overall this study shows less of a gap between attitudes and behavior than in past studies. This is an important point for those working with students since many student programs on many topics tended to be \"remedial\" in nature. That is, they attempt to bring perceptions and reality in line. If there is not a disparity, the roles of student personnel workers must change. Suggested roles are discussed. (Author)",

They were compared on the following dimensions: (1) academic achievements; (2) attrition from the university; (3) University Student Census responses; (4) cost of physical damage to buildings; and (5) number of reported incidents such as theft, vandalism, and disturbances. No significant differences were found among residents in the different types of dorms on academic achievement or  attrition. Some scattered differences were found on responses to the census. Coed and male dorms reported generally more building damage and incidents than female dorms. High-rise dorms generally reported more damages and incidents than low-rise dorms. Limited visitation hours dorms reported less incidents overall than unlimited visitation hours dorms, but reported higher damage costs than the unlimited hours dorms. This study suggests that type of housing is not a key element in the lives of most students. (Author)",

Following brief opening remarks the author elaborates on the black experience in America, and the attempts of higher education institutions to assimilate blacks into the \"white\" society in the past. Minority education repudiates this attempted assimilation and strives to preserve the richness, pride, inventiveness, joy, and intensity of feeling of the black race. The author touches on Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965, Aid to Developing Colleges, and its importance in helping build black institutions into the fine institutions they represent today. The author then concludes with a plea for the graduates to choose education as a  career, especially career education, special education, and preschool education, where the country needs able specialists.

The primary objectives of the program are as follows: (1) to enable the students to identify pertinent educational problems and to formulate appropriate questions for research and policy decisions; (2) to acquaint the students with the general statistical procedures used in analyzing the nature or problems involved in the educational process; (3) to provide an opportunity for undergraduate students to actually participate in the conceptualization, development and evaluation of an educational research project; and (4) to identify qualified black students who are interested in pursuing graduate studies in  educational development or in other related areas. It is apparent from the findings that in spite of their limited resources, black colleges are capable of providing adequate educational research experiences at the undergraduate level. Based on the findings and the conclusions of this report the following recommendations are made: (1) The federal government should continue to fund the research institute on an annual basis. (2) The research institute should be expanded to include: (a) multiple institutes operating simultaneously at different locations or colleges; and (b) the Academic Year Research Methodology Institute. Appendices include the institute staff and description of the site. (For related document, see ED 068 076.) (Author)",

The contents  include: definition of the associate of arts degree; responsibility for general education requirements; pre-professional course responsibility; admission to upper division programs that are competitive due to space or fiscal limitation; other associate degrees and certificates; publication of upper division requirements; statement of lower division prerequisite requirements; standard transcript form, and experimental programs.

The first trend includes the proportion of the State budget allocated for higher education in the future, which will be no greater in 1980 than it is now. The major trend that forces less funding is the establishment of a new set of social priorities (health care, common schools, environment, and recreation). Still another trend is the government's policy to reduce dollars for programs that aid institutions and instead give financial aid to students so that they may attend institutions of their choice. The fourth trend indicates that higher education will no longer be a growth industry unless an entirely new constituency can be attracted and unless  continuing education becomes an accepted pattern in our society. Perhaps the most important of the major trends is the increasing tendency for those who desire training to attend proprietary and industrial schools rather than traditional colleges, universities, or community colleges. A final trend, collective bargaining, is less clearly established than the others, but it could turn out to be at least as important as any so far mentioned. The cumulative impact of these trends cannot be fully anticipated, but they point directly to greater centralized planning at the state level. (Author/PG)",

A group of 10 graduates were selected from the 30 graduated in fall 1972 for lengthy interviews about their experiences at Empire State College. The sample included a range of persons with different educational backgrounds, life experiences, varied career interests, and individual approaches to learning methods. The structure of the student interviews center around six elements: interpersonal competence (the ability to interpret the intention and attitudes of others and to improvise appropriate responses); awareness (openness to  new ideas and experiences); clarifying purposes (self examination); Self-reliance; self-understanding and understanding of others; and self-consistency. Initial contacts with ESC, contracts and evaluations of learning, and personal contacts were all rated either satisfactory or better. Orientation, program of study, and assessment of prior learning were rated less than satisfactory. The report included the questions asked during the student interviews. (Author/PG)",

        "description":"A variety of pressures from students, alumni, legislators, and administrators has led to increasing concern about the quality of college instruction. In education and psychology, innovation frequently involves either the development of more precise behavioral approaches or more humanistics approaches; yet innovation often occurs without systematic consideration of broad goals and purposes. Failure to analyze goals and purposes lead too easily to fragmentary conceptions of how instruction should be planned, implemented, and evaluated. The Learner Controlled Instruction (LCI) approach attempts to define broad goals and to use an adaptation of Glaser's Basic Teaching Model to provide a framework for instructional design and evaluation. The learner assumes considerable autonomy in  deciding what and how to learn and in evaluation; he has responsibility, however, for clarifying his goals and intentions and communication with the instructor. The goals and purposes of LCI are examined in relation to the cognitivee and affective taxonomies, Torrance's definition of creativity, and Parnes' creative problemsolving model. A variety of criteria are described for evaluating instructional innovations in three categories: basic psychological aptitudes and traits; student report data; and internalization and application criteria.

        "description":"There is no unique answer to the question of what an ongoing program costs in medical schools. The estimates of program costs generated by classical methods of cost accounting are unsatisfactory because such accounting cannot deal with the joint production or joint cost problem. Activity analysis models aim at calculating the impact of alternative combinations of school activities. As now practiced, activity analysis yields the incremental cost of an activity given all other school activities, that is, pure program costs. Such analysis is a potentially useful management tool. Input/output analysis is a special form of activity analysis in which some activities provide both final outputs and input into other activities. Following the introduction in Section I, this paper deals  with cost analysis in section II and III. Section II discusses cost allocation studies that use the tools of classical cost accounting. Section III analyzes the use of linear regression as a tool for cost allocation, and Section IV examines activity analysis and optimization analysis. (Author/PG)",

Findings include: (1) Optimum demand, based on dental care for all in the next decade, would require 2,495 additional dentists. (2) Women find a career in dentistry to be very satisfactory but only one-half percent of the dentists in the United States are women. (3) Changing to a 3-year instead of a 4-year dental school curriculum could produce 232 to 320 additional dentists in 1973-80 and meet more than half of the need for more dental manpower. (4) If the water supply were universally flouridated in Pennsylvania, the manpower need for dentists would be reduced, thus providing manpower for improved care. (5) Projected dental manpower needs  for Pennsylvania for 1973-80 can be met without increasing dental school facilities by (a) enrolling more Pennsylvania students in Pennsylvania dental schools, thus reducing nonresident admissions, and (b) increasing the use of dental auxiliaries, particularly dental assistants.

The consequence is a new emphasis upon resource allocation that is only possible if the required data about program costs, program outputs, and program income are readily available. The task of the new management in higher education is to gather the needed information for intelligent, persuasive resource allocation. This paper is a summary of a conference of cost simulation models, how to end the confusion surrounding them, and how to promote the need for serious long-range planning in higher education. The contents include definitions, case studies, problems, evaluation, and applications of cost simulation models. Presented are individual experiences with cost simulation models at Colorado  University with CAMPUS: RRPM at Portland State University; PLANTRAN at the University of Denver; SEARCH at Eight Colleges; and Computerized Financial Planning at the University of Maine.

The impact of the program on the financial health of the receiving institutions is measured by an index of institutional financial health. The Index is composed of a series of ratio analyses using selected data from the annual Higher Education General Information System (HEGIS) reports. The Index design permits isolation of any one of nine categories of variables and thus permits  evaluation of any one of the variables relative to the overall financial health of each of the institutions or of a group of institutions with a common intervening program, such as state assistance. The findings reflect both satisfaction on the part of the receiving schools and measurable improvement in the financial health of the institutions as measured by the Index. Appendices are included.

Trend Surface Analysis is such a model. It is simple to apply, analytical in nature, and results in a graphic display in the form of a map. To the extent that the description of the population reflects demands on higher education and the degree to which regional characteristics are helpful is the level of utility of Trend Surface Analysis. Trend Surface Analysis and other mapping techniques offer significant potential for providing information regarding broad regional bases. Even though all of the information displayed in the contour maps is available in a number of tables, the interpretation of these data  is greatly simplified when viewed as a map. A second advantage is the ability to compare data drawn from various sources. Universities as well as other large public concerns need to sense the desires of the populations they serve. Studies of public demand are the first step on the road to accountability. Trend Surface Analysis offers a promising technique for interpreting the large volumes of data that accompany statewide assessment. (Author)",

Following an examination of various legal cases, the law of privacy is related to public disclosure of private facts seems to require the following disclosures: private facts about the plaintiff, made public with identification of plaintiff, and which facts are offensive to a reasonable person of reasonable sensibilities. Recommended guidelines concerning the release of student information by registrars and admissions officers are examined. The recommended guidelines place more emphasis upon ethics than upon case law. However, if the administration discloses private facts about the plaintiff, makes the  facts public, which clearly identify the plaintiff, and which are offensive to a reasonable sensibilities, the court would likely hold that there has been a violation of the right of privacy.

As a result of the study, four recommendations suggest: (1) Affiliated programs between the University of Virginia School of Medicine and Medical Center and certain other medical communities to increase health manpower and achieve other objectives are highly desirable and feasible, and further development and expansion of such programs should be undertaken immediately. (2) The University of Virginia School of Medicine should be provided  faculty and administrative budgetary support in the coming biennium for the continued development and implementation of affiliated programs already initiated in Roanoke and Winchester. (3) More detailed planning for necessary curriculum changes, the inclusion of other communities, housing, communications, and other logistical problems related to affiliated programs should be specifically studied and planned by the Commission during the next biennium. (4) The University of Virginia School of Medicine and Medical Center should plan continually for future health manpower needs in the State and should prepare for their role in fulfilling these needs.

These experiences are commonly called an internship and are conducted during the student's academic career; are within the student's major field of study; and earn academic credit. The program's 3 major goals are as follows: (1) developing the administrative capacity to conduct an intern program stressing service and learning; (2) creating a focal point for campus-wide activities involving students in community or off-campus programs; and (3) educating all of the participants in the operation of a meaningful service-learning internship  program. The service-learning internship give the student an opportunity to apply academic study to an actual working experience; opens up new areas of interest, study, and possible employment for the student; makes the student more attractive because of the internship to a potential employer; and provides potential employers with an opportunity to recognize the worth and value of the individual student and others like him or her. Appendices include a grant application, budget explanations, CEP Advisory Council, Senate Bill 197, and the by-laws of the Advisory Council. (Author/PG)",

In this report, the educational experiences and progress of undergraduate students who were not high achievers in secondary school will be compared with the experiences and progress of those who were. One of the purposes of this report is to determine the characteristics of a college--independent of student input--that maximize the chances that a low achiever will complete the degree in the traditional four years. The ultimate objective of this line of investigation is to determine what policy actions decisionmakers in higher education can take to facilitate the degree completion of \"atypical\" students. Results included the following: (1) Low achievers differed  from typical undergraduates in many important ways. (2) Men outnumbered women, and the proportions of nonwhites and older students were higher among low achievers than among regular students. (3) Low achievers were more likely to aspire to careers in business than were regular students and were less likely to be solely motivated by the academic quality of the college they attended. (4) Low achievers also had lower degree aspirations than did regular students, who were more likely to plan on postgraduate degrees.

Three salient points made by the authors indicate: (1) The University's main concern was with the development of its own physical plant; community development was a peripheral concern. However, both the community member and the city representative show that the community was concerned with the inter-relationships and consequences of residential, commercial and institutional development. (2) The University usually takes a progmatic approach to expansion, viewing its constituency as regional and national, and thus is less concerned about the expansion's negative impact on Oakland. In contrast, the community and the  city are very much concerned with the University's impact on Oakland, and moreover, the community expects the University to adhere to a higher standard of citizenship and service than is usually expected of institutions. (3) The three writers agree that the University was not responsive to changes in societal values which would have required citizen input to institutional planning. (Author/MJM)",

Part II reviews the governing arrangements for these early colleges, the evolution of the corporate idea during the 18th century, the influence of Lockean philosophy, the  background of the Dartmouth College Case and its decision, and the ensuing distinction between public and private colleges and universities. A concluding section very briefly surveys the implications of the Dartmouth College decision and the modifications to it by subsequent court cases, the total impact of which was to establish the parameters for the corporate models as basis for American college and university government.

        "description":"The basic premise of this paper is: if current management and fiscal problems are to be solved in higher education, planners and decisionmakers must adopt an outcome-oriented approach to planning. In the past, most planners have tended to be means-oriented, focusing more attention on problems associated with the course of action being followed and less on the end results to be achieved. It is argued that planners should begin focusing on the desired, expected, and actual outcomes of programs as they relate to the planning process. Although an outcome-oriented approach to planning should be beneficial, it is not without its problems. Among the problems discussed are that of reaching consensus on institutional goals and objectives, the lack of variance problems in attributing  outcomes to institutional and program effects, the need for a greater variety of criterion measures, and the problems of couching all outcomes in terms of measurable criteria. In this paper, the authors do not seek to advance outcome-oriented planning as a cure-all. Rather, they have devoted a major part of this paper to discussion of the problems associated with this suggested approach. On the other hand, they do not view these problems as insurmountable. Accordingly, the final section of this paper discusses possible lines of future research that may facilitate the implementation of outcome-oriented planning. (Author/PG)",

Those schools interviewed were the University of California at Berkeley, Davis, Santa Cruz; California State University at Long Beach, Los Angeles, San Jose, Sonoma; and California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo. The document contains descriptions of each campus. The study recommends that: (1) minimum and maximum enrollment standards should be determined for each institution of higher education; (2) such enrollment standards should be established by the respective governing boards of  each segment for each campus within that segment, with the recommendation of that campus and the endorsement of the chief executive of the segment; (3) educational programs, economy of scale, physical community, and internal organization of the institution should be utilized in determining the enrollment ranges.

Most urban citizens did not consider the campus disturbance to be a legitimate form of social protest. Urban citizens with more positive attitudes about campus dissent and those who did not believe that many subversive  activities were going on at the University were more apt to view the disturbance as a legitimate form of social protest.

Predoctors were SAT-Verbal and Math and high school grades (HSGPA) using multiple regression equations. Results showed that many different patterns of prediction for different race-sex subgroups emerged. For instance, HSGPA is less useful in predicting grades beyond the freshman year and is a consistently poor predictor for black males. Black males were the least predictable and white females were the most predictable subgroup. The results were discussed in terms of past research and alternative predictors for subgroups. The writers conclude that predicting grades beyond the  freshman year is useful and that separate prediction equations for race-sex subgroups should be employed. As more black students enter colleges and universities, this area of research should continue and the employment of experimental predictors should be attempted. (Author)",

Means and standard deviations and the 66 plus -33 minus scale scores were reported for each sample. Differences between black and white CUES scale scores were determined using t at the .05 level. Black freshmen expected more Practicality and Propriety and less Awareness using the mean scoring method.  Similar results occurred with the 66 -33 minus method except Propriety just missed being significant. A discussion of the results was presented and research questions suggested. (Author)",

This system allowed students to choose not only the pace at which they would advance through a curriculae but also allowed them the choice of output mode (paper versus tests) and areas of concentration. By rewarding student participation in helping to find educational resources and in supervised grading, it was possible to run individualized courses without resort to paraprofessors. Responses to standardized professor evaluation forms were noticeably superior to either concurrent control classes or previous control courses. In the two courses for which results are reported either significant increases in student productivity or shifts in student responses to evaluation forms from too hard to too easy  for the same work output were found.

Responses of the students to the questionnaire items in terms of frequencies and percentages are reported. Results indicated a decline in the percentage of the senior classes indicating an expectation to enroll the following fall in a college or university on a full-time basis. This drop in stated plans was accompanied by a drop in the percentages of high school classes actually entering college. Results are categorized according to composition of high school class by race and sex, trends in post high school plans by sex  and race, trends in types of institutions named by students, level of family income, intended plans versus actual courses of action, and noncollege bound respondents. Statistical data are included. (MJM)",

An evaluation and analysis of the data collected for this project leads to the following conclusions: (1) Private higher education institutions in Delaware as well as in other states provide a valuable service and have a role to play in meeting the educational needs of Delaware students. (2) It is in the highest public interest to preserve the vitality of Delaware's private colleges. (3) A precedent has already been established for public assistance to students in Delaware based on the provision of scholarships to students pursuing courses of study in special areas. (4) Thirty-five states have established some  type of public financial assistance for private higher education clearly demonstrating the need for such a program. (5) The most common method of state financial aid to private higher education is by means of aid to students. A recommendation of the study states that consideration should be given to some form of financial assistance to private higher education in Delaware in the future. (Author/PG)",

The general introduction presents two principles that are considered important in discussing the report: social responsiveness and quality. The best form of social responsiveness is to ensure the preservation of the highest quality of all forms of postsecondary education. The problem is that the quality of education may take second place to the administration of services, or that education in the university will take place in spite of, and not because of, the elaborate bureaucratization of postsecondary education. After studying the final version of the Commission's report, the COU isolated a few subjects of particular importance  to discuss comprehensively in this document. These matters are as follows: the place occupied by high standards of quality in the Commission's priorities; the structure of the system; the financing; student aid; and the place of examinations in licensure for professional practice.

It is addressed not only to federal officials but to all those concerned with questions of national educational leadership. Two over-riding themes dominate. First, in addition to supporting access to college, and subsidizing research and manpower training in various areas, the federal government must shift its concern from encouraging growth to a new concern for effectiveness throughout postsecondary education. Second, the federal government must develop a new concern for the form of public support, for how decisions are made, and for the purposes to be achieved, in order to preserve conditions under which postsecondary education  can remain viable and responsive. Attention and analysis must be focused not only on the levels of public support for postsecondary education, but on the purposes and forms of federal and state involvement as well. After the foreword and introduction, this document is divided into six sections: (1) The Implications of the Egalitarian Commitment; (2) The End of Guaranteed Social Mobility; (3) New Requirements for Effective Education; (4) New Political Realities; (5) The Federal Presence in Higher Education; and (6) The Federal Role in Postsecondary Education.

Current literature on innovative programs in higher education, such as the Union for Experimenting Colleges and Universities, was reviewed. Two site visits were conducted, one to Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University in Davis, California, and the other to Miami Data Community College in Miami, Florida. Results indicated that a major problem exists in the Modal Learning Concept in that many community college educators surveyed believe that they are already implementing innovations that  combine existing community resources. A seminar with community college Chicano Studied directors and administrators is recommended to increase their understanding of the Modal Learning Concept. It is felt that, with good salesmanship, educators can be convinced that their innovations can be improved. Such a change would be facilitated by the creation of an environment by administrators that would encourage experimentation and would allow for possible subsequent failure. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"Faculty termination criteria of community/junior colleges in Texas and Michigan were studied, and case law was researched to determine how definitive the criteria need to be and how the courts have interpreted general criteria. In Texas, 37 public two-year colleges were surveyed, with 25 replying. Of these, 11 institutions supplied policy statements that were basically a restatement of the Coordinating Board, Texas College and University System, criteria with one or two additional institutional criteria. These criteria for dismissing both a faculty member and a probationary faculty member are: (1) the demonstration of professional incompetence, (2) the demonstration of moral turpitude, and (3) the gross neglect of professional responsibilities. A list is compiled of the dismissal  criteria of the 25 colleges. In Michigan, 29 public community/junior colleges were surveyed, with 20 responding. Of these 20, 7 have criteria of various degrees of specificity. The faculty dismissal criteria for these seven institutions are listed. Case law and the most common dismissal criteria are discussed from the standpoints of: legal basis for institutional development of sismissal criteria, courts' interpretation of dismissal criteria, the interpretation of case law. A case law perspective of the dismissal of nontenured faculty is then discussed as related to the rights of nontenured personnel in a termination. Finally, a case law perspective of the dismissal of tenured personnel as a response to financial exigency is presented. An annotated bibliography prepared from a computer  search of ERIC materials concludes the report. (DB)",

The purposes of the survey were to: (1) determine if the agency had designated staff with exclusive or primary responsibility for providing administrative services to local student affairs staffs; (2) detefmine academic and professional background of state-level student personnel services staff; (3) determine the nature of the state agency staff's organization; and (4) develop a useable directory of personnel at the various agencies to facilitate interstate communication and cooperation. A questionnaire, designed for the survey, contained questions in three major areas: Staffing, Administrative Organization, and Relationships with other Agencies. The  questionnaire was distributed to the chief state officer for community colleges. Five states did not respond. Results of an analysis of the questionnaire data showed that: (1) 21% of the state agencies had one or more staff members who routinely were engaged a percentage of his time in student affairs; 10 of the 24 professional held the doctorate, 3 held advanced master's degrees, 10 had a master's degree, and 1 had a bachelor's degree; (2) 22 agencies had made provision for regular meetings of the chief student affairs officers of the colleges , and 11 states have established formalized councils; meetings are held to exchange information, make recommendations, and provide for in-service training; and (3) the student affairs staff member seems to relate most frequently to the  Vocational/Technical Education Division, Pupil Personnel or Guidance Division, and State Financial Aid Agency.

Clustering is defined as \"an active group exchange and/or interchange of three or more people that center their attention around a particular objective.\" There are multiple and expansive cluster shapes that can be used by a class for receiving and offering ideas and information. The most important role and function of the instructor in the cluster concept is one of collation. This involves bringing together what has been interchanged, and tying in the cluster activities and discussions. The procedure is not synergetic unless there is an attempt at synthesis. Examples of material around which clustering can operate effectively, which show that the synergism involved permits more learning to take place, are: questions and  question-sheets, problems and topics, papers and handouts, and evaluation and grading. Nineteen guidelines for successful clustering are provided. It is concluded that when clustering is working, the student feels freer, is autonomous, yet cooperatively associated, and more constantly involved and active. Appendixes provide cluster diagrams.

        "description":"Mastery learning is an approach to learning whereby students are expected to demonstrate competence of one level, or unit, of learning objectives before advancing to the next level. Most junior college instruction is group-paced, with the instructor determining the rate with which units are presented. One compromise between existing instruction and ideal mastery learning techniques is to provide specific supplementary instruction for those students who fail to master a given unit, while maintaining the group pace. The research reported focused on one form of that compromise: the effect of teaching one additional lesson per unit to those students who did not achieve mastery of that unit. Another part of the research examined the effect of providing students with detailed  behavioral objectives. The research was conducted in selected English and algebra courses at five community colleges in Southern California. Dependent variables were scores on semester exam and mastery rates, as defined by the proportion of the number of students who received A's, B's, and C's to the total number enrolled. The results of the research are reported separately for the English and algebra classes. In the algebra classes, the students received testing and remediation for mastery, and they achieved significantly higher final exam scores than control students. There was no significant difference between mastery rates of experimental and control students. In the English classes, the students who received detailed behavioral objectives scored significantly higher on their final  exam than did control subjects who did not receive the objectives.

        "description":"The options selected by secondary school graduates with varying academic backgrounds, the intellective characteristics of these students, and their completion/noncompletion records were investigated. A comparison was made of 229 male vocational training (VT) graduates and 200 male college preparatory (CP) graduates with respect to demographic data, seven preadmissions educational variables, and achievement in college. An attempt was made to study the 229 VT graduates as they pursued community college programs in one of three areas: college career program related to their secondary school curriculum; college career program unrelated to their secondary school curriculum; or a college transfer program. The study also examined these three VT classifications with regard to demographic  data, preadmissions variables, and college achievement. The subjects were enrolled in two comprehensive community colleges in Eastern Pennsylvania. Three hypotheses were tested. The two primary statistical techniques used were chi-square and univariate analysis of variance. The results of the study showed that CP and VT students tend to be similar with regard to demographic variables and to college graduation. They tend to be dissimilar with regard to preadmissions variables and to GPA. The three classifications of VT students tend to be dissimilar on demographic variables and on college achievement but are similar on preadmissions variables. Appendixes to the report provide a Synopsis of Research, List of VT Curriculums, and Year-by-Year Analysis of Enrollment by Curriculum.  (DB)",

The activities of the project consisted on State-level meetings, field visits, surveys, and inter-regional conferences and workshops. A discussion of the correctional officer, (his characteristics, duties performed and competencies needed) serves as a base point from which implications for educational programs are identified. Conditions influencing corrections education are reviewed: the probable impact of permissive and limiting factors such as the posture of correctional agencies, the sensitivity of State criminal justice planners, priorities of funding sources, the profile of the existing correctional officer, and the internal  makeup of the college. In a chapter on approaches to corrections education, several existing alternatives, which reflect the limiting and permissive factors, are analyzed. Improvements discussed at the conferences are suggested. A chapter is devoted to suggested standards for improving educational programs to prepare and upgrade correctional officers, one of the most frequent concerns of the meetings and workshops. The standards, by the very nature of the complexities of improvements in corrections education, address State planning, the career structure, incentives to line officers, curriculum matters, and legislation.

        "description":"Due to cost factors, an educational institution may be willing to finance an individualized instructional system for only part of its student population. Three approaches to selectivity in individualization have been suggested: individualizing the most advanced courses, the first-year courses, or selecting those students who can profit from an individualized program. The third appears most reasonable in terms of potential benefit, but no means of selecting these students have been suggested. Data show that students in the outer extremes in mental ability benefit more from a self-paced program than those in the middle. Students could, therefore, be selected for an individualized program on the basis of a test of mental ability or aptitude. The cognitive style maps of students can  also be used as a criterion for selection. Research indicates that certain elements must be present in one's cognitive style map to profit from independent study, programmed materials, and individual tutoring sessions: (1) theoretical auditory linguistic; (2) theoretical visual linguistic; (3) qualitative code synnoetics (knowledge of oneself) and qualitative code ethic; (4) an individual cultural determinant; (5) magnitude processes of deriving meaning; and (6) relationship processes of deriving meaning.

All 235 NCTYI identified in the \"1971 Junior College Directory\" were included in this study. Replies from 154 provide the basis for the conclusions drawn. To determine the extent of campus autonomy, a questionnaire listing 21 functions was used. It was concluded that: (1) each of the four types of MCTYI operate differently in terms of the  overall placement of management authority and responsibility; and (2) if changes do take place in accord with changes suggested by campus chief executives, more of the 21 functions will be placed at the campus level.

Attention should be focused, however, on the following existing problems: (1) financial barriers to transferring to a four-year college to complete baccalaureate degrees because of lack of funds to pay living expenses; (2) the need to modify existing admissions standards to include measures to identify minority group students who could be overlooked by traditional measures; (3) additional  factors that should be considered in respect to controlled access to the lower division of four-year colleges are the student's ability to pay for his education and his racial and ethnic background, neither of which should preclude his being selected; (4) access is still inadequate in many rural areas and in some inner-city locations; (5) the need for more techniques to insure that potential students are aware of opportunities for postsecondary education, particularly for adults; (6) increased financial assistance to disadvantaged students.

The survey sought to determine, in particular, if the students had secured employment that was related to their course work at the college and if they were receiving an adequate salary. Other areas surveyed were whether the skills gained at the college were those most useful and made advancement possible, and how the former students viewed the adequacy and appropriateness of the college program. In all, 418 questionnaires were sent out, of which 185 were returned. Of the 185 respondees, 96 had earned neither a certificate nor a degree, 8 had earned a secretarial  certificate, and 81 had received an Associate in Arts degree. Results of the survey showed that the holders of secretarial certificates had the highest probability of employment in the secretarial field; those who were working in the secretarial field tended to earn more per week than those students who had jobs other than secretarial; Associate in Arts graduates had the greatest likelihood of having above average weekly earnings of the total group; typing speed was more important than shorthand speed; certificated secretaries changed jobs less frequently than did degree holding secretaries; the reason for changing positions was mainly to earn a higher salary; English, shorthand, and typing were selected as their most helpful subjects; and none of the job skills training at the college  was rated as inadequate.

A secondary purpose was to elicit evaluative reactions from the graduates regarding the services available at the college. Of the 2,070 graduates who received a mailed questionnaire, 1,307 (63%) responded. Over two-thirds of the graduates entered the college directly from high school. While attending college, 76% of the graduates held some form of part-time employment with 52% working a minimum of 16 hours per week. In spite of this and the fact that 23% changed their academic major at least once, over two-thirds (68%) graduated in four semesters or less, excluding summer sessions. Upon graduation, 51% transferred  immediately to four-year colleges as full-time students, and 29% obtained full-time employment. As to the status of the graduates at the time of the study, 40% were employed full-time, 37% were full-time undergraduate students, 7% were part-time undergraduate students, and 2% were full-time graduate students. The graduates indicated that their academic advisors and the Admissions Office were the two most helpful counseling sources. The vast majority found the college to have been at least partially successful in meeting their individual objectives, interests, and abilities. Of the graduates, 86% plan to continue their education. The questionnaire used in the study is provided in an appendix. (Author/DB)",

The questionnaire used (a copy of which is provided in an appendix) was similar to the one used in the Follow-up Study of Bucks County Community College Graduates 1965-1972 (see JC 730 250), allowing responses to certain items to be compared and contrasted. A 50% sample of the non-academic attrition students (1,206) received the questionnaire, of which, 655 (54%) responded. Comparisons on the basis of sex, age, curriculum enrolled in, and credits completed indicated that the respondents were fairly representative of the total  universive of non-academic attrition students from 1965 to 1972 at the college. Less than one-half (48%) of the respondents entered the college directly after high school; 22% enrolled after working for a period of time; and 9% transferred to the college from a four-year college or university. The remaining students were either in military service or served in some other capacity prior to enrolling. Two-fifths of the respondents were employed at least 21 hours/week while enrolled at the college; another 28% worked between 11 to 20 hours/week; 63% attended college full time and 13% alternated between full and part-time. The primary reason for withdrawal from the college was employment, and the second major reason was to transfer to another college. Slightly over 45% continued their  education immediately upon wirthdrwing from the college, and 47% were employed. (Author/DB)",

The objective of the project is to carry out research necessary for the effective design of information systems in the social sciences. The aim of this part of the DISISS project is the application of statistical techniques to citation data in order to group journal titles in the social sciences. Various statistical techniques exist, some with a fairly long history, for grouping items according to observable attributes. Details of these techniques and the selection of one for use with DISISS data are discussed. This report coveres the use of cluster techniques in bibliography, techniques of clustering, an analysis of the pilot study data, progress  with data collection and conversion, and work that is required for the future.

The study described in this report involves using such a data base to analyze aspects of library use and non-use and types of users. Another major objective of this research was the testing of machine-readable circulation data serving as the resource for a variety of computer-based studies. These studies were designed to supply information for decision-making in libraries in such areas as collection development and book budget allocations. This document reports upon a study of the value of computer-based circulation data in administrative decision making in a large academic library. Computer programs were written to produce a variety of outputs including listings  for survey purposes of non-users/users; books most frequently used; use of the library by department or major of the user; and, the use of books by their classification code by academic level of user. It is the conclusion of this study that such experimental by-products of a computer-based circulation system offer useful data for book selection, budgetary allocation and the surveying of the library's clientele. A major question is raised as to what is library use/non-use. From the survey in this study it may be incorrect to categorize users or non-users as individuals who do or do not take out books for home use. (Author/SJ)",

This document suggests guidelines to be followed and areas to be considered in the costing of library procedures. An existing system model has been suggested as a standard (Appendix A) and a classification of library tasks originally devised for the British Library is put forward as a tentative basis for a standard (Appendix B). A check list of cost headings is given in Appendix G. Given a basis such as is provided by these, the costing of manual and automated procedures can proceed. Appendices C-F refer to particular data recording methods. The heads to be considered in costing proposed systems (in particular, automated systems) are covered in some detail,  and it is recommended that decisions on implementation of new systems are made only after estimates of costs have been made for a well-defined planning period. An accurate knowledge of costs assists in the decision-making process. Costing is a straightforward exercise when carried out systematically; the difficult task is the allocation of resources. In the university field this includes a long look at the university as a whole, and this work is now beginning to be done. The appendices to this report are intended to give assistance in the analysis of costs and the preparation of budgets. (Author/SJ)",

The center is designed to receive orders for purchasing books that are prepared by the member libraries, transmitted to the center over communication lines, and issued to vendors by the center. Vendors ship purchased items to the center, the books are processed centrally and then distributed to the ordering libraries. As a byproduct of its need to provide catalog cards for purchased books, the center will naturally accumulate a file of machine-readable catalog data on purchased items which, since it is also natural to record which library purchased the item, can serve in time as  the basis for a machine-readable union catalog for the SUNY statewide holdings. Three phases of implementation are described, and the report is organized around this chronological sequence to provide an evolutionary view of what will take place. The first phase focuses on placing the installation in operation. The second phase represents a period of restricted service--full service of specified kinds to a limited number of libraries. Phase III is the full implementation of all services to the entire SUNY network. (Author/SJ)",

They developed and tested a library game, LIB SIM, aimed at introducing students to the relationships between main library and various branches in a large urban public library, and the ways in which community pressures and political and economic events at local, state and national levels can impinge upon library policies and services. The simulation described in this report was an effort to build upon the experience with LIB SIM and to develop a simulation simple enough to be playable within an ordinary two hour class period (including the essential de-briefing or class discussion to clarify and focus  the issues raised) and realistic enough to be a genuine learning experience. The model here described focussed upon teaching students how to work as change agents within a typical library bureaucratic structure. It was tested in two sessions of a new core course at Wayne State on Issues in Librarianship required of all students in their last quarter of the curriculum. The experience with INTERACTION was positive. In addition, the model seems flexible enough to lend itself to focus on a variety of library problems. (Author/SJ)",

Specifically,  OMB should initiate a cost-benefit study to determine the feasibility of establishing a central depository for Federal libraries and should develop policies and plans to: encourage the use of microform publications or other methods of compacting library materials; coordinate library research; encourage cooperation among libraries to minimize multiple acquisitions of materials; and, encourage the integration of Federal agency information systems.

To make these judgments easier, report writers should state clearly objectives, hypotheses, methodology, conclusions, and recommendations. The second criteria, readability, refers to the physical makeup of the document. Authors should keep in mind that their products will be copied and disseminated as  received, and that, as a general rule, each generation of copying represents a 10% loss in resolution. Documents processed for the ERIC system are abstracted and indexed by subject specialists.

        "description":"The research reported in this paper examined data related to the characteristics of interlibrary loan borrowers, the material borrowed, the question of cost and time it takes to acquire the material, and staff information and procedures. The variables were coded onto computer cards and then tabulated into frequency tables by the computer. There were four major findings discovered as a result of this investigation. First, the average total time it takes for a request to be filled is twenty-three days. Borrowing costs were insignificant, while 75 per cent of the photocopied requests cost only ten cents per page. The concept of a heavy user of interlibrary loan from one department or agency was the third major finding. The fourth and final finding was the percentage breakdown of the  number of requests filled on successive passes. This methodology could conceivably be applied to the interlibrary loan services of other medium and large research libraries. (Author/SJ)",

        "description":"The J. Morris Jones--World Book Encyclopedia--American Library Association (ALA) Goals Award for 1970 was presented to the Membership Committee of ALA for a project to enable a select group of young librarians to attend the Annual Conference of the ALA in Dallas in 1971. The Students to Dallas project sought to communicate to the participating students the functions and goals of the Association, to recruit new members, and to provide a framework within which new members entering the profession could communicate their concerns to ALA leadership. The degree of success in achieving the stated goals of the project may be estimated after reading this report of the project. This research report provides objective information in a number of areas, not all of them project-related. Areas  of ALA Conference program planning which need scrutiny may be identified. Also, there are included some of the characteristics of library school students who are regarded by their peers as having top leadership potential. The report includes discussions on the development of the project, a profile of the participants and alternates, the conference week in Dallas, effects of conference attendance on the students, and conclusions on the overall impact and implications of the project.

This may be difficult and awkward for researchers if consultation involves looking at computer output, particularly in an interactive mode. This might be solved if both parties had a terminal. A test of the technical feasibility of such a conference was made. It indicated that on-line consultation is technically feasible and appears to be easy with the APL software system. Several different types of consultation sessions are described. (Author)",

The study approaches this problem of predicting book use from the conviction that there are certain characteristics associated only with high-use books, and certain other characteristics which are associated with little-used books. The object, then, is to identify these high-use, and no-use or low-use indicators so that they may be built into a book selection policy. The suggested test indicators included such things as English language, Major trade publisher, University press, and Conference proceedings. Some of these factors did turn out to be high-performance indicators, but for various reasons, among which may be mentioned the fact that most  applied to only a small proportion of the collection sampled, only the English language indicator could have any appreciable impact on the selection process.

As to physical characteristics, the card should be designed to be compatible with a wide variety of available badge reader/transactor equipment. As to contents, the card should include the following machine-readable elements: borrower I. D. number (Social Security number when available), borrower status code, and campus code. A campus coding scheme is suggested. Borrower name, borrower status code, university or college (including  campus) name, and validation or expiration date should be human-readable. Signing of the card should be accomplished as part of the card preparation process; inclusion of photograph could be left to local option. The back of the card should carry condition governing its use, as well as campus administrative information. (Author)",

Libraries, in general, have not responded adequately to rapidly changing social, economic and political factors. The locus for change lies in library education. Librarians, trained as information counselors, can make important contributions to the solution of some of this nation's major political, social and economic problems. However, before library schools can even begin to educate such specialists, faculty and administrators must recognize the need to make changes in almost every phase of their operations. They must establish new goals, assess their current status, and devise means by  which to reach these new goals. Moreover, they must develop mechanisms with which to evaluate progress toward the attainment of these goals, as well as assessing the continued validity of their new objectives. Library educators must develop flexible organizational structures capable of adapting to new conditions, and they, themselves must be flexible and willing to modify their own behavior. (Author/SJ)",

The three general areas of concern in library/information curricula are information, people, and technology. A fourth area which overlays all three is research. Before attempting to design a more pertinent curriculum, a few characteristics of these areas in library/information sciences must be understood: (1) libraries have traditionally been concerned only with the information base--gathering, collecting and organizing, (2) libraries have concerned themselves with only a small portion of the totality of  information, (3) the concern with people has been relatively recent, and not very successful, and (4) although technology has always been important in libraries, it is time to move to the next levels--media, computers and telecommunications. It is the interface among these three areas that curricula must be developed. Suggested courses and scopes of each are given. (SJ)",

The second discussion dealt with the concept of officially designating the stronger collections in the various disciplines as  national resources, which would receive continuing support from the federal government. The third group concerned itself with the prospect of developing a research library corporation. Following the discussions, the chairman of each group presented summaries to the entire membership.

A two-year pilot project was initiated in August 1969. This report is oriented toward the work of the project as a whole. The pilot project conducted at the Library of Congress covered five major areas: (1) testing techniques postulated in the RECON report in an operational environment, (2) development of procedures and computer programs to implement format recognition, (3) analysis of techniques for the conversion of older English-language materials in foreign languages using the roman alphabet, (4)  monitoring the state-of-the-art of input devices that would facilitate conversion of a large data base, and (5) a study of microfilming techniques and their associated costs.

The plan concentrates upon three principal needs of the library system: organizational redirection; financial soundness; and quality services on a comprehensive scale. In order to provide a sound basis for analyses and recommendations, these steps were followed in the preparation of the plan: Inventory existing status and performance of all public libraries in the state; Adopt standards of library services desired for all public libraries; Analyze library legislation of all states, but specifically with respect to  Florida; Determine; through survey techniques, what Florida library users want in the way of future library services; Determine the reasons for non-use of the libraries by many residents of the state; Assess the role, relationship, and future needs of the State Library; and, Assess the impact of new technology upon the delivery of library services. The results of the above work provided the Commission with ample information to determine the needs and direction of the Florida public library system. This document has been prepared to convey the results of the Commission's planning activities and to document the findings of the research work leading to the plan.

While some limited inroads have been made in automating certain public library functions, the bulk of services is still being performed in much the same manner as has been the case for years. This is not because public libraries have not sought to be progressive, or have been reluctant to change traditional procedures. Rather, other pressures for public funds have often resulted in lower-than-desired funding for library projects. Moreover, many of the promising applications of new technology have not been developed to the point where they are appropriate  for implementation in public libraries on any large scale. New methods of storing, retrieving, and disseminating information are needed, and it is in the realm of new technology and its application to public library functions that perhaps the greatest benefits will lie. With this in mind, an examination of potential new technology and the possible implications on the Florida library system is appropriate. Included in this discussion are broadband coaxial cable, cartridge television, and the implications of communications for Florida's library system. (Author/SJ)",

        "description":"Members of professional organizations, representing school libraries and audiovisual personnel, set up new standards for staffing the library media centers. These standards recognize that school libraries were taking on new and greater responsibilities and were incorporating more and more audiovisual functions which require a new professional expertise, combining the skills of the librarian and those of the audiovisual specialist. This report is concerned with a study that was devised to provide some measure of the extent to which these standards were being adopted, not only in the staffing of school library media centers and the programs they developed but also in the professional schools at colleges and universities which prepare the staff for these centers. The general  conclusion of this report is that the school library media field is making only tentative steps toward joining the two functions traditionally performed by librarians and by audiovisual specialists. While the best programs are moving toward new standards, very few school library media programs approach those standards. The report concludes with a summary of Federal efforts in the media field, particularly as these bear on the focus of this report. (Author/SJ)",

Modern photocopying in its relation to copyright spins off troublesome problems, which have been much discussed. Those issues have never before been mooted or determined by a court.

Treatment A children acted out, discussed, and suggested solutions to a conflict situation, and then re-enacted the situation using the trainer's mature response to resolve the conflict. Treatment B  consisted of operant discrimination training without discussion. Treatment C children listened to a story and answered questions.

Performance on the central task was assessed as well as later recall of information about the incidental stimuli, and these two measures together provide a basis for inferring selective attention. A major finding is the developmental improvement in children's efficiency of attention deployment. Although incidental learning remains relatively stable from middle childhood to early adolescence, central performance increases markedly. Beyond early adolescence, successful performance on central tasks is accompanied by an inhibition of attention to incidental features.  Studies are reviewed which deal with development of task strategies, correlational evidence for the developmental trend, analyses of attention in retardates, and cross-cultural comparisons. A two-stage model of information processing is considered, and it is concluded that this model may account for the various empirical results that have been presented. (DP)",

The first phase had investigated the effects of socioeconomic mix on the cognitive and social development of disadvantaged preschoolers. The objectives of Phase II were (1) to continue assessment of effects on the disadvantaged subjects over a 2-year span during which there were four testing periods, and (2) to determine the effects of socioeconomic mix on the advantaged children. Subjects (N=37) classified as disadvantaged, and 25 advantaged preschoolers were studied in three group conditions. Group I had a ratio of 50/50 disadvantaged to advantaged; Group II, 75/25; and Group III (100% disadvantaged) served as a control. Instruments used to assess developmental change were the Preschool Inventory, the Peabody  Picture Vocabulary Test, the Cincinnati Autonomy Test Battery, and the Kansas Social Interaction Observation Procedure. Two major conclusions drawn from analyzing the data were that (1) the positive effects of socioeconomic mix on the cognitive development of disadvantaged preschoolers were maintained over a 2-year period, and (2) the advantaged subjects who participated in the second year of the study realized positive gains on both the cognitive and social dimensions. Other conclusions concerned the effects of socioeconomic mix on adult-child interactions and the children's peer relationships. Data tended to support the value of socioeconomic mix in preschool classrooms; study limitations are delineated. (For related document, see ED 067 147.) (DP)",

The theorists' views also converge in many aspects of concept development, as they both see concepts as genuine acts of thought that change qualitatively over time. Areas of differences between Piaget and Vygotsky involve Piaget's &quot;cognitive ego-centrism&quot; and Vygotsky's tendency to overlook the limitations of  biosocial adaptation. Also, the relative importance of different concepts in the educational process is disputed. It is concluded that both men were instrumental in revolutionizing the study of language and thought through (1) the development of clinical methods to study children's thinking, and (2) the systematic investigation of children's perception and logic.

Punishment and repression of toddlers' curiosity has deleterious effects on their emotional development. The second critical variable in establishing a sense of self concerns the child's perceptions of society's evaluation of his family. Teachers are advised to reflect positive values and attitudes towards children's parents, even if they hold different personal standards. Teachers must be aware of the emotional significance of initial parent-child separations. The third stage in the development of self-concept is the child's accumulation of positive and negative experiences.

The instructional program was composed of a series of visual discrimination problems in which the child must discriminate the correct from the incorrect example of the concept. An errorless discrimination procedure was combined with positive reinforcement. A preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of the teaching method and materials was made to determine the feasibility of organizing college students as preschool volunteer tutors. It was concluded that (1) college students were highly motivated and creative teachers, (2) tutors, children, and parents enjoyed  participating in the program, and (3) exploratory data indicated that the programs, teaching methods, and evaluation procedures provided a good framework for the teaching program.

Field testing has occurred over the past three years to evaluate the curriculum, refine teacher training procedures, and extend the curriculum to kindergarten as well as preschool. Outcomes were analyzed with \"Gumpgookies,\" an instrument created to measure motivation for achievement, and criterion-referenced tests. Assessment also included classroom observation procedures. Also studied were the effects of two newly devised curricular units  involving intensive individual contact with a small number of students. Analyses of results indicate that the curriculum had preliminary positive effects and that teacher training procedures were generally effective in producing teacher behavior needed in the curriculum. In addition, the program seems to be effective with kindergarteners. Appendices describe the important activities and measurement instruments of the curriculum. (DP)",

Study I: Each child played with either a simple or a complex set of materials during three play sessions. Learning was measured on a posttest of classification ability. Results indicated that children's ability to interact with the materials was not related to the complexity of the materials, except in the posttest. Younger children performed better after playing with simple blocks, while older children performed better after playing with complex blocks, providing evidence that a match between age and complexity of materials may be a factor in learning classification. Study II: Only 3- and 5-year-olds were  studied, new materials were added, and the old blocks were redesigned to emphasize differences between the simple and complex. Instead of three sessions with one set of materials, each child had one session each with three sets of materials. Results indicated there was no significant interaction of age and complexity of materials on classification activities. There were significant age differences in manipulation scores. The study provided information on the consistency of responses across different materials and the relationships between different types of responses to the same materials. (ST)",

After 3 years of preschool, first grade entrants scored significantly higher on a school readiness test than classmates, but did not achieve as well as predicted by the end of first grade. Two years after the preschool program, children with 3 years of preschool made 1 year's gain on an achievement test but were below grade level on national norms. Intervention begun at age 3 and continued for 3 years is more beneficial than later intervention. (Author/DO)",

Evidence supporting the rationales is based on: (1) studies of classroom climate, in which emotional atmosphere of a  classroom has been shown to affect learning and social behavior in the students; (2) the Coleman Report of 1966, which concluded that self-concept and locus of control factors influenced achievement much more than school resources; (3) childrearing studies; and (4) comparisons of achievements and attitudes of students from different kinds of schools.

A historical overview focuses on the early influence of Freud's psychoanalytical principles on early childhood education. Developmental psychologists became involved with ECE on a large scale in the 1960's, encouraged largely by the formation of Project Head Start. The works of Benjamin Bloom, Basil Bernstein, J. McV. Hunt, and Burton White are mentioned because of their impact on educational practices. Jean Piaget has been a major contributor to developmental theory. Although his work dominated the field by 1960, the implications of his theory for education were uncertain. Piaget's stage theory is reviewed with emphasis on the aspects that are most relevant to  instructional methods. An example of an American preschool based on Piagetian principles, the Ypsilanti Early Education Program, is described; and the influence of the &quot;open classroom&quot; in English education is noted. Alternative educational approaches, not based on Piaget's theory, are discussed, represented by the Bereiter-Engelmann curriculum. Finally, the paper reviews the topic of moral development, focusing on the cognitive-developmental approach of Kohlberg. Arguments for developmentally based moral education are presented. (DP)",

Alternative life styles include these groups: (1) unmarried parents who live together, (2) single or unwed mothers, and (3) participants in communes. Depth interviews were administered to counterculture and traditional parents so that comparisons could be made. The interviews probed (1) demographic and personal background information; (2) marital and work status at the time of the child's birth; (3) current living arrangements; (4) birth, medical, and developmental histories of children; and (5) childrearing attitudes and practices. Some attitudes and value systems, which are common for all  types of counterculture parents, are reviewed. It is concluded that many characteristics commonly attributed to counterculture families were also evident in contemporary two-parent families. The pilot data suggest that alternative life styles represent a concentrated form of attitudes, values, and behavior that are actually broadly represented in society.

        "description":"This study investigated whether various kinds of preschool programs have differential cognitive effects on different kinds of children. Relevant literature was reviewed and data, generated in the first 2 years of the Head Start Planned Variations Study (PVS), were analyzed. The eight preschool programs associated with the PVS were considered. Children's characteristics used for analysis were initial ability, previous school experience, sex, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and style of response to testing. Cognitive outcomes were assessed with the Preschool Inventory and Stanford-Binet. Several tentative conclusions were drawn. First, some children's characteristics interact more powerfully than others with characteristics of preschool models. Response style and previous  schooling seemed the most important variables. Second, where interactions are consistent, they follow suggestive patterns. Educationally disadvantaged children seem to achieve more in highly directive programs than in less directive ones. Third, the interactions may be significant factors in preschool success or failure. Many educational approaches may be needed, to be delivered in a flexible classroom designed to accomodate all kinds of children. (DP)",

Related research literature is reviewed, although it is stressed that dissapointingly little comparative data could be found. Special difficulties in evaluating hearing-impaired programs are discussed, and an interactional approach is proposed. Based on Cronbach's Characteristic by Treatment Interaction Model, this kind of evaluation emphasizes individual differences rather than group effects. As an alternative to experimental-control design, many diverse programs should be evaluated to see what kinds of children do best in different kinds of programs.  Evaluation must be done by objective professionals from outside a program. To insure objectivity a group of evaluators should represent various viewpoints in education. Plans for the 5-year program. including the development of new testing and assessment techniques, are presented. (DP)",

        "description":"This study investigated the relative effects of kindergarten experience for boys and girls, based on considerable evidence that there is a developmental difference between the sexes around 5. Emphasis is in the areas of language and readiness skills, which are traditionally not evaluated until the end of kindergarten. Groups of 93 boys and 89 girls, matched for chronological age, were tested with the Metropolitan Readiness Test and the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities during the summer before their 5th birthday and again 1 year later. One group attended kindergarten during the year; the other did not. Analysis of results indicates that 5-year-old girls are superior to boys in language and readiness skills prior to kindergarten entrance. Kindergarten programs, however,  have a differential effect on gains in these skills for the sexes, as the experience led to greater positve changes for boys than for girls. This finding is discussed in terms of an interaction between developmental readiness and educational programs. It is concluded that goals and practices of early childhood education programs must be re-evaluated, with greater stress on sex differences and flexible entrance and promotion policies. (DP)",

Earlier studies have indicated that such conditions have facilitated paired-associate learning of retarded children. Study I involved 30 first grade children. As in previous studies, embedding stimuli to be associated in syntactic context, specifically, two-sentence paragraphs, facilitated acquisition and reversal of 4 paired-associates over a non-elaboration condition of labeling. Study II (with 36 first graders) demonstrated that two-sentence paragraph elaboration of two different types (semantic and syntactic) significantly facilitated paired-associate learning beyond that obtained by single sentence elaboration on an 8-pair list. No differences  between the two types of paragraph elaboration with regard to acquisition and reversal were found nor were sex differences in performance evident. Study III explored developmental differences in relationships among verbal elaboration and non-elaboration conditions. Twenty four younger (3.8) and 24 older (4.9) nursery school children served as subjects. Data from all three studies were compared to findings of previous studies with retarded subjects. (DP)",

Five teaching methods were compared in parallel programs in Tel-Aviv, Israel and Columbus, Ohio. The Traditional Method, in which materials are supplied but are not used to emphasize cognitive development was used in the control group. The four experimental groups employed the (1) Discussion Method, (2) Observation Method, (3) Touch Method, and (4) Technical Training Method to amplify what the children know of the subjects they draw, and what they can do in the drawings. The sample consisted of a total of 215 prekindergarten and 228 kindergarten children in both countries. Instruments to assess artistic development and cognitive performance were  developed. Results indicate that experimental teaching methods produced significant gains while the control method did not. Methods of observation and drawing technique were most effective, and the results were generally similar for both national groups. It is concluded that (1) drawing is an effective medium for developing cognitive abilities when carefully designed methods are employed, and (2) disadvantaged children from the two countries have similar needs and potentialities.

Norm-referenced testing focuses on interindividual comparisons rather than developmental patterns. Mental age and IQ scores are often considered to be fixed quantities, and interpreted inappropriately in educational practice. Sequential ordinal scales, as originally suggested by Piaget, invite investigation of structural details. Their advantages are (1) The hypothetical sequential order permits direct testing of hypotheses of the sequential organization of development, (2) They allow for the examination of relationships  between developmental patterns and environmental circumstances, (3) They provide means to test Piaget's hypothesis of six sensorimotor stages, (4) They disentangle development from the age variable, (which allows for study of the degree of plasticity in development, and relationships between cognitive competencies and affective conditions). The Uzgiris-Hunt Scales, which contain six series based on behavioral landmarks of development, are described. Research literature in which the Uzgiris-Hunt Scales have been used is reviewed to provide concrete examples of how ordinal scales facilitate investigation of early psychological development. (DP)",

The long-term objective of the project was to relate knowledge about children's attention and learning to issues of educational practice. The project focused its efforts on conceptual problems involved in formulating the interrelationships among performance, competence, and developmental factors. Major conclusions were (1) There is empirical support for the common emphasis on maturational factors or readiness, (2) Readiness involves performance as well as perceptual and cognitive factors, as in the traditional conception of the importance of attention span, (3) A relationship exists between children's age  and ability to solve problems despite noise in the problem field, (4) The complexity of the problem is another important variable on the effects of noise in the problem field, and (5) The interrelationships among attention, cognition, and age can probably be subsumed in Pascual-Leone's mathematical formalizations of Piaget's theory if several modifications are made.

This finding was replicated under a variety of experimental conditions and found to be reliable and stable. Same-different judgement tasks were found to be unsuitable for use with young subjects, and no significant correlation between this same-different phenomenon and classification performance was found. The findings are reviewed in terms of several linguistic models, and a four stage developmental model for the child's use of different\" is postulated. The significance of these findings for a theory of semantic development  and for experimental and instructional work with young children is discussed. (DP)",

The activities carried out included health education workshops, dental services, conferences, developing materials, public health nursing services, and environmental sanitation  services.

Residential schools were run as regimented orphanages; day schools and boarding homes isolated the students in a strange and often hostile world. The present changing attitude toward Indian education, whose main thrust is the integration of Indian and white students, has resulted in some favorable changes, such as the establishment of kindergarten and preschool care.

This summary is the 12th and final report on this American Indian tribe's progress since Federal trusteeship was terminated in 1965. The Menominees, now citizens of Wisconsin, still have more than cultural ties binding them and setting them apart. They have their own county and government; are stockholders in Menominee Enterprises, a tribally-owned corporation; and have their own special set of economic and social problems. The summary covers the Parents and Students Committee for Better Education's solutions for problems in Joint District Number Eight; background of that district and its Title III (Elementary and Secondary  Education Act) project; Indian parents; and elementary, middle, and high school student and teacher attitudes. Ten major problems are listed, such as the credibility gap, institutional overload, and an insensitivity to changing patterns of survival behavior. (FF)",

It has been extremely difficult to recruit, select, and keep Indian students, even at the graduate level. Several recommendations for obtaining more active Indian participation in higher education and in special programs such as administrator training fellowship programs can be suggested. A coordinated communication system could be established to inform students about available programs. In this system, a person could be designated to be responsible for selecting and recruiting Indian students. Colleges enrolling these students could have an Indian coordinator or counselor aware of all Indian students in their college who  could help them from the very beginning. These counselors could coordinate their programs with those of local high schools. One of the major goals of this system could be to inform these students about financial aids and special programs. The curriculum should also be developed to help these students adjust to college life. Thus this system could aid in getting American Indians into higher education. (NQ)",

The majority of those who do go on to college experience difficulty in keeping an acceptable grade average; consequently, few graduate. Present Indian recruiting programs have failed to identify the reason for this. Indian students do not enter college because of lack of motivation. This is usually due to lack of encouragement from family and teachers, improperly planned high school curriculum, and a misunderstanding of the importance of advanced education. Several suggestions can be offered for effective recruiting programs that not only get Indian students into college and out with a degree, but with self confidence, acumen, and desire to proudly  make his place in society. Among these suggestions are: recruitment must begin when the student first enters high school; Indians already in college must become involved in the recruitment programs of school with a high concentration of Indian students; the college must be able to offer financial aid; the college curriculum must be developed to allow these students to catch up in English, math, or science and also prepare them to graduate within 4 years; and social activities with other Indians in college must be made available.

Montana Indian education has been inexcusably low, with less than 200 college students from all reservations in a recent academic year against an estimated 4,000 Indian youths of college age in the state. MSU, as a land-grant institution, is in a unique position to help develop reservation resources through its programs in resident instruction, research, and extension. MSU can store, preserve, and help up-date tribal customs, practices and traditions. More specifically, AIS will seek to provide  opportunities for the Indians to more fully utilize the resources of their land-grant university. For instance, MSU will work with Montana Indian tribes to establish personal liaison with tribes, and to gain assistance in building up specific knowledge about tribes.

The objectives of the project were to reverse racial separatism; reduce racially related, negative black/white incidents, to increase teacher/administrator/counselor perception of black/white relationships; to decrease absenteeism by increasing positive black/white interpersonal relationships; to improve student grade point averages; and to increase student performance on standardized tests. In addition to measurement of the objectives, anecdotal records were submitted by teachers, and a series of questionnaires were used for the purpose of overall program evaluation.  Major findings were that all teachers responding found that tolerance levels were higher between black and white students, that there was an increase in voluntary black/white association, that the number of racially related negative incidents was reduced, and that absenteeism was not reduced. Copies of the questionnaire, test scores, and a description of the program were included. (PS)",

The handbook is based on the findings of a study conducted between September 1958 and July 1963 in Health District #1 of northern New Mexico. The study's purpose was to observe whether the quality of communication between nurse and patient and the degree of cooperation obtained from patients varied with the following 4 factors: (1) the setting in which the contact took place; (2) attributes of patients such as age, sex, language facility, and education; (3) nurse performance variables such as language used,  length of the interview, and use of visual aids or written materials; and (4) discourse variables such as use of complete, appropriate arguments and &quot;adequate&quot; explanations. Topics discussed in the handbook include: the patients; health beliefs and linkage; sickness; respiratory, children, and traditional diseases; treatment; traditional practitioners and their areas of competence and interests; first visit; use of an interpreter; arguments; explanations; folk attitudes relevant to public health; and general rules.

Dr. Ramirez outlined why the Cabinet Committee is needed, gave examples of the Committee's accomplishments, and discussed future plans to assure that Federal programs reach the Spanish speaking. According to Dr. Ramirez, the Cabinet Committee was established to advise Federal departments and agencies on appropriate actions to assure that Federal programs reach the Spanish speaking people. Since its establishment in 1969, the Committee has accomplished; the distribution of $47 million to first time grantees for programs run by the Spanish speaking for the Spanish speaking; the establishment  of Project Alpha to deal with job opportunities at the local level and Project Blue at the national level; effective data collection and reporting systems; the improvement of employment opportunities through Project Beta; strengthening the President's 16-point Program by helping to institutionalize it into the Federal structure; and getting agencies to be cognizant of Spanish speaking needs. In the future, the plans are to increase equal educational opportunities and the number of Spanish Americans on the Federal Register through local recruitment. (NQ)",

These efforts, which began in the spring 1970 and winter 1971, became a part of the proposal process for an Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Title III grant for the system. Data were collected by personal interviews with Mexican American community leaders and their allies and educational decision makers and their allies. Interviews on educational issues conducted with many of the same individuals were used to validate the information. Original documents and audio-tapes of all Community Advisory Council (CAC) meetings were also used. A majority  of the negotiating time was devoted to the role and function of the CAC. The school system resisted the input of the Council's more radical elements, while they supported the conservative representatives. The pressure placed on the school system originated under the supervision of a community organizing agency external to the Mexican American community. The study ended with the hiring of the project director in the fall of 1971. (Author/NQ)",

In depth interviews were conducted in 1972 to understand the dynamics of changes. Data interpretations were presented to see the changes that have taken place in these families, the adjustment to these changes, and the delineation of the prismatic types and characteristics. It was found that prismatic families show lines of tension between traditional and modern value systems, experience anomic feelings caused by discrepancies between traditional and modern values, perceive minimal  class differences, and experience an increase in the intensity of conflict and anomia with the movement from the rural end of the continuum towards the prismatic on the scale of a rural-urban continuum.

Subjects were 135 Indians and 200 non-Indians at the University of New Mexico and 68 Indians and 100 non-Indians at New Mexico State University. A random selection of the non-Indian students was made from the student directories. There were 22 hypotheses tested for significance at the .05 level by means of a step-wise discriminant analysis technique. Variables tested for classification purposes were: age, sex, marital status, tribal affiliation, high school rank, high school size, ACT scores, GPA, semester course load, major field  of study, place of residence, Indian or non-Indian roommate, Indian club membership, financial aid, and distance student travels from home to college. It was found that the best combination of factors related to persisting American Indian college students were: a female student less than 19 years of age when first enrolled in college, a graduate of a larger, public high school who ranked in the upper third of the graduating class, had scored 17 or above on the ACT, and chose a major field of study within the professional field.

A second aspect of the research compared the type of instruction, bilingual or monolingual, the former represented by the Corpus Christi sample, the latter by San Antonio. The Gloria and David Oral Bilingual Test -- Spanish and English was used as the assessment instrument. Main conclusions of the study were that: the sample involving bilingual instruction did  significantly better in English phonology; other factors besides sex, age, home language, number of siblings, and type of instruction may have influenced test results. It was recommended that bilingual instruction be used to teach children whose home language is Spanish.

It is suggested that, while teachers are presenting a weather unit to their elementary school classes, they should not overlook the opportunity to make learning more meaningful through outdoor teaching techniques. Explorations of temperatures in different places may indicate that factors affecting weather, such as temperature, humidity, sun radiation, wind and air movement, conductivity, shape of the land surface, and precipitation may vary as much for the little climates as they do for a general region. Various methods of observing the weather are suggested. A lesson plan for the study of small climates provides the following: objectives, concepts, vocabulary, materials,  instructional procedure and activities, and evaluation. (PS)",

        "description":"There is a growing need for environmental education, defined as the part of the total educational process which attempts to convey those values, concepts, and knowledges associated with the external environment, in urban areas. Since more people are moving to urban areas, these areas are becoming plagued with fast growing environmental problems. An enlightened citizenry with a framework of reference sufficient to motivate participation in action programs leading to the alleviation or modification of these environmental problems is needed. The development of this enlightened and informed citizenry can be accomplished by (1) educating the adult population through newspapers, radio, television, films, conferences, workshops, forums, legislative involvement, community planning  boards, and local, state, and Federal involvement and support; and (2) educating the children and youth of the nation. It is recommended that an experimental program in environmental education which is related to a regular school curriculum be provided. It should be an integral part of every subject area at each grade level and spiral upward through the grades. This second approach is discussed in this paper. (NQ)",

The insect world tends to be noticed by the average person only when the small creatures become pests or inhabit man's abode. However, young students have a sharp sense of curiosity and are usually fascinated with insect activity. The teacher should use these characteristics to her advantage since the insect world is readily accessible through much of the school year. The teacher can combine this study with other regular subjects. Among the various activities recommended are: making an observation data chart; taking a field trip to study the noise made by various insects and recording them; mapping their  activities; studying the relationship between 2 or 3 kinds of a certain insect; mapping travel at night; making a checklist of habitats or niches; collecting insects; making plaster of paris fossil imprints of insects or their homes; and identifying insects found on a single plant.

Indian students with chronological ages 5-9 enrolled in the first 4 grades at the Fort Thompson Elementary Indian School were tested. The majority of the children failed to carry out the objective designed by the authors of the ITPA for the Motor Encoding Subtest. All of the students were able to demonstrate the functions of a toy hammer, a toy pitcher, a toy gun. It was only when they had to do the same with pictures that they had difficulty. Indian children are often bashful with strangers, and in a situation where they are asked to  perform in front of a stranger, this bashfulness may be more pronounced. Three recommendations are presented--e.g., if the ITPA is going to be used as a tool to diagnose language disabilities, it is necessary to administer the whole test. One subtest can only provide minor information in this area. (FF)",

Also, do these Indian students possess this technological information in a form which can be used, or is it in a state of unrelated abstractness? Two tests were designed to determine whether technological differences were a factor which influenced the Indian's downward trend in academic achievement, 1 a verbal test, and the other a picture association test. Each test had 7 subtests on basic concepts concerning technological knowledge. Selection of subjects for this study resulted in matching a total of 60 Indian and 60 non-Indian students in the following areas: (1) age,  (2) IQ, (3) grade level, and (4) sex. There were no significant differences in the Indian and non-Indian students at the 4th, 5th, and 7th grade levels on all subtests except one. Another finding was that the 5th grade level had 3 subtests which were significantly different. They were home community, and job subtests. The remaining 4 showed no significant difference.

Survey items be broken into two divisions: ideas reflecting individualism and capitalism and ideas reflecting collectivism and socialism. The hypothesis that there were no significant differences in attitudes between the 2 groups was supported by information from the questionnaires. Therefore, it was suggested that the Indians' difficulties in adjusting to the overall American culture were caused by the dominant society's bias toward minority groups. The major  recommendations was that everyone should try to judge a person by the type of individual he is, rather than by the color of his skin. (KM)",

Instrumentalism and realism were chosen as two labels of the views of science, and intellectual independence and dependence were referred to as provisions made by instances of teaching. Features were logically derived from the two views and from the philosophical analysis of teaching and epistemology to serve as the items of the scheme. Revision was made to make each item correspond with classroom speech and to increase reliability. Empirical data were  collected by analyzing 14 ninth- and tenth-grade lessons and interviewing teachers. Three independent judges were requested to determine the scheme reliability. The author concluded that the significance of investigating classroom discourse for the provision of the view of science and intellectual dependence and independence was ascertained in the theoretical component of this study. The analytical scheme could be used reliably for provision assessment. Further applications of the scheme to research and teacher supervision were recommended. Included are the lessons used, interview transcriptions, scheme items, and judgements. (CC)",

The learning materials were categorized into units, and each group was divided into two subgroups. While one of the 1969 subgroups learned a unit in Spanish, the other subgroup learned the same unit in English. For the 1970 group, one subgroup learned all units in Spanish and the other, in Spanish and English, alternately. Comparisons were made among the achievement test scores of the four subgroups. For the 1970 group, the scores on an aptitude test in Spanish and an English ability test were also used for covariance analysis and served as predictors.  Results obtained showed that the group taught partially in English did not demonstrate a significant improvement in general ability with English over the group taught entirely in Spanish. A great deal of exposure to English was possible for the Latin American student without significant risk to physics achievement grades. Total and verbal scores on entrance tests were good predictors of success in physics. (CC)",

        "description":"The study attempted to show that the first grade child's learning in a new area must involve overt concrete experiences from which new ideas will be derived. Forty-nine students, assigned to six groups, were instructed on three scientific concepts. The verbal instruction technique was similar to that suggested in SCIS. The application segment involved actual manipulation of props and simple drawings. All tests were of the interview type modeled after Piaget's revised clinical techniques. General conclusions drawn include that while the first grader's science instruction must not be limited to pictures and reading, instruction must not be exclusively involved with actual manipulations of objects either. Diagnostic placement of a child into an instructional sequence with an  appropriate ratio of manipulations/representations can be based on that child's cognitive structure in that area. (EB)",

The category with the majority of significant items concerned the relationships pertaining to the teacher-student-subject and -classroom utilization. The judges' occupations were analyzed into seven distinct groups. Results obtained indicated the presence of biases due to judges' occupational status. Recommendations were made on the teacher participation in the evaluation process, selection of judges through teachers' suggestions, and permission of teachers' expression of opposing  ideas about judgments.

For each behavior, two items were written, one for V and the other for P measurement. A total of 140 items was developed in forms A and B. The items and their categorizations were judged by 5 judges, and 700 IRA and 520 non-IRA students were used to complete an item discrimination test. The non-IRA group was students enrolled in BSCS biology using a standard  text-laboratory approach. Fifty items were proved sensitive to IRA and non-IRA programs and used as items of form C. Most items indicated a difference at levels ranging from 0.001 to 0.2.

The goals of the project were to: (1) individualize instruction so that each student works in a program which is relevant to his needs with the attainment of appropriate achievement levels; (2) promote good student attitudes toward learning in subject areas where curriculum has been individualized; and (3) promote good teacher attitudes toward working with students in individualized programs. During the first two years of the project, a large resource center was developed for the  individualization of instruction in mathematics for 240 students in grades three through six. In the third year (1971-72) reading was individualized for 360 students in grades one through six and a primary resource center was developed to support this program. A detailed evaluation of the project indicated, among other things, a significantly higher achievement in mathematics and an improvement of student attitudes toward school and mathematics, and supported the validity of using such an instructional approach in the elementary school setting. This work was prepared under an ESEA Title III contract. (JR)",

An analysis of environmental information sources, both the schools and the media, appeared necessary. Only in this manner can environmental education programs be designed or relevant curriculums planned which can help students understand the information about, and comprehend the range and complexity of, the environment. The project developed an instrument to determine: high school students concepts and definitions of physical, biological, cultural, social, and technological environment; environmental parameters and priorities; environmental value judgments; and personal actions to initiate  change. Instrument questions covered wide areas of environmental information and were approached from three directions--cognitive, affective, and connotative. Analysis clearly indicated areas of strength, weakness, and misconceptions in the information high school students gain from their school and the media. There also appears to be a relation between the information a student has and his willingness to express an opinion. It is believed future research needs to consider not only the source and intensity of environmental information, but the processing ability of students as well. The questionnaire is appended. (BL)",

The simulation is described in terms of a two-week period although the teacher may  adjust the timing to suit classroom needs. General directions for the simulation, which concerns itself with a local resource controversy and its solution, are given together with specific directions for the various groups: advocate (plaintiffs and defendents), jury, community interest, media, and legal alternatives.

The hearings were held April 17, May 15 and 17, 1973, to provide an opportunity for individuals from the public, educational community, and environmental groups as well as officials of the administration to express their views on the bill. Chairman John Brademas prefaced initial statements by pointing out that the current administration requested no funds for the implementation of the Act in 1971; delayed establishing the Advisory Council, mandated by law, for a full 12 months after the measure was enacted; and delayed, also for a full year,  establishing the Office of Environmental Education required by the Act. Also, that the administration has tried to hamstring the Office of Environmental Education in the Office of Education with redtape and a variety of bureaucratic strategies and has provided no money for the Office of Environmental Education in the proposed 1974 budget, virtually killing the modest program. Statements made at the hearings and additional prepared statements, letters, and supplemental material submitted for the record are presented. (BL)",

Apparently part of the problem has been the generation of some theme or model around which a core of interested faculty and students could work. It is implied that some conceptual organization of an environmental studies program is the fundamental task for providing a common theme for the disparate disciplines. Measurement (of problems) is not enough of a common theme; some matrix of substantive relationships is required. We have left behind an era with ideas like recycling of aluminum cans and are entering an era concerned with understanding the interrelationships of consumption patterns, with population, and with pollution, and  whether or not technology is leading us in the direction we want to go. Additional essentials for university organization of an environmental studies program include some kind of status in the university hierarchy; a Bill of Rights or authorities for faculty in environmental studies; and flexibility in the format of teaching and the manner in which teachers prepare for interdisciplinary studies.

The nature of national objectives for research and development on problems posed by society is assessed, with new and better ways of providing education as one of the goals. This is followed by attention to the structure of the university, asking whether our present form is appropriate for the functions of a modern university. The case is made that we must continue the departmental structure to maintain intellectual leadership in the major fields of  human knowledge. But new, flexible organizations or interdisciplinary units are needed which may pursue differenct objectives without subordinating one administrative structure to the other. Lastly, the life style of the faculty is questioned. Is it possible to construct campus mechanisms for developing interdisciplinary capability, encourage faculty members to explore other career opportunities, and bring onto campus people with experience in industry or government who do not have the credentials of an academic professor?

Oakland Public Schools and the San Francisco Unified School District were the two systems involved in this study. Treatment variables included socio-economic level of the community (low or middle) and curriculum used for teaching mathematics (SMSG or the state adopted SRA text series). Details of the design of the investigation are reported along with descriptions of the sample, the measures used to assess achievement and the factor analyses performed on the data. The content of the two curricula are outlined in the appendices. Further interpretations of the statistics and data obtained are given in &quot;ELMA Reports, No. 2&quot; (SE 016 833).  (JP)",

This report describes the project's implementation in seven public and two parochial elementary schools to evaluate their mathematics curriculum. Project staffers assist the principal and a group of teachers and parents from each school to design an evaluation instrument which will identify strengths and weaknesses in their program. The instrument used during this study is divided into nine sections: goals and objectivies, curriculum, equipment, faculty, instruction, facilities, evaluation, administration, and in-service activity. The evaluation of each area is based on the school staff's\"yes-no\" responses to questions related to each area; a \"yes\" response denotes a positive aspects of the mathematics program. From the data collected at these schools, the staffs feel the areas of curriculum and equipment are strongest and that goals and objectives, evaluation, and in-service training are weakest. Specific recommendations are given for school and/or system action to strengthen the weak areas. Additional types of assistance needed from project staffers in aiding the schools to make such evaluations are also recommended. (JP)",

A discussion of research findings related to political efficacy and trust and a review of other pertinent research are followed by definitions of the basic concepts in the paper. The normative implications of the findings seem to point out that political attitudes of childhood do persist to adulthood; thus to teach adult blacks to be politically effective, the political attitudes of young blacks must be changed. The alternatives that explain why racial differences may result are: 1) differences in political education within American schools; 2) social-structural conditions that contribute to low feelings of  self-competence among blacks; 3) differences in intelligence; and 4) differences in the political environment in which blacks and whites live. The assumptions and empirical consequences of each explanation are discussed. An evaluation of the alternatives concluded that social condition and political environment explanations have the greatest scope and therefore are the best explanations, especially if not considered as being mutually exclusive explanations.

After pointing out the problems of identification, basic principles for special to regular class programs are discussed. Suggested activities and methods for the social studies cover the areas of reading, creative projects, news coverage, oral activities, and seminars, clubs and other resources. Each of these areas is examined for creative ways to teach social studies skills to the superior student. A summary of the guide offers seven goals by which to evaluate the work of the academically talented in social studies. A bibliography includes general information on the gifted, as well as information in the field of the social studies specifically.  Related documents are SO 005 979 through SO 006 000. (KSM)",

Rather than on writing the paper as an end in itself, emphasis is on the basic purpose of research procedures. Part one contains directions for students to follow in developing research projects. Ten steps focus on selection of a topic, background reading, secondary works, primary source material, note making, outlining, writing, quotations, and footnote logic and procedure. Although the examples relate to historical papers or reports, the same general approach may be applied in other secondary school social studies classes. Part two contains suggestions on how to establish and operate a sequential social studies library research program.  Step by step approaches to teaching the research assignment over a period of fifteen days are given, in contrast to the presentation of a total research assignment which places most students in a quandary.

The rationale is discussed in terms of the relationship between value study and mythic thought, delineating the components needed to complement the present state of the art relative to value study in social studies education analyzing mythic thought and narrative explanation, and outlining an approach to value education through the use of narratives to investigate value positions. The components of the disclosure approach include the explanatory power of the narrative and mythic thought of the author, the use of metaphor, the  nature of value concepts, construction and use of value continua, development of a value profile, and augmentation of personal definitions. The example given of the process, which includes a classification scheme for value analysis utilizing clarification questions for use in small groups, is based on the concept of justice.

This experiment was part of a project involving a state organization of teachers and teams of teachers in local school systems in which the former provided an organizing link and the latter acted as researchers and disseminators. A questionnaire discovered new educational practices which were evaluated by a rating scale especially developed for the project. Documentary descriptions of each nominated practice were placed in a catalogue and distributed to participating schools. The teachers' response to the catalogue was  measured by a postcard questionnaire. A forcefield analysis of the factors supporting and hindering active innovation resulted in a sharing institute focused on the resistance to diffusion. The objectives, design, operation plans, and program outline of the institute are followed by staff observations.

The rationale involves a re-definition of professional roles in the human services as a powerful means of political struggle. The aim of the political strategy is to eliminate the sources of social, economic and political inequalities, the underlying causes of social problems with which the human services profess to be concerned. A model for the study of social problems and policies is illustrated by a chart of the forces which interact with key processes of social policies. The poverty syndrome is used as an example in investigating the sources of inequalities within capitalism. A strategy to eliminate such sources is to replace the economic and  political system with an alternative, achieved through a fundamental change of consciousness of social reality and the perceptions of self-interest by much of the population. Consequently, professional practice in the human services would become an important factor in effecting this comprehensive cultural and institutional change.

Hence, the lab division of two sections -- The Communication Production Laboratory and The Communication Research Laboratory -- reflects this twofold emphasis. Study in communication may be pursued at the Master's level, Doctoral level, or short term residencies. The curriculum is based on four principles: academic training in basic theory and empirical research; practical experience in communication  research and evaluation; comprehensive and critical review of research literature on human learning and persuasive communication and the role of education and communication in social and economic development; and practical experience in applied communication. While the Production Laboratory goals range from developing communication materials and programs to conducting group training programs, the Research Laboratory's objectives focus on conducting experiments and research in fields of communication study.

        "description":"This study proposed that the interaction of student personality and school environment is influential in the development of normative climates. Two instruments measured the transactional relationship between individual personal structure (needs) and characteristics of the organizational environment (press). Needs were measured by an Activities Index (AI); press by the High School Characteristics Index (HSCI). A sample of eleventh grade students of high and low ability were randomly chosen out of the 462 who responded to both indexes. Factor analysis, correlation, and analysis of variance determined the significant relationships of the major variables. The responses were classified by school setting, ability group, and socioeconomic background. AI factors were achievement  motivation, emotionality, dependence, dominance, intellectuality, individuality, and submissiveness; HSCI factors were development press and control press. The evidence indicated that schools appear to develop psychological environments which are consistent with the personality attributes of the student clientele. The personality structure of students and the normative climates of schools vary among socioeconomic groups; within schools, they vary as a function of academic program placement. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"Educational research on the social studies since the 1960's, indicating that many changes have occurred yet implying that there is still a further need for research and improvement, is summarized in this booklet. Because the vast amount of research on social studies makes it impractical to report a great deal of it, many of the findings reported here are generalized without citing most of the investigations on which conclusions are based. The booklet is designed to: 1) suggest principles and teaching methods to be applied by the classroom teacher; and, 2) provide a basis for further study and use of research findings. Presented herein is a clear, concise portrayal of social studies in regard to basic purposes, scope and sequence, and content in the latter half of the 1960's and,  in many respects, as it is presently. Research findings are discussed as they relate to objectives, curriculum content, methods, materials, and teachers. The section on curriculum content presents elementary and secondary curriculum patterns, status of social science subjects, and multidisciplinary approaches to social studies. Teaching strategies as they relate to skills and inquiry techniques are given in another section. Under the materials and resources section, use of textbooks and other instructional media is reported. Another section deals with teachers and current change in social studies. Included are selected current research and development projects and a list of selected references. (SJM)",

Frances Dart discusses the cultural conflict between American and underdeveloped countries--conflict which occurs when one group prizes the achievements or possessions of another on a mostly non-reciprocal basis. This is followed by an examination of some of the agents which brought about, in a centuries-old, largely dormant culture, a craving for education and development. The third paper reveals some of the pitfalls of trying to borrow another culture's educational system, or make-do with an imposed foreign system, and illustrates the necessity and process for relating curriculum content in science education to the indigenous characteristics of the culture. The final paper  provides examples and suggestions in the field of art education. (Author/SHM)",

Design to train both groups at the same time in basic appropriate discussion techniques, the course rationale is based on the idea that students should learn how to cope rationally with differences of opinion inherent in our pluralistic society. Four lessons emphasize the need for students to interact, listen to others, keep the discussion focused, and analyze different points of view. Problems that arouse concerned teacher role, opinion, and attitudes; selection of issues; participation of all class members; student materials and feedback;  and course evaluation. Decision points reached are that: 1) teachers need to take an active role; 2) teachers do not view expression of their opinion as a problem; 3) teachers need to decide whether the course is appropriate for their style of instruction; 4) teachers view the selection of involved issues as a most difficult task; 5) discussions are fruitful when the class is divided into several discussion groups; and 6) students find materials which are concise and have high visual impact to be the most interesting. Pre-post tests indicated that teachers and students improved their use of some discussion techniques, although a few of the results were contrary to expectations. (SJM)",

The museum's collections support the educational purpose of providing an accurate knowledge of the arts, thought, and natural resources of 19th century New England. The program has made use of new educational techniques which apply to museum teaching, such as an interdisciplinary approach, open classrooms, and community and career oriented education. Thematic and conceptual approaches have been used for tours. The 1972-73 basic tours were farming, homelife, textiles, and government. The role of the tour escort has aimed at stimulating the group's own inquiry, deriving from Hilda Taba's concept formation and attainment models. A belief in the active involvement of  children in the learning process has resulted in farming, textile, and cooking studios. Teacher programs have focused on curriculum development and innovative teaching techniques. Materials collected have been classified in a resource guide for teachers. The Museum Education Center has been designed to facilitate the Center's educational objectives. The history of staff development and a staff profile conclude the issue. (KSM)",

The first four chapters attempt: 1) to analyze some of the barriers to change in education in general and in social studies education particularly; 2) to summarize some of the relevant research concerning the problems and processes of change in education and in other areas; 3) to describe various change models and roles; and 4) to outline some strategies and techniques that might be used for bringing about diffusion and adoption of the  new social studies. Chapter 5 presents an overview of some of the main types of change projects that have been carried out in the new social studies, and Chapter 6 describes one such project: the Social Studies Field Agent Training Program of Indiana University. The final chapter provides an annotated bibliography of some of the key sources on the process of change that might be of use to practitioners in the field of social studies education. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"This is the second unit of seven resource units for a twelfth grade course on value conflicts and policy decisions. The topic for this unit is promoting economic growth in the United States. The objectives are listed as to generalizations, skills, and values. The double-page format relates objectives to pertinent content, teaching procedures, and instructional materials. This unit helps pupils summarize factors promoting or hampering economic growth and then focuses upon issues related to how such growth might be promoted in this country. Some of the issues relate to the value conflicts involved in using government fiscal and monetary policies to promote growth as well as economic stability. To analyze alternative courses of actions, pupils use factual questions and economic  concepts in considering the consequences of different courses of action. The teacher's guide is SO 006 331; other units are SO 006 332-337. (Author/KSM)",

This publication is a collection of five conference papers which deal with various aspects of diffusion of innovative materials and ideas. Everett M. Rogers discusses two agricultural models, the wide scope and the narrow scope models of diffusion. His proposals emphasize use of change-agent teams. Authur Foshay discusses the problems of bringing about change within the present structure of the schools, the difficulty of moving in the direction of change. Practical proposals for improving the process of diffusion are suggested. A normative model is developed by Michael Scriven. Consideration focuses on how  diffusion should occur and how the diffusion process should be changed. In a paper by Ernest Burkman a development-dissemination scheme used by the ISCS Project in Florida is described. Questions concerning diffusion and acceptance of new processes are answered by Edwin Mansfield in the final section of this publication. Related documents are SO 006 340 through SO 006 344. (SHM)",

Does the school need general community support in order to implement innovative products? What degree of flexibility does a school need in order to readily adopt or adapt new products and ideas? How is flexibility defined? How does the level of academic training of teachers, supervisors, and administrators affect the adoption rate of innovation within a particular school? How does the median age or  median level of experience of the faculty of a school or persons residing in the community affect the level of adoption of innovation? Is the level of innovation-adoption of new materials or ideas influenced by the tax level of the community?

Materials were prepared to meet a variety of reading ability levels (7-12), conceptual comprehension levels, and interest levels. Staff leadership resulted in the production and testing of materials, workshops for culture studies teachers, articles in professional journals, and newsletters, and the beginnings of a model or pedagogical framework for studying cultures.

Extensive onsite observations and investigations give students an opportunity to form and text hypotheses from raw data.

Large group presentations are interspersed among small group and individualized activities. Extensive use of area resources is made and values exploration is stressed. Credit is given for either English or social studies, but course content includes music, drama, art appreciation, and crafts. In place of textbooks, students rely on  paperbacks and library resources for independent investigation. Instead of semester exams, each student selects a creative project and is assigned a personal project advisor.

        "description":"This study investigated the Zajonc-Cottrell theoretical conflict pertaining to drive by testing children during early learning on a gross motor task, with the audience effect paradigm of social facilitation. Two hundred forty youngsters served as subjects. They were selected randomly from both sexes and equally from a large preschool and public school second grade. Each subject completed 10 trials on the stabilometer task under an \"Alone\" or an \"Audience\" learning condition. Average and trend learning scores were computed for each subject. Second-grade subjects attained a higher level of performance than did preschool subjects. The analysis for rate of learning revealed an interaction between audience conditions and age levels. Preschool subjects learned in the \"Alone\" condition  at a higher rate than when in the presence of an audience. However, second-grade subjects learned at a higher rate in the presence of an audience than in the \"Alone\" condition. Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that the motor response tendencies of children are most probably influenced by their prior social experiences. This conclusion tended to support the Cottrell hypothesis that performance, in the audience paradigm of social facilitation, is dependent upon the child's social history. (Author/JA)",

The goal of this project was to improve students' initial mastery of reading skill objectives by a program of assigning appropriate objectives to each student, testing mastery of assigned objectives through criterion-referenced tests, and finally awarding incentives to target groups based on students' mastery of assigned objectives. In addition, the project has the goal of implementing and evaluating the impact of three incentives. Four experimental groups were devised: Student, Parent, Parent-Student, and Control (no treatment). In the Student Incentive Treatment, students received  instruction, Regional Center Materials, and the 1972 10X Catalog of toys, books, or records, and, ultimately, a class field trip. Incentives in the Parent Incentive Treatment included parents praising student success as an incentive with the parents receiving as an incentive $200 if 80 percent of the children in the class achieved 80 percent of their assigned objectives with 80 percent accuracy. The Parent-Student Treatment combined the incentives of the first two groups.

The dynomemeter lever arm, the fulcrum of which was aligned with the axis of elbow rotation, allowed extension and flexion for the subjects. All subjects were tested at three velocities (.10, .20, and .33 radians/sec) for each mode of contraction: concentric and eccentirc. Subjects tested in the concentric mode accelerated the lever arm by contraction of the elbow extensors, while subjects in the eccentric mode resisted elbow flexion forced upon them by the dynomometer. The hypothesis that forces observed would have an inverse relationship to the speed of muscle shortening or lengthening was rejected. Analysis revealed similar  force curves at all speeds, in terms of peak forces and slopes of the curves. Mean peak forces occurred approximately at the same point in the curves, regardless of mode or speed. Eccentric forces were consistently higher than concentric forces. It was concluded that subtle adaptations in the muscoloskeletal linkages resulted in relatively constant force output, regardless of variations in rate of muscle shortening. (Author/BRB)",

Its main objectives were as follows: a) to bring about change in the present method of preparing teachers  through extended participation by trainees in public school classrooms; b) to utilize better the resources of the university for the public school by having the university directly involved in a cooperative project; and c) to exchange ideas between the public school practitioner and the university instructor.

The term \"advisory\" is defined as in-service assistance to teachers that is provided only at their request, in terms of their own goals, and \"in situ\" rather than in formal courses; it is designed in such a way that teachers become self-reliant and independent. The report, based largely on the advisors' field notes, answers questions about what it is like to be an advisor, what problems arise in the course of using this approach, and how an advisory system should be designed. Section headings reflect the pilot's major objectives (e.g., Advisors' Personal Problems; Reaction of Teachers). (JA)",

Following an explanation of individualized instruction, the paper presents two differing points of view concerning how provisions can be made to individualize instruction: a) the patterned approach, which emphasizes the logical sequence involved in teaching a subject, and b) the unpatterned approach, which rejects the idea of the above. The vertical and horizontal organization of the school is then discussed in relation to graded and nongraded schools and to general ability and multi-age grouping of students. Individual differences found in the classroom are treated, as are provisions for dealing with these differences.

The first study investigated whether 250 prospective white teachers from a major teacher training institution held more positive attitudes toward suburban or inner-city schools. Osgood's Semantic Differential (SD) revealed that the subjects held positive attitudes toward suburban schools and negative attitudes toward inner-city schools. This investigation concluded that teacher expectancy affected the student's self-concept of academic ability. The second study determined whether a positive shift in the attitudes of prospective white teachers would be evident following exposure to inner-city schools. SD revealed that exposure to inner-city schools did have a positive effect, though  statistically not significant, on the attitudes of the subjects. Results also revealed that this same exposure led to negative attitudes toward suburban schools. Recommendations were made for more concentrated inner-city experiences.

To help ascertain the impact of this new population of teachers on education, data on the survival of 952 interns from 1960 to 1969 were collected and analyzed to determine the extent to which this select group of trainees can be placed and retained in teaching. The effect of the following variables on survival was examined: selection (sex, age, marital status, financial need, academic aptitude, and academic achievement); training (subject-matter specialty and achievement); and posttraining (ratings of the training program).  Data were interpreted from the perspective of the training institution rather than that of the school districts involved. It was concluded that the interns, as a population, probably have a higher survival rate than other populations of teacher trainees. Two personal attributes of the interns, sex and age, proved to be the best predictors of survival. In some cases, additional information was provided by analyses of the other variables and by the interns' reasons for leaving teaching. (Author/JA)",

Within these divisions, suggested competencies are listed and the assessment procedures for each competency (with a format of indicator, criteria, and procedure) given. In addition to theinstrument itself, there is a brief project history, which states that the listed competencies were identified as being absolutely essential for maximizing the emotional, cognitive, and social development of children and that the instrument was  designed to offer assistance and be supportive. The major thrust for 1973-74 is projected as the development and evaluation of competencies selected by the teacher participant and the evaluation team, acting together. (JA)",

The judges were members of the Omaha school system responsible for interviewing and hiring new teachers. Subjects were second-semester student teachers at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Statistical results indicated that there were no significant differences between the ratings of judges using only the traditional interview method and the ratings of those benefiting from the additional video tape. However, the lack of agreement among the judges in ranking the candidates in both the interview and the videotaped demonstration may have been significant enough  to mask any treatment effect of the video tape. A criterion, and evaluative check list, or some other rating process that has reliability, needs to be developed by school systems for the selection of teacher candidates.

The study focused on a) the expectations of the roles played by 69 aides, 64 teachers, and 6 administrators; b) the ability of each group to perceive the role expectations of another group; and c) each group's perception of aides' behavior. The instruments used were a behavior log and a role-norm inventory of 24 items divided into four task areas: Instructional-Management (IM), Instructional-Teaching (IT), Instructional-Support (IS), and Clerical (C). Results showed a) the major responsibility for aides was IS, C, and IT roles; b) teachers were more restrictive in their expectations than were aides; c) aides' behavior was more  restrictive than any group's expectations; and d) teachers' and aides' expectations showed greatest congruence for C, IS, and IM roles and least for IT. Teachers saw aides as more restrictive than the aides were, and aides saw teachers as less restrictive than the teachers were. Aides assumed more responsibility for IT tasks in open-space schools and more responsibility for IS and C tasks in traditional schools.

The general findings of the study, which assesses and compares the two systems as barometers of student achievement and evaluates student and faculty reactions to the H-P-F system, are as follows: a) the H-P-F system discriminates more sharply between exceptional and average student achievement than the A-B-C-F system; b) almost three out of four graduate education students who were graded under the system approved it; c) more than half of the instructors who used  the H-P-F system and three-quarters of those who did not approved the H-P-F grading system.

In addition to having expertise in the form of broad backgrounds, varied experiences, and skill in demonstrating activities with children, advisors need to be honest, open, gentle, constructive, nondefensive, resourceful, and committed to their work.

Eighteen male subjects were tested on a heart rate response test of 150 beats per minute on a bicycle ergometer at the pace of 50 revolutions per minute (rpm) and at 160 beats per minute at 60 and 80 rpm, with the resistance equal to the force of gravity of three kilograms. The subjects were then randomly divided into three training groups, each group to train at one of three initial testing paces. All three groups significantly improved performance on all three performance tests to the .01 level of confidence. No significant differences were found among the groups on any of three performance tests. It was concluded that, within the limitations of this study, pace training appears  to be general rather than specific with regard to cardiovascular endurance training. (Authors/JA)",

Other questions on the questionnaire asked about the improvement of the participants' knowledge  of minority groups (including young people, senior citizens, and women) and about increased sensitivity to their colleagues and students. Specific results are included in the tables in the text. The conclusions see the course experience as bringing some increased flexibility, increased awareness of behavior that needs changing, and increased sensitivity to colleagues and students. (JA)",

Sixty student teachers were divided into three groups of 20 students each. Two groups, \"urban\" for urban elementary schools and \"suburban\" for suburban, used traditional teacher preparation programs. The third group, the \"project\" group, participated in an experimental program for students doing their preservice teaching in inner-city classrooms. The instrument used in the study was a student survey using a 10-point scale to rate the influence, positive or negative, of eight groups of people: parents,  teachers, professors, peers, cooperating teachers, college supervisors, principals, and pupils' parents or other members of the community. Results indicated significant positive differences for \"project\" students.

The control treatment involved completion of the CT following 10 minutes of rest on the ergometer. Oxygen uptake was significantly higher following PE at every stage except the second 30-second period of the CT and the 60-second post-CT period. Ventilation was significantly higher following PE at every stage except the last 30 seconds of the CT and the 60-second post-CT period. HR was significantly higher following PE at every stage. Oxygen pulse was significantly higher following PE only during the 30-second pre-CT period and the  first 30 seconds of the CT, indicating that the PE facilitated the mobilization of stroke volume (SV) and/or atrioventricular oxygen difference. The similar values for oxygen pulse during the last 90 seconds of the CT indicate that the higher oxygen uptake following PE was a function of higher HR, not higher SV or atrioventricular oxygen difference.

There must be a concentrated effort to increase the number of black candidates available for suburban schools by improving teacher recruitment procedures, replacing the antiquated antidiscrimination employment laws, and encouraging foundations to support pilot projects.

It is stated that some teacher rating procedures ignore the student's responsibility to learn. Reference is made to the \"Joint Statement on Rights and Freedom of Students,\" which while upholding the right of a student's freedom of expression, further insists that he is responsible for learning the content of any course of study in which he is enrolled. To balance out the one-sided nature of course evaluations, different instruments, including various taxonomies, and possible student self-inventory questions are suggested. Teacher self-inventory and the provision of all evaluation results to students are also recommended. (JA)",

Reports are cited that emphasize operant learning as a means of behavior modification. In this instance, the teacher provides a favorable learning situation and arranges environmental factors to increase or decrease the frequency of certain responses. Implementation of operant learning is achieved through programmed instruction. The principles of this instruction are as follows: a) reward as a motivation for learning, b) learning in small steps, c) active participation in learning, d) learning with few or no errors, and e) learning at one's own pace.

The schools were categorized according to degree and length of implementation and according to location (rural, suburban, urban, and inner city). The following questions were investigated: Do significant differences exist in a teacher's perception of school climate in relation to degree of implementation? Do differences exist in a teacher's perception of school climate in relation to location? Do differences exist in relation to length of implementation? What differences exist in perceptions between teachers in IGE schools and non-IGE schools? Analysis revealed no significant difference in a teacher's  perceptions of school climate when compared to high and low degrees of implementation. A significant increase in Development Press and a significant decrease in Control Press were found as the degree of implementation of IGE increased in rural and inner-city schools. A significantly lower perception of Control Press was found for teachers in the second year of the IGE model as compared with teachers in the first and third years.

This is so, it is argued, because of the American cultural preference for muscle over mind, instinct over brain. Typical American heroes through history have been Davy Crockett, Kit Carson, John Wayne, and Joe Namath--not the schoolteacher type. Also described are quasi-Dickensian tag names assigned to teachers in stories (e.g., Miss  Lizzie, Miss Oates, Miss Sweet, Weasel Wilson) that immediately characterize the teachers in the stories and indicate teacher stereotypes. In addition, this speech includes an analysis of one short story, \"How Educational Progress Came to Greenwood County.\" The speech's conclusions stress that through teacher portraits in short stories, teachers have an opportunity to see themselves as others see them and change, if they can.

Sixty-six subjects took part. The research tested the hypotheses that these programs would not affect the teachers' perceptions concerning a) self concept, b) personal beliefs, c) degree of open-mindedness, d) classroom practices, e) student relationship, and f) reaction to classroom situations. All subjects were pretested with the Personal Orientation Inventory (POI), Relationship Inventory (RI), Personal Beliefs Inventory (PBI), Teacher Practices Inventory (TIP), Dogmatism  Scale (DS), Teacher Situation Reaction Test (TSRT), and the Tennessee Self Concept (TSC). The experimental group of teachers completed the DS, PBI, TSRT, and the TPI. The following implications emerged: a) efforts should be made to determine the individual needs of prospective teachers, and assignments should be made to individual programs; b) sequential humanistic programs should be implemented early in the college program with emphasis on course presentation; and c) future programs should be designed with frequent public school experiences early in the college program.

Two sections of an English course were used for the experiment, both taught by the same instructor, with identical syllabus, assignments, term papers, and final examination.  No significant differences were found in grades earned by the students in these two groups.

        "description":"The data presented in this report call attention to inappropriate use of the Eigenroot criterion in factor work, a practice which has probably grown out of a theoretical focus on determining basic laws of behavior, rather than a practical emphasis on providing information that will be useful to college instructors and administrators. When researchers have sought only the general, broad dimensions that occur in Course-Instructor Survey (CIS) ratings, instructors and administrators have concluded that only these larger factors are needed in describing the evaluation of courses and instructors. In reality, however, administrative decision making and the provision of comprehensive feedback to instructors may demand that more specific factors be identified. In such cases, the  proportion of variance criterion for stopping factoring may reveal information which would be lost were the Eigenroot criterion applied without regard to variance extracted. The question of when to stop factoring, then, seems to be best answered in terms of whether general laws of behavior are sought, or basic dimensions for specific practical applications are desired.

The chief issue raised by it is, &quot;Should legislators or other lay groups be permitted to intrude into the professional's province?&quot; The intrusions have occurred repeatedly, with educators serving as convenient scapegoats. Whether the particular law in question, the Stull Act, becomes a positive or negative instrument will be determined by the spirit of those who must develop the means to reach its goal and the attitude of those who have responsibility for determining what is to be done with the results. For this reason,  the profession must be concerned about the Stull Act to ensure that it does not interfere with the development of the best possible programs of teacher education and the requisite laws needed to produce such programs. The legislature must determine desirable goals, but it should not prescribe how the professional should reach those objectives. (Author/JA)",

An independent research agency was contracted to evaluate the program. Areas being investigated are attitudes of parents, teachers and students; school attendance; school climate; and scholastic achievement. Results thus far are generally favorable, although some negative effects are suggested. Among the positive findings are the parents' reports that their children like school more, increased school involvement of parents, enthusiasm for the project by the parents and teachers, and improved attendance for both bused and nonbused students. Negative findings suggest that bused students were a less cohesive group  than nonbused students, perhaps attended a more \"competitive\" school, felt more friction existed at school than did nonbused Burroughs students, and perhaps were less satisfied than nonbused Burroughs students. Some of these negative findings were inconsistent with results from parent and teacher interviews. Some of the inconsistency may be due to the use of the nonbused Burroughs students as a comparison group, which assumes that prior to the busing program, the bused students were no different from the nonbused Burroughs sample. If this assumption is wrong, the results of the questionnaire comparisons are not valid. Scholastic achievement data were not available. (Author/KM)",

The Leadership Lab, created to prepare a student leader to interact with a variety of people found in the typical school setting, provides students with structured learning experiences that progress from basic communication and group interaction to flexible leadership skills. Evaluation of the program was carried out simultaneously with the training sessions. These sessions were conducted at five high schools, two groups of students in each school, with approximately 17 students in each group. To measure change in interpersonal skills and personality characteristics, pretests were administered at the beginning of the training sessions, and the same tests  were again administered at the end of the sessions. The instruments used in testing were the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) and the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility (IAR). Other instruments used to collect information were Student Survey, Student Questionnaire, and Exercise 22-A from the training manual. As not all students returned the posttest and some did not use the same identifying number of the pretest on the posttest, the sample of CPI and the IAR were biased. Results of the evaluation, which are given in 29 tables, showed that personality characteristics and interpersonal skills measured by the CPI did not change over the period of the training sessions to a significant degree, whereas personality characteristics and interpersonal skills represented by the IAR  showed significant change. Copies of the CPI, a page of the IAR, the Student Survey, and the Student Questionnaire are provided. (DB)",

        "description":"A method for self-appraisal of muscular strength and physical working capacity consisting of a simple 13-grade rating scale was applied in a study of the physical fitness of a group of 70 middle-aged men. The method functioned well as shown by the similarities in means and standard deviations between ratings and laboratory measurements of the \"same\" variables. Significant correlations of the size .30-.40 were obtained between self-ratings of fitness and measure fitness. The highest correlation, r = .52, was obtained between ratings of endurance fitness and preferred work load (for a moderate training session) for work on the tread-mill. The method is applicable in evaluating other personality characteristics of importance for the understanding of people and their adaptation to  the demands of work, leisure time activities etc. By comparing the subjective ratings with \"objective\" test results, quantitative measuresments of an individual's \"reality conception\" can be obtained.

The goals of the conference were open communications on the topic of desegregation, discussions relevant to this topic, active involvement of participants, and the acquisition of useful knowledge about steps to be taken toward integration. The conference was evaluated by use of a questionnaire distributed to all participants who attended the closing session (n = 225). A total of 200 questionnaires were returned. The questions were related to the goals of the conference plus three additional questions related to the reactions of the participants to presentations made by consultants,  conference arrangements and facilities, with the final question designed to determine if reaction to the conference was related to participant characteristics, e.g., experience, sex, race, etc. The questionnaire data showed that the conference made moderate progress toward its goals. The greatest differences in response to program activities occurred between black and white administrators; these differences were variable. A number of differences were also noted between male and female reactions, but these were directed more at conference facilities than program content. The percent participants' responses are provided in relation to each of the questions. (DB)",

During the 1971-1972 school year, 50 students were enrolled at the center, of whom 47 took standardized achievement tests in reading and math in Ooctober 1971 and May 1972. The tests were the Gates-MacGinitie Test in Reading Comprehension and Vocabulary, Stanford Achievement Test in Word Meaning, Paragraph Meaning, Arithmetic Computation, Arithmetic Concepts, and Arithmetic Applications. The same tests were taken on both the pretest and posttest. Results of the tests showed that  the students made excellent progress in reading and made good progress in arithmetic.

A comparison group of students was also selected for study from a non-target school. The study population was all 1969-70 fourth graders whose test scores were at or below the 25th percentile on publisher norms of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Comprehension Test. The Target group consisted of 126 students, and the non-Target group consisted of 154 students. In January 1970 and October 1971, both student groups took the same form of the Vocabulary and Comprehension Gates-MacGinitie Test, as well as the Modern Mathematics Supplement to the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills. Target  Area students made grade equivalent gains on both the Vocabulary and Comprehension Tests, which was below the expected gain of 1.6 suggested by the publisher's norms. The non-Target students made gains of 1.1 in vocabulary and 1.5 in comprehension. Thirty percent of the Target students made gains of 1.6 or better in vocabulary and 33% made or exceeded 1.6 in comprehension. In math, the Target group had a pretest grade equivalent score of 3.0 and a posttest score of 4.4. The non-Target group went from 3.0 to 4.8. Results of comparing the posttest scores of the Title I Target students with a similar group of educationally disadvantaged non-Target students showed that both groups performed about the same in reading comprehension, but the non-Target group performed somewhat better in  vocabulary and math.

        "description":"The Continuous Progress Primary (CPP) was adopted in grades K-3 at Bethune Elementary School (Minneapolis) in 1970. The intermediate grades (4-6) were organized in grade levels. In the CPP, each child progresses at his own rate, the emphasis being on small-group learning. The school staff took part in a questionnaire evaluation of the CPP in May 1972. Respondents indicated a need for more parental involvement, although there was more parental involvement in the CPP than in the traditional program. The staff also felt that the CPP increased their effectiveness in meeting individual student's needs; they were pleased with the basic skills instruction in the CPP, but about half of the staff felt the children in CPP got insufficient instruction in other academic areas; and they  generally felt the available resources and services were adequate. The program for five-year-olds was viewed as a success, but about 80% of the staff felt that the five-year-olds should not be with the older children the entire day. Eighty percent of all respondents and all of the primary teachers thought the CPP should be continued.

The method of the study involved two phases: the selection of test items equally appropriate for Spanish- and English-speaking students for use in equating the two tests; and the equating analysis itself. The method of the first phase was to choose two sets of items, one originally appearing in Spanish, the other originally appearing in English; to translate each set into the other language; and to administer both sets in the appropriate language mode for pretest purposes to both types of students. These administrations were conducted in the Fall of 1970 with samples of  condidates taking the PAA or the SAT at regularly scheduled administrations. They provided data regarding the difficulty and discrimination power of each item for each of the two groups, and an index of appropriateness of each item for both groups. On the basis of the analyses of these data, two sets of items, one verbal and the other mathematical, were chosen and assembled as &quot;common items&quot; to be used for equating. In the second phase of the study, these &quot;common items,&quot; appearing in Spanish and in English, were administered in the appropriate language along with the operational form of the PAA in November 1971 and with the operational form of the SAT in January 1972. The data resulting from the administrations of these &quot;common items&quot; were used to calibrate for differences in the  abilities of the two groups and permitted both linear and equipercentile equating of the two tests.

        "description":"The University of Puerto Rico Medical School conducted six-month Physician Retraining Programs (Curos de Perfecionamiento) for two groups of foreign trained physicians starting in the Summer of 1970 and the Spring of 1971, respectively. The characteristics of the 84 participants in these programs are examined in terms of pre-Curso medical knowledge and licensing indices and academic potential; Curso achievement indices; and post-Curso medical knowledge and licensing indices. Findings indicate that the physicians in the two programs: (1) were essentially equivalent prior to Curso participation; (2) showed significant but differential gain during the programs; and (3) performed somewhat better on subsequent Puerto Rico licensing examinations than a group of foreign-trained  physicians from the general population. All indications, therefore, suggest the success of the Curso in improving the medical knowledge of participants and improving the likelihood of their subsequent licensing (and thus better utilization in a sparse health manpower pool).

In these instruments, the use of content words is primarily studied through the use of single-word measures, such as a picture vocabulary test and an auditory discrimination test, whereas the use of functor words is studied by three different measures: a listening comprehension test, a test which measures the receptive understanding of certain grammatical constructions, and a test which measures the ability of the child to produce the same or similar constructions. These last two measures are designed to provide information which can be used to compare the child's receptive vs. productive use of grammatical structures. The intent  of the CIRCUS measures is to provide the teacher with a reasonable sampling of the child's language. The CIRCUS instruments measure the growth of the child's spoken language by observing three types of language use: descriptive, functional, and narrative. (DB)",

A comprehensive program of individual assessment should include provision for gauging three major aspects of context: (1) inferences about personal characteristics, particularly about competencies, should be relative to the context of environment, education experiences, and programs to which the child has been exposed; (2) inferences about a particular characteristic or competency should be relative to the context of his general personality and intellectual makeup, or at least to the  salient features of that makeup; and (3) inferences about measured characteristics should be relative to the context of the measurement process per se. Strategies for the assessment of these aspects of context, particularly as exemplified in the ETS CIRCUS approach to comprehensive assessment, are considered. For a comprehensive program of measurement to deal meaningfully with the assessment of context, it must include provision for multivariate analysis and for the display, reporting, and interpretation of interactive and moderated relationships.

Activities, or process objectives, for the attainment of the product objectives were: workshops, classroom visits, coordination of support services, meeting between counselors and teachers, and information dissemination regarding activities. The counselors and the program were evaluated by the teachers, and student perceptions of the counselor, student attitudes toward school and teachers, and parent and student  involvement were obtained. Results of the study showed that teacher opinions of counselor effectiveness were much better than they were the previous year; students at Jordan had somewhat less favorable attitudes toward their counselors and the counseling relationship than did students the previous year; at Marshall University school, more teacher-counselor contacts and more favorable ratings of counselor effectiveness were reported by team teachers than by non-team teachers or by teachers the previous year; team students had more positive attitudes toward school and had more input into class decisions.

The process evaluation during the third year concentrated on three areas: group instructional methods, instructional materials other than the Standard Teaching Sequence booklets, and prescription practices. To determine whether the IPI project was successful in raising the median raw scores on overall mathematics achievement, the basic evaluation techniques used during the third year were a standardized achievement test, a semantic differential attitude scale, a locally developed arithmetic basic skills test, a record of student progress in the IPI continuum, and teacher  interviews. Students in grades 4-6 in two other Title I elementary schools were used as a comparison population. The evaluation data are tabulated and discussed. Results of the study showed that Hall students continued to make progress during the third year. Students in grades 3 and 4, who had had most of their formal math instruction with IPI, had higher percentile ranks than students in grades 5 and 6. Process evaluation of instructional activities indicated differences between classrooms in use of group instruction, variety of instructional materials, and prescription practices. Reactions of the teachers emphasized the value of the individualized approach for student achievement and attitude. Fourth and fifth grade students at Hall had a more positive attitude toward math than did  students at the two comparison schools.

Two categories of observed behaviors are reported: (1) the children's use of three major activity areas, and (2) social interactions. The data indicate that differential use of the areas is a function of both prior experience and sex, and that the dating back to infancy children emit more positive social behaviors than the contrast group. Attempts to show relationships between the observed behaviors and IQ indicated no  correlations. A series of 48 serial correlations were run using individual children. These analyses showed variation among the behaviors in the degree to which entering behavior influences later behavior. Serial correlation patterns were not apparently influenced by age, sex, or entering intellectual ability. (Author)",

It is introduced as a tool appropriate to the investigation of some symbolic interactionist questions focusing on the temproal and processual features of actor's courses of action. The main features of the CC are: (1) a free-response listing of 10 anticipated future life events; (2) Likert type items tapping respondent's attitudes toward each listed event along six different dimensions; and (3) four measures of CC &quot;configurational patterns&quot; (i.e., perceptions of conflict, complementarity, and means-ends relationships among listed events; and an importance ranking of events). A working hypothesis is inferred from Blumer's discussion of constructed actions: respondent's attitudes toward any given  CC event will vary with that event's configurational locus in the CC. An exploratory analysis of this hypothesis, using CC protocols produced by 295 college students, is presented. It shows moderate to strong relationships between configurational locus of &quot;graduation from college&quot; on the one hand and subjective certainty of graduation on the other. It also shows that while control for sex does not affect the relationship involving the configurational factor of &quot;conflict,&quot; there is a strong interaction effect for the relationship involving &quot;complementarity.&quot; Complementarity does not influence subjective certainty of graduation for men, but for women, subjective certainty of graduation is increased when that is seen as complementary with other CC events.

In such populations, the extremes usually are poorly represented, and the parameter estimates are relatively poor at these extremes. For criterion-referenced scales, the range of interest is defined by a range of the characteristic rather than the distribution of that characteristic  in some population.

        "description":"The present paper outlines two alternative strategies for evaluating teaching effectiveness. These are: (1) within-subject reversal designs, and (2) multiple baseline testing procedures. Each design is discussed in terms of its application to research problems in higher education. In reversal designs, the student is exposed to different teaching procedures during successive phases of a course. Changes in performance between treatments are analyzed, either on the basis of group averages or in terms of individual performances. The reversal design becomes even more powerful if a second group of students goes through the treatments in opposite order, thus counterbalancing the two groups for possible changes in difficulty across conditions. In the multiple baseline testing procedure,  students are given a comprehensive examination before instruction begins, and at the end of each successive phase of the course. This allows the instructor to demonstrate that changes in performance are functionally related to specific teaching procedures introduced during each phase. Furthermore, it provides a continuous baseline measure over material that has been trained. Percentage gains over baseline levels can be used to measure differential effects of different teaching procedures. Similar to the reversal design, the multiple baseline design allows the researcher to make statements about the effects of each procedure on individual students. (Author/DB)",

The predicted scores raise questions about the effectiveness of either the BSCS courses, the BSCS examination, or both. (Author)",

Some considerations on the conceptual framework of this problem in statistical terms are presented, and tentative definitions for certain terms are also given. Examples taken from published material and recent surveys showing the extent of grade repetition are included. Data on dropouts are not given. The main approaches to the study of wastage are reviewed, and the computational steps for evaluating educational wastage through the \"reconstructed cohort\" method are demonstrated in very simple terms. The basic principles and methodology as applied to a case study of Colombia are developed, and a comparative urban/rural analysis is made with a view to demonstrating the differential  measurement of the components of educational wastage as compared with the national aggregate. Observations and suggestions on research to be carried out following the 32nd session of the International Conference on Education are made. Appendixes provide (1) selected list of studies and publications, and (2) three case studies (Dahomey, India, and Morocco). (Author/DB)",

The advantages of the PEP system are: (1) it is a self-improvememt system of program development; (2) PEP allows local autonomy as to what changes are to occur; (3) PEP builds into the evaluation structure a deliberate mechanism for the change process and for implementing strategies derived; (4) feedback is meant to be formatively specific rather than descriptively general; (5) PEP serves valuable in-service and consultation function; (6) there is participation of all staff members at the local level; and (7) many changes can be identified that require no increase  in resources. General procedures of the program are outlined; these relate to: Pre-Visit Preparations (internal evaluation, selection of evaluators, requested time lines, in-service programs, internal reports, and selection of evaluation team members); Arrangement for On-site Visits; On-site Visits (arrival, procedures, and post-visit feedback); Change Mechanism for Implementing Recommendations (local team, final disposition of &quot;change strategies,&quot; implementation and monitoring of board resolutions). The most important single component of the PEP is the selection of the evaluation team; criteria for selecting the members are provided. Two evaluation forms are included: &quot;Teacher Input for Self Evaluation&quot; and &quot;Criteria for Use in Both Self- and Peer-Evaluations.&quot; A flowchart of the PEP is  provided. (DB)",

In all, 10 studies were conducted, 7 of which were directly relevant to investigating variables affecting perceived or actual control, and 3 being &quot;spin-off&quot; experiments. The seven studies tested the following hypotheses: the effects of control cannot be accounted for strictly by the fact that when one has control he also often is able to predict; that increased amounts of prior no-control would interfere with subsequent effects of gain or control; that unpredictable events elicited more autonomic activity than predictable events; that differing degrees of no-control would have different effects upon the control phenomena; the  effect of control and/or no control prior to either control or no control and the effect of predictability; that subjects could be misled as to whether or not they had control and that their perception was an important variable in the effect of control; and that subjects would more frequently elect to control under conditions that had increased control. The three spin-off studies were concerned with modeling. The methods used to evaluate the hypotheses were varied, and each involved an experiment manipulation to induce the condition under study. Results of the studies showed that: being able to predict or control aversive stimuli reduces the negative effects; prior experience with contol has the effect of modifying subsequent experience; the phenomena apply to those situations in which  others are the recipients of the aversive stimuli; and to affect the phenomena, powerful variables must be employed as the control phenomena are robust.

The collected data were used to determine whether the differences between the first and second waves of respondents would have predicted correctly the known distribution of the non-respondents. Results of the study showed that the direction of change between the first and second waves does not usually predict correctly even the direction of difference between the second wave and the non-respondents, and the differences between the predicted and  observed distributions of the non-respondents are often significantly greater than what would be expected by chance alone.

Present test validity is based on face validity and the rationale behind the item selection and construction procedures. The inventory also provides a springboard from which other ideas may come. The inventory is comprised of 24 test items that relate to language, facial characteristics, foods, games, clothing, sports, and flags. The use of five faces beneath each item seems to work well with children in a wide range of age, sex, and ethnic categories. The test provides a score based on an equal number of items representative of each culture. It is a relatively quick instrument to  administer (20-30 minutes), and is easy for both test administrator and subjects to understand. The age range of subjects who can be expected to understand and relate to the test is from 3 to 12 years, although older subjects have been used; the test should be administered individually to those of junior-high age or older. Administration of the test is discussed as to time considerations, physical facilities, materials, language considerations, special considerations by age group, and instructions to students (ages 3 through 8 and ages 9 and above) and terms to be used for test items. The test is scored by assigning a value of 1 to 5. A copy of the Test Data Recording Form is provided. (Author/DB)",

The curriculum emphasizes personalized help and team work with peers. The academic part of the program, the Pocket School, emphasizes English, social studies, and math. The second part of the program, the Positive Peer Culture, involves group sessions in which a group leader and a few students meet to discuss students' personal problems and ways of solving them. Questionnaires and interviews were used to obtain information from administrative staff, faculty and students for evaluation of the program. None of the 22 students in the peer group wanted to continue with the group for the coming year. About half wanted to continue with the  Pocket School. About 60 percent of the faculty thought that the Pocket School should or could be continued if modifications were made. A similar percentage thought that the peer group could be continued with changes. It was apparent that the leaders and the faculty of the peer group did not share a common philosohpy. Evaluators raised questions about the adequacy of training for teachers in the Pocket School and for group leaders. Recommendations, if the program is to continue, include: a written statement of goals; formulations of a common philosophy; appointment of a director for the program; keeping the program entirely at one facility; and complete administrative support for the program.

These responses were analyzed separately. Of the users, 97% had made referrals this year. Regular weekly visits by the VAC were the most usual method of contact, and most people  found him easily accessible when needed. Only about 1/3 of the respondents thought all handicapped students who should be getting help were getting it. Students response was thought to be positive, and there was general agreement with the vocational plans worked out by the VAC. Feedback was a problem for some. It was recommended that better information about eligibility requirements be provided at both junior and senior high levels, that feedback be improved after a student's rehabilitation program has been implemented, that referral be simplified, that students and parents be better informed, and that instructions for screening be given to all school personnel.

        "description":"In an earlier pilot study of the narrative sections of Navy performance evaluations for senior enlisted personnel in pay grade E-7, it was determined by content analytic techniques that it is possible to differentiate between the performance of typical and superlative chief petty officers based on the narrative content of Evaluation Reports. A second study attempted to cross validate the pilot study results on new Evaluation Reports for senior enlisted men in the same two occupational ratings (AT's and BT's) represented in the pilot study sample and to extend the content analysis to two different occupational ratings (CS's and RM's) in order to test the generalizability of the content analytic techniques developed earlier. As a further refinement, the cross validation and  generalization samples were analyzed without any knowledge of the ratee's relative position in the upper half of the marking scale on Performance of Duty (the criterion variable). A reliability study was also conducted whose objectives were twofold: (1) to determine the level of agreement among four individuals all of whom independently would perform a content analysis of the same corpus of 48 Evaluation Reports, and (2) to investigate if nonresearchers could be trained successfully to apply the complex content analysis methodology developed in the pilot study. This report presents detailed evidence that the pilot study findings essentially were extendible to the blind cross validation sample consisting of the same two ratings and also were generalizable to two different occupational  ratings. Despite the initial expectation that it would be extremely difficult to train nonresearch-oriented individuals to consistently index the narrative sections of Evaluation Reports, the surprising result in the reliability study was that in only six training sessions a quite respectable level of agreement was achieved.

In IPI, short tests are used to determine the level of proficiency of each student in precisely defined learning objectives. The output of these tests is used to guide instructional planning for individual students. The nature and effect of errors in proficiency decisions are described and a procedure for reducing the probability of such errors is proposed. The plan calls for a Bayesian procedure which would incorporate prior information on the instructional program, for example the distribution of the percentage of items answered correctly by students. Such a procedure would permit inferences about the true level  of functioning of each student. The final section of the paper proposes two methods for implementing these procedures in an ongoing IPI program: one approach calls for the integration of the procedure as a part of a computer-based instructional management system, whereas the second approach describes how the procedure can be made tractable in a typical, non-automated IPI classroom.

The educational literature from the early 1960's to the present from the following sources was searched: the ERIC system, the Library of Teachers College, Columbia University, the in-house document collection of the ERIC Information  Retrieval Center on the Disadvantaged, and several existing bibliographies. A few pieced dated prior to 1960 were included. The bibliography is arranged alphabetically by author and is followed by a subject index. Each citation is cross-referenced under two or more of the index terms which, hopefully, best describe the material. The bibliography is completely annotated. For those documents which deal only in part or peripherally with minority groups, relevant quotations are given or the relevant sections are described.

This module is designed in the hope that it will help the poor to make better use of their income, as well as with the expectation that those of higher income will be more understanding of the problems of  their fellow citizens. The modules in this series are being prepared as separate publications to provide greater flexibility.

Specifically, attention is directed to: (a) the role of parental status attainments and family environments in the transmission of intellectual advantage-disadvantage across generations; (b) the possibility that children's abilities affect the nature of the environment to which they are exposed; and, (c) the dimensionality of family environment as a prerequisite to (a) and (b). Data on children's ability (males only), family environments, and parental status attainments from 100 families were provided by Dr. Harry Mosychuk, Director of Research with the Edmonton, Canada, Public School Board. Data collection for the present investigation involved  contacting these families again and administering an intelligence test to both parents where possible. Visits were made with 72 of the original 100 families and usable parent ability data obtained for 69 of these. These comprised complete data for 55 families, and ability data on one parent only in another 14 families. Ability measures were the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children and Adults, respectively. The data provided general support for the existence of a triple advantage (disadvantage). It seems that children of intellectually advantaged parents are themselves advantaged in terms of genetic endowment (although this could not be shown in this investigation), the family environment in which they develop, and in the degree of control they have over this environment.

        "author":["Lachat, Mary Ann"],
        "description":"This study investigates the attitudes of white seniors toward black Americans in three suburban high schools varying in terms of the possible interaction between black and white students as reflected in each school's racial composition, grouping procedures, and curricular options. The study compared the attitudes of high school seniors in an all white high school with those of seniors in two racially mixed high schools. It was hoped that the study would provide some insights about the effect of intergroup contact on attitudes. However, the study also examined the implications of findings which maintain that contact alone may not break down the stereotypes between the two groups if the contact occurs in situations where status distinctions are maintained. The study thus make a  distinction between an integrated setting which seeks to facilitate the positive interaction of a racially mixed student body, and a desegregated setting which does not foster interaction. The racial attitudes of the high school seniors were determined through written responses to a questionnaire of belief statements. Much of the data described situational characteristics within each high school which could be affecting student attitudes. These included school philosophy, grouping procedures, classroom racial balance, staff racial balance, curricular and library offerings related to the black experience, and patterns of student interaction in the two racially mixed settings. The writer obtained these data through interviews and observations. (Author/JM)",

Two hypotheses were tested: (1) blacks with low reading skills who receive an oral version of acculturation materials will perform significantly better than similar blacks who receive a written version; and (2) blacks with high reading skills who receive an oral version of the acculturation materials will perform at a level equivalent to similar blacks who receive a written version. The respondents were 39 unemployed black males from the community of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. The respondents' ages ranged from 18 to 29, with a mean of 21.5. A set of 20 &quot;critical&quot; incident items was selected for use from a larger  pool of items which constitutes the Culture Assimilator: For Interaction with White People. For individuals in the written condition, each item consisted of a &quot;booklet&quot; of six pages. Respondents in the oral condition were presented the same material in the same order over a tape recorder. It was felt that the purpose of the present investigation was not simply to test an oral versus version of the culture assimilator, but rather to see if performance of blacks with low reading ability could be bettered through the addition of oral stimuli. As such, what is labeled in this study as an oral condition may actually be viewed as an oral presentation with a supplementary written presentations, should the respondent be able to make use of it.

The primary purpose of the first study (involving both nursery and first grade subjects) was to determine what evidence there is of two distinct processes basic to the control over the initiation and inhibition of inappropriate behavior on the Luria task. In the second study the focus of interest was in the relationship between impulsive behavior and the child's success with the academic work presented in the first grade. Other than the fact that the interstimulus interval in the Luria task was shortened to increase the difficulty level to one more appropriate for the first graders, the inclusion of indices of school learning constituted the only departure from the procedure used in the first study. Hence the results of study  two permit an important check on the reliability of the initial findings. The data were consistent in indicating that distinct impulse control problems on the Luria task persist longer in the development of the lower SES child than the child of middle SES. The evidence consistently indicated that impulsive behavior is a more general phenomenon in the lower SES than in the middle SES. There is also reason to believe that this general control problem, in the lower SES, was related to the sorts of impulsive behavior observed by their teachers in the classroom. When intelligence was controlled, lower SES subjects obtained significantly poorer relationship between Luria task impulsively and grades in the middle SES. (Author/JM)",

(b) Even if SES differences occur in the use of recognizable conditional forms, will children within the same SES be able to transmit conditional information to one another? (c) If SES differences are found in transmission of conditional information, are they attributable to lack of comprehension of the conditional logic, or to difficulty in expressing the logic? One hundred and thirty-two fifth grade Caucasian children, who were divided into lower and middle SES groups of approximately equal IQ. Dyads were formed by combining children into the four possible speaker-listener  combinations. The task required speakers to use a conditional communication in describing the rules of a game to a listener. Results showed that, as listeners lower and middle SES children responded equally well to the communications of both lower and middle SES speakers. However, as communicators, the lower SES children performed more poorly than the middle SES: All listeners had equally great difficulty following the instructions provided by the lower SES communicators. The data suggests that SES difference can not be attributed to lack of comprehension of the conditional logic. Instead, it appears that the lower SES children were difficult to understand because of strong tendencies toward egocentric communicational patterns. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Black Arts Literature--of which the New Black Poetry is the most important manifestation--emerged during the past decade as the appropriate artistic counterthrust to Black Power. Rhetoric and shouting aside, this new thrust was, on a very basic level, simply a call to black folks to redefine Blackness and re-evaluate the Black Experience. For the writer, this reassessment has culminated in a redefinition of the role of the artist and a new perspective on what constitutes Art. Black art must of necessity be functional and relevant to the lives and daily struggles of black people. The creator of Black Arts Literature envisions himself as a Necromancer, a skillful manipulator of the Art of Black Magic, whose job it is to \"heal\" Black folks through the evocative power of Art, and  transform their suffering into constructive political action. In representing the masses, the new Art will be expressive of the uniqueness of Afro-American culture. Hence the quest among Black Arts writers for a style rooted in this cultural sensibility, a style that is emerging as an identifiable Black Aesthetic. Nowhere is this Aesthetic more strikingly revealed in the language of the New Black Poetry, for in creating this new linguistic form, the poets are not only tapping the reservoir of the Black Cultural Universe but doing so in the Black Idiom. Poetic genre strike at the heart of the Black Cultural Sensibility: it is only through oral delivery that the audience can fully appreciate the artistic import and meaning the New Black Poetry. This, then, is the \"Power of the Rap.\"  (Author/JM)",

        "description":"During the 1971-72 school year, public and nonpublic schools of Connecticut provided compensatory education help for 50,690 pupils funded in part under ESEA Title I. The programs sought to bring about increased school success for pupils whose school achievement was restricted by economic, social, linguistic or environmental disadvantages. Public and nonpublic school end-of-year evaluations provided the data analyzed in this report. Also, two years of data were gathered separately for 1,896 pupils who received the services of 1970-71 compensatory programs. Average test gain scores in grade equivalent units were calculated for the combined pupils of each program and were the means of judging the effectiveness of programs. Ninety programs were identified as more effective efforts of  compensatory education in the schools of the state. Most were reading help programs; however, math, language, and preschool programs were also identified. Median test gains in reading and math for all compensatory efforts in the state equaled or exceeded a rate of a year's achievement per year for both public and nonpublic school programs in 1971-72. These test gains were based on pre-post testing with intervals of a year or less between testing. When the interval between testing extended over a two year period such as it did for the 1896 pupils followed-up from the 1970-71 more effective compensatory programs, achievement gains appeared to be much closer to just under a year's growth per year for disadvantaged children.

Chapter one discusses the philosophical aspects (pro and con) of prisoner education. Chapter two traces the history of prisoner education from the roots of its beginning to the present. Chapter three presents the data collected by Syracuse University Research Corporation staff during interviews with correctional and educational authorities, through analysis of documents, and from correspondence and discussions with over 300 individuals who served as resource persons to the staff during the project. Chapter four focuses on prisoner education in the future, its needs, problems and probable accomplishments. Chapter five presents a thorough model for  prison authorities to follow in designing prison education programs. Chapter six presents findings, conclusions and recommendations--in the form of what might be considered a \"blue print for action\" for the Ford Foundation. Included are barriers to prisoner education programs, criteria for successful programs, suggestions in improvements that can or should be made, general and specific recommendations. A Bibliography of over 300 documents appears after chapter six.

        "description":"The primary objectives of the Continuing Education of Girls Who Must Leave School Because of Pregnancy Project (CEG), which is funded under Title I of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act, are to reduce the percentage of female dropouts from Detroit schools via the enrollment of 110 pregnant girls in the project, to have the enrolled girls make normal academic progress in a schedule of classes appropriate for their grade level, and to have the girls return to a regular school following the completion of their CEG classes and their pregnancies and complete requirements for their high school graduation. During the school year, the evaluators made many visits to observe the CEG Project in action. They found it projected a warm, non-censuring climate. The fact that every  student at CEG shares a common handicap allows them to provide the mutual support for each other that they need to continue their education. These things combined with a low pupil teacher ratio and the additional supportive services of the project have permitted the girls to resume their classes, begin to restore their self-concepts and self-respect, and revive their educational and career aspirations. Only 14 percent of the CEG girls did not continue their education after their enrollment in the project. Of 292 girls who were enrolled during the 1971-72 school year, 33 (or 11 percent) became dropouts, with the remainder either graduating or returning to school to continue their education. CEG girls achieved a slightly higher honor point average in their CEG classes than they had in  regular school. (Author/JM)",

        "author":["Kallen, David J."],
        "description":"Malnutrition can be defined as a lack of a sufficient quantity or quality of nutrients to maintain the body system at some definable level of functioning. It has been estimated that nearly half the children in the world today grow and develop under conditions of protein or protein-calorie malnutrition sufficient to impair their physical development. In the United States this level of malnutrition is rare. The major problem in the United States is probably that of hunger, defined as a psychological variable. It seems probable that the social and psychological causes and consequences of malnutrition and hunger are themselves conceptually independent. In this paper some of the factors involved in the relationship between malnutrition, learning, and behavior are critically reviewed.  Most of the data are drawn from studies conducted in the developing countries of the world, where the conditions of malnutrition are significantly different from those in the United States. Therefore attention is given to some speculations about the impact of hunger on learning and behavior in this country. The review of the impact of malnutrition on learning and behavior concentrates on methodological and conceptual problems of studies reported in the literature. These problems make it impossible to assess the impact of malnutrition, as a separate entity, on human behavior. Malnutrition is socially regulated, and not random, either in the social system as a whole, or in segments of the social system, be they sub-classes or families. The conditions which lead to malnutrition are also  conditions which affect the intellectual, social, and cognitive development of the child. (Author/JM)",

The major experiment was a 1-1/2 year longitudinal study of teacher bias and expectancy effects on the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) performance of children in two grade 2 and grade 4 classrooms. The major findings were that: telling teachers students will do well did not alter children's SAT performance; teacher ranking was significanlty related to SAT performance from each of the five testing periods; and,  there were no interactions with grade level. These findings were interpreted as indicating that teachers are good predictors of children's academic potential and do not &quot;bias&quot; children's education. The finding of the grade level X experimenter sex X sex of Ss X time study of experimenter bias was the significant triple interaction involving grade level, bias condition, and sex of Ss; this interaction reflected a general trend of older Ss to be more influenced by biasing effects of experimenters than younger Ss. The second experimental study revealed essentially the same effects for experimenters in who bias was induced and those who predicted performance themselves (self-generated bias). (Author/RJ)",

        "description":"This study reports correlations among scores from two commonly used individual measures of intelligence, the Revised Stanford Binet and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and reading subtests of a standardized achievement test with a group of elementary-aged disadvantaged children. The present study employs longitudinal design to assess correlations among beginning-first grade IQ scores and measures of reading performance obtained toward the end of the first, second, third, and fourth grades. The content of both reading and IQ tests thus remained essentially constant, thereby avoiding the confounding of reading ability with the assessment of intelligence. A complementary objective of the study was to determine the test-retest reliabilities of the two IQ measures for  disadvantaged children during the same time interval. Determining reliability and validity of these measures is of particular interest since both tests were standardized on white children of essentially middle socioeconomic backgrounds. The sample included 36 subjects, 18 boys and 18 girls, from the public schools of metropolitan Nashville, Tennessee. The sample comprised children who had participated in an experimental reading project in which they were taught to read by the initial teaching alphabet method during the first and second grades. The findings suggest that verbal ability, particularly verbal proficiency, becomes more highly associated with reading performance as the child proceeds through school. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"While the effects of teacher expectations on learner performance have continued to be of interest to both classroom teachers and researchers, the findings of much of the research have been equivocal. Teacher expectancy statements may affect performance in three rather distinct ways: the past association value of the expectancy statement, the value of the expectancy statement as a sign of approval or disapproval, and the novelty of the expectancy statement. The subjects were 43 eleventh-grade students with a past record of low achievement. These students had been assigned to a special reading program. The six subjects who were, in the opinion of the teacher, the most highly motivated were randomly assigned to each of the six treatment groups. The remaining subjects were then  randomly assigned to one of the respective experimental treatment groups. Six treatment groups were formed from all possible combinations of three types of expectancy statements (high, neutral, or low) and two types of feedback, positive or negative. The results concerning how expectancy interacts with feedback in a low achieving group indicate that (1) when it is low, it stimulates effort by making a task seem difficult, and (2) when it is high, it reinforces effort if negative feedback is being received. One implication of these interpretations is that under conditions where a teacher's statements are not credible, expectancy will not have an effect (unless it has discriminative cue value that is independent of its surface meaning).

The Student Leadership Program outlined was field tested for one year in a low income black elementary school. The specific aims of the program were to reduce the disruptive, negative behavior of some socially powerful students while increasing the rewards for more appropriate models and for teacher efforts to improve the environment for learning. Although it was designed to promote desirable student behavior and attitudes in a \"distressed\" situation where negative attitudes and tensions prevailed, the program is held to have  unlimited application--can be suitably adapted for use with children from grades 3-8 in schools large or small, rural or urban. The three major parts of the manual are: Part I, defining the problem and the rationale of the program; Part II, delineating all steps necessary for setting up the leadership program and getting it under way--alternative methods being noted and suggestions given for possible difficulties encountered; and, Part III, constituting anecdotal records of the first semester of the pilot program, as well as the organizational records thereof.

The judicial attack on private schools has been unsuccessful in stemming their growth as alternatives to integrated public schools. Judicial action in approving desegregation plans has actually contributed to resegregation in some communities. Judges have a distinct problem in trying to assess which desegregation plans will produce maximum desegregation. On the one hand they know that school officials sometimes raise the specter of resegregation  when white flight from the public schools is not really likely. On the other hand the white percentage actually declines when court ordered reassignment is instituted. A judge genuinely interested in the workability of alternative plans must determine what combinations of circumstances are most likely to produce resegregation without really having much information on which to base his decision. Social science, so far, has offered little help. The lower court must contend not only with the lack of information about resegregation, but must produce decisions acceptable to the Supreme Court as well. The Court's two goals of effectiveness and speed may be, under certain circumstances, contradictory. (Author/JM)",

Findings indicate that there has been little change in the relative educational achievement of the major European ethnic groups during the last fifty years. Russians continue to maintain the large lead they has after one generation in this country; Italians, Poles, and French have improved slightly; the British have declined slightly; and Germans and Irish have remained unchanged. On the other hand, blacks and especially Chicanos have dramatically increased their level of schooling relative to the national average. In 1971, very large differences exist in earnings among the ethnic groups, with Russians far ahead and blacks far behind; slightly above blacks are  Chicanos and Puerto Ricans; considerably above the latter are Cubans, Central or South Americans, and other Spanish; between the Latin groups and Russians are the remaining European groups, led by the British, Italians, and Poles. These differences in earnings among men, 18 to 65 years, do not disappear when ethnic differences in age, education, marital status, and location are held constant. Differences in adjusted earnings do not vary with age but do so at least for the Non-European groups with educational level. The pattern seems to indicate that changes in relative quality of schools has not affected black-white earnings differences, but that the protests of the civil rights movement of the sixties have improved relative earnings of well-educated blacks.

        "description":"School community relations in big cities are marked by apathy and distrust and, often, by hostility. Yet, many Federal programs and many pressing urban problems require that administrators and communities work together more closely than ever before. This project analyzes evidence from recent empirical research and from field evaluations to identify the most successful practices which have put administrators and neighborhoods together in shared decision making. The key finding from that analysis is that involvement is successful when it is significant. The tested procedures for involvement were collected as a \"Principal's Handbook for Shared Control in Urban Community Schools.\" The present document, which is a companion report to the Principal's Handbook, presents the evidence on  which the Handbook recommendations are based and it is organized parallel to the Handbook for easy cross reference. A bibliography of over 300 citations is appended. [For the companion document, the Principal's Handbook, see UD 013 893.] (Author/RJ)",

This paper discusses and reviews the nature of that relationship between femininity and high achievement need which has generally been of a reverse nature. The dilemma of being female for the black women is that she is being urged by society in general to cultivate traits that lend themselves to femininity, i.e., dependency, passiveness, submissiveness, and the like. On the other hand, she is pressured by the political-economic system and survival needs of the black community to develop those traits that are contrary to the ideas of womanhood as prescribed by the sex role standard, i.e., independence, self-assertion, persistence, and so on. Historical and future implications are also  discussed. (Author/RJ)",

This study offers evidence toward the following questions: (1) do teachers evaluate students differently according to mode of presentation, students' ethnicity, and social class? and (2) what is the relative influence of aural and visual cues upon teachers' evaluations? Videotapes of Grade 5 and 6 Anglo, black, and Chicano middle and lower class students were presented to 156 teachers who rated the students on 15 semantic differential scales. A 3 x 3 x 2 analysis of variance for repeated measures revealed significant effects for all 15 scales. Anglos were  rated most positively, followed by blacks; chicanos were rated least favorably. Middle class Anglos and blacks were rated more favorably then lower class Anglos and blacks, respectively; however, class made no difference in the ratings for Chicanos. The aural mode of presentation transmitted more cues than the visual mode. (Authors/RJ)",

It thus produces more antisocial behavior, ineffective education, and lower levels of occupational attainment. The present study employs data collected from a random sample of the 14-18 year old population of Illinois and examines the joint effects of race, gender, social class, and family organization on a number of indicators of family interaction, antisocial behavior patterns, educational aspirations, and gender role conceptions. The conclusions of the Moynihan Report are not supported by these data. There are few differences found in the ways that families treat their children, and these differences are not concentrated in the lower class. Even in the  lower class broken family, there is no indication in the data that black families are dramatically different from white families. Thus, in terms of delinquency, educational expectation, perceptions of the education desired by the parents, self conceptions, and notions of appropriate gender role behavior of adults, it was found that empirical evidence provides less than adequate support for the conclusions reached by the Moynihan Report.

Variations in size, number of products produced, ownership, and dependence upon agriculture as primary or sole source of income  demonstrated the range in differences.

Through long term planning and policy perspective together with immediate short term planning such a reorganization could take place.

This report focuses on the more salient findings of the study with results presented in terms of what students say, do, and know about career development. A major finding is the sharp contrast between need for help with career planning and the help students have been receiving. In general, study results support the current emphasis on career guidance and career education. Because the study is unique both in its focus and its national scope, results should provide educational policy makers and planners at  both the national and local levels with a new perspective on the career development status and needs of students.

The project demonstrated that pre-trial counseling and career development can be introduced into an existing court situation, that it can effect positive changes in the life-styles of defendants within a three-month period resulting in a lower recidivism rate, and that nonprofessionals (exconvicts and exaddicts) can be recruited and trained to perform  effectively as staff counselors. The report includes a project summary and history of the operation, and an epilogue stating that since termination of the demonstration phase of the pilot project it has been incorporated, has doubled its scope to include Brooklyn and the Bronx, and has continued to receive the support of the city and court.

The analytical procedures involved in this research permit identification of the best job position within the training organization which can be used as the OJT training position. Three OJT program models were developed, each based upon different assumptions regarding the program structure. In addition, a general method for utilizing the data to develop  different programs, responsive to other assumptions and constraints, was developed. (Author)",

Reviews of adult education programs sponsored by religious institutions are examined in four areas: participants; concepts; programing; and personnel and instructional techniques. The literature generally was published since 1965 and indicates that adult education in churches and synagogues is experiencing differentiation and integration. There are problems of conceptualization, structure, finances, personnel, and techniques. Within this framework of developing programs, conceptual bases range from strict religious emphasis to secular ones. Much of the criticism is directed toward traditional Bible study taught  through formal lecture. Another problem area is personnel--most teachers and leaders are amateurs in teaching and theology. Some of the eighty-nine references are annotated. (MS)",

        "description":"Personal interviews were conducted in July, 1967, with 315 farm operators in rural Brazil where the local extension service had been in operation for more than four years. Patron-dependence (PD) was described as the subscription to a value system, according to the individual's position in the status structure, which produces dependency at different levels on the local hierarchical structure. It was hypothesized that communication variables are more closely related to agricultural knowledge and innovativeness among low PD than among high PD farmers. The high PD individuals were those with low education, minimal extension agent contact, low functional literacy, lower socioeconomic status, few cosmopolite contacts, minimal mass media exposure, low agricultural knowledge and low  innovativeness, and possessed fewer cows. They relied more often on the decision-making abilities of those occupying superior positions in the system. The PD variable correlated negatively, as expected, with both the communication variables and variables on development; it was further shown that the relationship between PD and development was not affected by controls on socieconomic status and social intergration.

The dynamic program changed frequently during its 2 year term as its range broadened to include provision of information links between existing available services and the families (an expeditor role), shifting emphasis from wide-scope personal service to a more strictly educative function by the family assistants, and preparation of the family assistants to take on community leadership roles after the project ended in June 1971. Basic assumptions regarding the ordering of priorities and the ability of education  to solve problems were found to differ widely between professional and community residents. Staff development was hampered by ambiguities of role and organization structure, ethnic mixtures, and the pressures of urban life. A major finding was that families with extensive problems were unable to utilize project help, but those with less severe problems were receptive to lasting aid. It is concluded that urban extension operations can be effectively carried out but should not be counted on as a base for faculty research or student training. (MS)",

The project staff were to assume the roles of six change agents (analyst, advisor, advocate, systems linkers, innovator, and trainer) to reflect the Project's staff perception of their responsibilities. A systems model was used which contained eight elements; the nature of the elements varied according to the needs of each section of the region because of geographic, cultural, economic, and population differences.

Of the surveyed black men, most were college graduates, young, with few years of work experience. Slightly more than half were satisfied with their career progress; and most reported good relations with white coworkers, supervisors, and subordinates; but three out of five  felt that they did not have the same opportunities as whites in their firm.

        "description":"The author has attempted to assess attitude change of elementary teachers toward career education, industrial arts, and vocational education due to participation in implementation of new instructional units in the Mesa (Arizona) Public Schools. A stratified random sampling technique was used to select experimental and control groups of 100 subjects each. Pretesting of all participating teachers was done before the Comprehensive Career Education Model units were implemented and posttesting was done at the end of the 1972-73 school year. To measure connotative meanings of the three concepts, thirteen semantic differential bipolar scales were developed using factorial composition, relevance, and semantic stability. From the thirteen scalar scores three factor scores and a total  concept score were obtained by simple addition and rated for evaluative potency and activity directional reactions. Positive changes in the potency, activity, and total concept scores for industrial arts accompanied participation in the units. There is evidence that all three concepts were viewed more positively by teachers involved in career education activities, that career education and industrial arts were viewed more positively by male than female teachers, and that industrial arts were viewed more positively by intermediated than primary teachers.

Highest ratings were assigned to such items as freedom to utilize materials, equal opportunities, field trips, developing four year plans, and understanding the principle of the program. There were 186 recommendations for program improvements and changes submitted by classroom teachers, occupational orientation teachers, counselors, and administrators. In addition, students participating in the programs in two school systems were evaluated by pretest and posttest. Indications are that the instructional programming was very effective in these school systems. There are 66  tabular presentations containing the major volume of data and information gathered.

The guiding model emphasized the factors affecting both a person's decision to enter a postsecondary school and his experience and successful completion of schooling. Results indicated that approximately two-thirds of the community youth planned to obtain further education, yet not as many actually enrolled due to indirect money costs, distance, and lack of familiarity. The percentage of disadvantaged who select themselves out of further education is slightly higher than the one-third overall rate. This group as a whole rated their motivation low, whereas  Indian youth still retained an interest. One difference between those planning and not planning further schooling was the role played by the family as a source of information about the schools. Factors which advance the student toward graduation include satisfaction with progress, relevance of education, positive evaluation of school, and slightly higher high school grade point averages.

The project assisted eight HEW Region IV states to institute badly needed training programs for teachers of adults. Teachers participated in workshops and new courses at 22 colleges, then state staff development committees analyzed the new programs and developed individual state plans which were later implemented and refined. At the end of the three-year project it was evaluated as a whole. State plans for adult basic education are now available in each state of the region and at least three times as many inservice courses are now being taught than before the project began. The  number of ABE faculty at institutions of higher education has increased significantly with black institutions of higher education assuming a prominent position in training ABE teachers. Recommendations are that the eight states act as a consortium in seeking federal funding while each state works out formal plans and local teachers become involved in planning local inservice experiences.

The State grant mechanism is studied in terms of the extent to which funds set aside for disadvantaged, for handicapped, and for postsecondary students reach these target populations; the extent to which the States have been able to allocate the Federal funds to the localities based on ability to pay, excess costs of vocational education, vocational needs, and manpower needs; and a review of State vocational education expenditures and the degree to which they reflect Federal vocational education priorities as specified in the 1968 Vocational  Education Amendments. The report concludes that the approach of the 1968 Amendments is an appropriate one in that it fits contemporary American federalism. It further concludes that the Tydings Amendment should be extended but that changes in the formula used to allocate money to the States would be in order. Supportive statistical tables and related data are incorporated into the report. There is a five-page bibliography. (AG)",

The final report assesses the experience in order to develop: (1) suggestions which other universities could use to plan, organize, and carry out similar projects; (2) guidelines for improving the quality of manpower research to facilitate maximum use of the findings; and (3) practical advice for manpower researchers on how to improve the quality of writing  and analysis in their reports.

The largest percentage of undesirable enlistees was found in the high school non-graduate, Category 4, and seventeen year old groups. Using these three categories of variables, it was found that it would be possible to eliminate 34 percent of the undesirables, although 76 percent of the individuals falling in this three category group actually proved to be successful in their military careers. It was emphasized that caution should be used in attempting to establish a screening procedure to identify undesirable enlistees since a  significant number of potentially qualified personnel might be excluded at the same time.

The two models designed were for use in New York City but it is felt that they would be applicable elsewhere. Model A, a sequential plan for use in a community college program, would require 66 college credits for an AAS degree. Two alternating tracks of 20 hours of work would be made possible by relief workers, each relief worker releasing two trainees. Model B, a sequential plan for upgrading nurses aides who do not opt for a community college program involves about 15 months of study prior to the  LPN exam. The sequencing of these programs over a three-year period, costs for Model A, and a statement of required policy decisions to be made by the employers, unions, City University, community colleges, and the State are all shown.

GRIP project included: (1) conducting a two-day workshop for participating teachers; (2) developing organized units of classroom instruction (mini-lessons); (3) involving older people in the classroom setting; and (4) pre- and post-testing of the attitudes toward aging of participating and control children and teachers. Findings indicate children and teachers know very little  about the process and problems associated with aging, with children showing a more positive attitude toward older citizens than do their teachers. Through planned learning activities, childrens' attitudes can be changed to ones of greater acceptance and interest. A relative universality of application of instruction on aging was found to be appropriate. The involvement of older citizens as teacher aides, tutors, or special resource teachers successfully raised the children's understanding of aging and provided a rewarding experience for the older citizens. Appended are workshop agenda, schedule of project activities, test instruments and results, and mini-lesson outlines. (Author/NMF)",

To explore the area of student selfhood support and development, the study developed a needs assessment instrument based on 24 criterion probes to compare desired student status with actual student status. Deficiencies between actual and desired status represent student needs. The investigation also attempted to  identify subgroups of married students sharing similar needs. While finding a high degree of satisfaction among married students, the study discovered seven problem areas: supplemental income, affiliation need, family involvement, relationship with college, child care, job information, and college expectations and opportunities. The author suggests four alterations in student personnel services to meet these needs. (Author/LAA)",

Stressing the alienation and dogmatism of the competing approaches, the authors relate each approach to its operation in community action projects. Social Darwinists favor intergroup conflict to keep the ingroup pure, and ostracize those who do not adhere to values of competition and self-denial. Functionalists see a stratified society whose subsystems inter-relate to produce equilibrium. Militants, showing an intense distrust of establishment officials, demand first-hand experience of the poor peoples' situation. Conflict theory states that people in power use that power in their own interests  but to the disadvantage of the powerless. The pluralistic approach tries to avoid these unrealistic and romantic aspects by introducing flexibility into rule systems and by using feedback to revise rules. The paper concludes with specific recommendations for community action workers. (Author/LAA)",

From social exchange theory it was predicted that both experimental groups would show significant increases on the dependent measures over trials and in comparison with a control group, but the Disagree group would not show the same effect on the leadership rankings.

Using the data from a national survey conducted in 1968, the study constructs indexes on Interpersonal Violence Approval, National Violence Approval, and Political Violence Approval to measure the following aspects of violence experienced in childhood: observing violence, carrying out violence, and being the victim of violence. By computing the correlation of each measure of violence experienced to indexes of violence approval, the study tests the hypothesis that violence in childhood relates to adult approval of violence. Results show that approval of interpersonal violence most highly relates to  experiencing violence as a child.

The programs were based on a theoretical rationale suggesting six classes of factors that influence the career choice process (i.e., change, past experience, personal characteristics, interest, aptitude, values and the world of work). Five decision-making steps in career planning were also stated: identifying the problem, gathering occupational information, exploring vocational alternatives, selecting, implementing and evaluating a choice. Given these factors and stages, the counselors developed multimedia and counseling modules (e.g., vocational  testing and interpretation, life planning exercises, value identification, information-seeking behaviors) that were adapted to specialized client populations. Variants of these modules were presented to several thousand incoming freshmen, marathon groups, a career class and minority students. Research instruments to assess program effectiveness included measures of information of the world of work, vocational maturity, movement towards a career choice and information-seeking behaviors.

The study drew a proportionate random sample, stratified on the basis of sex class year, from the undergraduates in a southeastern coeducational university. The students received mailed questionnaires which examined the use of eight drugs. The results show that marijuana continuers, experimenters, and non-users differ significantly. More users report driving after drinking, using marihuana to overcome depression, and experiencing identity problems. Continuing  marihuana users reported serious suicidal thoughts. The perception of fewer risks involved with marihuana use relates more directly to its use than do indicators of alienation. (Author/LAA)",

The study attempts to examine the process through which teachers' and parents' biases regarding a child are developed and the group differences between the biases. Nine upper-elementary grade teachers assigned equal numbers of children from their own classrooms to three performance categories: Low Performance, Moderate Performance, and High Performance. A child's teacher and his or her parent (usually mother) then completed structured and open-ended questions regarding the reasons why the child performed as he or she did. Results showed that while teachers clearly distinguished differences in causative factors in the different performance conditions,  parents of children in different conditions did not significantly differ in their ratings on each factor. Teaching was rated as more important by parents in all three conditions than by teachers. (Author/WSK)",

Data compiled on dropouts by the South Carolina State Department of Education indicate that approximately one out of every two first graders in South Carolina public schools drops out of school before completing the requirements for a State High School Diploma. Studies conducted to determine the reasons students leave school show no consistent behavioral pattern as to why they withdraw. The most common characteristics of those students withdrawing from school include: lack of interest in school work; economic reasons; a feeling that courses are not relevant to individual needs; attractiveness of outside jobs, wages, and experiences; poor self-concept; etc.  The report states that the dropout-prone student generally follows a well-defined path: his interest in school diminishes and grades start to drop, and he begins skipping classes and is perceived as a disciplinary problem by school authorities. The publication concludes that serious efforts must be made to deal with the dropout-prone student. (WSK)",

The study relates to the problem of college persistence and investigates two general hypotheses concerning the influence of the nonintellective variables of personality characteristics on the criterion status of graduate and nongraduate students from the University of Minnesota. The study takes into account evidence which indicates that: (1) nonintellective factors such as personality characteristics are important determinants of college success; (2)  nonintellective correlates of college performance are specifically tied to ability levels; and (3) sex interacts with factors affecting academic performance.

The program deals with typical real-life situations faced by many young adults in a variety of settings and situations. The exercises provide participants with an opportunity to learn more about themselves and their peers by helping them learn how to develop and apply decision-making skills. The materials retain the decision-making concept of \"Deciding\", but the focus of \"Decisions and Outcomes\" is the utilization, application, and evaluation of information, objectives, and strategies in the  context of more complex personal, educational, and career decisions. The program content is divided into four separate sections: the starting point; the deciding self; before deciding; and apply skills.

Subjects were recruited by mail from the list of incoming Freshmen of the University of California at Riverside and sampled randomly to represent one fifth of the Freshman class. Since subjects were paid for their participation there was a high response rate to this form of solicitation for a total sample size of 256. The results show that males and females differ significantly in attitudes. The discriminant function coefficients indicated that mechanical curiosity has the greatest discriminating power, with males showing greater curiosity. The comparison among major field groups yielded a highly significant difference among groups, as well as a significant  interaction between sex and major field. The study concludes that attitudes differ between males and females and among major fields. The results have an implication for the use of attitude inventories for the academic counseling of women. A conclusion is that the use of a common norm for the counseling of men and women might actually be detrimental to both groups. (Author/WSK)",

Later starting students were somewhat less likely to be narrowly characterizable demographically, and appeared less positive and committed toward their present and future usage.

The study defines the unique activity called child advocacy as intervention on behalf of children with those services and institutions that serve children or impinge on their lives.  It is action that focuses on transactions between individuals and institutions or among institutions as they determine the immediate circumstances of children and families. These services and institutions begin where the family leaves off. Whereas child welfare's primary concern is interventionwith secondary institutions such as schools, juvenile courts, health programs and child welfare programs. Child advocacy is thus a shorthand term for advocacy on behalf of families and children. (WSK)",

Parents were referred to the group after only brief screening consisting of a lengthy questionnaire, an intake interview with a clinician at a mental health center, and perhaps a brief discussion of the case at a disposition conference. Referrals to the program were made for those parents who indicated that their children manifested behavior problems. Thus, the group tested the adequacy of this model for outpatient treatment of children at a mental health center. Ten couples and one single parent agreed to participate in the course which was for ten two-hour sessions, and met once each week in the evening. The results of the course suggest that academically-oriented courses in  behavior management are not sufficient treatment for a large percentage of family cases referred to psychiatric treatment facilities, although they may be adequate for other parent populations such as public school parents. The results further suggest that a more clinical group treatment approach should be considered. The fact that 77% of the group participants did carry out successful programs and that the parents did tend to learn the principles of behavior modification suggests that formal parent behavior modification courses can be the major treatment offered for certain selected clients, and can be of considerable adjunctive value with others.

Subjects, singly or in groups, with or without communication, were either angered or not angered and then given a revenge opportunity.

An exchange-orientation, however, was hypothesized to be quite appropriate for limited or beginning friendships, and exchange-exchange couples should develop greater friendship intensity than other combinations.

Performance of two experiments using the same reinforcement conditions, differentially sequenced, provided information on the effects  of a particular sequence.

Therefore an attributional analysis of crisis intervention, a model of community-based, short-term consultation, was presented. This analysis suggested that crisis intervention provides attributionally-relevant information about both the source of the crisis state and the source of the crisis resolution. Structural and process features of the consultation facilitate attributing the crisis state to an external source and attributing the crisis resolution to an internal source. Implications of this analysis for the role of the crisis consultant, for the setting of goals in crisis work and in the training of consultants, and for the further extension of attributional analysis were  discussed.

        "description":"This study attempts to assess the effects of high school consolidation on the achievement, aspirations, and adjustment of students by following one cohort through a newly-consolidated school in a southern Appalachian county beginning in 1968. The study compares the consolidated students with students in a nearby nonconsolidated school during the first three years following consolidation. Questionnaires, interviews and school records provide information on within-school variations in the consolidated school over four years. The findings suggest that few, if any, major differences exist between the two schools on the achievement, aspirations, and adjustment measures available. Moreover, the results suggest that initial inequalities existing within the consolidated school typically  remained by the end of the 12th grade. No group became more \"advantaged\" across the board on the success indicators, but lower status, lower IQ, lower modernism females in the consolidated high school did show increasingly poorer adjustment patterns, while lower status, lower IQ, lower modernism males showed improvement on some adjustment indicators.

        "description":"In association with an extensive examination of the disclosure literature, this paper describes two laboratory studies designed to yield information regarding the effects of reinforcement on self-disclosing behaviors in an exchange process. In one series, the experimenters manipulated the patterns of personal reward/cost experiences, hypothesizing that shifts in reinforcement, inconsistent with prior established expectations, would produce \"contrast effects\". Results provide evidence of such effects, with S's exposed to negative changing to positive reinforcement talking about themselves for longer periods of time than those subjected to continuous positive conditions. This pattern held true only when S's were led to think they would be together for a long time. No contrast  effects were found for the positive changing to negative condition. A followup study, in which the major independent variable was intimacy, introduced four patterns of intimacy of self-disclosure into the verbal exchange of S's and confederates. Results of these exchanges also provided some support for the contrast hypothesis. The author suggests several independent theoretical foundations for the appearance of contrast effects and hopes that future studies will provide more solid empirical support for such effects.

The model gave rise to an idea for a drug abuse program which applied and tested concomitantly in an \"action research\" drug abuse program with junior and senior high schools in San Bernardino, California. It was postulated that, given a school situation where an active group of drug users and pushers were present, a sizeable number of low-resistance students would imitate the drug behavior. It was further postulated that the medical inoculation model, by introducing into the schools deactivated toxic agents such as paroled ex-addicts, would act to discourage the low-resistance students from illicit useage. Some of the validating techniques used in this type of research  are highlighted in describing the outcome of the application of the model. The data seem to support the viability of the model, and the paper concludes with a discussion of models and the risks involved in their use. (Author/SLD)",

Fifty women comprised the two final sample groups. The data was gathered through use of the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation-Behavior scales (FIRO-B Scales), measures expressed and wanted inclusion, control and affection. Findings suggest that: (1) women who have previously attended parochial schools exhibit more social inclusion than do those who attended public schools; (2) women who have attended parochial schools exhibit a greater need for social inclusion than do others; (3)little if any difference exists between the two groups in the amount  of social control deemed desirable or in the amount of affection given or desired in social situations. Since this study was conducted at a small Catholic college, a broader study should be conducted in a larger setting to determine whether or not the results will generalize. Future research should also assess the importance of the inter-group difference in inclusion behavior to determine if such a difference might be responsible for fostering socio-religious segregation in society or, rather, might represent a desirable behavior that is not being learned in the public schools.

It makes comparisons between the numbers of 1972 high school graduates versus dropouts in the labor force, and between sub-groups--number of white dropouts versus number of dropouts of Spanish origin, number of black graduate enrolled in college versus number of whites, number of women graduates attending college versus number of men, etc. The report briefly discusses economic, geographic, and sociological factors  influencing differences between groups, and examines how young people of Spanish origin fare in the job market. (This wider analysis covers all out of school youth age 16-24). Among the more interesting findings are these: (1) only 49% of 1972 graduates (the lowest proportion in 5 years) went on to college; and (2) among all youth of Spanish origin aged 16-24, one of three was a school dropout, a much larger proportion than among whites or Negroes.

Questionnaires (dealing with types of program, organization, program administration, funding, staff, clients, and primary objectives) were returned from 222 of the 262 agencies contacted. Surveys findings conclude that, although bureaus are widespread, their conceptual bases and funding levels have not been sufficient in scope to make much difference in the way that our society deals with troubled youth. However, there is evidence that youth services bureaus have pioneered programs that are changing ways in which their own communities provide such  services, which is encouraging for the future of the bureau concept. The report suggests these principles for the implementation of a youth service bureau: (1) organization and program must remain flexible in order to respond to a community's unique needs and unanticipated problems; (2) programs must deal with the community power structure, including those believing in a punitive and deterrant course of action; (3) programs must be real substitutes for other courses of action; (4) programs must use the favorable public bias toward children to its fullest advantage; and (5) programs must provide for evaluation and research. The report also points out that staff is the single most important ingredient of the youth service bureau. (Author/EAK)",

Responses to a questionnaire administered to the students were analyzed separately by sex and grade level (7-9 vs. 10-12). Some findings were: (1) about one-third of the high school students (10-12) were using illicit drugs, while one-tenth of junior high school students (7-9) were users; (2) over two-thirds of the grade 7-9 group and over half the grade 10-12 group reported no drug usage at all; and (3) legal substances were most frequently used by those reporting usage, with coffee, alcohol and tobacco most popular and illicit drugs (except marijuana) used by less than one-tenth of the sample. Friends were very important in  shaping drug-use patterns, with users being eight times as likely to have a best firend also using drugs. Users describe themselves as social misfits and may turn to drugs as a means of finding friends. The data suggest that, at least for this district, the majority of adolescents are relatively uninvolved with illicit drugs. Educational programs must differentiate between the relatively small user group, those sporadically involved, and those who are non-users. (Author/CJ)",

        "description":"Empirical evidence indicates that intrusions into an individual's personal space may produce anxiety and defensive or avoidance behaviors which might be reduced when conversation occurs between interactants. This paper briefly presents two field experiments designed to investigate this possibility. The first study hypothesized that invasion of space would incur more rapid defensive reactions when the invader (experimenter) and subject were the same sex. Analyses disclosed that both distance and sex of invader had significant impact; an unexpected finding was that female experiments elicited more rapid defensive reactions than males. A second study incorporated distance, sex and presence or absence of a verbalized remark (\"hello\"). Analysis indicated that sex of the invader and  verbalized communication influenced subject reactions in the direction of defense or avoidance. Females again brought about more threatened feelings on the part of subjects. It is posited that uninvited advances by female invaders are perceived as manifestations of aggression, and therefore more threatening to males; another possibility is that female experimenters, recognizing a role conflict in their portrayal, reflect anxiety which stimulates rapid defenses. To test these hypotheses, a third study has been designed to incorporate not only distance and sex but also anxiety levels of invaders. (Author/CJ)",

The findings support the notion of a causal chain that links (a) maternal employment with (b) a different view of social placement with (c) differential maternal encouraging behavior or involvement in courtship. Findings show that working mothers are more likely to view employment as an option for their daughters than are unemployed mothers. The author concludes that evidence is in favor of a change in maternal attitudes toward the social placement of daughters. It is suggested that this change is due to the mother's view of employment, and its consequence is a lessened degree of involvement in a daughter's courtship or mate choice.  (Author/WSK)",

Some ingredients of such a program include measuring achievement thinking, learning achievement thoughts and action strategies, experiencing achievement thinking, and practicing achievement strategies through goal setting. The second approach, human potential training, helps people to expand their goals and to realize more fully, their potentials. Because it focuses on positive characteristics, this approach is particularly suitable for the  public school setting. The third approach, elimination of self defeating behaviors (SDB) helps people rid themselves of behaviors detrimental to achieving full potential. A unique feature of SDB groups is strong direction provided by the leader. Some guidelines for implementing the three programs are offered, and two appendices are included.

Twenty-five boys and 47 girls from three moderate-ability first grade classes were chosen as subjects. These students had accumulated six minutes of session time on the computer assisted reading program (CAI) phonic strand before beginning the experiment. One set of 24 spelling patterns was devised for each of the five vowels: A, E, I, O, and U. When each subject began the experiment, he was randomly assigned to one of the five sets of spelling patterns and then 12 of the 24 spelling patterns in the chosen set were selected for training. At the end of his  eight-day training period, each subject was individually tested, off-line, on all 144 initial consonant and final consonant combinations derived from the full set of 24 spelling patterns to which he was assigned. The data reflected the value of presenting spelling patterns in initial reading. Teaching spelling patterns to the subjects resulted in positive transfer to a criterion task that required subjects to read words and non-words composed of the spelling patterns taught. (WR)",

        "description":"A consideration of reading potentials could produce a more balanced outlook concerning the future of reading in our society. In working with students on the improvement of reading, we find that comprehension problems are often related to attitudes about language, facts, and accuracy that are opposed to the requirements of the learning situation. This is a humanistic problem. As a component of college and adult reading programs, some type of \"language\" dimension should be added to help students develop awareness and/or improvement in the following: language as language; reading as an aspect of the language system; language practice vs. language potential; and students' current language status. Programs should also be developed to help those students who arrive on the college  campus with deficits unrelated to intellectual deficienceis, skills, or physical handicaps, as a relationship has been seen to exist between mental and emotional health and academic success.

Using the LAC at California State University Long Beach (CSULB) as a model, the LAC is defined as a support, delivery, and referral service for the entire campus community. A LAC is held accountable to itself and its users through a cybernetics approach to systems (problem difinition and organization, system analysis and development, and system evaluation are interrelated by feedback built into the system). Three aspects of the LAC's total assessment procedure are considered: (1) usage of the center, (2) usage of the materials in the center, and (3) usefulness of the center's material to the learners. The author asserts that improved data collection, analysis, and subsequent  change within the system are required for improved accountability. Literature dealing with accountability is reviewed. The practicality and efficiency of the methods used at CSULB for assessment are discussed and evaluated. (LL)",

One concern that dominates many papers is the preparation of individuals for the teaching role. O'Neill reports the evaluation results of a preservice program that maximizes the use of field experiences; Duffey discusses the results of his study designed to evaluate undergraduates in social studies methods courses; Ashlock presents a rationale for the need of certification for elementary school mathematics specialists; after analyzing texts used in reading methods courses, Moretz and Davey assert the need for more consistent use of reading terminology; Amershek urges professional competence as the criterion for the selection of staff members for preschool  programs. Another concern reflected in many of the papers is the nature of school programs for learners. Maley describes the impact of a reading emphasis industrial arts program; Gantt advocates a focus on the child's educational environment; Shields discusses reading in the kindergarten; and Hall and Ribovich build a rationale for teaching reading as a form of communication. Following each paper is a brief summary of participant reactions. (WR)",

Once understanding occurs, learning and remembering follow automatically. The conventional psychological literature says little about the processes involved in the learning of complex material--material that takes weeks, months, and even years to be learned. Yet, most adult learning is of this form. This paper examines some of the issues that are involved in this type of learning, issues such as the nature of understanding, the types of hypotheses that subjects bring to bear on the learning process, and the types of processes that need to be studied in order to understand the psychology of learning.

Begun in Idaho schools in 1969-70, the program encourages each student to tape record many impressions, stories, or experiences which he considers meaningful. Typed copies are returned to the child and become his personalized reader. He may choose to share his story with his teacher, his peers, or simply read it to himself. In 1971-72, district-wide implementation of the program began in grades one and two with a similar district serving as a control group. Experimental first graders significantly outscored the control students on the Stanford  Achievement Test. No significant differences were found in achievement between second grade groups or in reading attitude and self-esteem for either group at both grade levels. Seventy-eight percent of the participating teachers expressed a strong desire to continue the program, and most indicated a decline in their preference for the basal approach and an increase in their preference for individualized and language experience approaches. A more complete program description and other findings are included in the document. (TO)",

A folder of information to be used by each pupil consisted of personal information graphs for plotting rate and comprehension scores, answer sheets, a reading skill and materials reference sheet, and a contract to be signed by each student. The counselor's record system consisted of recording the conferences, recommendations, and personal assessment of needs, materials, and procedures being prescribed. Test scores as well as an informal personal inventory were used for diagnostic purposes. Based on the diagnostic information, the counselors prescribed the areas and materials in which the student should begin  working. The prescription was given to each student individually at a conference held during class time. A supplemental evaluation of the program after one year of operation resulted in eliminating the pupil contract, the introduction of mini-sessions for follow-up and extensions of lessons, greater reliance on informal inventories and individual conferences than on testing, and utilization of textbooks used by the students in other courses.

Two variables, question placement (BA) and pacing (PL), were combined in a 2 x 4 factorial design. Within each factorial cell, type of item (CI), form of item (VP), and time of test (ID) were treated as repeated measures. The final design was a 2 BA x 4 PL x 2 CI x 2 VP x 2 ID with repeated measures on the CI, VP, and ID variables. In addition to the eight experimental groups, two control groups were included. The subjects were 126 students from two fifth-sixth and one sixth grade classroom. A 1,320 word passage  constituted the experimental text. The passage was divided into 20 paragraphs, each 66 words in length. For each paragraph, two unrelated questions were constructed. Then a lexical paraphrase was generated for each of the original questions so there was a total of four questions per paragraph. The results indicated that a 2 BA x 4 PL x 2 CI x 2 ID analysis of variance yielded significant results for the BA, CI, and ID main effects and the PL x ID interaction. This study suggested that adjunct questions have different effects as age decreases. (WR)",

        "description":"Written questionnaires were completed by the teachers, principals, and students of those elementary schools participating in the 1970-71 seminars based on William Glasser's concept of Schools Without Failure. The questionnaires were designed primarily to determine what changes had occurred since the seminars began and whether or not the schools were still following practices contrary to Glasser's concept. Teachers and principals were asked to indicate the changes that had occurred in grading, testing, grouping, discipline, classroom meetings, parent conferences, curriculum, and homework. The pupils of teachers who had attended the seminars responded to survey items dealing with involvement, relevance, thinking, and responsibility. Responses indicate that the seminar program  apparently had positive effects on students and on teachers. Findings reveal that students have become more responsible for their own behavior, and have learned to express themselves better and to listen to and respect the opinions of others. In addition, communication between teachers has improved, and teachers have become more aware of students' needs and are better able to handle their own discipline problems. (Author/WM)",

The author first considers some of the factors determining the growth of school enrollment; needs for estimating future school enrollment; and the characteristics of short-term, medium-term, and long-term estimates. Some of the terms used in connection with estimates of future school enrollment are then defined; the types of basic data needed are specified; and the kinds of methods generally used are explained briefly. Three case studies are presented that estimate future school enrollment in the developing countries of Colombia, the Philippines, and the Sudan. These case  studies are intended to illustrate the application and adaptation of certain methods to suit the needs of particular situations. The presentation concludes with some illustrative examples from actual projections of school enrollments taken from published sources in three developed countries -- the United States, New Zealand, and France.

Of the forty schools in the random sample, 27 were operating under traditional collective negotiation procedures -- teachers relatively unorganized; eight were operating under procedural negotiation procedures -- characterized by specific procedures related to negotiations; and five were operating under comprehensive contracts -- similar in scope and content to a union labor contract. The study used the Purdue Teacher Opinionnaire, a multidimensional morale instrument. The instrument measured teacher morale under specific bargaining procedures at one point in time.

Finally, a number of policy recommendations are formulated, which should guide the Massachusetts Teachers Association in their deliberations concerning how best to revise the present system of educational finance.

The study also attempts to show some of the processes by which an idea is converted into legislation and some of the difficulties involved in  administering federal programs in education. In each section, the author has attempted to relate the legislation to the social, political, and economic climate of the time in which it was enacted.

On the basis of study findings, some conclusions are presented in this report concerning (1) the total fiscal system within which Connecticut finances its schools, (2) fiscal disparities in the established method of funding public education, and (3) ways that Connecticut could achieve a high degree of fiscal equity and neutrality in its school finance system. The authors first describe and interpret the overall nature of Connecticut public finance and its relationship to the State's system of educational support. They then delineate the tax and expenditure characteristics of the present system of school finance and discuss their shortcomings.  Next, using simulation analysis, the authors examine the financial requirements and likely fiscal impacts of alternative funding schemes. The presentation concludes with an outline of some policy recommendations designed to guide the Connecticut Education Association in its deliberations over revision of the State's present school finance system.

        "description":"This study illustrates the underlying premise that certain classes of participants may be adversely affected by organizational experiences in ways that are not normally recognized. Schools belong to a set of organizations whose primary function is to socialize organizational members. This function is described as the providing of a process to a recipient class, and structures utilized for this function are termed process events. Process accounting entails the arrangement of career data on individual recipient class members into longitudinal data files and the typological analysis of this information relative to output measures which bear on the socializing goals of the organization. Process accounting is interpreted as a sociological model of school accountability because it  illuminates the impact of group structures on different student subgroups. The case study focuses on the impact of a high school's ability grouping and letter grading practices on 9th grade black students differing in social status. Study findings indicate that students of low status situated in academically competive English classes manifest considerably lower output measure profiles than do their peers. Several explanatory theses are considered. (Author)",

        "description":"This study of the impact of unrestricted federal aid on State bureaucracies describes how federal money was spent in nine SEA's (particularly in Massachusetts, New York, and South Carolina). It also examines whether Title V promoted a rethinking of SEA priorities and led to a &quot;thorough overhaul&quot; of SEA activities. Study findings reveal that, while SEA budgets and staffs doubled between 1965 and 1970 (one fifth of the 1970 dollars coming from Title V), SEA strengthening varied significantly from State to State. In New York and Massachusetts, the Title V outcome took the form of marginal adaptations of ongoing activities in procedures, activities, or roles; while in South Carolina, marked changes took place. However, the author notes that in none of these States did Title V  stimulate a rethinking of priorities or promote a thorough overhaul of activities. Even in South Carolina, Title V failed to promote basic change, but rather acted as a facilitator for a SEA that was &quot;ready to go.&quot; The report explores explanations for the failures of Title V and concludes that the underlying reasons why Title V failed to promote basic institutional change may have as much to do with the way complex organizations typically behave with free money as it does with particular institutional or individual shortcomings.

Following a description of the historical and current manifestations of State aid, an empirical analysis was conducted to study the impact of State aid on several variables. More State aid was found to be associated with (1) higher per pupil expenditures, (2) lower per pupil local revenues, (3) less likelihood to raise funds through local bond issues, (4) lower nonpublic enrollments, and (5) larger average school size. In another phase of the study, incentive features were developed that could be incorporated into State aid schemes. These incentive features were divided into (1) Scale Incentives -- designed to highlight the potential for cost savings  through scale adjustment; and (2) Output Incentives which considered two possible goals: maximum output regardless of cost and maximum output per dollar of cost. Penalty factors and incentive payments, singly and combined, were presented as alternative methods to increase efficiency in terms of both scale incentive and output incentives. (Author)",

The authors explain how this marketing approach to dissemination might be adapted and applied by a product development agency, touch briefly on some of the elements of such an approach already in process, and point up some of the problems that will have to be solved if such an approach is to be implemented. Each one of six characteristics of the marketing approach is examined, and the relationship  of each characteristic to the development of a better dissemination strategy by R&D agencies is explored.

The model also translates (&quot;crosswalks&quot;) the program budget into traditional format as may be required by law. At present, many school districts create a &quot;program budget&quot; by reversing this process, thus losing the entire program planning aspect of PPB. The Rand model described here outputs 5-year cost estimates by (1) major program area, (2) standard budget category, and (3) program cost by budget category. The program cost output uses the approach suggested by California's Advisory Commission on School  District Budgeting and Accounting, where &quot;programs&quot; are essentially subject areas and administrative functions. Although these definitions fall short of a true program, they are far more useful than the conventional resource categories. The computer program is not discussed. (Page 5 may reproduce poorly.)

To illuminate both the logic of explanation and the specific needs for research, two competing explanatory models are developed: (1) the naive hypothesis, which focuses on local objectives and the low productivity of various educational innovations, and which has restrictive implications for federal R&D policy; and (2) the organizational model, which notes that educational objectives are inherently vague and production possibilities imperfectly known and seldom implemented, and which concentrates instead on the relative freedom of educational bureaucracies to make policy and on  the self-serving incentive structures. Since research has not yet touched on many basic issues of the problem, there is sparse evidence to disprove either model. More importantly, there are few directives on how more detailed, policy relevant explanations should be developed. Further research is necessary into the process of innovation itself. This paper formulates an agenda for such research. (Author)",

Five problems associated with standard braille books which may be circumvented with Autobraille are storage space requirements, weight of braille books, deterioration rate of braille surfaces, high production costs, and unsuitability for electronic communication. Component parts are a table-top display device, a control unit, and a tape cartridge. In addition to converting tape signals to the tactile reading display, the system also generates tapes for storage through two computer programs. One transforms an alpha-numeric natural language text to codes corresponding to  the 63 braille character combinations in Grade II braille; the other program transforms the computer's codes into a tonal code (similar to the Bell system's touch tone), and also tonally separates characters on the display device's reading line. Autobraille is capable of transmitting data through the telephone at 1000 words per minute and thus has potential for library to user transmission. (MC)",

For each of the five students, 4- to 6-years-old, who were normal or had handicaps of oppositional behavior, Down's syndrome, physical and speech handicaps, or autism, assessments were made according to functional areas, skills, and personal-social characteristics. A curriculum involved gross, fine, and perceptual motor training; color and shape discrimination; letter, number, and word recognition; and creativity expression.  Behavior modification procedures included primary, (candy or cookies), and secondary reinforcement (praise, or hugging); continuous music; and timeout. Parents learned through observing children, taking a behavior management class, recording behaviors, and teaching. Data indicated that the five children acquired from 14 to 27 skills; that four children attained a minimum of two out of five competency levels for each of seven developmental areas; that four children achieved full competency in one developmental level. Data indicated directions for an experimental research design, and support for early intervention, parent training, and individualized programs. (MC)",

Urging federal, state, and local leadership, he described problems of the gifted, such as women's entry into traditional masculine fields, and identification of talent among minorities and the poor. He explained that 1974-1975 budgetary limitations precluded new federal initiatives, and stressed that more important than money was the change in federal policy from program management to idea management, encompassing efforts to stimulate creative response and to  serve as a link between the problem and those who could solve it. Cited were the Emergency School Aid Act, which will give grants to urban magnet schools to identify talent through programs for the gifted and career education; and the Office of Education for the Gifted, which has given a grant to the Illinois Department of Education to develop a national/state leadership training program, and has facilitated establishment of the Exploration Scholarship Program, supported by donations, whereby gifted students accompany scientists on summer explorations.

Simultaneous verbal and manual signs were chosen as the communications mode. The children initially displayed infrequent, unrecognizable vocalizations (Screeches, or vocal twiddles), failed to role play, used objects repetitively and nonfunctionally, and showed either little affect or self-aggressiveness. A behavioral framework with reinforcement included rewards, such as food, tokens, and social approbation. Parents attended weekly meetings and also observed training sessions. A day school was developed, consisting in supervised group work for short periods, and gross motor activities (roller skating, swimming, or  art activities), and later evolved into three levels and more extensive tasks. Initially the children imitated all teacher hand movements, repeated questions and added answers, repeated only key words, or directed questions meant for other children to teachers. Later (still signing manually), children instructed themselves before performing, generated sentences comparable to 2 and 3 year olds', labeled other children's inappropriate behaviors, helped one another, mastered personal pronouns, and had an estimated vocabulary range of 101 to 370 words (a gain of over 100 words in a year). Some children began to mouth words, verbally approximate words, and three children could verbalize &quot;hi&quot; or &quot;bye&quot;. Behavioral assessment indicated increase in social activity, decrease in self stimulation,  higher levels of play, and attempts to play with classmates. (MC)",

A prototype evaluation of procedures for teaching reading comprehension involves assessment of 96 EMH or normal students' skills in identifying main and supporting ideas in connected discourse. Described is the Lincoln School's behavioral management system for EMH students, which stimulates the American capitalistic system through teacher development of a realistic environment, wherein students establish governing rules, and receive pay for good work and behavior. Reported are studies of contextual analysis and concept learning of normal and retarded children. Results of a token economy to develop money management skills in EMH students 12- to 17-years-old indicate higher competency levels  in functional mathematics. Provided is a basis for assessing and programing retarded children's cognitive and motor development from infancy through 7 years of age. Described as adaptable for institutional or agency use is a model which evolved from a teacher's workshop in Pennsylvania in preparation for teaching previously excluded EMH children. Discussed is the Charles Carroll Occupational School's program for EMH boys, which offers prevocational and vocational education, and work study experience. Six of eight EMH girls are reported employable as maids after a 6 week training program, which included class and on-the-job training, slide presentations, and a pictorial manual. A prototype evaluation of procedures for teaching word meaning skills to EMH and normal pupils centers on 2  years' research on synonyms and homonyms. (MC)",

        "description":"Three conference papers concern education of trainable mentally retarded (TMR) children. A presentation originally accompanied by slides describes a behavioral objectives curriculum (Meridian Program) for TMR students, 5 through 18 years of age, which includes a checklist of behavioral goals (to evaluate entering students, identify behaviors, monitor progress, and evaluate progress and programs), and an educational prescriptive retrieval system (for collecting data for evaluation and accountability); and also delineates articulation of the public school TMR program with the Office of Mental Retardation programs in Nebraska. Also described is Benhaven center, which serves neurologically impaired, moderately and profoundly retarded, and multihandicapped children, 6 to 21 years of  age on an outpatient or residential basis; trains professional and paraprofessional personnel for other centers; provides services such as institutes and workshops; emphasizes sign language with nonverbal children; uses music and rope therapy; stresses continual evaluation and socialization; avoids drug therapy; and offers academic and prevocational education. Results reported from a survey of 63 parents of moderately and severely retarded children indicate that parents agree on practices and trends in educationally oriented teacher-parent encounters, that a child's program enrollment and age group are strong factors of parental opinion; that future studies should focus on program enrollment and age; and that professionals who have qualities that parents prize should be identified.

Federal programs cannot be expected to provide ideas which will dramatically improve education for the gifted nor to provide large quantities of money. The federal government can serve as a catalyst to ideas through research and demonstration programs and support of leadership training. A federal survey on the gifted has shown the degree to which existing legislation is not serving gifted children. In contrast, gifted and other children in the Soviet Union are exposed to an extracurricular program of clubs using notable professionals as instructors. Though gifted students can be found in every racial group and social  class, the search for a culture free intelligence test is not useful. Development of the art of scrounging can lead to innovative ways to obtain funding. Educational support services such as research and development and training activities are an unrecognized part of the educational delivery system. A bill for educational assistance to gifted and talented children has been introduced but must overcome political hurdles before it is passed and appropriations gained. Political allies need to be nurtured in organizations such as the National Education Association. (DB)",

TICS had two components: an author system and a delivery system. Underlying assumptions were that instructional programs required complex logical structures and could not be written in one linear sequence, that they must be modifiable, that authors should be able to use on- and off-line modes, that programs required communication with and some control by students, and that programs should allow different modes of interaction. TIC's structural framework consisted of interconnected nodes, each containing a linear sequence of actions. A dynamic  data base was maintained and the author language served as the interface between the author and the system's routines: for creating, mapping, testing, and modifying programs, for viewing their structures, and for developing auxiliary information stores. Automatic maintenance features included space allocation for the growing data base, the assignment of identifiers for new items, and the notation of errors. (PB)",

SEDCOM is a small but powerful enough to provide an excellent introduction to machine language programing. The system, which is truly generative in that it creates and solves problems tailored to individual student needs, consists of four major components: a problem generator, a control unit, concept routines, and a SEDCOM simulator. Operationally, it proceeds by first acquiring  student records and determining the amount of instruction needed. It then generates a sample programing problem and helps the student design a solution by dealing with sub-tasks.

Newer, generative CAI systems which are supplied with a knowledge of subject matter can generate their own problems and solutions, can provide extensive drill and tutoring, and can diagnose learner problems and prescribe remedial feedback. These systems reduce the amount of instructor effort required to teach new material and encourage students to assume the initiative in studying new topics. Information-Structure Oriented (ISO) systems have capabilities for natural language communication and are useful in the humanities and social sciences. Quantitative systems rely on  algorithms and are oriented toward providing students with practice in problem-solving. While the existing generative systems are still experimental it is expected that their use will become more widespread as research continues and as CAI facilities become more available and economical.

Performance records from student classes of 1961 and 1962, when grading changes were introduced, were examined. Analysis showed substantial correlations between instructor and checkpilot evaluations when checkpilots were drawn from the instructor pool, but not when they came from outside sources.  The individual standards of the rater influenced final evaluations, and optimum procedures were not used in the collection of student performance data. These findings suggested that the flight grading system needed standardization, that an organizational separation of training and assessment functions was desirable, and that the data input for quality control should be made more objective, detailed, and routinized.

        "description":"As part of the Army's effort to use synthetic devices to improve training, researchers evaluated a captive helicopter attached to a ground effects machine. Experimental groups received varying amounts of pre-flight practice tasks designed to develop flight skills, while control groups received no device training. Student flight performance during the 85 hour primary helicopter training program provided criterion measures. Significant results included that: 1) the attrition from flight training for the experimental groups was lower; 2) experimental groups required less time to qualify for solo flight; 3) experimental groups received higher grades from flight instructors; 4) individual performance on the device correlated positively with subsequent flight training performance; and  5) the flight experience of the device instructor did not affect student flight performance. It was concluded that the device lowered student failures, improved their performance, and served as a predictor of student flight proficiency levels. (PB)",

Such adaptations became a salient feature of military training due to the continuous modification of operational equipment. Using a candidate device for rotary wing training, they produced a system of procedures, called the Task Commonality Analysis (TCA), which allowed training personnel to: 1) identify task elements associated with criterion performance in the operational and training equipment; 2) compare the two sets of tasks; 3) estimate the extent to which task commonality is required for transferable training; and 4) specify the synthetic training program most likely to result in maximum positive  transfer of training from device to operational equipment. Information derived from the TCA was used to predict transfer of training. Results indicated that the TCA provided an effective basis for assessing the potential value of a training device; they also showed the particular training device employed in this study to be of little use.

Geometrical concepts such as congruence, symmetry, perpendicularity, parallel, triangle, rectangle, etc., are discussed prior to consideration of the features needed for computer control of the student's tracing experiences. Methods are described by which students can draw patterns at their terminals; the computer's judging pattern and teaching logic are also outlined. Evaluations of student acceptance of the program and of the degree to which the program achieves its goals with inexperienced students indicate that the CAI  system can assume routine functions involving pictorial student responses. The major advantages are that the CAI system keeps accurate student records, permits frequent program revisions, and allows the instructor to give individual attention to members of large groups without unduly delaying the progress of any single student.

Proceeding from the fact that tariff rates on wide band educational television channels are attractive, but that the data format must be compatible with television images and must flow at a rate of 1200 bits per second (BPS), it deals with the major problem of converting sporadic bursts of computer output data into a serial rate of 1200 BPS through the utilization of a buffer storage device. An analytic study of input and output properties, a discussion of feasible assumptions, and descriptions of various models are presented,  leading to suggestions for a suitable design of a buffer storage mechanism for the PLATO IV system. Actual data are employed in the determination of design alternatives. A brief outline of the PLATO system as it is currently conceived is also included. (Author/PB)",

In the experiment, subjects free recalled lists with either no randomization, total randomization, or randomization within the primacy, recency, or middle portions of the list. The NIP effect occurred with equal strength across all conditions, and increased over trials. Contrary to previous data, an interpolated delay between study and test did not destroy the NIP effect.

Coding Theory was selected as the subject area in which the example was carried out. The retrieval program developed allowed searchers to make queries and receive answers at the terminal, using a simple &quot;dialogue&quot; logic program. Highly structured query paths leading to the data base were built, although the ultimate system goal will be to  have natural language capability. The model retrieval system was successful because it provided rapid responses, fostered simple user-computer interactions, permitted expansion of user questions, allowed algorithmic functions to be employed, and stored a history of interrogatory events for use in the subsequent modification of the retrieval strategy.

Two one-semester sections of the course were taught with students having 20% of their instructional time on the CAI system. Results which showed that student attendance and achievement were  high and their attitudes positive led to the conclusions that network theory can be taught by CAI systems and that TUTOR is appropriate language. Further implications were that future research should study additional instruction instructional modes and investigate the utility of interstation communication, pre-recorded feedback, and the information structure oriented approach.

Since composition involves the production of original sentences and current computer facilities are not yet sufficiently powerful to deal with this phenomenon, it is not feasible to have a complete computer-assisted instruction (CAI) writing course. Nevertheless, it is possible to give instruction in many of the basic skills and concepts which precede the final act of writing. To accomplish this, the CAI system must possess two semantic capabilities--those of conceptual comparison and phonetic spelling judgment. Given these, it is possible to construct a hierarchy of composition concepts, of which the following list is an example: audience, purpose, strategy, thesis, research,  organization, introduction, transition, conclusion, paragraphs, and sentences. Assuming that the student possesses an entering repertory of skills relevant to each concept, it is possible to develop CAI activities or lessons which will develop those particular skills and thus contribute to his overall ability to write.

Several content areas were affected: history, culture, English and Spanish language skills, and math. Second graders benefited least, showing significant gains only in the Spanish content area of history and culture and in English fluency. There was little impact upon the Spanish content areas of science, phoneme/grapheme relations, and language mixing.  Attitudes of teachers, parents, and children toward the series were positive, and a growth of pride in Mexican culture and increased use of the Spanish language were noted.

These are systems capable of generating problems for students and of deriving and monitoring solutions; problem difficulty, instructional pace, and depth of monitoring are all individually tailored and parts of the solution algorithms can be used to analyze incorrect student responses and to direct remediation. A generative CAI system which teaches logic design and machine-language programing is discussed. This system covers material for an introductory electrical engineering course and is intended to supplement regular instruction by providing practice in problem solving. Also described is a companion system for teaching laboratory principles in which students learn to  construct combinational or sequential logic circuits using standard integrated circuits. The student's logic circuit is automatically interfaced to the computer for testing and the computer aids in debugging the circuit. Work in progress on the design of a tutor for high school algebra is also related. Finally, a formal mathematical approach to problem generation and solution is presented. (Author)",

The report of the inquiry, initially prepared for internal use, was found to be of interest to a wider audience and hence was subsequently adapted for broader distribution. Its general purpose is to advance the state of the art of instructional technology by assisting the proponents of instructional technology to articulate their goals, to adhere to them throughout any project undertaken, and to measure their success in achieving them. The first chapter examines interpretations and definitions of instructional technology, while chapter two deals with the issues of defining  purpose, securing teacher cooperation, attending to technological matters, and evaluating progress. The next section surveys the effectiveness of hardware and software and the fourth reports on some major applications. The final chapter sets forth the conditions which appear most likely to increase the probability of success in the use of technology. (Author/PB)",

Results are reported for four different types of programing: instructional programing, Children's Television Workshop productions, news and public affairs programing, and general audience programing. Additionally, data were analyzed and are presented concerning various characteristics of the broadcasters such as amount of time broadcasting, type of program presented, source of distribution of programing, budget size of broadcaster, region of the country, type of license, and size of population served. Selected comparisons with previous surveys in this series are also presented. A summary of the results shows  that the Public Broadcasting Service's programs and locally produced programs increased in usage, that there was an increase in instructional programing, and that the quality of programing also appeared to improve.

The implications of learner control for six different aspects of educational systems are discussed in this paper--the choice and definition of educational objectives, the organization and sequencing of objectives, the problem of displaying educational alternatives to the learner, the provision of learner control  within a given instructional episode, learner control of motivation, and evaluation of competence.

Three groups of juniors in fall 1971 who had completed specific distributional sequences that had satisfied general educational requirements in the areas of humanities, social sciences/history, and natural sciences, were administered the appropriate CLEP general exam. Cutoff scores were established providing a framework for granting 6 hours of credit in a particular area of the naive student's score who had received an average grade of A.

The subjects of the study were 36 recently appointed academic deans and vice-presidents who participated in the American Council on Education's fall 1971 institute for academic deans held at the University of Chicago. The subjects were divided into two 18-member subgroups. The subgroups were identically matched in every feasible way. One subgroup was arbitrarily assigned the case-study method and the other the paper-seminar method. All subjects were tested before and following their respective experimental sessions with an 18-item attitude questionnaire. A comparison of the results across subgroups revealed case study was a more effective and  efficient learning method than the reading-discussion method. Eleven appendices contain supporting documents, materials used in the study, and functional guidelines for planning professional training programs and developing administrative case studies. (MJM)",

State capitals' response to these realities is an increased emphasis on program effectiveness. In an effort to cope with the challenge of effectiveness, a reevaluation of institutional goals is imperative. Goal setting at the public institutions should involve integrating the desires of people on the campus with those of the citizens in the region and the statewide planners. Five areas that colleges can conceive of institutional effectiveness and fulfill institutional objectives are: student learning, student value development, programmatic  responsiveness, campus morale, and number (application and enrollment figures).

Each game participant serves in the same capacity and is required to make two decisions per year for a 5-year period. The participant is provided with a hypothetical academic department, an initial roster of several faculty and a teaching obligation. Decisions then require a specification of individual teaching assignments for the faculty including number of courses, level of course assignments, e.g., lower division courses, upper division courses, and/or graduate level courses, as well as matching faculty preferences  and capabilities with departmental speciality offerings. The game mathematically relates all decisions to such department characteristics as faculty satisfaction, the ability of the department to attract graduate students, levels of research and scholarship, teaching effectiveness and a general composite measure of department reputation.

That those programs did not represent an overall strategy of institutional aid does not lessen the clear fact that the President was deeply committed to the concept of aid. The Congress was highly receptive to the Presidential initiatives and enacted broad new aid legislation. The new bureaucracy which was established to administer the program nurtured the new funds carefully in close collaboration with the clientele groups. The higher education associations behaved with more harmony than might have been expected and aided in the successful passage of the landmark Johnson legislation. In sum, policy formulation and implementation was a result of complex  interactions and bargaining among the relevant political actors. (Author)",

The information provided by the institutional research officers must be selective, meaningful, bring about changes for improvement, and allow experimentation in solving existing and future problems of higher education, particularly the institution's role.

Most uses of comparable information and analysis can be grouped into three management functions: resource acquisitions, resource allocation, and planning and management. The major benefits of comparative analysis come from determining why differences exist. Principles used to guide efforts in this area indicate the collected data should be useful to the decisionmaking and planning process of postsecondary education, the conventions and procedures for aggregating the data must be uniform  and acceptable, the information should arise from uniform, acceptably defined terms, and the reporting and exchange should involve two-way communication with built-in feedback mechanisms. The two phases of the project are concerned with direct costs and full or allocated costs. (Author/MJM)",

Two randomly selected panels of men enrolled at 25 universities were identified from student directories, and followed by mail surveys during three successive summers. Results were analyzed for 1,858 men who responded to all three surveys. Panels were selected so that during the longitudinal study Panel A members received increasing exposures to chosen major fields of study, while Panel B members received steady (or diminishing) exposures to such major fields. In a quasi-experimental design, changes in student attitudes and in perceived characteristics of peers and teachers were related to temporal variations in the  degree of exposure to major fields of study. Predictions concerning differential accentuation of initial major field differences were generally unconfirmed for the attitudes measures, thus failing to replicate the results previously reported by Feldman and Newcomb. Implications for interpreting the impacts of major fields of study upon attitudes and values are discussed. A 31-item bibliography and appendices of research material are included. (Author)",

Data were gathered from records and reports, by interviews and by a questionnaire which was administered to college presidents and board chairmen. The analysis of the data suggest the existence of three distinct phases of college coordination: private junior college operating in affiliation with the University of Alberta, expansion of public college system, and formal and specific provincial coordinating agencies. Conclusions suggest that coordination is effective in decision areas in which statutory authority is deficient. This was most apparent in decision areas affecting both the public colleges and other provincially  owned postsecondary institutions and universities. Recommendations suggest that the commission form of coordination should be retained and that its authority be increased to allow for the coordination of the total nonuniversity postsecondary system rather than just one part of it.

        "description":"Both external accountability and the necessities for coherent internal priorities have forced a rapid increase of attention to the outputs of institutions of higher education. This paper offers a purview of some of the areas which need to be considered in conceptualizing output measures for education. These measures are important for the planning and management of institutions which increasingly find themselves in financial difficulty and under pressure to induce cost efficiency. The central question posed is: what difference does an exposure to higher education make in the life patterns of those who get it? Education is a transformational process, both as to the social benefit and the private benefit conferred, and it is argued herein that its transformational character may be  even greater on the social benefit side. Better measures are needed to show the nature and extent of this transformation. Some of the indices, available to administrators that will help determine these measures are discussed. The number of degrees produced by program and level is one measure of instructional output. Another is longitudinal data concerning the jobs and activities of former students to assess what the students have really gained in educational output. Finally, quality measures, based on something more concrete than guesswork and reputation are needed to show with some precision and accuracy the worth of an education. (Author)",

It differentiates between private and social costs and benefits, as well as between monetary and nonmonetary costs and benefits. It is further argued that we must look at costs and benefits that arise not only during or immediately after the schooling experience but also at those that arise later. The work on the impact of higher education to date is reviewed. An attempt is made to relate the results from a few studies of lower levels of education to those dealing with college. The next section focuses on recent work of the author, in which he attempts to define measures of college quality and introduce them into an earning function. It appears that both quantity and  quality of schooling are important factors to explain lifetime income patterns of individuals, even after controlling for the individual's innate ability. The two most significant measures of quality in a statistical sense are average SAT scores of entering freshmen and average faculty salary. It appears that these two factors have independent influences on lifetime earnings. A 43-item bibliography is included. (Author/MJM)",

Major findings regarding the state of postsecondary education concern finance and capital, facilities, enrollments, access, financial aid, diversity, quality, governance, and future manpower requirements. Major recommendations suggest: (1) A student Bill of Rights should be enacted to guarantee New York high school graduates the right of access for up to 2 years of postsecondary education with necessary financial support. (2) Low income students must be able to count on grants from public funds adequate to cover full tuition during all 4 years of attendance at public institutions in the state as well  as support from all sources to allow attendance at private institutions. (3) Tuition charges should be uniform throughout the state. (4) The concept of the University of the State of New York should be maintained and strengthened. (6) A statewide planning council for postsecondary education should be established. (7) The Governor should nominate the members of the Board of Regents for confirmation by both houses of the Legislature. (8) The state should increase its funding of and its responsibilities for the governance of the institutions. (9) Individual campus autonomy should be strengthened. (10) Special studies should be made of financial considerations. (Author/MJM)",

The resulting summary data on entering freshmen included information on the entering freshmen at USC and weighted normative data based on questionnaire results from the 42 participating universities. Results indicated (1) the estimated parental incomes of USC freshmen are nearly identical to the nationa norms. (2) The estimated parental income interval containing the largest percentage of cases for both USC and other university freshmen  has remained at $10,000-$14,999 level during all the years studied. (3) Similar to freshmen at the national level, the most important source of financial support for USC freshmen was parental income. (4) Since source of financial support has remained stable, whereas, the corresponding percentage for other university freshmen has increased almost 10% during the same time period. (5) USC freshmen are not as concerned about financing their education as are freshmen at other universities.

Autonomy was defined as the ability to set goals and to structure the organization to maximize professional concerns; size was measured by the number of faculty members and students in the institutions. Data were gathered from 241 colleges and universities in the United States, and from more than 9,200 individual faculty members and administrators using a questionnaire. Responses to the questionnaire were examined with regard to patterns of decisionmaking, departmental control over faculty selection, courses, tenure, and budgets; and peer evaluation. The data showed a strong trend toward greater faculty autonomy in larger institutions. It is hypothesized that  this was so because the larger institutions had more complex tasks and were divided into more specialized units composed of more highly trained experts whose expertise gave them power to demand the autonomy they desired. The larger schools had less centralization of decisionmaking, fewer bureaucratic regulations covering professional tasks, more departmental and individual autonomy, more evaluation by peers, and greater protection from outside demands. A 10-item bibliography is included. (Author)",

(2) That Title I HEA as amended be funded at the level of $25 million in fiscal year 1974. (3) That the newly authorized fund for the  improvement of postsecondary education undertake an examination of on-going nontraditional programs for nontraditional students. (4) That Federal agencies give priority to implementing programs to provide financial aid to parttime students on the basis of demonstrated need. (5) That Federal agencies review their policies affecting the utilization of university continuing education resources. (6) That universities and Federal agencies seek to find ways to eliminate needless duplication. (7) That consumer protection legislation be enacted.

No definite conclusions are indicated, however, it is suggested that the changes that have occurred in the organization of scientific work and in the nature and scope of the facilities it requires make it necessary to reshape many research institutions, particularly in industry and the  universities. An effort of this kind can only be planned and carried out under the sponsorship of the state and in the light of national interests. This necessitates the development of government decisionmaking mechanisms with wide powers and further investigation to ascertain the conditions under which research policies geared to economic objectives will have to be determined in the coming years.

        "description":"This study investigates job mobility of men and women psychologists in the southeast. The sample consisted of 300 male and female regular members of the Southeastern Psychological Association whose names were taken from the 1972 membership list. Each person in the sample was sent a one-page questionnaire which asked for the date of their doctorate or terminal degree, the area of specialization within psychology and for a chronological listing of all the jobs held since the terminal degree was obtained. There was a 47% return, with 72 females responding and 74 of the males. Results indicated: (1) more men had the doctorate degree than women; (2) while both sexes specialized in an applied area more often than a basic area, this differential tendency was greater for women; (3) women  were more often employed by agencies than men; (4) the mobility of men and women was not significantly different; (5) the level of highest position reported differed by sex. Men achieved the rank of full professor more often than women; and (6) men more often than women reported changing jobs in order to achieve professional advancement, or because of job dissatisfaction.

The intensive study of and practice in communication are the purposes of the freshman institute held prior to the beginning of the fall quarter. The freshman colloquium program is an attempt to continue the small group learning process begun with the institute. The twentieth century course is a required three-quarter course designed to enlarge the perspectives of students in the arts, sciences, and major concerns of our time. Each student is required to complete three interdisciplinary courses after his freshman  year; students are also permitted to bypass traditional majors by designing a program more suitable to their own needs. Activity units aim at providing limited credit toward graduation for a great variety of activities not included in the curriculum. (Author/MJM)",

The second chapter reviews recent data on dropouts in order to estimate both the effect of ability and social status on current rates of dropout and the degree to which rates of dropout have changed since 1965. The third and forth chapters deal respectively with the development of the basic theoretical model which seeks to explain dropout as an interactive process between the individual and the institution, and with the synthesis of recent research on dropout within that theoretical model. The  fifth and final chapter utilizes the findings of the preceding two chapters in order to develop a modified definition which seeks to distinguish voluntary from nonvoluntary dropout and transfer from the permanent dropout from higher education.

Some major recommendations were: (1) Two of the state colleges should be closed, or if not closed, converted to junior colleges. Neither of the two institutions was closed but one was made a junior college and technical college branch of the University of South Dakota. (2) The Board approved a recommendation that there be a common course numbering system for all seven campuses and that college credit received by a student from one campus would be fully  acceptable as comparable credit on any other state college or university campus within the state. (3) Arrangements also were made for a student who was enrolled on one campus to take courses on another without actually transferring. (4) The plan called for the creation of the Division of Continuing Education. (5) The number of courses with 10 or fewer students must be reduced. (6) All graduate programs must be rejustified to the Board. (Author/MJM)",

The background of Open Admissions is described, and the major features of the program are discussed, with social and economic characteristics of the students also considered. Students are compared (within colleges and across colleges) on two major criteria of academic success: grade-point averages and rates of credit generation. A similar set of analyses are carried out with regard  to the effects of remedial and compensatory education programs. Dropouts and nondropouts are compared with regard to the characteristics of their academic performance. Attrition data for the University are compared with national findings. The 1970 and 1971 freshmen classes are compared with regard to indices of academic success and the effects of remedial programs. (Author/MJM)",

Following an introductory discussion which touches upon the underlying concepts of terminological confusion, the inseparability of academic governance and collective bargaining, and individual-group imputations in bargaining, three models of bargaining--the collegial model, the managerial model, and the union model--are developed conceptually from the relevant literature. The empirical portion of the study consists of a national survey of American institutions of  higher education. Survey data were gathered through a questionnaire mailed to 244 randomly selected institutions. Results indicated 29% of the respondent institutions reported collective bargaining activity in three stages. Fifteen percent reported developmental stage activity, 4% reported negotiations in progress, and 10% reported collective bargaining through the contract stage. (Author/MJM)",

To be effective, the college must provide direction to and receive direction from its constituents. A survey was conducted among approximately 15,000 adults in the service area of Mountain Empire Community College in Virginia to ascertain the quality of life of the people. Most of the students are first-generation college students from small high schools who did not participate in many high school activities. Most of them work and get financial aid. Coal is the only major industry in the area, a fact that slows community development and leadership. A substantial percentage of families fall in the poverty  level. A sizeable number of residents are not community participants. The college has a number of older students, and there are a substantial number of public school dropouts in the area that the college could reach. The college is beginning continuing education classes for adults with five mobile classrooms. In spite of the community service and continuing education emphasis, the regular instructional program is still central to the college's function. An analysis of social and educational trends is necessary in order for the college to be responsive. Charting an effective course would be helped by a clear mission statement, community field experiences for the faculty, and a series of community days through the school year for discussions among faculty, community people, and students.

        "description":"The public two-year college in its exemplary (comprehensive) form is an open admissions institution characterized by diverse curricular offerings, with a heavy emphasis on guidance and counseling, as well as an emphasis on compensatory and continuing education. The major focus of this study was to examine, by a survey of community colleges, the nature and extent to which compensatory practices and programs exist in two-year colleges for the minority group academically disadvantaged. Subject to normal research limitations, conclusions may be considered as representative of all two-year colleges in this country. Almost all have personal, academic, vocational-occupational, and job placement counseling. Only 40% have the curricular offerings and admissions policies expected of public  community colleges. Although almost all public two-year colleges state that they have an open admissions policy, almost 45% require more than a high school diploma or some minimum age standard. It appears that public two-year colleges need additional emphasis on recruitment teams to go into the ghettos. Since only 17% have courses in ethnic studies, more is needed in this area. One-fifth of the private two-year colleges have special programs for the academically disadvantaged, and 2/3 have developed special courses for them. Approximately 40% of the public two-year colleges have special programs for the disadvantaged, a dramatic increase over the past decade but still inadequate in view of the purpose of the community college.

        "description":"In an effort to meet the need for a more comprehensive program evaluation, staff at Moraine Valley Community College developed a questionnaire and interview schedule to obtain feedback from employers concerning career programs. Questionnaires were sent to all employers who hired graduates of occupational programs between 1969-71; over 80% returned the questionnaires. A sample were selected for the interview phase as well; interview schedules were completed for 60% of the sample. Factor analysis of the original 25-item questionnaire designed to evaluate technical, human relations and problem-solving skills revealed that employers evaluated graduates using a two-dimensional structure that included only technical and human relations skills. Results showed that: (1) employers rated  as effective or highly effective their employees' training; (2) evaluations for public service, health and business programs were similar; (3) public service graduates were rated slightly higher in technical skills than business and health graduates; (4) personality factors were mentioned most often as areas of strength or weakness; (5) the chances for advancement of half the graduates were rated higher than the chances of other employees in similar positions; (6) supervisors were interested in hiring graduates; and (7) a positive correlation exists between college evaluation and job performance evaluation. Program changes were recommended on the basis of these data. (KM)",

The dependent variable was constructed by comparing each student's fall, 1970, vocational choice on the Career Planning Profile to his or her spring, 1972, vocational choice on the Career Planning Profile Follow-up Questionnaire. Follow-up questionnaires were sent to and administered by the 62 participating institutions. A total of 4,592 completed questionnaires were returned. Application of four sample selection criteria resulted in a final sample of 2,928. Male changers tended to report more business detail  competencies and score slightly higher on trade interests than male nonchangers. Female changers tended to report fewer science competencies and score slightly higher on business contact interests than female nonchangers. Aside from these differences, nonchangers did not differ greatly from changers. Variations were noted in the types of vocational choice change exhibited by individuals whose original choices were in different major categories. Of the 1,498 who changed major categories, 30% changed to the realistic category, 22.5% changed to the investigative category, and 19.7% changed to the social category. Changers differed very little from nonchangers on the interest, ability, and familial background variables. (KM)",

Following a review of pertinent literature, survey data related to these five points are discussed and tabulated. It was found that: (1) as to type of control, slightly over 50% (11 of the 20) of the transformed institutions were operated under church-related auspices, two were public  and seven were under independent sponsorship; (2) as to type of student body, 3 out of 4 institutions involved in a downward shift had a coeducational student body enrolled on their campus; (3) data related to enrollment category show that 13 of the institutions had fewer than 300 students and four out of five has less than 500 enrolled; (4) in relation to academic calendar, 13 of 18 institutions that reported such data operated on the semester calendar system at the time of their academic transformation; and (5) using the boundaries of the six regional accrediting associations, the geographic distribution of the affected institutions revealed that the North Central and Northwest accrediting areas were most involved. The overall results show that less than one institution (0.8) annually  sought an academic shortening during the period of the survey. (DB)",

A total of 662 usable questionnaires (60%) were returned. Analyses of the data showed positive and significant correlations between total  amount of actual influence and member attitudes of policy agreement, superior-subordinate relations, and peer relations. There were negative and significant correlations between variability among the orientation of influence curves and member attitudes of policy agreement and superior-subordinate relations; there was a negative and non-significant correlation between variability among the orientation of influence curves and peer relations. The analyses showed negative and significant correlations between variability about the distribution of actual and ideal influence curves and member attitudes of policy agreement, superior-subordinate relations, and peer relations. There were significantly more negatively sloped distribution of actual influence curves than positively sloped curves, and  there were significantly more positively sloped distribution of influence over programming curves.

Data obtained in Phase One of the study of 653 entering students were augmented with high school test data and parental occupational information. Two data decks--one for persisters and one for withdrawers--were used in the discriminant analysis. The variable, Social Studies Florida Twelfth Grade score, emerged as the most significant in discriminating between persisters and withdrawers. Student status, i.e., full-time or part-time students, was generally second in importance, but was significant in only one of the five analyses, with the  full-time student always more likely to persist than his part-time peer. Third in significance was generally race, with blacks less likely to persist than whites or &quot;others.&quot; It was found that with the Florida Twelfth Grade excluded, high school rank entered significantly, the student having the better high school standing more likely to persist than one with a lower standing. When all academic data were excluded from the analysis, none of the other variables were significant in discriminating between persisters and dropouts. It was found that the data available would lead to predictions of about 65% accuracy. (DB)",

This investigation is based upon an educational planning model derived from the theoretical framework of social demography and serves to describe patterning of college enrollment in terms of the sociocultural milieu of district community colleges. A review of the literature relevant to organizational growth and dynamics of two-year colleges in the United States was made. Findings include: (1) During a period of slow college enrollment throughout the nation, the Metropolitan District colleges have demonstrated the capacity to increase  headcount and FTE enrollment; (2) Student utilization of parking facilities at the urban community colleges of the district approximates a rate of 57% over a one-week instructional period; and (3) Modes of student access to suburban community college facilities are somewhat limited.

A review of the literature was undertaken. A group of 28 females matched in terms of College Board Scholastic Aptitude Test verbal and math scores were measured in terms of emotional well-being, study skills and readiness, and problem-solving abilities. The t-ratio for the percentile averages earned by Group A  (Visual Arts majors) and Group B (non-Visual Arts majors) was zero. Therefore, no statistically significant evidence was found to support Sir Herbert's presumption that art education eventuates in improved study habits and attitudes. (CK)",

        "description":"Public two-year colleges, which enroll more than half of all Illinois undergraduates enrolled in the public sector are bearing the brunt of the shift from &quot;mass&quot; to &quot;universal&quot; higher education. But recent evidence raises serious questions about whether a dual track system in higher education is being established which segregates by academic aptitude, achievement, and thus, to some extent, by SES. Student and institutional expenses at the two-year college far exceed what is popularly supposed. The total academic year budget for the State's junior college students is approximately $1,900, while that for senior college students is approximately $2,100. The taxpayer's cost is approximately 30% higher for the junior colleges than for freshmen-sophomore instruction in the senior  institutions. We should examine the comparative costs of junior college remedial work to the cost of doing the job right at the elementary and secondary levels. Questions have arisen about the desirability of encouraging commuter higher education in view of studies showing that some types of students, particularly those from low-income and minority groups, do better at a resident college away from home. Evidence also exists that junior colleges do not increase the proportion of the college-age population who earn bachelor's degrees. But nearly 70% of the junior college operating budgets are expended on transfer programs. We must define what we mean by the qualifications for higher education and determine whether the expansion of post-secondary &quot;opportunities&quot; has reached a point of  diminishing returns. Education from kindergarten through the Ph.D. must be considered in determining priorities. (For related documents, see HE 004 271-273, 004 281-289.) (KM)",

        "description":"The rate of increase of Illinois junior college enrollment has decreased for the past several years. One reason for this may lie in the fact that the consumption of a service has its greatest rate of increase in the early stages of the supply of the service. As the unmet demand for it becomes satisfied, additional consumption decreases, approaches zero, or may become negative if the consumer population becomes smaller. This paper deals with two demographic factors which are likely to limit junior college growth: (1) the size of high school graduating classes, which are reaching a natural limit because of the deceleration of the birthrate in the late 50s and early 60s; and (2) the shifting nature of the demand for junior college instructional programs. The following data,  tabulated in appendices, are discussed in relation to these two factors: (1) junior college districts and standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA) of Illinois; (2) number of high school graduates--actual to 1970, projected beyond; (3) junior college fall enrollment for the State through 1972; (4) junior college enrollment and high school graduates for the northern, central and southern counties; (5) the distribution of junior college teaching loads by SMSA; and (6) distribution of junior college teaching load by major program subfunctions (baccalaureate, vocational, technology, adult and continuing, and general studies) for the northern, central and southern counties.

Community participation by those who can teach the heritage of the area is a part of the implementation of this commitment. Some of the older people in the MECC service area either take the course work in folklife or come to the classes and serve as resource persons, activities that give the older people a renewed feeling of self-worth, stimulate a new pride in mountain life, and help to bridge the generation gap. In the first year of the college's operation, over 4,500 persons participated in the semi-annual Home Crafts Days, during which older craftsmen demonstrate and teach crafts once considered essential for survival in the mountains, such as shoeing mules,  quilting, carding wool, and building barns. These activities have stimulated the interest of individuals, community groups, local television, and the Children's Television Workshop, which filmed the building of a log barn. Students go out into the region on field work assignments to talk to and work with craftsmen and musicians. A record album of local music is being prepared, and a cooperative venture with the Virginia State Parks called Tunnel Crafts brings demonstrations and exhibits of music and crafts to a local State park on weekends. The college is also planning the development of a summer Virginia Folklife and Culture Seminar for public school teachers. (KM)",

Data were gathered at college entrance (with the Career Planning Profile), again after one term at the school (with the In-Program Follow-Up Questionnaire), and finally after most had graduated or were graduating. The sample totaled 7,933 students. For comparison, the sample was split into four age groups: 19 or less, 20-24, 25-39, and 40 and over. Differences in means and percentages were analyzed. The examination of total group differences was completed in an earlier study, so the purpose of this analysis was to relate the overall differences between the groups found  earlier to differences between the sexes at each age level. The age levels clearly differed in various measures of developed ability, with older students typically having lower scores. But consistent declines in ability with age on all variables were found only for women. Older students typically earned higher grades than younger students, grades higher than their test scores would indicate. The trend for self-reported high school grades was just the opposite of that for college grades. For both high school and college grades, women had higher averages than men at all age levels. Expected sex differences were found on interests and vocational plans. (KM)",

Whatever the size or type of library, the need exists for written descriptions of every job performed. There are no standard of job descriptions available because work duties differ among libraries. Tasks are grouped differently and jobs are given different titles. The organization of a small library, for example, is quite different from that of the large library having a high degree of specialization. Total work performed in operating different types of libraries is delegated in widely varying ways. This is a fact of librarianship and probably cannot be avoided. The job descriptions presented herein are offered as examples for library directors to use as guidelines in drafting  statements to fit their own particular operations. In total, the descriptions attempt to cover most of the major work activities performed in libraries, whether they be in public, college, university, or special libraries. Although the statements were prepared for use in a small college library, they are equally adaptable to any type of library. It is highly recommended that a unique job description be written for every job in every library. Professional management requires the use of such tools in the proper allocation and division of work.

Almost every aspect of nonprofessional personnel in special libraries needs adequate research, but two areas in particular call for prompt and careful attention: (1) the collection of personnel statistics, and (2) careful consideration of goals and definitions of the professional role.

(The interim report covering the period from July 1970 to June 1972 is ED 069 327.) Objective one was the establishment of an institutionalized field agent program whereby each of the twenty-five districts that participated in the project identified one person who became the local field agent. Objective two was to test the feasibility of expanding the service to include the larger urban districts within the state. For the first two years the project served only small, rural districts. During the continuation period, the state agency, through the project staff,  selected one large school district (at least 10,000 enrollment) to participate in the project. Objective three was to provide computerized ERIC searches to Utah educators through the Technical Assistance Reference Center and the Utah State Data Processing Division and the necessary research support for the field agents by coordinating ERIC services with other national and local dissemination efforts. This final project report discusses the pursuit of these objectives, the activities of the project, and an evaluation of project effectiveness. (Author/SJ)",

The ASIN Committee was directed to review various network concepts as a means of improving information services to professional agriculturalists in the private and public sectors and to develop detailed plans for implementing a cooperative information system. The Committee stressed the improvement of service to the ultimate user of research information. Building upon recommendations of an earlier study by the Interuniversity Communications Council (EDUCOM), the ASIN Committee has recommended that the National Agricultural Library (NAL) serve as the coordinator in a network plan. NAL's function would be  to continue to assist other information services in providing less common documentary materials, and to coordinate the plans for developing services in greater depth and breadth. The network as recommended can be described in terms of five broad components: (1) Libraries; (2) Research and development in information science and services; (3) Information analysis centers; (4) Integrated knowledge services (a kind of directory and referral activity); and (5) International cooperation.

The participant learns about the library through the use of media that are located in libraries and material centers along with the books and printed matter which are easily obtained. The purpose of this booklet is to aid the school volunteer to become an effective assistant to the librarian, teacher and student. More meaningful and creative student and teacher use of library resource material may be established with the assistance  and support of a school volunteer library assistant. The training booklet is sub-divided into three mini-modules containing eight activities to develop skills which are useful in assisting in the library. The first module develops skills in using the card catalog and the Dewey Decimal System. Mini-module two instructs the student on how to differentiate materials, identify and operate audio-visual equipment, and design displays for bulletin boards. Module three develops story telling skills. (Author/SJ)",

And whether there are some questions relating to general educational policy, sociology and library theory, in short, to library philosophy which are raised throughout the world by scientific and technological development and economic growth. In the author's opinion, the answer to the first question is in the negative while it is in the affirmative to the second. However, the two  questions are closely related, and the answers to be given and a thorough explanation of the problems involved is conditional upon long-term, multi-dimensional, and institutional research work on the part of the specialists.

It is now desirable that the results of INFROSS should be compared with those of science user studies. To do this it is essential that studies should be based on comparable data. The relationship between the sciences and the characteristics of each science must be taken into account in ascertaining the differing information requirements of scientists and social scientists. This report therefore attempts to draw from science user studies possible general  conclusions that enable a comparison to be made with the results of INFROSS, and in doing so considers some of the methodological problems involved.

        "description":"The existing volume and increasing growth rate of documented information has resulted in numerous efforts to construct operational Document Storage and Retrieval Systems, as a practical solution to the demand for information storage and retrieval. Accompanying the surge to build more and better and bigger Document Retrieval Systems (DRSs), was the realization that there are few effective tools for the designers and managers of these systems. The tasks of design and management of DRSs requires tools and performance measures to aid in the selection of preferred options, and in the control over the fundamental processes of inquiry analysis, indexing, retrieval and system growth. A step toward the generation of operational tools to aid in the design and management tasks is presented  in this report, by the development of a Retrieval Quantity (Rq) estimate. The Rq estimate is defined as a function of the inquiry form, search strategy and descriptor-document distribution, and can be used to predict the quantity output due to system growth, and aid in the tuning of the indexing and formal inquiry specification processes.

What has happened in all too many American communities is that libraries are intensively used by only a small portion of the population, while the vast majority are untouched by the library's service and its genuinely useful social and educational function. How librarians are committing themselves to reverse this trend is the subject of this brochure. Elementary and secondary school libraries, academic libraries, and community public libraries have all affirmed the goals of the Right To Read program, a national endeavor to eradicate illiteracy and functional illiteracy in the United States. Described here are the ways in  which Federal funds have been used to sponsor local library activities in support of these goals. Such activities include tutorial sessions in inner-city libraries, reading-readiness programs in day-care centers and nursery schools, remedial reading exercises for out-of-school adults with difficulties in reading and writing, and bilingual collections and services for those who are literate in a language other than English. Taken together, they represent the library's new contribution to opening the once-closed covers of books for thousands of Americans. (Author)",

In addition, they attempt to show how one piece of work is related to or influenced by another, since research works seldom evolve without interaction. Because a number of outstanding works on computer security and access control in computer systems are classified or unpublished, this collection is not exhaustive. The annotated material is organized into four sections of which the  sections on computer security and access control in computer systems are emphasized. In addition, to provide some background and broad understanding of the issues of computer security, they have included several bibliographies, some articles on the business and management overview, and several works on social and legal implications.

The Massachusetts Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, in association with Merrimack Education Center, has recently prepared a response to this need by means of a microform dissemination system modeled after the ERIC system. Throughout the educational community, improved curricula are being designed and developed. In order to utilize the invaluable information that is being generated by this curriculum development activity, a pilot committee was formed in the spring of 1973 to develop an exchange of curricula among local school systems. A literature search of information  centers revealed that the resulting exchange project is unique in providing educators with teacher-prepared materials developed locally. The major portion of this document is the index, by subject, title, school system and accession number, of available documents. Annotations are given with the subject index.

The committee was faced from the beginning with the problem of how to develop school libraries with inadequate funds and insufficient manpower. The approach taken was to provide reasonably adequate library service in a few schools at first, and then expand the program to other schools. This would allow for efficient service in the selected area and would provide a model of what could be accomplished in other areas in the future. UNESCO assistance helped establish model school libraries in three regions, including a mobile school library service.

The KWAC program is essentially a KWIC index generator designed for a special purpose for use in a particular course, though it has sufficient flexibility to be used in other, similar contexts. The program takes free form natural language input, and generates an index in alphabetical order of each significant word appearing in the input alongside which appears the bibliographical description of the document in which the word was located. Output options permit free form title page, introduction, and epilog. Page headers and footers are  permitted, and index page numbers are assigned and printed automatically. Determination of significant words is made in two ways: 1) a word is determined to be significant by default, if it does not appear in a user-input stop list and provided it begins with an alphabetic character and it is more than one character long; and 2) an otherwise significant word may be eliminated from the indexing by a simple procedure at the time of input.

A strong point of the legislation creating the Office is a provision that mandates the establishment of local councils for children across the state. The Office for Children plans to establish 35 to 40 local councils. The local councils will have the power to review budgets and funding proposals, to evaluate and monitor programs, to develop information and referral services, and to make recommendations on needs and priorities regarding children's services. These recommendations will form the basis of the policies and priorities adopted. In addition to the local councils, a state-wide council on children will consist of representatives from each local council and  enough additional appointments to insure strong consumer representation at the state level. The state-wide council will serve as a forum and advocate for issues that affect the common interests of children across the state. It is expected that at least half of the councils will be established by June 1973, and that all will be operating before the end of the year. One of the immediate goals of the Office is to stimulate the creation of local supportive services for children who are in immediate danger of institutionalization. Other responsibilities of the Office are: to set standards for all child care centers and systems, provide for inspections of facilities, review state budgets involving children's services and make recommendations, draw up guidelines for the development of day care  services in the state, and others.

Each of the conferences has been concerned with a problem typical of the decade in which it occurred. The White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children, in 1909, was a protest against the use of institutional care for dependent and neglected children. The second conference, held in 1919, the White House Conference on Standards of Child Welfare, framed  the first important body of child health and welfare standards to insure that every child had a fair chance. The White House Conference on Child Health and Protection (1930) produced the most comprehensive statement of the needs of children ever written. The subject of the 1940 Conference on Children in a Democracy canvassed the fundamental democratic principles, conditions, and services essential for the well-being of children in a democracy. The Midcentury White House Conference on Children and Youth (1950) was concerned with democracy's responsibility &quot;to produce socially minded cooperative people, without sacrificing individuality.&quot; This conference explored the ingredients of a healthy personality development. The 1960 White House Conference on Children and Youth enlarged this theme  to find ways &quot;to promote opportunities for children and youth to realize their full potential for a creative life in freedom and dignity.&quot; The stories of these conferences are provided.

        "description":"Cognitive categories in infants that have relevance for linguistic development were investigated. \"Agent\" and \"recipient,\" the categories chosen, are relational categories which by definition involve action. This experiment explored infants' (48 males, 14-24 months of age) sensitivity to certain \"action parameters\" of events. The question of whether infants could perceive the difference between agents and recipients was operationalized by comparing infants' visual fixation times to different experimental events presented on two color, silent motion picture films. These events were constructed to be more or less discrepant from an additional standard event appropriate to the content of each film. The different experimental events in the two films were presented sequentially in the  habituation paradigm. The agent-recipient dichotomy was contrasted by having real people and a table perform in filmed action sequences which represented three variations of the agent-recipient relationship. Data from the 48 subjects were analyzed in a four-factor analysis of variance using the difference scores between visual fixation time to the experimental event minus the visual fixation time to the preceding standard. The results indicated that only one agent-recipient reversal, the agent recipient reversal by direction, was watched more than the combined means of the agent-recipient reversal by position and the position-direction reversals.

        "description":"Following an analysis of work in the area of relationships between concept development and social development, a preliminary research project carried out to examine these relationships is discussed. Piaget's &quot;The Language and Thought of the Child&quot; served as a springboard for the past and present investigations. In the experiment reported, a group of normal pupils compared with a group of gifted pupils were tested on three Piagetian tasks and a measure of social abilities. Piaget predicts accelerated acquisition of concepts in gifted children. Assuming this prediction to be true, it was hypothesized that: (1) concept level on cognitive tasks and the level of socialization measured by a test of role playing ability is significantly higher for gifted children than for their average  peers; (2) egocentrism, as measured by Piaget's task of spatial perspectives, is negatively related to scores on a test of role playing ability; and (3) there is a stronger positive relationship between the cognitive task measuring conservation and role playing ability than between the other tasks and role playing ability. In order to test these hypotheses, 20 subjects were chosen from two third-grade classes. Five boys and five girls, matched for sex and age, were randomly selected from a normal third-grade class for the control group; five girls and five boys from the third level gifted class served as the experimental group. The subjects were interviewed individually on three Piagetian tasks and a test of role-playing ability. Results of the study showed that hypothesis one was  supported; hypothesis two was not supported; and hypothesis three was supported. (DB)",

        "description":"To determine whether maternal involvement reflects her expectations about her child's ability to solve the tasks at hand, a group of 32 boys and their mothers were studied. Sixteen of the boys were classed as reflective and 16 were classed impulsive on the Matching Familiar Figures Test. The boys were matched on age (8 years 9 months and 8 years 6 months), IQ (120.3 and 118.3), and social class (no differentiation on Hollingshead two-factor index). The mothers accompanied their children to the test room where they were advised that during the performance of four tasks by the children, the mothers could help as little or as much as they liked. Children were than presented with two easy and two difficult tasks to complete in counter-balanced order. Each of the tasks included a  verbal and a non-verbal problem, to be completed in 10 minutes each. The mothers were asked to write the childrens' answers to the verbal tasks. While the interaction session was in progress, the observer sat behind the subjects and coded both maternal and child behaviors in 10-second blocks on predefined behavioral categories. The study data indicated that mothers of impulsive boys provided more direction and structuring than did mothers of reflective boys. Maternal interventions increased with task difficulty, indicating that the mother's behavior is a reflection of her expectations about her child's ability to cope with the tasks at hand. The two groups of children did not differ on interaction measures; however, the impulsive children tended to engage in more irrelevant conversations.  (DB)",

        "description":"An extension of previous attempts at modifying children's cognitive styles is discussed. Specifically, the present study employed sociometric peer models in order to ascertain whether: (1) impulsivity is modifiable through observation of salient models, and (2) sociometrically selected peer models are more effective than unselected models in the reduction of errors associated with increased response times. The 19-item Sutton-Smith and Rosenberg Impulsivity Scale 3 was administered to 98 fourth and sixth grade children (50 in the fourth grade and 48 in the sixth). Fifty children (28 males and 22 females) scored at or above the median of 10 on the IMP3 Scale; 25 of the children were assigned to the experimental condition and 25 to the control condition. The experimental design of  the study was implemented in three stages: (1) pretest evaluation of cognitive style, using the Matching Familiar Figures test; (2) training in which the children in the experimental group were individually exposed to a trained reflective model, who was named by the experimental child, and who were not classified as impulsives; the children in the control group were not exposed to models; and (3) children in both groups were individually pretested on nine items of the Matching Familiar Figures test. The study data were subjected to statical analysis. Results indicated that impulsive children showed a change in response style after viewing a reflective model. Generally, males in the experimental condition showed a greater increase in mean response time than did females, as well as a  stronger decrease in mean number of errors. (DB)",

Eighty children, 40 white and 40 black, were given the block design task in natural lighting on a cloudy day. Half of each racial group were given the red/white design and half the  blue/yellow design. Results were significant in the predicted direction. White children were not affected by the block design color, while the scores for black children were significantly different on the blue/yellow design.

        "description":"In designing group day care for infants, special attention has been given to efficient care practices, so that all the children's health needs can be met and so that the staff will have ample time to interact with the children. One efficient method is to assign each staff member the responsibility of a particular area rather than a particular group of children. In the Infant Center several areas are utilized--receiving, feeding, diapering, crib and play. All staff members are to interact with children in a large play area when not needed in their area. The center is one continuous open space separated only by low partitions, an arrangement that allows easy monitoring of all areas. Use of this design has posed some questions. One question was whether children would have trouble  sleeping in an open center, since the sleep area would not be darkened or separated from the rest of the center. Studies comparing amounts of sleeping and crying in open, closed and open room conditions have shown that room conditions do not affect infants' sleep. Another question that arose was whether the use of an efficiently planned environment would result in staff spending more time with the children. It was found that as the number of staff in the play area increased, the percentage of time each spent interacting with the children decreased. An experiment has shown, however, that if planned activities are assigned to staff members, interaction is greater and there is less reduction in individual interaction as the number of staff in the area increases.
