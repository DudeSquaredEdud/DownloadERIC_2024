        "description":"This booklet recounts the history of apprenticeship and describes its practice in the United States today. The booklet is organized in five sections. The first section outlines the early days of apprenticeship, telling how the system of indenture was imported from Europe, giving various examples of apprenticeship under that system, and describing the production of apprentices'\"masterpieces\"--test pieces to prove an apprentice artisan's mastery of his craft and his right to the status of \"freeman.\" The second section details the changes that apprenticeship has undergone, discussing graduated wages, wage rate lags, beginning careers, first apprenticeship legislation, labor standards, equal employment opportunity, and the national apprenticeship law. In the third section, modern  apprenticeship programs are described. Topics covered include certificates of completion, joint apprenticeship committees, basic standards for apprenticeship, and apprenticeship values for youth and industry. The fourth section explores new directions in apprenticeship, such as women in apprenticeship, apprenticeship preparatory courses and preemployment programs, and veterans in apprenticeship. The final section briefly suggests ways apprenticeships may go in the future. The booklet includes a directory of regional and state offices of the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training as well as a list of state and territorial apprenticeship agencies. (KC)",

        "author":["Pomerance, Anita"],
        "description":"A pilot tutor training project, the Student-Tutor Orientation (STO), was designed to meet the need for making whole-language concepts of reading and writing instruction accessible to tutors as well as students through hands-on experience and for establishing a collaborative tutoring relationship in which students share in decision making. Together, tutors and students at a literacy program in a large Northeastern city learned the new concepts and strategies such as the language experience method. Use of materials relating to student goals and interests was emphasized, with instruction on how to make difficult but interesting texts accessible through such strategies as student listening and duet reading. Writing was stressed from the beginning, using invented spelling if  necessary. After a year's use, in which 11 STOs were given and 97 tutor-student pairs trained, the approach seems to be superior to the agency's former training methods in several respects. Retention of tutors after training and hours of service surpassed those of a comparable series of the Center for Literacy's training a year ago. Tutors expressed increased confidence, and tutors and students reported more goal-related materials used and more writing done. Staff members requested STOs for their areas, stating that they felt the STOs produced better tutoring. Students were enthusiastic about their progress and their gains in self-esteem. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"At the request of the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 17 agencies in the Pittsburgh area began a planning process to form a single administrative body for all adult basic education and literacy programs. This project supported the hiring of a planning consultant, the convening of planning meetings and a retreat, and thorough documentation of the process. The early planning meetings showed that the agencies had a variety of preferences and expectations. Gradually, they began to collaborate and accept the consortium. A great deal of time was spent in determining how the governing board of the consortium would be structured. Guidelines were provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The project led to the incorporation of a new nonprofit organization, the Literacy  Consortium of Allegheny County. (Most of this document consists of documentation of the planning process for the formation of the consortium, including letters to agencies, agendas for planning meetings and the retreat, and minutes of meetings. The planning process and questions asked of agency officials thinking about the consortium are included.) (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A study of the Center for Literacy's (CFL) program was conducted to provide information on retention and attrition in an urban, open-entry/open-exit, individualized, goal-based literacy program. An exploratory analysis that used student and tutor records from 1985 through 1989 provided a summary of demographics and attendance patterns. This information, staff interviews, and a literature review were used to create working definitions of retention and attrition and to form research questions. The study also conducted statistical analysis of variables affecting retention. These variables were found to have a statistically significant effect on student retention: sex, instructional level, age, ethnic membership, dependents, employment, previous educational experience, handicap, area  of residence, and area of instruction. Some program implications that were developed focused on: specific, individualized student goals and interests; increased student support from staff; topic-oriented small group instruction; increased flexibility for special needs; ongoing tutor/teacher support; and drop-in centers for transition periods. These significant tutor variables were identified: age, educational background, and ethnic membership. Program implications regarding tutors were also developed. (Thirty-two references are cited. Appendixes include a sample student data file and numerous additional tables.) (YLB)",

Intense guidance was provided to each student in the program. The program included: (1) maintaining daily contact with each student to provide encouragement and positive motivation in their preparation; (2) counseling that included requiring each student to write their long- and short-term career goals; (3) encouraging students to apply to programs to further their education after the GED; and (4) group instruction in test taking. Classes were held from 6:30 to 9:00 p.m. on Tuesdays and  Thursdays. The program was built around programmed disposable materials, along with some audiovisual materials. Forty-two students enrolled in the program, 20 retested, and 11 actually achieved their GEDs. Attendance was a problem for many students, and their low level of attendance could not be overcome by staff even with intensive contact. The study concluded that high numbers of prospective students must be contacted in order to recruit and retain the number of students projected in project goals for this population. (KC)",

Witnesses included members of Congress, officials of the U.S. Department of Labor and the Social Security Administration, officials of the National Council on Aging, the mayor of Union City (New Jersey), a project director of a day care program in New Jersey, the director of the New Jersey Department of Senior Employment Services, and the public affairs director of the National Association for the Education of Young Children. The  witnesses testified about proposed legislation that would exempt child care earnings from the Social Security earnings test so that more older adults would be willing to be employed as child caregivers. The witnesses favored doing away with the earnings test entirely, since it usually is a disincentive for older Americans to work. They also wanted Job Training Partnership Act provisions changed so that older persons could be trained for child care, as is being done by the New Jersey project, without being required to work full time, which many older people do not want. Reports included in the transcript point to the need to reconsider older adults and their training and employment needs as well as the work force needs of the country. (KC)",

Products for the report were gathered through reviews of CAD periodicals, computers in education periodicals, advertisements, and teacher recommendations. The first section lists the primary considerations in choosing a good CAD system, as agreed upon by teachers: cost, ease of use, ease of setup, and availability of coordinated curriculum materials. The following important features of CAD software are also outlined: dimensioning, display, creating objects, modifying objects, snaps, output, input, and modeling. CAD programs for Macintosh and Apple II series microcomputers are reviewed in separate sections. Each section begins with  a brief discussion of advantages and disadvantages of the microcomputer and software available for it. A chart comparing the features of the CAD programs for specific microcomputers follows. Each program description includes publisher name, address, and telephone number; computer name; cost; and a summary of the opinions of the teachers who reviewed the program. Four programs for the Macintosh are reviewed: MacDraft, MGMStation, MiniCAD, and VersaCAD. Four programs for the Apple II are reviewed: MATC-CAD, discoverCAD, CADApple 2D Version 3.5, and Entry Level CADApple. (YLB)",

Witnesses included Members of Congress, representatives of veterans' groups, the national employment director of Disabled American Veterans, and officials of the Vocational and Rehabilitation Service. Witnesses testified that veterans' education and rehabilitation programs are extremely cost effective and noted that more personnel are needed in order to do a better job of placing veterans in training programs. They also noted the difficulties of helping with some veterans'  problems, such as lack of transportation, and recommended shortening the amount of time needed to be placed in programs. Some witnesses also noted that outreach provisions of the bill would be difficult to meet. Witnesses did not object to allowing some veterans' discharges to be changed, but differed as to which agency should handle the paperwork. (KC)",

        "description":"The Kenan Trust Family Literacy Project was implemented during the 1988-89 school year at three model sites in Louisville, Kentucky, and four in North Carolina. The model was designed to teach undereducated parents together with their 3- or 4-year-old children. Children participated in a comprehensive preschool program while adults studied in various academic and vocational areas. During Parent and Child Together (PACT) time, parents and children worked and played together. The Parent Time (PT) component allowed parents to meet as a group to address significant problems. Research identified seven types of parents with distinctly different characteristics related to program participation, motivation, capability, needs, and likelihood of accomplishment. Few parents in two  problematic groups remained in the program for periods long enough to make significant gains in their or their children's achievements. For all other groups, almost all parents and children made important gains in academic performance, self-concept, social skills, and control over their lives. Recommendations were made for model adoption. (Following the 42-page final report are a description of the model, descriptions of parent types, case descriptions, anecdotal records, academic achievements of parents by site, and raw data for adults by site.)

        "author":["Beck, Robert H."],
        "description":"Relating vocational to academic programs in U.S. high schools is a challenge. Usually, more academic subjects are required for graduation, while vocational study is squeezed into the electives. This is not a balance; what is needed is an interaction between the academic and the vocational, the product of which is a general education persuasively stronger than what currently exists. Collaboration between teachers of vocational and academic studies will make academic studies more relevant and students will be less likely to drop out of school before graduation. Such a collaboration could be termed polytechnical education. The Soviet Union has developed a curriculum of polytechnical education, in an effort to establish &quot;parity of esteem&quot; of vocational and academic preparation.  Soviet polytechnical education is rooted in the Marxist-Leninist ideology, which remains a powerful influence despite a move toward an economy responsive to the market. Soviet polytechnical education has different manifestations in rural and urban areas, but it has an essential structure. It can also facilitate vocational learning and career decision making. A polytechnical education system such as the Soviet Union has could be a step toward integrating academic and vocational education in the United States. (This paper contains an extension examination of the Soviet polytechnical system and 75 references.) (KC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine whether data from a 1988-89 Kentucky survey measured differences in the value level held by minority and women administrators and their respective counterparts (majority and male administrators). The sample included 1,500 public service managers who had received inservice training and 1,500 who had not. The 1,471 respondents included 49 minority administrators. Survey participants responded to nine statements reflecting public services values on a Likert scale. A two-way MANOVA was performed to test all nine hypotheses simultaneously. Additional one-way univariate and stepdown F tests and other statistics were produced to complete the analyses. Minority administrators' responses indicated that they did not feel that the general public were as  ignorant about the complexity of decision making in government agencies as did their majority counterparts. Nor did minority administrators value the importance of being aware of public opinion concerning their agencies as much as their majority counterparts. Female administrators differed significantly from male counterparts on four value measures. They felt to a greater degree that agencies should provide equal treatment for minorities and women, but disagreed to a greater extent that political influence was important for an agency to help a citizen. Women administrators felt to a greater degree that high quality services should be provided and democratic principles should be applied at the workplace and when dealing with the public.

Three major adjustments need to be made in current thinking about human development to meet the challenge of using the new technology. First, the development of people must be viewed as an investment and not an operating expense. Second, development must be seen as something the individual controls himself or herself and not as something that another person (instructor, counselor, or manager) does to him or her. Third, development should not be viewed as applying a treatment, as in teaching, but as preparing a learning environment. The learning environment is at the heart of developing people. To develop learning environments that deal  with the range of learning outcomes required in the modern workplace will be impossible to achieve without the use of modern tools and technologies. Faced with the challenges in society that the new technologies have created, educators and trainers must improve education and development at each stage of the human development process.

First, a survey was sent to 832 Ohio educators and human services personnel to identify the status of targeted linkages relevant to serving LEAP (Learning, Earning, and Parenting) and JOBS (Job Opportunities and Basic Skills) participants. A total of 417 usable responses were analyzed. Respondents identified exemplary linkages with other programs serving JOBS and LEAP participants, strategies to link programs, barriers to linkages, types of assistance to strengthen networks, and interest in attending an interagency team  workshop. Second, an interagency linkage workshop attended by 15 local teams was conducted. Thirteen teams completed action plans. Technical assistance was provided through roundtable discussion, and a resource notebook was distributed. Third, to identify exemplary local linkages, the team collected information through telephone interviews with selected survey respondents and workshop attendees. Responses were synthesized into a list of tips for developing successful linkages.

A critical analysis of this first commission of a national professional organization shows that individual motivation often sustained the work, but that the question has often lost its place in the concerted efforts of adult educators when that individual was no longer championing the cause. The article chronicles the work of the Commission noting the following highlights: (1) acceptance by the Adult Education Association of a $2,000 grant in 1953 to conduct a conference to examine the implications of adult education for school  architecture and to disseminate recommendations; (2) two Commission meetings in 1955 at which the Commission developed an outline for a book, &quot;Architecture for Adult Education,&quot; and then approved the text, format, and examples; (3) distribution of the book by 1958; and (4) the Commission's last and largest project, the national Conference on Architecture in December 1958. The paper concludes with a brief reference to rebirth of interest in adequate physical facilities and the creation of a new Commission on Planning Adult Learning Systems, Facilities and Environments.

Some of the findings of the study were the following: (1) VACs are spending more time teaching and less time supervising students on work sites, or developing work stations; (2) VRCs also were spending less time on job development or supervision;  (3) clarification is needed regarding responsibilities and roles of VACs and VRCs in supported employment and job placement; (4) perceptions of the groups toward the other was more negative if they had not worked together in special education; and (5) the groups shared more similarities than differences in values, but VRCs valued economic returns more than did VACs, VACs valued responsibility more. Further training was recommended regarding aspects of work roles for key transition personnel. VAC and VRC surveys are appended. (KC)",

        "description":"The significant number of firefighter trainees experiencing performance evaluation anxiety during fire training school was addressed by the implementation of anxiety reduction and performance enhancement strategies. Audiotape recordings were chosen as the primary intervention medium to facilitate program effectiveness within an established fire training regimen. The intervention modalities of relaxation training, cognitive therapy, and mental imagery were implemented with 10 firefighter trainees. Two primary screening devices, the Text Anxiety Inventory (Speilberger 1980) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Speilberger 1983) were used to determine the preintervention and postintervention levels of performance evaluation anxiety. The results indicated measurable positive  anxiety-reduction effects with significant improvement in performance. It was concluded that the performance improvements were attributed to the vivid imagery dialogue and that this type of training presented on audiotape is most effective when used in conjunction with conventional training programs.

        "description":"This study investigated factors that influence students not to enroll at the Springfield-Clark Joint Vocational School (JVS) and in vocational education at the feeder comprehensive high schools. A cluster sample of 357 nonvocational students was selected from junior English classes from the nine feeder schools and administered a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The top five reasons students gave for not enrolling in vocational education were: (1) plans to attend college; (2) career choice limitations; (3) graduation requirements; (4) academic ability of vocational students; and (5) behavior of vocational students. Students reported that they were influenced not to go to the vocational school by (in order) friends, mothers,  fathers, and counselors. The study concluded that the image of vocational education and of the Springfield-Clark JVS needs to be improved, since students have negative images of the students enrolled. Recommendations were made to promote the accomplishments of graduates, especially information about graduates going onto higher education. Recommendations also were made to ease the social transition when students change schools to attend the Springfield-Clark JVS, to promote social activities, to increase positive publicity about the JVS, to encourage counselors to recommend the school, to provide new courses such as child care and development and law enforcement, and to provide more information about the JVS to parents.

The youngsters were then contrasted along four sets of outcomes: psychosocial development, school achievement, internalized distress, and problem behavior. Results indicated that adolescents raised in authoritative homes scored highest on measures of psychosocial competence and lowest on measures of psychological and behavioral dysfunction; the reverse was true for adolescents raised in neglectful homes. Adolescents raised in authoritarian  homes scored reasonably well on measures indexing obedience and conformity to the standards of adults but had relatively poorer self-conceptions than other youngsters. In contrast, adolescents from indulgent homes evidenced a strong sense of self-confidence, but reported a higher frequency of substance abuse and school misconduct and were less engaged in school. The findings suggest that Maccoby and Martin's four-fold classification scheme provides a workable empirical framework for those interested in the study of adolscent socialization. More important, the results illustrate the need to distinguish between two types of \"permissive\" families: those that are indulgent and those that are neglectful. (Author)",

A socioeconomically and ethnically diverse sample of approximately 10,000 high school students provided information about their parents' behavior and their family background and completed measures of four indicators of adjustment: school performance, self-reliance, psychological distress, and delinquency. The students were grouped into 16 ecological niches defined by ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and family structure, and analyses were conducted within each niche to contrast the adjustment scores of adolescents from authoritative versus nonauthoritative homes. Analyses indicated that the  positive correlates of authoritative parenting transcended ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and family structure. Virtually regardless of their ethnicity, class, or parents' marital status, adolescents whose parents were accepting, firm, and democratic earned higher grades in school, were more self-reliant, reported less anxiety and depression, and were less likely to engage in delinquent behavior.

The results indicated that long work hours during the school year were associated with diminished investment in schooling and lowered school performance, increased psychological distress and somatic complaints, higher rates of drug and alcohol use, higher rates of delinquency, and greater autonomy from parental control. Workers did not have any advantages over nonworkers with respect to self-reliance, work orientation, or self-esteem. The correlates of school-year employment were closely linked to the number of hours worked each week and generally cut across ethnic, socioeconomic, and age  groups, although the association between hours of employment and poor school performance was clearer among White and Asian-American adolescents than their peers. Nevertheless, in no ethnic or socioeconomic group were the correlates of employment positive, either in terms of lower rates of dysfunctional behavior, better school performance, or enhanced psychosocial well-being. These and similar findings from previous research suggest that parents, educational practitioners, and policy-makers should continue to monitor the number of weekly hours adolescents work during the school year.

The subscales were labeled as Spouse, Kin, Friend, Parent, Coworker/Classmate, and Neighbor. Scores were most collectivist on Parent and Kin subscales. Women scored as more collectivist on the Parent subscale than did men. Students' scores also differed according to university attended. Those attending a university which charged moderate tuition scored as more collectivist on the Parent and Spouse subscales than those attending a university which  charged higher tuition, thus attracting students from wealthier backgrounds. There was also an interaction between gender and university attended with women attending the middle socioeconomic university scoring as most collectivist. These findings support a previous finding that links an emphasis on family relations with collectivism. (Author/ABL)",

The staff consists of a supervisor, a coordinator, 3 teachers, a school liaison person, a counselor, 2 parent advocates, 2 part-time computer teachers, 2 drivers, and 12 paid student tutors. Additionally, students participate in activities for which  appropriate adult role models are provided. During the program year studied the process objectives were all met within designated time limits; the product objectives were also fully met. All other indicators demonstrated that participation in Project PRIDE was a predictor of improved attendance and improved grade point averages. Participation in the project can also be a predictor of fewer suspensions, staying in school, and improved citizenship. (ABL)",

        "description":"The role of women as sexual victims has been recognized and documented in cultural and social history. However, men too can be the victims of unwanted and aggressive heterosexual behavior. This study explored the incidence of sexually aggressive behaviors performed by women (N=212) who were students in sexuality classes. Specifically, three questions were posed. First, what is the structure underlying the sexual histories of women? Second, what is the structure underlying sex-related attitudes? Third, how does the identified attitudes structure predict the aggressive sexual behaviors of women? More than one-half of the subjects had engaged in sexual behaviors that might be deemed abusive or even coercive. These sexually coercive behaviors included such behaviors as verbal  pressure, use of power, or lying. Some 18.5 percent of the subjects engaged in behavior that would be considered sexually abusive such as initiating sexual contact with a minor or inducing intoxication for the purpose of initiating sexual intercourse. Five dimensions were found to underlie the incidence of reported behaviors. Predictors of these behaviors were explored using a canonical correlation analysis. Passive aggressive attitudes contributed appreciably to explaining a range of sexual behaviors. Predictors of aggressive sexual behavior must be better understood in order to design effective interventions. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"This paper reviews alcohol awareness and alcoholism prevention efforts on college campuses since the mid-1970s. The concept of responsible drinking which is an accepted part of these college prevention programs is discussed. It is noted that while the responsible drinking concept has been recently called into question, there never was any meaningful body of research underlying its use in prevention programs in general, nor has there been any significant research to assess the efficacy of its use in campus prevention programs. Designated driver programs are also discussed, and it is noted that here again there has been no research evaluating these programs. Other points made are that college prevention and education programs created under the Omnibus Drug Bills of 1986 and 1988  are being rapidly created in an atmosphere of an inadequate research base. It is noted that many of the research funds provided to the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration have been specifically designated for \"high risk youth\" and do not include college students. At the same time, colleges have a rich array of resources which can be involved in meaningful research efforts if provided with proper leadership. The paper concludes by recommending a meaningful national research agenda regarding the prevention of alcohol and other drug problems on campus. (ABL)",

Another characteristic of at-risk students is the role parents play or fail to play in the at-risk behavior. A case is made for all students being at risk at some point in their lives. Four programs were designed and implemented to help at-risk and marginal students at one junior high school. The four programs include the OK Club, the Quest for Success Skills Program, the I-CANN (Individualized Course Alternative, Now or Never), and the Student Assistance Council. The OK Club is designed to build self-esteem and to provide after school-support and requires a strong parental component. The Quest for Success Skills Program is a transition program which  prepares at risk sixth-graders for junior high school. The I-CANN Program provides counseling, development of self-esteem, and a hands-on curriculum. It also has a strong parental component. The Student Assistance Council involves a staff team that assesses the needs of at-risk students and recommends actions to address those needs. A successful program must begin with an attitude of caring. This caring attitude must be reflected by the total school staff toward every student and his or her family. (ABL)",

It then compares these preferences to determine whether significant differences exist between men and women in contemporary Japan. For their present and future family life, these Japanese subjects preferred a division of labor in which wives take primary responsibility for housework and husbands take primary responsibility for home maintenance, &quot;breadwinning,&quot; and decision making. While the Japanese women tended to think wives should be more responsible than husbands for maintenance of health and management of finances, Japanese men appeared to desire an equal share of these  responsibilities. Both Japanese men and women indicated a preference for equal sharing of responsibilities involving education, discipline, recreation, birth control, and communication with relatives. These Japanese men and women differed significantly in their preferences regarding division or sharing of five traditional family tasks. The women wanted more equality or sharing of tasks related to housework, education, &quot;breadwinning,&quot; and decision making. The men wanted more equality or sharing of tasks related to maintenance of health. These findings were construed as issues warranting communication and negotiation in family relationships in contemporary Japan. References are included. (Author/TE)",

Using these data, an analysis of covariance was conducted to compare the goodness of fit of two alternate models of the relationship between health conception and health-promoting lifestyle derived from  the literature. Model A hypothesized strength of health conception as the single underlying dimension progressively related to the four health conception scales (eudaimonistic, adaptive, role performance, and clinical); Model B suggested that the adaptive and eudamonistic health conception variables were strongly related to one another. Results of the analysis suggest that Model B was best fitted to the data. A discussion of these findings and their implications ensues, and recommendations for further research for are made.

Part I of the book, Understanding the HIV Epidemic, provides the basic foundation for  understanding the emergence and epidemiology of the epidemic. Part II, the San Francisco Response, presents three chapters detailing different aspects of the prevention effort in San Francisco. Part III, HIV Prevention in Your Community, provides nuts and bolts expertise concerning the development, design, and implementation of prevention programs.

Lessons 1 and 2 challenge students to analyze why individuals, as consumers, make the decisions they do. Lesson 3 helps students to explore consumer issues related to the foods they eat. Lesson 4 allows students to become advisors to fictitious teenagers as the teenagers make decisions about health and beauty products. Lesson 5 looks at the issue of health professionals.  The activities in lesson 6 are designed to help students synthesize the information and issues in previous lessons so they can predict the skills that will be critical for future consumers. The lessons in this curriculum explore the influence of television advertising on buying habits; present the problems and benefits of alternative medical treatments; address adolescents' concerns about peer acceptance and choices related to skin care, hair care, and deodorant products; and provide guidelines for making sensible consumer health decisions.

        "description":"This study was conducted to identify those books in the discipline of student personnel and in fields of study closely related to student personnel which Chief Student Affairs Officers (CSAOs) and heads of student personnel preparation programs listed as being most important for students in master's degree programs to read. Questionnaires were completed by 58 heads of preparation programs and 45 CSAOs. For the heads of preparation programs, the book chosen most often, \"Student Services: A Handbook for the Profession,\" was selected by 30 of the respondents (50.85%). Only 3 books were chosen by 20 percent or more of the this group of respondents, who collectively named 44 different books. \"Student Services: A Handbook for the Profession\" was also the book most often chosen by  CSAOs. Again, only three books were chosen by 20 per cent or more of the CSAOs and a total of 43 books were chosen by this group. By all respondents put together (a total of 103) 64 different books were chosen. Except for the \"Student Services\" book there appeared to be a great variety of opinions concerning the student personnel books which the profession believed master's degree students in student personnel should read. This diversity occurred not only between heads of preparation programs and CSAOs, where the differences may be accounted for by the diversity between theory and practice, but also within each of these groups.

        "description":"The accreditation manual of the Council for Accrediation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP) contains a statement that, whenever possible, criteria for assessing standards should be qualitative rather than quantitative. The study reported in this paper was conducted to gather baseline data on the extent to which accrediting bodies have included quantitative terms in standards related to program goals, structures, and processes. Quantitative statements were defined as any reference in an accreditation standard where a numerical value could be attached. Minimum hours, minimum degree levels, numbers of required semesters or quarters, ratios of students to faculty, and percent of increase in funding for library materials are examples of terms that met the criteria  for being identified as quantitative. The accreditation manuals of the American Psychological Association (APA), the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), and CACREP were examined to determine the presence of quantitative statements in the standards of these bodies. A model which included 47 categories of accrediting information revealed that, when compared to APA and CSWE, CACREP had more categories which included quantitative information and was more expansive on quantitative statements within each category.

        "description":"Alcohol use and abuse has received extensive attention, with recent concerns focused on the use and abuse of alcohol by adolescents and young adults. Alcohol use has become one of the major rituals in the rites of passage from childhood to adulthood. Anthropologists have documented the importance of rites of passage rituals for marking the successful passage from one position in a social structure to another. Rites of passage include the three phases of separation, transition, and reaggregation. There are many rituals, some formalized and common throughout this culture and others common within certain subcultures and ethnic groups and still others less formal or only practiced within certain subgroups. This culture has had a tendency to decrease the observation of rites of  passage rituals. Sanctioned initiation rituals can provide increased satisfaction, dedication and persistence among students completing their education, and can also benefit the system by reducing the number of unsanctioned, dangerous, addictive rituals that are required of new students by upperclass students. The challenge is to help young people find or devise appropriate and rigorous rituals that will permit youth to demonstrate and to prove their worthiness to be considered and accepted as members of new groups without resorting to dangerously addictive and permanently debilitating ritual activities. Appropriately sanctioned passage rites offer a viable and constructive alternative to accomplish this challenge. (ABL)",

Although teenage pregnancy rates leveled off during the 1980s, the fraction of births to unmarried women doubled, increasing the prevalence of problems associated with young motherhood. A young mother has three potential sources of private income: her parents and other relatives; her husband or the father of her children; and her own earnings. Young mothers are likely to be poor during the first few years after they have children,  particularly those who are unmarried and living with only their children. Federal policies addressing the problems associated with adolescent motherhood might follow two approaches: policies to reduce the incidence of births to teenagers, thus avoiding the problems; and policies to increase the resources of young mothers. Because the problems faced by teenage mothers are complex and interrelated, a wide range of policies would probably be required to address them. (ABL)",

        "description":"This book is written for faculty and student affairs professionals. Its goal is to assist these professionals in helping students learn to set their own directions, while knowing how and where to get help at all stages. Two premises underlie the book: that students often do not make optimal use of their colleges because they are not acquainted with the underlying principles of academic life; and that the tasks of working through the academic structure, planning a satisfying undergraduate education, and learning how to use academic resources are developmental processes that can make college a rewarding experience. The two major objectives of the book are to use students' needs as the focal point for demonstrating how academic and student affairs issues are wedded and to present a  scheme for teaching students self-advising skills and strategies. Chapter 1 discusses an intersection for academic and student affairs; chapter 2 describes the common ground underlying these two sectors. Chapters 3 through 7 each consist of two parts, one presenting conceptual and practical approaches to a problem area and the second consisting of relevant short essays. Chapters 3 through 7 deal with: The Myth of the Academic Major (chapter 3); Making Resources Visible (chapter 4); Some Basic Job Search Strategies (chapter 5); Schooling Beyond the Bachelor's Degree: Fact and Fiction (chapter 6); and A Primer on Counseling Skills: Identifying, Helping, and Referring Troubled Students (chapter 7).

It begins with a self-assessment of supervision-related skills, then proceeds  to an assessment of the supervisee, establishing goals and a contract, choosing interventions, dealing with process, issues, considering legal and ethical concerns, and evaluating the supervisee. A final section helps supervisors evaluate their own development and performance. An epilogue summarizes literature on the beginning supervisor and describes instructional approaches for the instructor/supervisor of novice supervisors. Individual chapters focus on: (1) assessing supervision knowledge and skills; (2) initial supervisory sessions; (3) supervision goals; (4) choosing and implementing supervision interventions; (5) supervisory relationships and process issues; (6) supervisee evaluation; (7) ethical and legal considerations; and (8) supervisor evaluation.

Fast learners may find the content exceptionally easy to read, thus learning does not become the challenge it should be. Slow learners may find the content too difficult to comprehend. There are a variety of informal and formal ways for teachers to determine the reading levels of their pupils. The classroom teacher needs to think of diverse ways to help students achieve as much as their capabilities permit. Too frequently, teachers emphasize obtaining facts in reading content in the social studies. However, students need to move to more complex levels of cognition. For each unit in social studies, an adequate supply of books should be  available for pupil choice at a reading center. Early primary grade pupils can have interesting, realistic experiences through the taking of excursions with teacher leadership. Teachers should think of various approaches that can be used to help slow learners and gifted and talented learners achieve to their optimum in the area of reading in the social studies.

Reading comprehension is so complex that it defies any attempt to arrive at a single definition. S. Toulmin's argument structure model provides the basis for an analysis of the connection between critical reading and reading comprehension. The framework allows for the delineation of the crucial function served by background knowledge in the formulation of interpretations of written discourse. An expansion of the basic model provides a hierarchical structure in order to accommodate embedded arguments typical of natural discourse. T. A. Van Dijk's notion of a superstructure and his articulation of operative mental processes in the form of macrorules  offer a meaningful way of connecting the psychological perspective on reading comprehension based on schema theory and the philosophical perspective on reading comprehension based on Toulmin's argument structure analysis. A method now needs to be developed through which texts of moderate length can be systematically analyzed. (MG)",

        "description":"This study controlled the gender context of sentence cues containing nouns and pronouns and asked children to draw pictures depicting the situations described in them. Subjects were 220 elementary students from the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. Each child drew responses to cues for only one form. The experimenter allowed them 4 minutes per cue to draw a picture of what the child imagined the cue to describe and to name each figure in the drawing. Results indicated that for some of the cues, children drew more male figures in response to the noun &quot;man&quot; than in response to either &quot;individual(s)&quot; or &quot;people.&quot; Further analysis also indicated that boys and girls make qualitatively different responses to the cues. Boys drew more male figures than girls and drew more male figures in  general. Girls drew more mixed-sex groups and females than boys and drew more of such pictures in general. Future studies on this topic should be cautious not only about the sex of the nouns/pronouns in the cues, but about the sex bias of the context in which these nouns/pronouns are presented.

        "description":"This two-year pilot study examined the effectiveness of whole language on the literacy development of selected at-risk children, comparing the performance of nearly 100 first and second graders in whole language and traditional classrooms. Findings showed that children from the whole language classrooms performed as well as their counterparts from traditional classes on standardized achievement tests in reading. Informal, qualitative measures of literacy development indicated that, compared to children in traditional classrooms, children from the whole language classrooms: (1) read for meaning better, corrected more of their mistakes, and retold more fully the stories they read; (2) wrote so much that they did as well or better than their traditional counterparts on spelling,  with little or no direct instruction in spelling; (3) appeared more confident in their reading; and (4) appeared to possess a wider variety of strategies related to reading. The study concluded that children in the whole language classrooms appeared to feel better about themselves as readers, writers, and learners; seemed to know more about the reading process, and appeared to learn the mechanics of reading and writing as well as or better than their traditional counterparts without high levels of direct skill and drill instruction; and appeared to be on their way to becoming more independent learners than the children in the traditional program. Thus, the study concluded that whole language (in the hands of trained and committed teachers) appears to be a viable alternative to traditional  instruction for young children at-risk.

The paper briefly discusses the eight steps involved in this strategy: (1) motivate the children so they will eagerly anticipate the lesson; (2) introduce special vocabulary in the song; (3) set a purpose for the children to read/sing the words of the song; (4) read the song's words and sing the song; (5) ask questions pertaining to the song; (6) sing the song again; (7) incorporate skills/strategies into the lesson; and (8) extend/enrich the lesson.

The report assumes a constructivist view of both reading comprehension and social discourse. Thus, it views the &quot;teacher as a text&quot; and suggests that students build a model of meaning for the classroom instruction they encounter. The report closes with a set of nine rules of thumb for guiding the development of comprehension, including the following: (1) good reading strategies are as adaptable as they are intentional; (2) good reading instruction depends upon the creation of an environment that continually portrays the  usefulness and value of reading; and (3) both reading comprehension and comprehension instruction are highly interactive and reciprocal. One table illustrating the interactive view of reading comprehension is included; 149 references are attached. (Author/RS)",

Six schools in two school districts in a southwestern urban area were selected for intensive study; 39 teachers of grades 4-6 participated. The report also developed and tested a school-based staff development process designed to change teachers' practices in reading comprehension instruction. Chapters of the study are titled: (1) &quot;Introduction and Rationale&quot;; (2) &quot;Research Methodology and Site&quot;; (3) &quot;Research-Based Teaching of Reading Practices&quot;; (4) &quot;Teachers' Reading Comprehension Instructional Practices&quot;; (5) &quot;Teacher Beliefs and the School Context: Factors Affecting  Teachers' Use of Research-Based Practices&quot;; (6) &quot;The Staff Development Process and its Effects&quot;; (7) &quot;Implications of the Staff Development Program for Student Learning&quot;; and (8) Conclusions.&quot; The report concludes that research should provide practitioners not just with findings in the form of activities or behaviors that &quot;work,&quot; but ways of thinking and empirical premises related to teaching and learning. The report also concludes that opportunities should be created to allow teachers to interact and maintain conversations around standards, theory, and classroom activity. Sixteen pages of references are attached; extensive figures and tables of data are included. The appendixes include a six-page list of syntheses and reviews of comprehension teaching practices; an outline of reading  comprehension practices researched in the literature; evaluation instruments, survey instruments, and interview questions; and detailed case studies of five schools where research was conducted.

Surveys indicated that (1) faculty and students developed good working and personal relationships; (2) faculty and students believed the study skills portion of the course to be helpful; (3) faculty felt students profited the most from essay writing instruction; (4) students felt reading and highlighting notes and textbooks  were the most beneficial skills; (5) instruction in time management was needed; (6) instruction in making study guides was needed; (7) knowledge and ability to function independently with encouragement and suggestions in forming their own study habits and thinking skills should be acquired by freshmen during the course; (8) a &quot;spoon feeding&quot; atmosphere should be avoided; and (9) more freshmen tend to drop out of college during the first semester than the second, and therefore, surveying those students would give information to advisors to help freshmen adjust better to college life.

Principals can provide such support by working cooperatively with teachers during every phase of implementation. The following guidelines are suggestions that can be added to individuals' repertoires and used when needed: (1) form study groups for the purpose of sharing information; (2) develop a firm belief in emerging literacy; (3) treat independent reading as an important activity rather than as a frill; (4) encourage the teaching of vocabulary through reading immersion; (5) support teachers' demonstration activities that reinforce the role of context  for expanding word knowledge; and (6) focus on informal evaluation that is well-matched with instruction. These guidelines are only a sampling of the many ways in which educational leaders and teachers can take risks while they promote worthwhile strategies and activities for children.

The program, now in its fourth year, helps to upgrade the language and math skills of academically and emotionally unprepared students. Students are admitted to the program only if they are in a degree program and exhibit motivation for learning in a pre-enrollment interview. During the fall semester AFY offers two sections each of math and language for non-credit, and during the second semester the classes remain relatively intact when the courses become credit bearing. The initial focus in language sections is on study skills including learning styles, motivation, study habits, note-taking, SQ3R, and  test-taking. Students begin journal writing from day one and practice reading skills, the writing process, and word processing. Students also receive additional support in a weekly one-hour lab which supplements classroom instruction and provides them an opportunity to experiment with some strategies and skills in a non-threatening environment. Weekly conferences with students are also held outside of class with each student to monitor individual progress. Finally, counselors address each class four or five times each semester to provide \"survival tips,\" and former AFY students serve as mentors and class-link tutors by leading essay workshops and presenting role models of success.

Results revealed that the average percentage of material devoted to invention was 11%, the lowest percentage in an individual text was 1% and the highest was 32%. The standard pattern for the low-percentage text was to discuss invention in a short section at the front of the book, with subsequent sections devoted to concerns of arrangement and style. The higher-percentage texts were not as likely to be dominated by a strict invention/arrangement/style format. A representative pattern in these texts was a general discussion of invention, arrangement, and style in the front of the book, followed by chapters on  different types of papers or rhetorical situations, chapters which included a more specific discussion of invention. Results also revealed varied distribution of formal and informal methods for three main categories of invention activity including observation, intuition, and collaboration. Findings suggest that information about invention can help influence pedagogical methods in college writing instruction. (An appendix listing the 27 texts previewed is attached.) (KEH)",

The most important reason to use literature has to do with its usefulness as a source of inspiration. To build the students' confidence, teachers need to involve them in reading that elicits powerful, often very personal, reactions to written language. One way to use literature as a springboard for creative efforts is by asking students to keep a journal in which they can record responses to brief writing prompts designed to help them improve their understanding of literature. The instructor must choose selections that are  accessible to the student both in vocabulary and in subject matter. The objective is not to introduce students to the study of literature, to important cultural phenomena in the canon, or even to new vocabulary. It is to foster their growth as writers. Instructors must also prepare their classes somewhat differently and perhaps more carefully when using literature as a springboard for developmental writers. (MG)",

        "description":"One researcher found that the most productive collaborative learning approach has at its core a communally evolved metalanguage to generate and maintain ongoing dialogue among students and between students and their teacher. A shared metadiscourse about writing was established in the classroom by working in small groups to determine qualities of good writing and then shape them into a statement that would be meaningful and agreeable to all. Creating group histories increased student autonomy and commitment by permitting students to determine their own goals, make decisions about achieving them, and reflect upon their success. Creating questions to initiate group discussion for each draft helped reveal students' heightened awareness of the kinds of questions that will provoke the  assistance they require. Students wrote journals after each collaborative session to react to the group discussion. Each composition handed in for teacher reading is accompanied by a letter of transmittal that gives the following information: goals for the composition; how the group helped the student to achieve these goals; risks taken or features of the writing that especially please the student; and direction on how the teacher should read and respond to the paper. This triple-tiered pedagogical approach (whole class, small group, and student-teacher) is intended primarily as a mechanism to enable students to take more charge over their writing goals, processes, and valuations. For students to gain autonomy as true student collaborators rather than as teacher-directed peer groups,  collaboration needs to be an integral part of learning and writing in every class period.

Data were gathered from course syllabi, assignment handouts, and semesterly reports of faculty members teaching 27 WAC courses in natural sciences and engineering. Results revealed that 12 courses did not use a single process approach practice, seven courses used one, six courses used two, and two courses used three practices. Instructors of these WAC courses ignored many opportunities to blend process approach practices into their courses. Revising and sequencing of assignments were the  two most frequently used practices while journal writing and peer critiquing were the least used. Results also revealed that the focus in these WAC courses was on quantity of writing (based on a predicted word count) that could be accomplished during a semester rather than on current practices to writing pedagogy. Findings suggest that the expectation placed on interdisciplinary faculty, who are largely unaware of the current composition research and pedagogy, to teach writing appears to be rather unrealistic.

The project was based on the idea that the language arts--listening, reading, writing, and speaking--should be integrated and that many subject areas could be incorporated into any well planned language arts block. Included in the process was the incorporation of computer use, specifically the use of LOGO, a computer programing language, and word processing. Each teacher education student was assigned two or three children at the fourth or fifth grade level. Each group remained together throughout the six practicum sessions. Two basal stories served as the springboard into the other  requirements, all of which had to fit into a modified directed reading activity format. The following steps of a modified directed reading activity were used by the teacher education students: motivation; vocabulary instruction; purpose for reading; silent reading; questioning; purposeful oral reading; skills/strategies; and extension. The students had to show evidence of working through a five-step writing process which included: prewriting, drafting, revising, editing, and sharing. Results indicated that the children were developing their writing, computing, and critical thinking skills, while learning to work cooperatively and improving self-esteem. The teacher education students found that using the computer in this way enhanced the directed reading approach, the language experience  approach, and the writing process. Additionally, the teacher education students actively learned how to teach in a natural, holistic, and diagnostic way. (MG)",

One of its major themes was that children's understanding of words is best understood from the perspective of developing sensitivities to the English language. A second major theme is that acquisition of word identification skills and vocabulary knowledge centers on discovery of the regularity of the language. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were examined. The literature on word identification and vocabulary development stems from different theoretical and methodological orientations and so the studies need to be considered illustrative. Nevertheless, it appears that the patterns of findings support several important instructional implications. Instructional  activities ought to take place in informal as well as formal settings, provide a broad rather than narrow focus, and engage children in a variety of activities. Instruction must also be carefully tuned to draw from and extend children's existing knowledge. (Author/SR)",

        "description":"A study investigated the impact of task definition on students' revising strategies to determine whether college freshman writers could revise globally if instructed to do so and if those global revisions would result in improved texts. Data were elicited from 38 students enrolled in two entry-level college writing courses. Participants, randomly assigned into two groups, were asked to revise a text evidencing both global problems such as poor organization and poor adaption to audience concerns and local problems such as errors in spelling, punctuation, diction, and agreement. One group was given eight minutes of instruction on how to revise globally, and the other was simply asked to make the text better. Results revealed that the texts written by students who received the  instruction were significantly better in quality and included significantly more global revision. Results also revealed that the improvement affected the treated population generally rather than just a small part of that population. Findings suggest that the change in task definition allowed students to tap revision skills that they already had available.

Teachers maintained extensive records of their instruction and also corresponded with the professor via dialogue journals. A study examined these instructional records and dialogue journals to understand teacher use of dialogue journals, the relationship between journal entries and instructional patterns, and the influence of the university educator on teacher change. Results revealed a number of patterns, including the following: (1) teachers had distinctive response styles (narrative and intertextual) that were consistent over the 5 weeks (interaction with the professor did not seem to  affect this style); (2) teachers with a narrative response style tended to want to &quot;fix&quot; a child's problems, while teachers with an intertextual response style tended to focus on understanding a child as learner; and (3) teachers with an intertextual response style wrote more about their own learning and reported that they knew more about teaching and learning as a result of the course.

Five midwestern school districts--four public school districts and one Catholic diocese--participated in the study. Data consisted of interviews with school staff, school records, and student survey questionnaires. Results indicated that although student performance affected placement in all districts, four of the five relied heavily on past ability-group placements in assigning students for ninth-grade English. This practice tends to limit opportunities for upward mobility for students outside the honors level. Results also indicated that although students and parents have formal control over the assignment process, only one district  showed any evidence of this control being exercised.

Children comprehended this play by remembering central dramatic actions and by accurately sequencing the plot's main events. Few children made metaphoric connections from the play's concepts to the world at large, although almost half grasped the main motive, and two-thirds accurately inferred  emotions in spite of masks, puppets, and animal make-up. Over half the children reported learning the concept of trusting oneself or good moral behaviors. Children appeared to have both watched and listened to this play by relying equally on the use of visual, verbal/aural, or psychological/contextual cues as bases for their inferences. The more they used visual cues (primarily dramatic actions), the more they also used verbal/aural cues and psychological cues. (Ten tables of data are included, and 32 references are attached.

A student-run ad agency provides students with a total learning experience on a small advertising agency scale in line with what they are likely to experience in their first jobs. As a course, such an agency yields benefits for both students and instructors. One such course, called &quot;Creative Services Workshop,&quot; functions as part of an advertising sequence within a journalism department in a major northeastern university. To enroll in this elective course, typically taken during the senior year, students must receive the instructor's permission. The workshop has its own three-room space which looks  and functions like an agency. The majority of clients come from the Small Business Development Center, a division of the School of Business. Students are assigned to specific jobs within the agency and organized into teams of three to five people. The first third of the semester is usually taken up with organizational start-up activities, and the remaining two-thirds are devoted to getting the work done by the semester's end. Grading is accomplished by instructor/graduate assistant evaluations and by peer evaluations. Working in the context of a small agency allows students the opportunity to witness and experience the various functions and roles inherent to the advertising agency business, provides students with portfolio material, and holds them accountable for their work in a  real-world situation.

The relationship between rhetorical texts and historical contexts was a sustained theme throughout the course. Five major critical methodologies, including situational, argument, neo-Aristotelian, genre, and dramatistic perspectives were used to explore the rhetoric of women's suffrage. Additionally, students gained insight into historical context by conducting textual analyses.  Emphasis was placed on locating and reading original texts and doing close textual analyses as a means of comprehending historical periods.

The stages of the conservative reform movement include the appearance of &quot;careerism&quot; in the early 1970s; the &quot;literacy crisis&quot; beginning in 1975; and the publication of &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot; in 1983. Critical thinking, for the conservative, represents the fourth phase of educational restoration. Yet, critical thinking can also serve the radical position by providing students with the tools to affect changes on an imperfect society. Four &quot;right-headed&quot; suggestions for using critical thinking include: (1) re-endorsing the student-centered classroom; (2) employing  the concepts of classical rhetoric to dispel the myths of inviolate texts and encouraging students to question; (3) engaging students in the socio- and psycho-linguistic nuances of language; and (4) helping students develop the logical abilities which will allow them to become active contributors to social and political processes.

Most basic courses tend to be behaviorally focused in applying knowledge to behavior and integrating that knowledge into students' life-long repertoires, but these courses neglect the methods of thinking characteristic of the discipline. Basic courses should be structured so as to help students understand how professionals in the discipline understand their methods. How professionals study must be the focus, not just what is studied. To teach such  a course, educators need to become more aware of their own way of proceeding that may be largely intuitive or only tacitly understood. Furthermore, students need to be challenged to identify and understand their own &quot;logic-in-use&quot; and the different interpretations resulting from its application.

Other notable advances are evident in curriculum design, development in assessment criteria, improved contacts with professional associations in education, and integration of the language arts. One area with only minor progress is the problem of definitions, evidenced by inconsistent definitions of communication skills at the state, district, and local levels.

        "description":"One of the thorniest problems facing teachers of public address and other speech performance courses concerns students' reticence in classroom criticism and discussion of fellow students' performance. Many teachers believe that discussing the speeches in class provides valuable feedback to the speaker and helps foster critical thinking skills in the audience members. The following suggestions can help students feel more comfortable with the concept of public criticism: (1) have students discuss the video-taped speeches of strangers before discussing one another's presentations; (2) announce that comments made in class will not affect the speaker's grade; (3) explain to students that honest criticism is an act of friendship; (4) explain that the most helpful comments are&quot;constructive&quot;; (5) the better students know one another the more they will offer critical comments; (6) ask a class &quot;What was good about this speech?&quot; rather than asking &quot;What was wrong?&quot;; (7) consider assigning specific listening roles; (8) explain that positive comments are also examples of &quot;criticism&quot;; (9) emphasize that criticizing the speech is not criticizing the person; (10) allow speakers the option of not having their speeches discussed; and (11) ask specific rather than general questions. Finally, when teachers make comments, they should consider whether to make them in private or in class, and bring up only as much as the student can manage at one time. Throughout, students should be left with the impression that speaking well is not beyond their abilities but, rather, is a  skill which they can master. (SR)",

Data were gathered from votech teachers, craft committee members (tradespersons advising votech school faculty and administration), co-op employers, and senior votech students, all associated with the Erie County Technical School (Pennsylvania). Respondents were asked to compare the relative importance of data, people, and things (categories described in the federal government's &quot;Dictionary of Occupation Titles&quot;) by assigning percentages to them or by rating them on a one-to-five scale. Results revealed that the &quot;people&quot; category and oral  communication skills were collectively considered as highly important to students' future job success. Results also revealed that votech teachers reported significantly less actual classroom attention to oral communication skills (only 32%) than indicated in their statements of its importance, and home school English teachers devoted only 24% of their time to teaching oral communication. Based on these findings, a workshop was conducted to sensitize home school English teachers to the particular nature of vocational education and the need for more direct teaching of oral communication to prepare students for the work environment.

Ethical values education should be integrated throughout the curriculum of higher education in general and communication education in particular to encourage cultural diversity and pluralism. Specific ethical values can easily be stated in the syllabus, as numerous values are implicit in each discipline, and explained very early in the course. Case studies, writing and speaking assignments, and discussion questions could be used to provoke students' thinking about ethical issues. Additionally, reading lists that reflect a variety of ethical points of view can be used to  complement the values of students and instructors and sharpen the analytical skills of both faculty and students. Finally, every university faculty member should receive training in values-added instruction as an aid in design and implementation.

Results  revealed strong support for this aid from a significant majority of consultants and instructors. Both groups perceived that instructors, consultants, and students benefited greatly from the experience. Results also revealed overall agreement among faculty and consultants as to what constitutes ethical and unethical consultant behavior.

Subjects were 306 undergraduates enrolled in the basic public speaking course at a midwestern university during the 1988-1989 academic year. Situational factors tested were task difficulty, ambiguity reduction, acquaintance level, evaluation potential, familiarity, and stimulus duration. These factors were tested by manipulating the instructional format through which the initial public speaking assignment was structured. Results indicated support for several of the situational factors. It was demonstrated that speaking before half the class aroused less anxiety than speaking before the entire class,  while a personal experience speech resulted in lower reported anxiety than the evidence speech. Speaking last on the assigned day also aroused less anxiety than speaking first, while a random speaking order and a speaking limit of 5 minutes each resulted in lower anxiety than the exact order and the 10-minute limit. Collectively, findings suggest that select interventions reduce public speaking anxiety of students enrolled in a basic public speaking class regardless of their prior communication apprehension level.

Choice must not be limited to the affluent; it is most needed by financially poor parents whose children are trapped in the most inferior schools. The chief opponents of many statewide choice schemes have been the education establishment fighting to protect its monopoly and job security. Since competition among schools boosts student performance, choice will actually restore respect for teaching. Principal school choice options include magnet schools, open enrollment, tuition tax credits, vouchers, and home schooling. The first two options normally confine choice to public schools, whereas tax  credits and vouchers extend freedom of choice to private schools. Although business leaders and many governors are strongly backing choice, critics claim that widespread freedom of choice would turn inner-city schools into dumping grounds for the very poor and hard-to-educate. This contention is refuted soundly by the East Harlem (New York) experience. When choice was adopted there, two schools failing to attract students were closed and later reopened with new staff and programs. The Bush administration should take its cue from choice proponents across America who have overcome educational establishment opposition and introduced competition and accountability into the school system.

A conference, attended by more than 1,100 educators and other interested people, discussed the mission of the schools and made recommendations on how best to realize that mission. Following the keynote address by Robert R. Spillane defining the issues and purposes of the conference, the following papers were presented: (1) \"Literacy and the Nation\" (E. D. Hirsch, Jr.); (2) \"Reaction to E. D. Hirsch\" (William R. Raspberry); (3) \"Reaction to E.D. Hirsch\" (Solomon Lausch); (4) \"Ensuring That Schools Achieve Their  Mission: A National Perspective\" (Paul Simon); (5) \"Ensuring That Schools Achieve Their Mission: A State Perspective\" (John Murphy); (6) \"Supporting the Mission of the Schools in the Schools of the Future\" (Marvin Cetron); (7) \"How To Achieve the Academic Mission of the Schools for All Students\" (Ruth Love); (8) \"Teaching To Increase the Academic Emphasis for All Students\" (John L. Hynes); (9) \"Teaching To Increase the Academic Emphasis for All Students\" (Karen Simpson); (10) \"Academic Disciplines as the Basis for the School Curriculum\" (Graham Down); and (11) \"What We Have Accomplished and Where We Go from Here\" (Floretta McKenzie). Two reports of group discussions are also included, one following the presentation by, and responses to E. D. Hirsch, Jr., and one just preceding Floretta  McKenzie's wrap-up address. (AA)",

Research objectives included: (1) to identify content characteristics of episodes documented by teachers who were asked to document events in their professional lives; (2) to identify linguistic styles of documented episodes, such as rhetorical sequence and level of involvement; (3) to disclose ways in which documented professional episodes may serve the process of school based  professional development of teachers; and (4) to create instances of authentic professional \"cases\" for use in teacher education programs. Findings indicate that analysis of shared experiences contributes to professional growth of teachers by providing resources for self-evaluation and reflection and intercollegial problem solving.

Addressed to both trainers and practitioners, this three-part handbook stresses the development of training competencies, including training materials. To introduce trainers to the educational management scene in Asia and the Pacific, part A discusses some general issues, such as the role of educational planners and administrators, the importance of training in improving educational management, available training opportunities, and appropriate training contexts. This part also provides a country-by-country account of the training facilities  and systems in Asia and the Pacific region for training educational managers. issues and concerns. The six chapters in part B discuss various aspects of planning and organizing training, including strategies, techniques of identifying training needs, modular curriculum development, methods of classifying training modalities, training institute organization, and techniques for evaluating training. Part C presents several effective methods for training administrators. Recognizing the serious limitations of the lecture method, the nine chapters in this section explore alternatives such as self-instruction materials, simulation exercises and games, in-basket exercises, and case method, role playing, field training, self-study and small group work, instrumented training, and distance training.

A study was done to review the program for school districts affected by federal activities. Data were collected from a random sample of 58 of the 178 unfunded Department of Education projects from fiscal year 1988. Department records show that as of fiscal year 1988, the estimated funding gap was about $200 million. The Department's criteria for computing priority numbers of eligible projects and ranking projects are equitable, but the Department does not  periodically reevaluate these scores once projects are ranked on waiting lists. It is recommended that: (1) Congress amend Public Law 81-815 to require that school construction payments to eligible districts be based on average state per pupil construction costs; and (2) that the Secretary of Education require school districts to apply annually for school construction aid to ensure that project requests reflect current data. It is further suggested that Congress might want to consider authorizing the Secretary of Education to distribute appropriations among a greater number of projects. (MLF)",

If the Office of Management and Budget projects a deficit in excess of the target amount plus $10 billion, the President must issue a sequester order to reduce budget resources sufficiently to reach the target deficit level. The fiscal year 1990 sequester reduced the Department of Education's budgetary resources by $266.1 million, or 1.1 percent of its $24.5 billion budget authority for the year. Department officials believe the sequester's overall impact was minimal. After the sequester, the Department's funding was 5.1 percent higher than in fiscal year 1989. The greatest negative impact was reported in two departmental  accounts that experienced funding difficulties beyond those created by the sequester: Program Administration and Office for Civil Rights.

        "description":"To provide for its public education system, the state of Pennsylvania pays an Equalized Subsidy for Basic Education (ESBE) to school districts. More than 85 percent of the basic ESBE is distributed inversely to districts on the basis of their wealth. The rest of the ESBE is comprised of numerous supplements addressing the particular needs of certain types of districts, such as small districts and those with many families receiving welfare payments. Although the subsidy is intended to equalize resources among school districts of varying wealth, instructional expenditures across the state vary widely. The wealthiest 100 school districts spent an average of $4,210 per pupil in 1988-89, and the least affluent 100 school districts spent an average of $2,729. There are two explanations  for this wide variation in spending patterns: the unwillingness-to-spend hypothesis and the inability-to-fund hypothesis. The study summarized in this report tests these hypotheses by examining the equity (across wealth groupings) of the current educational subsidy system and various alternative subsidy proposals. Using groups of 100 school districts, data from all 500 operating school districts were analyzed. According to numerous equity measures, it was found that the current system maintains the unequal distribution of instructional resources across wealth groupings. A base guarantee system with no minimum subsidy for school districts would provide the greatest degree of equity at current spending levels. Included are numerous graphs and two appendices providing comparison data and  methodology analysis. (MLH)",

Project results indicate that the role of the network broker is crucial for network operation and that FAX technology is the medium of choice for a network involving school principals. More significantly, it was determined that most principals' work patterns are generally incompatible with the requirements of membership in an electronic network.

Section 3 provides a summary of the salary schedule and some demographic data for a majority of the AFT's large locals for the 1989-90 school year. Section 4 briefly describes more than 200 contract settlements or wage agreement, each involving at least 1,000 workers, and concludes with salary information from locals that have already negotiated salary schedules for fall 1990 and later years. Twelve figures and 21 tables supplement the text, and 3 appendixes supply population and enrollment figures and a list of data sources grouped by table. (MLF)",

Data include national average salaries or earnings for teachers, other school employees, government workers, and professional employees over the past 25 years. Beginning salaries for teachers and other college graduates over the past 15 years are reported. The AFT's survey of state departments of education also asked states to provide information on actual beginning salaries, experienced teachers reentering the classroom, and retirement rates. Comparisons with the various tables can be developed to suit the purposes of a particular local or state federation. The report is  organized in four sections. The first section focuses on state comparisons; the second highlights trends in national averages; the third focuses on beginning teachers, with supplemental information on experienced teachers reentering the profession and teacher retirement; and the fourth presents an international comparison concerning public spending on education and some international teacher salary data. The text is accompanied by 21 figures, 22 tables, and 5 maps, and 2 appendixes provide education data by state for 1988-1989 and 1989-1990 and a list of data sources referenced by table. (MLF)",

        "description":"In this digest, readers are introduced to the scope of instructional program evaluation and evaluators' changing roles in school districts. A program evaluation measures outcomes based on student-attainment goals, implementation levels, and external factors such as budgetary restraints and community support. Instructional program evaluation may be formative, summative, or &quot;ex post facto.&quot; Although standardized testing is widespread, some evaluators use alternative methods to measure student attainment, such as standardized interviews, direct tests (reading and math demonstrations), and students' notes, art work, and other material. Others suggest using a program evaluation profile that reveals less tangible values. Community and school board input can significantly affect program  evaluation, as four recent studies show. Although principals generally feel that evaluation benefits are minimal, superintendents tend to be more positive about program evaluation. The job of program evaluator is expanding from technical roles to political and advisory roles. In some innovative programs at the research and development stage, evaluators help identify goals and develop implementation strategies. Evaluators also translate policy questions developed by school boards and legislators into the more precise questions of program evaluation. In this new role, evaluators help fashion innovative programs with readily measurable features and become effective partners at all stages of program development. (Eight references) (MLH)",

        "description":"Although it is relatively simple to check on applicants' basic professional competency, ensuring the moral competency of potential school employees is much more difficult. This digest examines major legal issues, district liabilities and responsibilities, suggested guidelines, and information sources involving employee background checks. Of more than 230,000 cases of child abuse in 1984, only about 200 involved school employees. Many lawmakers and educators favor applicant privacy rights, while others point to the potential for harmful behaviors besides child abuse. District size seems a major determinant of schools' screening practices. Whereas smaller districts rely more on references and informal sources, larger systems tend to use bureaucratized procedures and allow employees  to start working before all checking is concluded. &quot;Wrongful discharge&quot; is also a major issue. Background checks are subject to twin problems: &quot;saying too much&quot; (risking defamation charges) and &quot;asking too little&quot; (risking a negligent hiring charge). Many states have mandatory FBI checks; some require fingerprint checks of all school applicants. Districts can also check local police records and state registries of known child abusers and must use careful documentation. The American Association of School Administrators and the National Association of State Boards of Education have prepared some helpful guidelines. The Teacher Identification Clearinghouse and a comprehensive handbook, &quot;The Guide to Background Investigation&quot; (Richard Long, 1989) are suggested resources. (Five references)  (MLH)",

        "description":"Research has provided an increasing amount of information about the work-related behaviors associated with effective school administrator practices. Considerably less is known about the factors that bring individuals to pursue school leadership positions and enroll in principal preparation programs. The focus of this paper is research on the factors influencing the socialization experiences of 87 aspiring and incumbent principals prior to and during their participation in the Northwest Territories Principal Certification Program. Analysis of responses to survey questions identified 12 factors as influences on the candidates' decision to pursue training for the principalship. The following four factors were most strongly represented: skill development; pursuit of knowledge; &quot;step  in the career ladder&quot;; and &quot;desire to broaden or gain perspective.&quot; Findings indicate that relationships with subordinates, peers, and subordinates, were not strong influences on decisions to pursue a principalship or seek training; on the other hand, once a decision to pursue training has been made, the data suggest that the actual choice of a training program can be significantly influenced by others. In the case of the Northwest Territories program, the steady encouragement provided by regional officials and incumbent principals to their subordinates appears to have had a positive impact, as did also the perceived quality of the program as reported by participants. However, preliminary results suggest that the socializing factors which most significantly influenced decisions to pursue  both the principalship and training were those motivators derived from the individual's inner processes.

Micropolitical theory, with a focus on language, is utilized to understand administrators' knowledge of the assumptive worlds of their subculture, and how these assumptive worlds constrain and limit conflict. Interviews with 20 assistant principals and onsite observations of their schools identified four domains of site-level assumptive worlds: (1) the right and responsibility to initiate; (2) acceptable and unacceptable values; (3) patterns of unexpected and sanctionable behavior; and (4) special conditions management. Assumptive worlds create in administrators the following characteristics: avoidance of value conflict  and risky change, defensiveness, and belief in a \"one best system.\" A conclusion is that assumptive worlds function to reduce inherent dilemmas by confining values and behaviors to acceptable domains. An implication is that reform efforts and administrator education programs will encounter administrator resistance when mandated in ways that disrupt assumptive worlds and must therefore consider political behavior.

        "description":"Since 1976 the U.S. Department of Education has helped fund 60 education policies by state legislatures. These competitive matching grants, or cost-sharing awards, have laid the groundwork for significant education reforms. This report seeks to advance information-sharing among state legislatures and between policy makers and researchers. The report contains a list of 27 cost-sharing awards funded between 1983-86 and presents 4 case studies highlighting important issues confronting state legislatures today and illustrating the different methods that legislatures use to define issues and employ research in making changes in state education policies. In 1983, Tennessee's General Assembly was stalemated over the controversial issue of rewarding teachers with higher salaries.  Finally, a Select Committee on Education used a cost-sharing award to commission papers from education researchers and provide expert testimony. The committee then drafted a bill underlying the state's landmark career ladder law. In 1985, the Maine Legislature used a cost-sharing award to conduct its own field research project on teachers' decisions to stay in the classroom or leave teaching. As a result, the legislature can deal realistically with teacher supply and demand by relying on state data. The two other case studies involve a Washington State higher education funding formula research project and a South Carolina project to monitor the progress of recent educational reform efforts.

        "description":"This study analyzes the ways in which school boards assess and utilize evaluation data and their attitudes toward testing. Interviews with 27 school board members from 10 districts indicate that board members tend to rely on informal working knowledge over formal information, and on district administrators' judgments. Findings suggest that simple changes in data reporting, such as inclusion of executive summaries and clear graphic displays, will improve clarity and usefulness. However, members' lack of familiarity with basic research principles, reliance on experiential-based knowledge, and preoccupation with administrative concerns suggests that improving data quality and usefulness will have a marginal impact on educational quality. A conclusion is that the technical problems  of providing reasonable, useable data are tractable, and that feasible solutions can be found; however, if they are to have an impact on educational quality, larger sociopolitical issues must be addressed. Appendices contain the interview guide, three graphs, and seven tables. (4 references) (LMI)",

This report represents a critical summary of case studies conducted in seven states: California, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. Government and university policy analysts from each of the seven states reviewed specific policies, statutes, legislative actions, and regulatory codes aimed at the principalship and interviewed 15 principals in each state. Seven state teams looked at personnel management, curriculum and instruction, and children and youth policies to see how they directed principals' work. Essentially,  these teams explored what state policy has to say about principal preparation, career development, employment, and performance assessment. Three issues emerge as particularly critical and significant: (1) the most direct and influential state policy approach to school leadership is in the area of entrance standards and procedures; (2) there is a need to define roles and responsibilities clearly for the school principal; and (3) recent efforts at educational reform have yet to provide new concepts of the school principalship.

Student evaluation activity is examined at the following levels: province, district, school, department, and classroom. Methodology involves analysis of documents from four elementary and four secondary schools in two British Columbian districts, one urban and one rural, and interviews with representatives from each educational level. Similarities between current policies and the devolution model are provision of general policy direction and the generation of policies and procedures unique to each level. However, findings indicate a lack of policy statements based on an evaluation philosophy and an emphasis on reporting  achievement results. A conclusion is that student and program evaluation is difficult in situations where standardized reporting formats of comparable achievement are entrenched and mandated. This situation creates a discrepancy between the goal of individual learning and the policies and procedures devised and enforced to report that learning. Three statistical tables are included.

Four curriculum components are identified: basic skills subjects, separate subjects, integrated topics, and additional programs. A conclusion is that the school curriculum structure represents a genuine effort to combine contradictory educational orientations and curricular approaches. Recommendations to sustain this structure include: (1) development of a common educational philosophy shared by  staff and administration; (2) institutionalization of the four curriculum components; (3) creation of a school ethos; and (4) development of a supportive social and organizational environment, especially principal support.

Building on two other studies in Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) and Florida that explored factors determining teacher salaries, the Georgia study was replicated, using complete 1988-89 data. In addition, the measure of revenue generating potential was simplified to include only the local property wealth per full-time pupil. The null hypothesis, that there was no statistically significant difference in the property wealth per FTE (full-time equivalent) pupil between districts paying teacher salaries higher than predicted (from the mean salaries of teachers in neighboring districts) and those paying teacher  salaries lower than predicted, was tested at eight points correlating various combinations of educational attainment and experience levels. Based on regression equations for predicting local teacher salaries and on property wealth comparisons, the null hypothesis was rejected for each of the eight salary points. Results show that if salaries in contiguous districts are raised, the salaries in adjoining districts will also be raised. Also, the degree and experience level that superintendents considered most important when setting salaries is not always the beginning bachelor degree level. (32 references) (MLH)",

Multiple regression analysis is used to determine the relationships among dependent variables, which include expenditures and number of participants, and independent variables, which include poverty rate, district size, urbanicity, district revenues per enrolled student, educational need, and educational cost factors. Data sources include the federal Chapter 1 database, national Census Bureau information, and New York and Vermont Department of Education records. Findings indicate that characteristics of Chapter 1 programs can be predicted by certain district financial and  demographic information, such as poverty, size, and federal Chapter 1 allocations. However, the finding that high poverty districts tend to implement smaller, more expensive programs argues for the consideration of economies of scale and cost factors. Lack of federal funds prevents poor districts from exercising choice and size of programs.

Major criticisms are its emphasis on social control, mechanical nature, and the relationship between education and value for money. A conclusion is that payment by results was a restrictive system of educational accountability that impeded educational progress in England for the second-half of the 19th century, and that long-term benefits were sacrificed for short-term financial reward. True accountability should  not be contingent upon examination results because the pedagogical methods used to attain those results will be mechanical, nonhumanistic, and detrimental to students.

        "description":"Teachers and coaches once held a special place in the hearts and minds of the American public; however, times have changed. Students are quick to question authority and parents are more willing to retain the services of an attorney to solve their problems. Elementary and secondary school physical education teachers are especially vulnerable targets of legal liability lawsuits. The most frequently used yardstick to determine the liability of physical educators is negligence (a type of civil wrong), which is the failure to act as a reasonable and prudent person in a situation that causes someone harm. Because there are no concrete rules to define negligence, the courts utilize an objective formula to evaluate the conditions surrounding a sports injury to determine whether it was  the result of the physical education teacher's negligence. The elements of the formula include: (1) Did the teacher owe the student a duty of care to protect him from unreasonable risks of harm? (2) Did the teacher breach his duty to protect the student by failing to provide a reasonable standard of care? (3) Were the teacher's actions the direct and proximate cause of the students injury? and (4) Did the student suffer an actual physical injury? (14 references) (KM)",

A conclusion was that most districts lacked board policies or regulations governing the use and copying of software, and that central office administrators were unaware of their existence. A second finding was that districts with policies often did not comply with them. Results demonstrate the need for specific guidance in administrator education to address ethical issues in computing.

Through videodisc and CAI the studies isolated the effects of the following design variables: (1) review cycles; (2) size of teaching sets; (3) explicit strategies; and (4) correction procedures. Studies involved three different kinds of CAI--drill and practice, tutorials, and simulations. Results indicated that properly designed CAI can be effective as an instructional medium if attention is paid to the academic task, the stage of instruction, and the role of the teacher. Detailed reports are presented in the form of preprints or reprints of journal articles with the following titles:\"Applying Instructional Design Principles to CAI for Mildly Handicapped Students: Four Recently Conducted Studies\" (John Woodward et al.); \"Effects of Instructional Design Variables on Vocabulary Acquisition of LD Students: A Study of Computer-Assisted Instruction\" (Gary Johnson et al.); \"Elaborated Corrective Feedback and the Acquisition of Reasoning Skills: A Study of Computer-Assisted Instruction\" (Maria Collins et al.); \"Teaching Problem Solving through Computer Simulations\" (John Woodward et al.); \"The Effectiveness of Videodisc Instruction in Teaching Fractions to Learning-Disabled and Remedial High School Students\" (Bernadette Kelly et al.); and \"Closing the Performance Gap in Secondary Education\" (John Woodward et al.).

Specifically it addresses six questions: (1) do mentally retarded persons in institutions have more serious medical needs than their community counterparts? (2) when people with mental retardation are moved into the community, does their health/medical status deteriorate? (3) does the community service system provide access to the medical care, resources, and support services needed by the current institutional population? (4) what medical care and services are needed by retarded persons currently in or potentially in the community? (5) what are the barriers to provision of community medical services? (6) what can be done to improve  community medical care and services for persons with mental retardation? Among conclusions are that prevalence of different medical conditions is comparable for community residents or institutionalized persons; that persons in state institutions utilize service professionals more frequently than do individuals in the community; that people with mental retardation in the community appear, in general, to be receiving adequate medical and health services; and that the availability of medical care and support services in the community can prevent institutionalization.

        "description":"The study reported in this document examined how special education administrators and staff in 100 school districts were involved in the adoption of new educational technology. The sample was drawn from the known population list of operating school districts from the Common Core of Data of the National Center for Educational Statistics. Selection procedures were designed to ensure coverage for the widest distribution of the population elements in the sample. Two survey forms were developed, one for special education administrators and the other for computer coordinators and special education teachers. Respondents included 100 administrators, 93 special education teachers, and 89 computer coordinators. Findings showed that administrative involvement in the decision making  processes related to computers is high. Involvement in committee processes was reported by over half of the administrators; about two-thirds reported working with other administrators at the district level and half work with other administrators at the building level. One-third of teachers reported regular interaction between administrators and teachers. Teachers in special education programs are sharing computer resources with regular education through informal mechanisms. Technical assistance for computers is reported to be available by about 90% of administrators and teachers. Two-thirds of the administrators reported both purchase of computer technology for administrative purposes and regular use for professional purposes. Forty percent of teachers reported purchase of hardware or  software for administrative applications. The report concludes with plans for Phase II of the study, a list of 19 references, and copies of the survey instruments. (JDD)",

Electronic aids include hearing aids, telephone devices for the deaf, teletypes, closed captioning systems for television, and remote signal devices. The fact that most instructional software can be used by this population with only minor modifications is noted and mention is made of various types of special instructional software to teach lip reading, signing, finger spelling, and vocalization. Word processing is recommended to improve written communication skills. The use of telecommunications is suggested to learn with and about students in distant places as  well as to practice communication skills. Finally, combining videodisc technology and computer access can provide interactive instruction tailored to meet the learning needs of a student with hearing impairments. Lists of five readings, seven organizational or network resources, four periodicals, six software resources, and six hardware vendors conclude the guide. (DB)",

        "description":"One of nine brief guides on using computer technology, this guide is directed to parents of children with disabilities and provides an overview of computer use with handicapped children and suggestions for ways parents can learn more about the potential of technology to aid their children. Instructional software for classroom or home use generally falls into four categories: drill and practice; tutorials; simulations; and games. Tool software (e.g., word processing, database, and graphic editors is another option that is proving very useful for computer users of all ages. Principles for selecting a computer include developing a profile of the child's learning needs which will take into account the nature and degree of severity of his/her disability and also the child's age.  Specific concerns when selecting computer equipment include ensuring that the software programs chosen will run on the computer to be used, presence of sufficient memory, compatibility of adaptive devices, printer features, and cost. Parents are encouraged to read about computers, talk to the child's teacher, and join a local computer user group. Also recommended is contacting the local chapter of the appropriate disability organization and obtaining information on software, hardware, assistive technology, and possible funding help. Four readings, eight organizational resources, four periodicals, and three software resource guides are listed. (DB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to carry out the mandate of the Education of the Handicapped Amendments of 1983 and 1986 which called for an analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of procedures undertaken by state education agencies, local education agencies, and intermediate educational units to improve programs of instruction for handicapped children and youth in day or residential facilities. The facilities on which the study focused are those described as &quot;separate&quot;; i.e., residential or day facilities exclusively serving handicapped persons in buildings physically separate from those for their nonhandicapped peers. Research questions specifically addressed were: (1) What are the current number and characteristics of such facilities? (2) What types of educational  opportunities and related services do children in these facilities receive? (3) What have been the patterns of change in these facilities? and (4) What factors have affected the practices of facilities and patterns of change? A survey was conducted of 2,580 facilities, from which total 1,941 replies were received for a response rate of 75%. Additionally, data were gathered from 50 special education divisions of state education agencies, including the District of Columbia (one state failed to respond); and case studies were conducted of eight state education agencies and of three facilities within each state. An extended summary of findings, which comprises the remainder of this volume, is organized into three sections: (1) a national profile of separate facilities; (2) a review of state  special education procedures that can influence separate facilities; and (3) an analysis of changes at separate facilities since the passage of Public Law 94-142 and the factors associated with those changes. Findings show that separate facilities have noted such changes as increased individualized program planning and evaluation, increased parental involvement, and to some extent, more opportunities for interaction with nonhandicapped peers. Changes in social expectations about the developmental potential and life contributions of handicapped persons have led to increased emphasis on life skills training, vocational training, and transition planning. State education agency procedures have played a significant role in fostering change at separate facilities, especially through setting  regulatory standards, offering technical assistance, and monitoring compliance. Several avenues for further resarch are suggested. Includes 23 references. (JDD)",

        "description":"An increasing number of children who are both medically fragile and profoundly retarded are living to reach school age due to advanced medical technology. The provisions of Public Law 94-142 the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, bring these children within the domain of public education. A major question concerns what service delivery models should be used to meet the needs of the target population; the answer to this question requires a closer look at Public Law 94-142 itself, while the law does not speak directly to the population of concern; it does offer two important features: (1) it provides the obligatory force to program for all children regardless of severity; and (2) it sets in place a framework within which such programming may be developed. Summarily, it can  be said that the public education system is the central agency for services to school aged children. It has a value-positive place in the social structure; it eliminates stigma; and it represents the legally-mandated least restrictive environment. Hence it may be reasonably considered as the basis of a service model for the children under study. Another advantage is that it means that a source of monies and a method of dissemination are already in place. In developing new guidelines for the particular children of concern, attention must be paid to provision of funds to meet the &quot;related services&quot; needs of this population. The spirit of commitment to the education of all children and to early intervention expressed by Public Law 94-142 and 99-457 must be matched by policy, or the  educational agencies and the population of concern will be left in a position of vulnerability. Following the text a framework for proposed system changes is presented in the form of an Individual Education Plan. Contains 24 references. (KM)",

The project also developed procedural manuals to assist practitioners in developing community-based and classroom-based instructional programs. The report lists  project objectives and briefly reports project activities and accomplishments. Among conclusions are the need for more comparative research on effectiveness of commonly recommended instructional strategies; examination of strategies leading to the adoption of validated techniques by practitioners; and research on instructional strategies to enhance maintenance of performance in community settings.

        "author":["O'Reilly, Robert R."],
        "description":"The report examines case law in both Canada and the United States with respect to the integration of exceptional pupils into regular classrooms, with particular emphasis given to three concepts: mainstreaming, least restrictive environment, and maximum benefit. Analysis of American and Canadian jurisprudence finds that all exceptional children appear to have a right to an education, but it is a right bestowed on them by specific legislation and is not recognized as a constitutional or inalienable right. Adequate educational progress is the major criterion for United States court decisions; however mainstreaming is such a desired goal that in some cases marginal improvements in educational progress can be sacrificed. Canadian courts have tended to allow school boards to make  educational decisions, provided they follow provincial government procedures and no harm is done thereby to the child. In Canada's case, courts tend not to interfere in the decision making of agencies acting in accordance with clear legislation and within their sphere of expertise. In Canada also, no one is entitled to the &quot;best possible service&quot; or &quot;maximum benefit&quot;; a service which ensures some educational progress appears to be sufficient. Further, it should be noted that predictions for the unfolding of case law in this domain can be perilous as all Canadian court decisions are very context- and issue-specific. Includes 33 general references, 10 Canadian legal references, and 12 American legal references. (JDD)",

        "description":"Preliminary findings are reported from a study examining changes in preschool-aged child communication skill occurring when parents were trained to apply one of two procedures: milieu teaching and responsive-interactive teaching. Three families participated in milieu language training in which the adult uses naturally occurring situations as opportunities to teach language, and three families participated in responsive interaction training, which aims to enhance the quality and richness of parent-child communication as a basis for stimulating child language development. Results suggest that parents can learn to use the milieu and responsive interaction procedures and that children derive benefits from increased parent competence in communicating with their children. While milieu  teaching appears more useful in developing specific language targets, response interaction shows some evidence of stimulating general child language behaviors. It is concluded that a hybrid intervention that blends the effective components of milieu and responsive interaction would be optimal. (JDD)",

        "description":"The study obtained cross-cultural measures of quality of life (QOL), based upon perceptions of individuals with mental retardation/developmental disabilities (MR/DD) of their degree of satisfaction, productivity, independence, and community integration. The Quality of Life Questionnaire was administered to 92 persons in MR/DD programs in Australia, the Federal Republic of Germany, Israel, and the Republic of China and 552 persons from MR/DD programs in Nebraska and Colorado. A very consistent trend was found across the five countries: quality of life scores increase as one lives and works in more normalized environments. The paper also outlines characteristics of mental retardation/developmental disabilities services in the four countries (excluding the United States), focusing  on: public laws regarding services to persons with MR/DD, funding patterns, administrative structures for MR/DD services, current living options, and current employment options. The paper notes that the concept of quality of life in habilitation services can be used cross-culturally to foster international QOL-oriented public policy, implement QOL-oriented program practices, and complete QOL-focused cross- cultural research projects.

An objective for the Year 2000 Health Objectives for the Nation has been proposed, stating: &quot;By the year 2000, the prevalence of serious mental retardation (an intelligence quotient of less than 50) will be reduced from 2.7 per 1,000 children to no more than 2.0 per 1,000.&quot; Two major approaches for reducing serious mental retardation include reducing its severity among children with clinical disorders associated with serious mental retardation and reducing the incidence of these clinical disorders. Four groups of clinical disorders offer important opportunities to reduce incidence: alcohol-related mental retardation; mental  retardation due to psychosocial deprivation; Down Syndrome; and a group of many known causes which account for a small proportion of mental retardation. Maternal use of alcohol in early pregnancy is used as an example to outline an incidence reduction model and possible preventive techniques. CDC will work towards this national health objective in three major areas: technical assistance and support for state and community prevention programs; support for better data and more rigorous evaluation of interventions; and etiologic research.

        "description":"Leisure activity is a significant factor in the personal-social adjustment of mentally handicapped adults. A particular leisure activity that holds promise for the development and appplication of age-appropriate social behavior is table games. Table games allow for participants to engage in problem-solving activities, sophisticated interpersonal behavior, and moral judgment. Social behavior involved with table games demands both appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication among group members. It is important that these games be conducted in an age-appropriate manner, using the same game materials for handicapped adults as are used by nonhandicapped adults, and as much as possible the same game objective and rules. Adapting age-appropriate table games involves consideration of  motor skills, perceptual/cognitive abilities, and social skills. Examples are provided of adapting complex board games to allow mentally handicapped adults (approximate mental ages of 5 to 7 years) to successfully play the game in an adult manner. Examples include &quot;Uno,&quot;&quot;Parcheesi,&quot; and &quot;Junior Trivia.&quot; A list of observations and suggestions on ideal group size, location, furniture, time allotment, types of games, participants, and facilitators is provided.

It identifies disorders of interaction and/or attachment and disorders of independence/dependence as specific maladaptive social and emotional states associated with neurological impairment. Three theoretical explanations for the obvserved relationships include: (1) direct effects of central nervous system pathology; (2) a secondary effect of the child's frustration; and (3) distorted social ecologies in families. The paper begins with a review of normal social and emotional development, notes the scope of the problem for children with neurological impairment, identifies the three possible etiological factors, and documents the specific types  of affective disorders found most commonly in association with neurological impairment. Finally, the paper offers 10 implications for programming, including: parents should be helped to \"read\" their infant's behavioral cues; parents can be assisted in developing stable and predictable routines; respite services may be needed for parents under stress; parent groups should be encouraged; children should be provided experiences in which their attempts at independence are encouraged; and children should be allowed to experience some degree of normal day-to-day frustrations.

A questionnaire elicited information about the subjects' use of each language with parents, with friends, at home, and in school. Each subject then read a 775-word text in French. Acoustical analysis of the recorded speech revealed the incidence of velarized (typical of Catalan) and non-velarized (typical of Spanish and French) lateral consonants. Results indicate that the production of lateral consonants in French tended to be the non-velarized variety found in French and Spanish. However, comparison of these results with those of other studies suggests that the context in which Spanish and Catalan are  learned may be an important factor in phonetic transfer or interference.

A variety of modes of representation exist, including those in the external sensory world, that are received through the different senses and individual representational systems. Each individual's unique system can be determined from his choice of words or eye movements. In addition to possessing different representational tendencies in different subjects, humans have dominant modalities for each of these problems. It is important in LSP teaching to find out the students' most widely used representational system, and the system that most favors the assimilation of concepts in the specific subject area. The role  of representations in concept formation must be linked with the basic process of memory. The theory of semantic, as distinguished from episodic, memory has implications for the format of knowledge representation and its organization. The basic concepts of a language are acquired extentionally, associating linguistic symbols with events and accumulating associations with time, reinforcing concept storage. This is exemplified in the concept of derivatives in mathematics. (MSE)",

The first section summarizes basic knowledge about preschool language development, facilitating language development at this stage, and the specific language problems faced by multilingual preschool children at home and in group care. The second section looks more closely at the sociolinguistic dimensions affecting language choice and proficiency. In the next section, three preschool program descriptions are given, each involving a situation in which a higher-status national language coexists with an indigenous language. They include a  Spanish-Quechua/Aymara transitional bilingual program (Peru), a Gaelic maintenance program in Scotland's Western Isles, and a Maori revitalization program (New Zealand). The fourth section discusses practical aspects of planning for language learning and emergent literacy in preschool environments, including group size and organization, adult-child relationships, choice of language, instructional materials, staffing and staff training, adult and community participation, and administration. A brief &quot;conclusion&quot; and a list of almost 100 references conclude this part of the document. A special feature of the &quot;annotated bibliography&quot; which follows is that the annotations are written around themes (countries/communities and language use at the preschool level) and are similar in nature to  essay reviews. Entries are listed alphabetically by country and information is provided under the following headings: document source; community (including language situation); educational system specifics; program (including characteristics/components); and comments.

Phonology, especially intonation patterns made continuous discourse hard to grasp, while some employees had problems with simple word functions, such as articles and prepositions, that resulted in utterances lacking requisite precision. In order to address these problems the company organized an in-house program, consisting of eight weekly 3-hour sessions, aimed at improving the non-native English speakers' communication skills and educating them about English phonetics. Each session focused on specific phonological elements,  such as diagnostics, stress and unstress, proper use of consonants, and stigmatized forms in oral and written English. After completion of the program, participants indicated that they had benefited significantly from the sessions and had developed a clearer understanding of English as a system of sounds and word order, and had an increased awareness of the contrasts between the way they used English and the expectations of native speakers.

For both language and business faculty, traditional demands of the disciplines, personal training and backgrounds, and the institutions' organizational structures have all been obstacles to effective interaction. Strategies for breaking through those barriers and forging interdisciplinary alliances include the following: (1) recruitment of &quot;moles,&quot; or departmental champions of the cause; (2) imaginative use of guest speaker and lecture programs; (3) use of the accreditation and professional development standards set out by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of  Business; (4) gradual development of academic programs; (5) use of business faculty in language courses and language faculty in business courses; (6) stimulation of business faculty involvement in study-abroad programs; (7) identification and exploitation of joint research opportunities; and (8) use of existing internal professional development programs to educate faculty in the other disciplines.

In most United States institutions, the long-standing policy of departmentalization and a perceived dichotomy between the humanities and traditional business areas persist. Curricula in commercial French should be redefined and geared toward the professional rather than the service sector. Textbooks must address economic analysis, issues of terminology, and government regulation. Instruction should incorporate presentation skills, simulation of negotiation, and sensitization to nonverbal behavior and corporate culture. At the intermediate level, discussion should incorporate  analysis of organizational charts, business card use, and culture-based differences in presentation modes and market strategies. An undergraduate or graduate program could include rotating semester courses in which a single specific economic or technical field is emphasized. Socioliterary and historical courses are also useful for developing an understanding of French corporate culture. Debunking stereotypes and adapting French communication skills to concrete transactional situations will allow Americans to deal successfully in all French-speaking areas of the world. (MSE)",

The materials targeted three common areas of student difficulty: large amounts of new vocabulary, unfamiliar business concepts, and the formal style of business writing and correspondence. It was decided to keep the software simple in format while incorporating maximum comments, extensive error correction information, and frequent student analysis of materials. Instructions were standardized to avoid confusion. Vocabulary software already used in elementary and intermediate courses was adapted for commercial French vocabulary and coordinated with textbook chapters. Vocabulary learning exercises,  emphasizing rapid acquisition of large numbers of words, generally consist of French-English and English-French translation of individual vocabulary items and short idiomatic expressions or phrases. Multiple-choice vocabulary manipulation exercises were developed to ensure student understanding of meanings and usage. Two verb programs provide systematic review of verb forms. Dictation and sentence translation exercises and a program for composing formal business correspondence were also developed. All programs were designed by an amateur programmer/language teacher using readily-available hardware and could be easily adapted or imitated to fill the needs of beginning commercial language students.

A solution found at Ohio University is to use a publication that bridges the two cultures, such as the &quot;Journal francais d'Amerique&quot; (&quot;French Journal of America&quot;). Once students become familiar with a topic, they can advance to more challenging and in-depth accounts found in French publications, reading the corresponding accounts of one issue given in several publications. Students may also study videotapes in class and in the language laboratory. Timely and authentic video materials are obtained most easily via satellite transmission, but other video  materials are available through journalism programs and publishers. Materials chosen should be thematically challenging and linguistically feasible. In selecting video recordings, special attention should be paid to visual and sound track quality. Students should be prepared for exposure to varying accents, idioms, and vocabulary. In all cases, the success of materials selection depends on adequate preparation through pre-reading exercises, vocabulary preview, grammar review, and cultural allusions. Closure also requires adequate time, and may include student interviews with an expert and group presentations. (MSE)",

Language department harmony has been maintained, but some conflict has occurred between language and business faculty. The greatest current problem is identifying fully qualified new faculty. Recently, the college has begun projects in cooperation with West Germany's University of Paderborn, which has similar programs in both economics and business administration in which English language study is required. Academic achievement in the program and participation in  study abroad programs have been highly satisfactory. Problems encountered in the German program include large classes, difficulty recruiting qualified personnel, and lack of instructional materials. Two studies of the use of English for special purposes and English for economics in major German enterprises clearly documents the need for this specialized language instruction, but the efforts of higher education institutions to fill the need are very limited to date. A more integrative approach is recommended in both the United States and Germany. (MSE)",

Comparison of automobile ads from the two countries, using both pictures and text, suggests significantly different approaches to the audience, with the German  version using a much more interpersonal communication style and the American ad stressing facts.

Four samples were rewritten in three versions, with changed lexical items, changed syntactic items, and changed lexical and syntactic items). The texts were presented to 28 well-educated, non-expert readers employed in government administration. Reading time for each version, controlled for individual reading speed, was measured. All versions were read by at least six readers. The readers were then asked content, comprehension,  and structural questions about the passages. In the case of two texts, readers were asked for their opinions of the readability. Results indicate that for all of the texts, answers to content questions were best on the versions in which both lexical and syntactic items were changed.

        "description":"This special report on the assessment of French immersion students in Alberta focuses on critical issues and methodological problems with testing methods. After an introduction, the second section gives an overview of these issues and problems. Issues discussed include the following: whether students instructed in French immersion programs should be assessed and results reported on a provincial basis; whether participation in the achievement testing program should be mandatory for this population; in what language the students should be tested; whether all students should be tested in the same language; whether achievement should be assessed using the same tests used in the regular achievement testing program; against what standards student achievement should be measured; and  against what reference group student achievement should be compared. The third section reports on a 1989 study to address the effect of the test's language on achievement. In the study, grade 3 and grade 6 French immersion students took the social studies achievement test in either English or French. Results showed that students testing in French scored significantly lower than those testing in English. Section 4 presents some statistical data concerning identification of appropriate expectations for French immersion students. The final section draws conclusions and discusses future directions for policy-making. (MSE)",

        "description":"Since 1965, Amish children in Buchanan County, Iowa have been exempted from state requirements to attend centralized schools and, instead, are taught in small rural schools with a traditional curriculum through grade 8. More recent federal laws mandate provision of special services to limited-English-proficient (LEP) students in this group. Some schools have refused English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) services, which currently include diagnostic testing, recommendations on materials adaptation and purchase, inservice teacher workshops, and consultation on planning for the future. Administrator attitudes have been positive to neutral. Teachers have generally been receptive to workshops and new ideas. Parents have expressed guarded approval, preferring minimal change. The new  program design resembles sheltered English, with subjects taught in English. However, the goals of sheltered English and of the Amish differ. Sheltered English programs are intended to mainstream students, while the Amish community prefers separation. Development of a program model tailored to the goals and language functions deemed important in this and other unique communities, such as native American groups, could be useful. Some methods and content are considered inappropriate for the Amish, and challenge currently-accepted methodology. Inservice training must match teacher needs and goals, and testing must be adapted for the population. (MSE)",

Attitudes of students in the last year of elementary school, before second language instruction begins, and students of French in the third year of secondary school, the last year of obligatory language instruction, were informally measured through interviews, observation, and surveys. Analysis of the results is in progress. An illustration of one portion of the analysis focuses on the secondary students' knowledge of an ordinary meal in France, assessed in interviews, and the sources of their information in and outside of class.

Data collected included information from the following sources: semi-structured interviews with 30 ESL teachers; descriptive data on the teachers' background and characteristics; classroom observation and instructional analysis with three of the teachers having different dominant theoretical orientations; and modified stimulus recall procedures to examine  contextual variables. Results suggest that most teachers have theoretical orientations consistent with the major theories in the field. However, 40% had other orientations. The three teachers identified as having differing theoretical orientations were found to use instructional practices associated with the underlying assumptions of theoretical beliefs. Contextual factors identified as influencing instructional decisions were primarily the academic and real-life language needs of their students, supporting the notion of the strong influence of extra-instructional, societal factors. Implications for classroom instruction and teacher preparation are discussed. (MSE)",

        "description":"A discussion of pre-historic (i.e., preliterate) language looks at the processes of affixation and inflection in the context of two conflicting theories on the complexity of those languages. The traditional view holds that the grammar used by early Indo-Europeans was at least as complex and abstract as that of any modern educated and literate speaker. The other perspective is that the early peoples are unlikely to have been very different in language and thought from present-day non-literate speakers and very different from contemporary literate language users. The two theories are outlined and discussed. It is concluded that given the absence of direct evidence for pre-historical stages and changes in Indo-European languages, the conflict will have to be resolved through: (1) an  appraisal of the validity of the traditional technique of historical linguistics; (2) appraisal of the validity of the studies and descriptions of non-literate users of contemporary languages; and (3) evaluation of the latter theory's assertion that characterizations of contemporary individuals and societies are proper data for the understanding of early man.

The first section offers background information about Waterloo, its population and language history. Linguistic evidence of VBE in the community is then outlined, and the grammatical, morphological, and phonological characteristics of it and the Midland vernacular are compared. Survey and some anecdotal evidence of negative attitudes toward VBE are  then presented. The survey administered to 61 non-black university students, native speakers of the Midland vernacular, involved evaluating four guises, one of which was VBE, to determine the characteristics of the speaker (sex, nationality, religion, race, age, educational level, and ten personality traits or attributions). Results support the theory that listeners were making assumptions about the relationship between intelligence, race, and language. Areas for future related research are outlined.

It is important for supervisors to realize that the goal of supervision--improvement of instruction--is problematic because of the complex relationship between teaching and learning. The focus of training is on specific outcomes that can be achieved through a sequence of steps, commonly within a specified period of time. Some aspects of teaching are not easily  mastered. A variety of activities focus on teacher development. These activities, incorporated into the supervisory process, provide opportunities for teachers to become more informed and capable of making their own decisions about improving their teaching. In most contexts, the creative supervisor, equipped with instruments to train and methods that offer teachers a chance to develop, can encourage teachers to learn and to build a more complex theory of teaching.

This executive summary describes the major components of the study and discusses the methodology, the key findings, and key corrective action recommendations. The study found consistently high rates and magnitudes of error in each program. Student  misreporting of application information is a major cause of these high levels of error. Institutional error also continues to be a problem. The project identified three major areas for quality improvement: simplification of the delivery process, including a reduction in the number of data elements required for needs analysis; institution-based quality control; and structural changes to the delivery systems to integrate functions among programs and to provide central control over delivery system activities.

        "description":"Stage Two of the Title IV Quality Control Project represents an integrated study of quality in five related Federal financial aid programs for postsecondary students. An introductory chapter of this volume on procedures and methods presents the major objectives of Stage Two and discusses them in the context of previous related quality control studies. It reviews the Title IV programs and introduces the data sources used to conduct the study. Subsequent chapters describe in detail how the study was conducted. Chapter 2 discusses how error was defined and the procedures used for measuring error. Chapter 3 presents the sampling methodology used to construct a national sample of Federal student aid recipients. Chapters 4 and 5 describe data collection activities, focusing on  institutional data collection, and student, parent, and secondary data collection. Chapter 6 details the preparation of the data for analysis. Finally, Chapter 7 presents a discussion of nonresponse and variance estimates and their effects on the sample. Appendices report on sample design and sources of variability in overall student weights, offer a project summary, and examine variance estimates. Appendix D, bound separately, offers materials related to data collection. Materials include institutional data collection letters and forms, such as notification of selection letter, master schedule for data collection, interview confirmation letter, telephone script for schedule confirmation, interviewer validation report form, data collector call-in form, and a form listing data collection  problems to discuss with field data collectors. Materials also include student/parent data collection letters, such as letters sent to students and parents introducing the project and soliciting cooperation in data collection efforts, re-approach letters to students who refused to participate, and other request and reminder forms.

        "description":"Stage Two of the Title IV Quality Control Project is an integrated study of quality in five related Federal financial aid programs for postsecondary students. Section 1 of the paper establishes a framework for defining quality improvements, in order to identify the types of changes that would tend to improve quality across all facets of the delivery process. Section 2 looks at the shortcomings in quality, categorized by a taxonomy of features for all the student aid programs. The corrective action themes of simplification, integration, and decentralization are used to address systematic issues contributing to an error-prone system. This analysis sets the objectives for delivery system quality improvements. The objectives derived are: improved built-in accuracy; improved  timeliness; reduced burden; less confusion; improved controls; improved accountability; and less cost outlay to the government. In Section 3, five key structural changes to the delivery of Title IV assistance are recommended. These are: a reduced core of data elements; an integrated needs analysis structure; a central database; a central disburser that would eventually become joined with a central database; and expansion of the Institutional Quality Control Program. A phased approach to implementing the quality improvements is described in Section 4. (JDD)",

        "description":"This report is a selective analysis and assessment of quantitative data and field studies that reflect the economic role of the Academic Health Center (AHC) in the urban economy and in neighborhood revitalization. It describes the effect of a variety of cooperative efforts between local community organizations and AHCs, which usually include a medical school and a teaching hospital. The first part of the report describes revenue-creating activities of the Academic Health Center as a purchaser of durable and nondurable goods from a large number of industries, including construction, pharmaceuticals, and hospital supplies, and from local producers of commodities and services such as utilities, laundry, and food. This macroeconomic analysis is derived from a sample of AHCs in nine  metropolitan centers (Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis). The second part examines the role of eight urban AHCs in collaborative neighborhood development efforts, primarily initiated in the 1960s and located in Boston, New York, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Los Angeles, and Irvine (California). A concluding section examines the likely directions of such cooperative efforts in the decades ahead. Seven tables display supporting data, and an appendix discusses the concept of &quot;export income&quot; in the context of the urban economy. (JDD)",

        "description":"This report, prepared in response to a requirement in the Academic Research Facilities Modernization Act, proposes a plan for the modernization of general research facilities in which academic research is conducted, including research buildings, research laboratories, support rooms, and other institutional or departmental facilities in scientific and engineering disciplines. Federal research facility support programs of the 1960s and early 1970s are described as instrumental in helping to build and strengthen the academic research facility base, while the 1980s have seen few such programs. Recent studies indicate that U.S. academic research facilities have deteriorated and there is a growing need for additional research space. The roles of various key groups in supporting and  investing in academic research facilities are spelled out; for example, institutions should consider greater use of debt financing, and state and local governments should encourage partnerships and consortia. A combination of funding support mechanisms should be established to provide the balanced and sustained support necessary to develop modern research facilities. The Academic Research Facilities Modernization Act calls for a competitive grant program for the repair, renovation, and, in exceptional cases, replacement of academic research facilities. Special features of the program are described. The appendix provides program guidelines (a revision of a draft published in the Federal Register April 20, 1989) that describe a two-phase annual proposal cycle for organizations seeking  grants for the repair, renovation, or replacement of a research facility or facilities. A 37-item bibliography concludes the plan. (JDD)",

Sixty percent of respondents believed that public managers need a related college degree, while 38.4% did not believe so. Women viewed the importance of college education at the same level of importance as males, while none-whites felt that a college education was more important than whites did. The perceived need for specialized training and education in public  administration was more prevalent among non-white respondents and respondents above the age of 49. Commitment to training ranked highest among non-whites and women. The two most useful fields of study were perceived to be personnel management and public relations, followed by policy/program analysis, budgeting, management information systems, administrative law, and statistics/research methods.

In addition, a list of reasons why highly intelligent people either do not succeed or underachieve is provided to assist the mentor in recognizing areas of potential or current difficulty. Two particular problems that sometimes arise when women are being mentored (finding the appropriate mentor and male chauvinism) are discussed, as well  as the unique problems involving assisting minorities, which include their difficulties with culture shock, feelings of isolation, and the lack of an established professional support system. Ways in which a mentor can help the mentoring process be more successful for women and minorities are listed and include specific areas of professional skills development.

The black college student is seen as possessing a unique contextual self, borne of a heritage that values, to a very high degree, the family and other people that significantly impact the lives of those with whom they interact and relate. Because black students often come from a less than desirable social, financial, and developmental background, the college environment in which they find themselves is perceived as unfriendly, unwelcome, or dangerous. It is suggested that the black student requires a great deal of \"catching up\" attention that augments the traditional student services. Actions that can help in nullifying these adverse circumstances  include: (1) providing more follow-up of the recruiting efforts of potential black students, including financial aid counseling; (2) providing developmental academic instruction; (3) skill-building orientation activities; (4) hiring more black faculty and requiring them to serve in a variety of roles; and (5) cataloging and collecting black student resources and actively encouraging programs and events which celebrate the ethnic heritage of the black college student.

The manner in which a resident assistant tells and sells, and participates and delegates will have a significant impact on their ability to lead. The proper developmental approach to the discipline process will allow the leader to emerge, but if avoided, mires the disciplinarian and the disciplined in a bog of bad feelings and ill will. Further, if the communication skills of the disciplinarian are poor, the disciplinarian will never be perceived as a leader by the other party. Thus, communication which invites interaction with others that is sincere and reflects genuine concern for those  under authority is desirable. Finally, what is required of a true leader is the firm and total belief in, and commitment to, a philosophical approach that is both intrinsically valuing of all human beings and at the same time enlightening, empowering, and uplifting for everyone involved.

        "description":"This report outlines the progress and the plans of the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, a group created by the 1986 amendments to the Higher Education Act to strengthen the federal student aid programs to ensure equal opportunity through access to postsecondary education. The report begins with descriptions of the Title IV programs of the Higher Education Act which authorize postsecondary student financial assistance, the structure and agenda of the Advisory Committee, and the Advisory Committee's reauthorization activities. Four issues dominating the Advisory Committee's agenda during its first 2 years are discussed: the new formula for need analysis, Congressional Methodology (CM); the structure and costs of multiple data entry processing; institutional  lending in the Stafford student loan program; and the rising level of student loan defaults. The report documents issues that should be considered by Congress during the next reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. These issues include need analysis and the delivery system; information resources, services, and programs; and studies, surveys, and analyses. A list of members and staff and a copy of the authorizing legislation for the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance conclude the report. (JDD)",

A handbook is presented which gives background information and some suggestions users may find helpful in implementing the (FACE) process. FACE is a technique whereby a professional group, the principals/directors of TAFE colleges, can set performance standards and monitor adherence to these standards by those of its members who choose to participate. The handbook is primarily concerned with peer appraisal, although a discussion is given on how FACE may be adapted to other forms of appraisal. A step-by-step approach is presented for developing the process and an  example is given of the FACE process being implemented. In addition, the handbook provides guidance on the handling of problem areas, or weaknesses in executive performance, that may be discovered during the appraisal interview and how to best deliver negative feedback. An appendix provides further detailed information on FACE development and application as well as a resources list. Contains 15 references. (GLR)",

The main purpose of the study was to determine if women and men differed in their initial pay expectations. Surveys were received from 447 college seniors, including 100 pretest surveys. Respondents were majoring in Agriculture, Business, Engineering, Social Sciences, and \"other\" composed of Nursing, Education, and Human Ecology. Except women in Social Sciences, respondents expected their starting salaries to be higher than the starting salaries of others. Compared to males, females expected lower peak salaries for themselves and lower peak salaries for the \"best\" others in their fields. Engineering  reported the highest salaries. Females in Agriculture also expected higher peak salaries for themselves while females from \"Other\" majors had lower salary expectations. Across all colleges except \"Other,\" women expected fairly comparable salaries. Additionally, females in Engineering, Business, and \"Other\" majors expected lower initial salaries for themselves; they also believed lower starting salaries were fair salaries, compared to males in those same fields. The study concludes that the differing meanings of money are a possible explanation for the gender wage gap. Contains 33 references. (GLR)",

Declining enrollments leave institutions with unused building capacity, increased costs per student, funding difficulties, and increasing pressure to lessen the difficulty of the curriculum, thus undermining the school's academic significance. Understanding attrition and risk is critical to achieving success among the high-risk group by the 21st cdntury. Most students begin school with positive attitudes; however, differences in race, gender, and social class often begin to  emerge in early childhood education and increase through high school and college. Through negative conditioning, such as prejudice and lack of understanding among teachers towards the &quot;different&quot; student, low self-esteem is unintentionally created and nurtured. This low self-esteem can in time force students to &quot;cooperate&quot; with forces that create antisocial behavior and influence the drop-out mentality when circumstances become difficult to deal with. High-risk students must be challenged to develop academic and non-academic skills and competencies associated with success in college, and teachers, counselors, and administrators must persist in seeing that programs are completed through appropriate nurturing behavior.

Data were gathered from questionnaires from 142 academic deans, 392 department chairs, and 1,173 faculty members. Faculty reported lower tenure weights for teaching and research than deans, but higher tenure weights for committee work and publishing. Faculty perceive that there is no merit salary increment for outstanding teaching, though deans and, to a lesser extent, department chairs indicated otherwise. Concerning the adequacy of institutional funding for teaching and  research support, ratings of good or excellent varied from 46% of the deans to 40% of the chairs and 33% of the faculty. Nearly a third of the faculty received $250 or less support for all forms of professional development in academic year 1984-85. Data support the notion of a gradient of ignorance about the availability of funds for the support of teaching and research from deans to faculty. It is concluded that this gradient serves to maximize the dean's power and control over faculty access to support funding. Includes 11 references. (JDD)",

The differences included a larger parental influence in choosing a religious college and the perceived importance of social atmosphere.

The purpose was to introduce a systematic and rigorous planning methodology to enhance success in moving forward into a complex, turbulent, and uncertain future. The focus of the methodology was the identification, analysis, and evaluation of alternative future states of an organization's environment and the sources of change within it. At the seminar, participants were grouped into four simulated organizations: a liberal arts school, a comprehensive university, a national advisory committee, and an international organization focusing on higher education. The purpose of the simulation was to learn how to use a planning process to link environmental scanning  information to the formulation of institutional strategy, how to assess the position of an educational organization in the external environment, how to delineate alternative futures of that environment, and how to define the strategies necessary to adapt to a range of anticipated changes in the external environment. This paper defines the perspective of the alternative futures approach to planning, along with the methodological assumptions underlying the approach and the model used. The planning team reports from three of the simulated organizations are presented to illustrate application of the model. Includes 111 references. (JDD)",

Although the report focuses on black-white differences, it is emphasized that the items where substantial differences were found were considerably outnumbered by items that yielded minor or no differences. Major findings include: (1) black students reported lower family  incomes and education level than white students; (2) black college freshmen have experienced declining access to financial aid in the form of federal grants and have been forced to rely more on student loans; (3) low tuition was a major factor in black students' decision about which college to attend; (4) black freshmen continue to be less well-prepared for college compared to their white counterparts; (5) career choices of black students do not reflect preference for careers in the sciences or college teaching.

It deals with the problem of pursuing a minimum \"socially necessary\" growth rate in the world economy required to meet the key aspirations of today's generation by the year 2000. It argues that the opportunities presented by the current international situation involving detente between the superpowers will enable the developed countries to transfer to developing countries the resources needed to supplement domestic efforts for bringing about growth. It also argues that there will be enough resources left over, after providing for growth,  to address the key dimensions of the global environment problem in both developing and developed countries by expenditures to be made during the 1990s, so that sustainable development can be ensured for the 21st century and beyond. Environmental problems considered include global warming, deforestation, land degradation, and the pressure of population growth on environmental resources. The argument is supported by projections of resource requirements. An annex to the paper contains an extract from a statement by Thorvald Stoltenberg concerning a system of development contracts.

The report discusses the fundamental dilemma states face in trying to foster greater institutional responsiveness to changing demographics. Next, an examination is made of two measures of state or institutional progress towards equity: an estimate of the differences between majority and minority participation rates, and an estimate of differences in graduation rates attributable to the effects of race and ethnicity. The problems of convincing a state's colleges and universities that improving minority participation and graduation rates  ought to be high on their agenda are discussed, as well as efforts used to influence them to act, including the predominate use of court-imposed mandates. Finally, suggestions are presented on ways a state can achieve educational equity in its colleges and universities, including the act of making equity a priority, delivering that message clearly, selecting the person best qualified to deliver it, and developing and executing a plan of action.

Based on the assumption that university graduates must be computer literate before entering the workforce, a study was conducted to examine how attitudes held before attending a computer course differed on the basis of gender, intention to purchase a computer, and ownership of a computer. A survey of 156 students who had enrolled in a required university computer literacy course yielded a 70% participation rate. The study revealed that gender and ownership of a computer were responsible for attitudinal differences, while intent to purchase a computer was not. Students who withdrew from the course during the semester and students in the course with lower ability both  perceived the computer as increasing job complexity. Ownership of a computer eliminated almost all gender differences in computer attitudes. A discussion of the implications of these results for managers and future research concludes the paper, and 11 tables of statistical data are attached. (45 references) (DB)",

One group of students was placed in the studio with the instructor and another group in a classroom away from the studio. The classroom was equipped with a monitor enabling students to watch all the action, a telephone to allow them to call in with questions, and a microphone was used to ensure that their questions could be heard by both groups. The first lesson was a student activity demonstrating social differences, and it included music, visuals, and handouts. A facilitator was on hand in the &quot;distant&quot; classroom to pass out materials. The instructor was allowed three much-needed rehearsals in the studio before conducting the class. The second lesson included a video clip of a news  documentary and a discussion between studio and distant classroom students. Based on the results, it was concluded that the television medium is an exciting, viable distance education format that can promote creative teaching and enhance distant learning. (11 references).

        "description":"Beginning in 1985, Apple Computer, Inc., and several school districts began a collaboration to examine the impact of computer saturation on instruction and learning in K-12 classrooms. The initial guiding question was simply put: What happens when teachers and students have constant access to technology? To provide &quot;constant access,&quot; each teacher and student in the project received two computers, one for the home and one for the classroom. This paper describes the program, Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow (ACOT), and reports on the instructional evolution that occurred in those classrooms. The personal struggles of teachers who came to confront the nature of learning and consequently, the efficacy of their own instructional practices, are examined in detail through individual journal  entries. This paper also places the innovative ACOT program in a broader perspective on educational change and draws implications for the support and development of teachers engaged in significant reform projects.

As part of the planning process, the LRC conducted a user survey to solicit information from the college's faculty, staff, students, and other users about how they have used the LRC and how they would like the LRC to improve. A nine-item questionnaire was distributed to all faculty and staff and copies were made available for 1 week at the LRC circulation desk for students and other users. Analyses of the 44 responses received indicated that the primary reasons for using the LRC are to seek reference information  and to do research either for teaching or writing papers. Time spent at the LRC by users varied evenly across the categories of more than 20 hours, 10-20 hours, 1-9 hours, and less than one hour. Suggestions for improvement included additional budget, personnel, facilities, books, and periodicals, as well as longer hours, more comfortable seating, and more study space. The responses are tallied in three tables, and a copy of the questionnaire is included. (DB)",

        "description":"This report describes the Distance Learning Project North, which began in September 1988 in Alberta, Canada. The primary emphasis of the project was on increasing equity in educational opportunity and the focus was testing alternative distance education delivery systems which can be used to provide equitable, cost-effective education to the project schools. The project was to explore a multi-grade model where a &quot;classroom&quot; was composed of students from many grades in learner-centered mathematics supported by a computer managed learning (CML) system. Students in these classes would study modular, independent learning materials while receiving instructional support, question and answer support, evaluation and assessment from off-site. A case study evaluation consisting of  interviews, observations, and document analysis was used to ensure recognition of contextual factors that affected the project. Results indicate that overall attitudes toward the CML mathematics experience were positive. Organization and structure of materials may be improved, and both students and teachers would benefit from orientation to the distance learning program prior to its commencement. Copies of the interview protocols used with principals, teachers, and students are included. (DB)",

Technology-mediated interactive learning (TMIL), a new form of instruction, may result from the synthesis of distance education, cooperative learning, and computer-supported cooperative work. Group process themes and cooperative learning may be increasingly incorporated into distance learning classrooms, which can be designed to promote a wider, deeper range of student skills than a local site could offer, afford a higher quality of teaching than may be locally available, and provide greater opportunities for students to interact. As distance education evolves to technology-mediated interactive learning it  will become the preferred instructional methodology instead of simply a means of providing solutions to conventional teaching problems.

Pretest/posttest data were supplemented by observations, interviews, document reviews, and teacher and student questionnaires. Results of the achievement tests showed that students' test scores improved; however, treatment differences in reading were significant only in the white group for comprehension. Significant differences in the mathematics component were restricted to race and race by sex. Overall, this study supported research findings that indicate computer programs  whose management is not an additional burden on the classroom teacher, match the local curricula, and address learning theory research can be implemented successfully.

        "description":"Children often have difficulty developing debugging skills. This may be attributable to instructional methods that discourage reflection on one's reasoning errors. Logo instruction may encourage such reflection. Two studies examined Logo's effect on confirmation bias--the tendency to select confirming over disconfirming information to prove an hypothesis. One study viewed elementary students while the second investigated college students. A third study investigated confirmation bias developmentally in grades 4 through 12. While Logo programming did not significantly effect deductive reasoning, elementary students exhibited an unusually high tendency to be disconfirmers while college students were confirmers. A significant difference was found in that twelfth graders more  frequently selected confirming information than did fourth graders. This suggests that elementary students may be less resistant to learning self-reflective debugging skills than older students. Also, programming instructors may need to generate specific strategies to address confirmation bias in older students at the secondary school and university levels. (Author)",

The project had two aims: (1) to survey research findings and practices of decision-making processes in instructional material selection in the United States and Australia; and (2) to identify the attributes of decision-making processes used to select instructional materials in educational settings in Australia through a content analysis of a sample of articles published in Australian journals. The Textbook Adoption Advisory Services agency in Connecticut is discussed for its contribution to the organization of the decision-making process as it applies to textbook selection. It is noted that there are no counterparts in Australian education to the range of institutionalized practices  used in the United States to select and adopt instructional materials. A content analysis of research reports and literature published in Australian journals was then used to investigate the attributes of decision-making as perceived by the authors. Seven types of decision rules and a &quot;stages of action cycle&quot; were used to determine differences in decision method. It is concluded that practices used for the selection of instructional materials in Australia cannot be specified, and that those who are regarded as authorities in the area of selection have a poor appreciation of the decision-making process. Appendices include a bibliography of relevant journal articles indexed in the Australian Education Index 1975-1989, an annotated bibliography of the Australian journal articles examined,  and a 33-item bibliography of books and articles that includes U.S. publications.

        "description":"This study investigated the use of a computerized tutorial--Self-Test and Review (STAR)--in a computer-managed general psychology course. STAR consists of four major modules which provide the student with a variety of learning exercises, including practice quizzes, practice final exams, performance reviews, and structured study questions. The purpose of the study was to determine whether students would choose STAR as a study tool, the effect of lecture versus self-paced settings on the use of STAR, whether students who used STAR would perform better than those who did not, and the effect of the timing of feedback in STAR on performance. Students were enrolled in either a lecture or self-paced setting. Students in lecture sections met in the classroom for a traditional lecture,  discussion, and classroom activities. Students in self-paced sections met in a computer-managed testing center. Analyses of data on course performance and STAR usage indicate that: (1) 49% of the 1,136 subjects used STAR; (2) lecture versus self-paced settings did not affect the use of STAR; (3) the timing of feedback did not have an impact on performance; and (4) students who used the STAR tutorial performed well in the course and, as a whole, better than those students who did not use the tutorial. It is concluded that, while the results were generally positive, the findings of the study create other research questions concerning the impact of modification of lecture settings, the impact of STAR tutorials in other course formats, and the ways in which STAR influences student  comprehension.

        "author":["Lindsay, John"],
        "description":"Information systems design is at a crossroads of changes in technology (microcomputing, software engineering, and telecommunications) and the administration of social systems, of which urban and regional planning are a part. Training in information systems design will be beneficial to four distinct groups of people: clerical and technical staff; new information professionals; middle- and senior-level planners; and policy makers. The training process must take an integrated approach to systems design, rather than attempting to formulate technical solutions to technical problems. Planning authorities need to develop local information plans which would include mapping the current information infrastructure and constructing a development program. Training of clerical/technical and  young professionals can be best accomplished within the country. Senior-level training should occur out of the country, through a combination of short courses, conferences, and seminars, or by one year of Masters of Science level courses. Policy planners will benefit from sensitizing, rather than training; it is probably best achieved through short seminars. Experiences in other areas of administration where the same issues are being confronted should be utilized, and the formation of documentation centers in regional centers of excellence would help to offset the slender range of teaching materials available. There remains a dilemma, however: those who are best equipped to see the need for an information plan and the value of training in systems design may not be in a position to  influence policy decisions. Further, the process of designing an information system is likely to uncover institutional antagonisms. (56 references) (SD)",

        "description":"A descriptive study was conducted to delineate a structured representation of one abstract type (theoretical) and suggest how this predictable representation could affect user-system interfaces of information retrieval systems. Fifty-five argumentative type abstracts were selected from issues of \"International Political Science Abstracts.\" Each abstract was classified into one of three groupings: Substantive, Authoritative, or Motivational. Each abstract was examined for the presence of the first and the second triads of elements--i.e. (1) data, warrant, and claim; and (2) backing, rebuttal, and qualifier. Of the abstracts, 68% belonged to the Substantive class, 20% to the Authoritative class, and 11% to the Motivational class. The first triad of elements was found in all of the  abstracts. Of the second triad of elements, Rebuttal was found in 16, Qualifier in 24, and Backing in 28 of the abstracts. It is concluded that patterns of form and structure can be found in the argumentation texts, and therefore, that the rhetorical structure of argument is a useful framework in which to describe the structure of theoretical abstracts. Further, if a user-system interface could make use of these findings in information retrieval systems, users would be aided in comprehending the content of retrieved abstracts and in refining their search queries.

        "description":"The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) commissioned a study to determine the baseline costs of operation for the network of libraries and agencies that provide braille, playback machine, and recorded book services to patrons of the free national program. A 15-year projection of costs was also prepared. The approximate costs of network operations for the federal fiscal year 1989 were $3,154,000 for braille book services, and $7,724,000 for playback machine services, and $30,181,000, for recorded book services, for a total of $41,058,000. These numbers represent expenses incurred by state, local, and private agencies in the network, and exclude costs for materials or equipment, which were covered by the NLS. The NLS also incurred approximatley  $805,000 in costs for its multistate centers (MSCs). In fiscal year 1989, the network consisted of 56 regional libraries, 92 subregional libraries, 8 machine lending agencies, and 3 MSCs. The 15-year projection of network costs was based on the cost behavior of 35 sample sites, operational statistics as reported to NLS by network libraries and agencies, and unit occupancy costs compiled by the General Services Administration (GSA). Independent mathematical relationships relating the costs for the sample sites to their associated operational statistics were developed for regional and subregional libraries for the three services under study and for three major cost categories: labor, occupancy, and all other costs. It is projected that costs in the 15th year will have increased to  $91,601,419 ($6,134,726, $17,415,106, and $68,051,587 for braille book, playback machine, and recorded book services respectively).

Students were given one page of searching instructions and a one-page form for purchasing Grateful Med software and acquiring a National Library of Medicine (NLM) student access code. Students who used the library's funded access code were asked to complete a two-page evaluation form (68 of 73 were returned). Data were correlated to the type of instruction received as well as the users' previous  computer experience. It was found that almost all of the students were interested in learning how to use the software and found it easy to learn. Analysis of the evaluation forms indicate that in-depth training including hands-on use of the software gave the highest levels of satisfaction. Any prior computer experience increased the level of satisfaction. Approximately 37% of the students indicated they would acquire their own NLM access codes. Four tables and three figures--including the evaluation form--are provided. (15 references) (SD)",

The discussion considers advantages and disadvantages of this tool, which evaluates past collection efforts, revealing the way in which the collections reflect those efforts, and determining the current and projected collecting intensity. Organization and staffing concerns are also discussed, as well as issues and trends in applications of the methodology. The North American Collections Inventory Project (NCIP)--an expansion of the Conspectus method--is described, and a copy of the NCIP questionnaire is provided. The major  part of this publication is made up of documents that were submitted by Association of Research Libraries (ARL) member libraries in conjunction with the NCIP survey. This collection includes four documents that outline plans and procedures for implementing the Conspectus methodology, six that set forth criteria for assessing a collection, six that discuss various uses for the Conspectus, and four Conspectus project reports. Institutions submitting these documents are Emory University, Harvard University, Indiana University, Library Information Resources for the Northwest (LIRN), METRO, University of Alberta, University of British Columbia, University of California-Los Angeles, University of Missouri-Columbia, University of Oklahoma, University of Toronto, University of Virginia,  Washington University, and Yale University.

To assess these activities, a SPEC (Systems and Procedures Exchange Center) survey was sent to members of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL), with resonses from 64 to 118 member libraries (54%). Over 90% of the responding libraries have some mechanism for systematically identifying brittle books. Most libraries operate programs for replacing brittle books with hard or film copies and for fitting materials that cannot be replaced with protective wrappers and boxes. More than half of the libraries have developed preservation photocopying and microfilming capabilities. Nearly  half of the libraries segregate brittle materials. Most libraries assign the responsibility of selecting preservation options to professional librarians, and many have forged links between preservation and collection development. Nearly half of the libraries discard 90% of original materials after providing adequate film or hard copy replacements; conversely, nearly 20% retain more than 90% of original materials. Approximately 64% of respondents, rely exclusively on microfilm. This SPEC Kit contains the survey instrument and the survey results, planning documents, organizational charts and job descriptions, searching and selection procedures and forms, guidelines and workflow descriptions, microfilming and photocopying procedures, and a five-item reading list.

Discussion covers the possible  content of such training and the training objectives corresponding to each module. Also provided are examples relevant to the situation of information specialists, a number of exercises to accompany the course, and suggested readings for tutors and students who wish to continue their training independently. Inservice training is geared toward professionals already in the workforce.

The 33 forum participants--representing backgrounds in network systems, national libraries, archives, cataloging systems, USMARC, AACR2 (Anglo-American Cataloging Rules, second edition), microforms, preservation, serials, and special materials--offered varying perspectives to the discussion. The forum focused on identifying and evaluating solutions for the USMARC record-based communications environment. After introductory remarks, the forum began with two framework presentations. The first treated the definition and scope of the multiple versions questions, and the second surveyed  the characteristics of various automated environments in which bibliographic data are currently manipulated. From discussions following these presentations, forum participants developed a set of seven working assumptions and a set of nine evaluation criteria for techniques that would be discussed. Following the framework sessions, three basic techniques for handling multiple versions were examined in detail: (1) composite; (2) two-tier and three-tier hierarchical; and (3) separate. Of the options considered, the two-tier hierarchical model was considered the most viable for preservation microform versions. Various aspects of the discussion of the Forum participants on the selected model are presented in six sections, and appended materials include descriptions of the other types of models  considered as well as a list of participants and an agenda for the meeting.

The project activities were designed to eliminate the stereotype of mathematics and related careers as masculine domains. Female tutors and female computer lab technicians, peer tutoring, scheduled review sessions, and access to computer-assisted instructional materials were provided to help women develop confidence in their mathematics ability. The retention rate for women in technical curricula increased from 53% to 61.2% after exposure to the new program. In addition, the dropout rate for women in remedial mathematics decreased at the  end of the experimental year compared to the previous 2 years. An expanded project emphasizing career education and targeting local high school seniors was implemented in the 1988-89 school year. This project focused on increasing the number of women who elect to take technical curricula, increasing the retention rates of women in technical curricula, and disseminating information about careers for women in nontraditional technical fields. Support services similar to those offered the previous year were provided. In conjunction with Gruman Aircraft Systems, IBM, and AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, a Career Day was held with presentations from women within these industries. The 1988-89 results were also successful, with retention rates for women increasing from 70.5% in 1987-88 to 89.2% in  1988-89.

The SAP model provides confidential, professional, and voluntary assistance and support to students regarding alcohol- and drug-related personal problems that are adversely affecting their academic performance. Workshop attendees decided to form a larger Core Committee which would receive more extensive training in order to implement a viable program at the college. A consortium was formed with neighboring colleges to cover the costs of an intensive 4-day substance abuse training workshop.  Workshop participants were introduced to the PLISSIT (P=Permission, LI=Little Information, SS=Some Suggestions, IT=Intensive Therapy) Model, a method for one-on-one student counseling. One of the first committee activities was the development of a student questionnaire on alcohol and drug use. To gain more expertise and guidance for the committee, a member of the district police department, and a counselor from the Santa Clara County (California) Drug Abuse Bureau were invited to join the group. A presentation on SAP was given to all faculty members, special activities were conducted during Alcohol Awareness week, and an Alcohol and Drug Awareness Event was held in October, 1988.

        "description":"In 1990, a survey was conducted of selected professional staff at 139 community, junior, and technical colleges nationwide to determine which national leadership/service organizations (NL/SO's) the colleges were affiliated with, to identify the NL/SO programs and services utilized by the colleges, and to evaluate those services. The survey was sent to presidents of 62 randomly selected colleges and 77 community college professionals who had served in leadership roles in various NL/SO's or had been recognized by one or more of these organizations as leaders with national stature. Major findings of the study, based on responses from 52% of the presidents and 48% of the other professionals, were as follows: (1) on the average, colleges were affiliated with nine different NL/SO's;  (2) 80% of the respondents rated the overall value of their institution's involvement in all NL/SO's to be significant or very significant; (3) five organizations or groups of organizations were mentioned by 54% of the respondents as having provided significant leadership or service to their colleges; (4) the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges (AACJC) was identified by all respondents as having provided significant leadership, with 96% rating it one of the four most significant or valuable NL/SO's; and (5) 65% of the respondents indicated that their institution's involvement in their four top ranked NL/SO's was greater in 1990 than it had been in 1980.

        "description":"In 1989, the Center for the Study of Community Colleges received a grant from the Ford Foundation to assist community colleges in defining their transfer rates and collecting data to support those definitions. The Center invited 240 community colleges with at least a 20% minority enrollment to participate in a Transfer Assembly. Interested institutions were asked to provide information on the number of their students (disaggregated by ethnicity) who had entered the college in fall 1984 with no prior college experience; the number of these students who had stayed at the institution long enough to attain at least 12 college credit units; and the number of that group who entered a senior institution within the ensuing 4 to 5 years. To assist the institutions, the Center staff  established a definition of transfer rate which would be valid, readily understandable to the layperson, and calculable with data that would be accessible to the college staff at a reasonable cost. At the 47 colleges providing usable data in 1989, 50% of the students entering in 1984 with no prior college experience had completed 12 units, and 23% of these students had transferred to a four-year institutions by spring 1989. Data gathered in 1990 from 40 colleges revealed that among students entering in 1985, 46% had completed at least 12 units and 24% had transferred by spring 1990. The paper concludes with suggested strategies for measuring community college success in their other, non-transfer purposes. (PAA)",

        "author":["Clagett, Craig A."],
        "description":"In forecasting its fall credit headcounts, the Office of Institutional Research and Analysis at Prince George's Community College (PGCC) utilizes the Component Yield Method (CYM), an enrollment projection model developed by the college's planning analyst in the early 1980's. By disaggregating enrolled students into multiple groups, each with an independently calculable enrollment forecast, a greater degree of accuracy is permitted in headcount forecasts as changes in any component can be factored separately into total retention figures. The following seven yield rates are used to forecast fall credit headcounts: (1) retention rate from prior spring; (2) enrollment rate of new graduates of county high schools; (3) percentage of county high school students concurrently enrolling at  PGCC; (4) enrollment rate of county residents other than current year high school graduates; (5) enrollment rate of residents of neighboring jurisdictions; (6) PGCC readmission rate; and (7) rate of transfer from other institutions. A baseline or \"stable rates\" forecast is made each year using yield rates based on the previous 3 years. With an assumption that all yield rates will remain unchanged from those realized in fall 1988, the CYM forecasts fall 1989 credit headcount of 13,831, nearly a 3% increase from fall 1988. Projected fall 1990 headcount is 13,988. An alternate headcount projection, seeking to account for unusually high expected transfers and readmissions, was obtained by using 1986-88 \"stable-rates\" averages. Examples of how the CYM operates when there are variations in  specific yield rate categories, and data tables are included. (GFW)",

        "description":"In 1988, a telephone survey was conducted of students at Prince George's Community College (PGCC) who were enrolled in fall 1987, but who were not registered for spring 1988. The purposes of the study were to ascertain students' reasons for not returning to PGCC and to determine what the college could have done to influence the non-returning students to stay. Out of an interviewee pool of 767 non-returning students, 343 (54%) were contacted and successfully interviewed. The demographic and academic characteristics of the respondents closely reflected those of the total target population of 5,222 non-returning PGCC students. When asked to cite their primary reason for not returning to PGCC, 22.3% gave reasons relating to employment, 12.2% indicated that they had transferred to  another school, 11.3% gave financial reasons, 9.2% said that they had achieved their immediate goal, and 6.3% cited health problems. To determine the demographic or academic characteristics that might have had an impact on the reasons for not returning to the college, students in each of these response categories were further subdivided for analysis by race, gender, age, full-/part-time status, most recent educational goal, admission status, and cumulative grade point average. Less than 20% of the respondents said the college could have done anything to have influenced them to return for the spring semester. Of the 315 people who responded to the question, 85% indicated they would be returning to PGCC.

Specifically, the evaluation would seek to answer the following key questions: (1) What is the impact of the OIR? (2) Does the office provide analytic studies and services that contribute in a positive way to a quality educational environment? (3) How effective is the operation of the office? (4) Does the office do needed studies or provide needed services? and (5) Does the office have necessary resources available to do  such tasks and provide such services? Data collection for the study will involve extensive personal interviews with those directly involved with institutional research, brief personal interviews with senior managers, group brainstorming interviews with staff members having knowledge of or contact with institutional research, and mail surveys of decision makers on the OIR mailing list. This evaluation plan includes the following: a review of the OIR's purpose and clients served; a description of the purpose of the evaluation, the audience for whom the evaluation will be conducted (e.g., the director of the OIR, and the president of the college); data collection procedures and timetables; the names and titles of the individuals to be surveyed and interviewed; data collection and analysis  procedures; the reporting strategy; and a copy of the 68-item test instrument.

The colleges were chosen to represent urban, suburban, and rural locales and different student populations (i.e., primarily middle-income white, ethnically diverse, and working-class white). Their reentry programs had been in operation since the early 1970's, and all had a reputation for success. Interviews were conducted with reentry program administrators and faculty affiliated with the programs. Study findings included the following: (1) all of the programs began in the late 1960's as women's centers or  educational outreach programs for particular groups, such as low-income women, displaced homemakers, single mothers, or a combination of these; (2) one of the major changes witnessed by all programs was a shift from a feminist orientation as a women's center to a program accommodating both men and women; (3) all were headed by female program coordinators; (4) all were highly individualized, taking into account the characteristics and unique needs of the targeted groups; (5) the programs sustained themselves only through constant struggle on the part of program directors; and (6) feelings about the shift away from a feminist orientation ranged from resigned support to outright criticism.

        "description":"In response to state directives related to the implementation of matriculation mandates, Spring Student Surveys have been conducted at Glendale Community College since 1986. The surveys are designed to: determine the level of student satisfaction with support services; seek evidence of the impact of matriculation funding on support services; evaluate orientation efforts; gauge the impact of counseling on student behavior; and assess the impact of the institution's commitment to non-discrimination in the provision of support services. Student opinions collected over the past five years have shown an increased recognition of, use of, and satisfaction with support services across all segments of the student population. Specifically, the following trends have been noted: (1) 1989  survey results showed an increase over previous years in recognition of and satisfaction with 16 of 17 support services, with only the admissions and records unit showing a percentage drop; (2) orientation activities were rated good or excellent by 60% of the 1989 respondents, compared with only 25% of the 1986 respondents; (3) the proportion of all students seeking counseling services increased significantly each year; (4) recognition and use of student services were lower among evening students, part-time students, and older students; (5) women were more likely than men to use the library and academic counseling services; and (6) satisfaction was highest among Armenian and Mexican students, and lowest among Korean students.

        "description":"In response to reduced state funding for faculty development in community colleges in Washington, the Faculty Association of Community Colleges and the State Board for Community College Education established a special committee in 1989 to make recommendations to enhance faculty development efforts at the 27 community colleges statewide. To determine faculty development needs, the committee surveyed the state's 2,684 full-time faculty to determine specific development needs, the degree of faculty interest in certain content areas, and the best methods for delivering faculty development activities. Study findings, based on a 70% response rate, included the following: (1) the highest interest area for all faculty regardless of their discipline, level of experience, gender or region,  was development activities for working with students (e.g., making goals and requirements clear, encouraging independent thought, and demonstrating interest in learning); (2) about 75% of the faculty in all disciplines expressed high interst in 6 of the other 25 faculty development topics (i.e., instructional methods, critical thinking, use of computers, use of technology in teaching, articulation with universities, and gaining expertise in a specific field); (3) faculty expressed the most interest in local workshops or individualized development activities (81% of the respondents were likely to participate in release time activities); and (4) barriers to participation included limited time and funding, and undesirable locations of activities. The survey instrument, with numerical and  percentage results for each question, is included. (JMC)",

        "description":"In 1990, a study was conducted at Illinois Central College (ICC) to identify pre- and post-enrollment variables that could serve as predictors of student persistence and to compare persistence between vocational and academic program students. From a population of 656 Applied Science students and 671 Arts and Science students who were first-time, full-time, degree-seeking enrollees in fall 1987, a random sample of 75 students was selected from each group. Students were classified as persisters if, by fall 1989, they had graduated, had requested a transcript sent to a four-year institution, or were still enrolled. Pre-enrollment variables included age, gender, race, American College Testing Program (ACT) score, high school rank and class size, and stated educational goal.  Post-enrollment data were obtained from student transcripts. Additionally, a telephone survey of persisters examined self-reported success factors. Study findings included the following: (1) no significant difference was found in persistence rates of vocational and academic program students; (2) among pre-enrollment variables, only ACT scores, student age, and high school percentile were found to be significantly related to student persistence; (3) grade point average and course withdrawal rates were the only significant post-enrollment variables; (4) students surveyed indicated that teachers were the institutional factor most important to their success, while family was the most important personal factor, followed by work, money and transportation. The survey instrument, tabulated survey  results, and a 30-item bibliography are included. (JMC)",

The study was conducted by sending questionnaires to a national sample of 1,500 third through sixth grade teachers. The objectives of the study were: (1) to learn about school use of 3-2-1 CONTACT, SQUARE ONE TV, and other programs; (2) to understand how and when these programs are used in schools, and teachers' opinions of the educational value and content of the programs; (3) to describe the market environment for the use of educational programing, including the availability of programs and supporting materials, and influences on the use of programing; and (4) to understand the characteristics of the market, the teachers who comprise it,  and related school and district characteristics. Questionnaire items focused on how teachers use programs, teacher assessment of program characteristics, how teachers get information about programing, and teachers' characteristics. Results revealed that media centers and specialists play an important role in providing information about and access to education programs; educational television is used more often for enrichment than for instruction; and teachers prefer programs that deal with a single topic and are 15-30 minutes long. The questionnaire and data tables are appended. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Schools typically place a high value on the dominant middle-class approach to becoming literate: they expect all children to arrive at school familiar with books and able to discuss stories. However, community use of printed materials varies, resulting in a large number of nonmainstream children deemed at risk for school failure at an early age. In an effort to address this situation, a study examined the effects of including shared book reading activities in an urban preschool program that identified at-risk children through assessment of child and family characteristics. A year-long intervention supplemented the regular program with weekly classroom reading and sharing of simple books; use of book topics for writing and dramatic play; and shared book reading by parents and  children at home. The study employed a quasi-experimental control design with multiple converging measures of children's knowledge of language and literacy constructs and parent questionnaire responses. Multivariate and univariate analyses revealed that literacy development can be fostered through the incorporation of shared book reading. Pre- and posttest comparisons also revealed that at-risk children can make substantial growth in language development, print concept awareness, letter knowledge, writing, and reading abilities.

Content focuses on: (1) a rationale for youth community service; (2) the young adolescent and community service; (3) appropriate roles for young adolescents; (4) sponsorship of youth community service; (5) the placement site and the students; (6) community service in middle school reform; (7) community-based programs; and (8) barriers to community service. Described in detail is the Early Adolescent Helper Program at the City University of New York's Center for Advanced Study in Education, a program that has promoted youth service for young adolescents since 1982. Extensive attention is given to school-based and community-based programs. It is concluded that  a strong program of community service, structured to give every young adolescent an opportunity to participate and to experience the empowerment that comes with making a difference, can be a positive step toward addressing some of the critical problems facing society and youth. Establishing community service as an integral part of the program in middle level schools could constitute an important first step in true reform. (RH)",

Generally speaking, the programs covered the prescriptive steps fairly well, but largely ignored the descriptive research. The external validity of the programs was analyzed in terms of evaluation studies of the programs. Many of the curricula had considerable face validity: their  underlying principles seemed plausible. Implementation of curricula was often imaginative. It is noted that the fact that the programs have gotten as far as they have shows enormous commitment and ingenuity. However, before a strong case could be made for adopting any of the programs, the program in question would need to give greater attention to its pedagogical underpinnings and the measurable impacts of the program on behavior. Programs reviewed used decision making and general thinking skills curricula. Life skills and social skills programs were also reviewed. Citations number 146. (RH)",

        "description":"From the mid-1960s until 1980, adolescent drug use rose sharply. Although use has declined somewhat since, adolescent cocaine use remains at peak levels, and crack presents a major threat. Treatment for compulsive drug or alcohol use is needed by 5 to 15 percent of the teenagers who experiment with drugs and alcohol. Drug abuse experts now believe that reducing demand for drugs through education and prevention programs is the most promising strategy for combatting drugs. However, past prevention and education efforts have generally proved unsuccessful in reducing substance use. Reaching adolescents who have dropped out of school and are at highest risk for substance abuse is extremely difficult. During the past 6 years, federal drug policy has emphasized supply control. The  Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 represents an important first step in developing a comprehensive, well-funded national response to the drug problem. However, a cabinet-level office is needed to lead and coordinate agencies and insure the implementation of a comprehensive, coherent national strategy. Citations number 92. (RH)",

Those testifying included representatives from the Administration Association, the Committee for Economic Development; and others. Recounting past successes, ongoing efforts to improve the program, and future plans, officials requested that the program be continued. Particular attention was given to the success of participating parents for whom Head Start was the gateway to upward mobility and also to the success of young  adults who participated in the program in childhood. This testimony is supplemented by reports of research that identifies characteristic features of successful intervention programs in the fields of health, early childhood education, and social services. Viewpoints on the importance of investment in early childhood education were also offered by the National Alliance of Business and the Children's Defense Fund.

While there can be no argument against accident and injury prevention, an argument can be made about the extent to which recommended playground standards should be allowed to restrict children's developmental play. Safety standards are producing playgrounds that are colorful and cute rather than challenging and complementary to children's development. Construction of safe playgrounds involves consideration of a few important developmental facts. First, children are natural explorers of their limitations,  seeking higher levels of challenge that will enhance their repertoire of skills and competencies. Second, what is safe and unsafe to an adult is often a matter of personal perception, judgment, and past experience. Third, children with high and low self-efficacy differ in their perception of what they can do with the skills they possess. A challenge and a hazard differ in that a hazard is something that is hidden, or at least not perceived by the child, while a challenge is something the child may see as dangerous. Playgrounds must provide numerous entry levels with ascending increments of challenge. (RH)",

The program was developed to provide factual information about puberty and sexuality which would serve as a basis for increased communication about sexuality between parents and children. The 2-hour program was presented by male and female human development specialists from the Cooperative Extension Service of the University of Georgia or other specially trained professionals. The program provided separate sessions for parents and sons aged 10-13 and for parents and daughters aged 10-13. Videos were used to provide information and stimulate discussion. Questions from participants influenced the depth of the  discussion. Follow-up evaluation data from a sample of 35 fathers, 150 mothers, 70 boys, and 98 girls indicated that programs which reach their audience only once can in fact make a difference in the attitudes, knowledge, and behavior of participants. Findings also indicated factors that had a critical influence on communication about sexuality and sexual values, the degree to which parents assumed responsibility for such communication, and the particular needs of parents residing in rural areas.

The dependent variable was marital happiness; independent variables of greatest interest concerned parenting. The study was designed to provide detailed information on relationships between demographic, situational, and interactional variables and marital happiness among recent national probability samples of black husbands and wives. Although the study focused on parental variables, several potentially confounding variables were also investigated. Findings indicated that the presence of minor children at home was significantly related to parents' marital happiness. However, the relationship was complex and involved the ages  and numbers of the children. Sex of parent was an important variable, with mothers more negatively affected than fathers, by numbers and ages of children in the home. Husbands were happiest with their marriages in families with preschool or teenage children, while wives were happiest with few or no minor children, or with preschool children. Additional variables such as income, age, education, health, frequency of church attendance, spouse's education, number of children born, and number of persons in the household were also investigated for their relationship to marital happiness.

The first function has been usurped by commercial firms, the second by the state. Some functions remain: physically and emotionally gratifying the family's adult members, socializing the family's children into community mores, and promoting the children's development. Four social policy initiatives will increase the likelihood that children will thrive in today's family environments: (1) protecting young mothers and their children against poverty; (2) providing paid parental leave after childbirth; (3) assuring access to quality day care; and (4) educating  students for parenthood in the public schools. Taken together, these elements of a comprehensive national policy on child development can make a significant contribution to the future of the nation's children. (RH)",

        "description":"In general, the preparation and professional development of the early childhood work force is affected by three conditions: demand for quality, the operative fiscal and regulatory environment, and compensation. If all the conditions were right, the system would work. In reality, these conditions, and therefore the preparation and professional development that depend on them, vary considerably depending on the settings, the age ranges of children served, and the programs associated with the funding streams that support early childhood programs. Head Start is an example of a system in which demand, regulation, and compensation are addressed, though not with equal emphasis. The planned expansion of Head Start to all eligible children will put stress on this system. In addition,  program expansion fueled by the Family Support Act (FSA) has the potential to affect preparation and staff develoment throughout the child care community, both in and outside of the traditional regulatory arena. This is due to FSA's expansion of the forms of &quot;legitimate&quot; child care to include forms not currently regulated. While the obvious direct ways to improve the quality of child care are not considered allowable expenses under the FSA, the act nevertheless offers unique opportunities to affect the conditions that constrain the preparation and development of the work force.

This problem is compounded by the limited amount of attention that the topic of early childhood teacher preparation and professional development has received from researchers and policymakers. This paper addresses this situation by making an attempt to define the issues and describe some of what is known about the financing of professional preparation. Three questions are of particular interest: (1) Why is the financing of preparation and professional development so important to this work force? (2) What is known about costs and expenditures for early childhood training? (3) What should a research and policy agenda include  in regard to financing issues? The second question is treated extensively. Several federal sources of training funds are identified, and a publication that lists examples of private sector support for training center-based and family day care providers throughout the country is cited. Concluding remarks advance four strategies for moving the policy agenda forward: (1) expand federal legislation; (2) disseminate information regarding legislative models; (3) promote private sector investments; and (4) launch a public awareness campaign on the need for qualified staff.

The first objective under that goal is that of providing high quality and developmentally appropriate preschool programs for all disadvantaged and disabled children. This paper seeks to assist efforts to achieve that objective by defining key concepts and providing background information concerning the size of the target population, levels of preschool participation by disadvantaged and disabled children, and indicators of the quality of the programs in which disadvantaged and disabled children are enrolled. Enrollment patterns are described in terms of the preschool participation of disadvantaged children, private versus public programs,  trends in enrollment by income across time, differences by race and Hispanic origin, preprimary enrollment levels among Hispanic children, Head Start, prekindergarten programs supported by Chapter 1 funds, and state-funded prekindergarten programs. Data indicate that about half of the 4-year-olds in poor families nationwide receive preschool instruction, either from Head Start, Chapter 1, or state-funded programs. The same is true for less than 20 percent of poor 3-year-olds. By 5 years of age, nearly all children from low-income families are enrolled in public school kindergarten or prekindergarten programs. An appendix describes the kind of data system that would be desirable for the monitoring of progress toward the objective of providing high quality programs to all disadvantaged  children.

Models include those derived from early childhood education and school partnerships with parents as policymakers, as volunteers in the program, and as facilitators of children's development. Barriers include physical or psychological distance between teachers and parents, lack of teacher training, race and class biases, limited views of parental involvement, and perceptions of the school as limited to the provision of instruction. Concluding remarks emphasize that the creation of an atmosphere of cooperation and understanding between  schools and parents will require a dramatic change in the way in which our nation views its schools. It is pointed out that if children are to meet new academic challenges and realize success, the nation's schools must evolve to the point where parents and schools capitalize on each other's knowledge and abilities. Mutual partnership between parents and schools will ensure that all children arrive at school each day ready to receive an education. Appended is a parent resource guide describing 18 experiences that promote children's development and prepare them for school. (RH)",

        "description":"This paper presents an overview of the development of child support in America. A review of the English common law from which U.S. laws evolved provides a glimpse into the ways that institutions of marriage and the family were viewed in the 19th century. The development of American law reflects the transformation of family structure by technological and economic advances. Changing gender roles, greater control over reproduction, increased longevity, and geographic and occupational mobility, are some factors that are shaped by such advances. These factors exert a powerful influence on marriage and the family; in particular, they have brought about increases in families headed by never-married and divorced mothers. A disproportionate share of these families live in poverty. The  collection of child support is seen as a remedy to the burgeoning problem of children and mothers on welfare. This link between welfare and child support has moved the locus of control from a state to a federal issue. The Family Support Act of 1988 has brought about dramatic change in child support through a requirement that states develop a rebuttable presumption schedule. The Family Support Act also moves to narrow gaps in collection of support in two of the most troublesome types of cases, paternity and interstate. Proposals for changing the child support system are discussed. (Author/RH)",

Introductory notes on cooking experiences for Head Start children and suggested menus for young children are followed by nine units. The curriculum incorporates a variety of teaching techniques and learning experinces which allow for flexibility and easy adaptation. Lessons are detailed enough to allow individuals with no formal teaching experience or nutrition training to present worthwhile nutrition education activities. Lessons can be easily modified to match the capabilities of nearly all preschoolers. Many lessons encourage parent involvement and are enhanced by parent participation. All lessons provide background  information, guidelines for conducting the program, and lists of resources. This curriculum is self-contained; no other materials, except art supplies, food, and food preparation equipment, are needed. A list of 269 references, including preschool curricula, books for preschoolers, materials for teachers and parents, and audiovisual materials for preschoolers, teachers, and parents is appended, as is a list of sources of inexpensive nutrition education teaching aids.

        "description":"For this study of the influence of the diameter of implements on children's drawing products, performances, and preferences, toddlers and preschoolers were observed while they drew with primary (larger-sized) and standard markers, pencils, and crayons. The relationship between drawing and early home manipulative experience was also investigated. A total of 20 children were observed while they completed spontaneous drawings, geometric form copying, and tasks involving the drawing of a girl or a boy. The tasks were taken from the Riley Preschool Developmental Screening Inventory (1969). Findings revealed that levels of symbolic representation in free drawings, geometric forms, drawings of boys or girls, and handgrips, were similar for primary and standard instruments. More children  claimed to like the standard instrument than to dislike it. Early home manipulative experience, including buttoning, cutting with scissors, coloring and drawing, and building with Duplo or Lego materials, was related to children's more mature drawing products and performances. It is concluded that results confirm findings of previous studies that indicate that even very young children are able users of standard drawing instruments. (Author/RH)",

McDevitt and Carey's (1978) Behavioral Style Questionnaire was used to assess children's temperament by means of mothers' reports. Teaching behaviors of interest were assessed with the Maternal Teaching Observation Technique (Laosa, 1980). Behaviors included inquiry, use of directives, negative verbal feedback, modeling, visual cues, physical affection, and positive and negative physical control. Correlational analyses revealed relationships between characteristics of children's temperament and the teaching techniques mothers used to teach the children. In comparison with others in the sample,  children identified as slower to adapt had mothers who offered less praise and more negative verbal feedback. Mothers of children who were described as having a positive mood used less negative verbal feedback while teaching. Children with higher levels of distractibility had mothers who used more modeling. The lower the child's sensory threshold, the fewer the negative verbal comments by the mother and the more the visual cues by the mother. (RH)",

Since 1988, the Far West Laboratory's Center for Child and Family Studies and agencies in two low-income communities have been collaborating members of the Bay Area Early Intervention Program (BAEIP). BAEIP organizes agency services and develops new ones so as to create a coordinated support system that serves families from pregnancy through the child's eighth year. The program's intervention model consists of two interrelated efforts: the Augmented Family Advocacy System (AFAS) and the Community Services Support System (CSSS). AFAS uses a home-based, case management strategy to deal with program participants, while CSSS works with community  institutions, informal networks, and service agencies to facilitate their coordination, collaboration, and support in providing assistance to families. In this report, information from the work done in the two low-income communities involved in BAEIP is used to illustrate the manner in which facilitation activities took place and the needs and issues that those who attempt similar interventions should expect to encounter.

Five students attended a daily play session in block and housekeeping play settings that had been established for the purposes of motivating student activity and increasing appropriate play with toys, and increasing socially competent behaviors relevant to classroom expectations. Sessions were videotaped. Students were able to expand on their skills and were free to take risks without fear of rules imposed by adults. Before each play group session, students sat on the floor with a participating teacher and planned their involvement.  Students concentrated on the area they preferred to play in, the materials they wanted to play with, the actions they proposed to undertake with the materials, and the students they wanted as playmates. When situations involving inappropriate behaviors arose, students were shown their behaviors on tape. Immediately afterwards, appropriate ways to play and interact were taught and modeled. After students practiced modeled behaviors, they viewed their taped behaviors and discussed their involvement. Practicum evaluation data indicated increases in social competence.

Of these, 83 percent were children in families in which the mother was employed. The other 17 percent were in families in which the mother was not employed. In general, younger children tended to be in less formal care arrangements and older children were more likely to be in formal, organized group care situations. The data on the stability of care show that a substantial proportion of the children had experienced a change in child care arrangements during the preceding year. There is surprisingly little variation in the stabilty of child care arrangements for children of  various ages. Characteristics of child care arrangements varied according to a number of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. These included race and ethnicity, region and place of residence, family income, and mother's education. Further analysis of these differentials by means of a multivariate approach, will increase knowledge of the factors that influence choices about types of child care arrangements. (RH)",

        "description":"At the elementary school level, promising new early intervention programs, such as the Reading Recovery Program (RRP), show ways to succeed with students in the primary grades. The RRP targeted the poorest readers in a first grade class, who were given supplemental, one-to-one planned lessons for 30 minutes each day by a specially trained teacher. The program demonstrated that most participating students were able to keep up with their class after 15-20 weeks in the program. Such programs challenge educators to review their expectations and reconsider what are the most appropriate modes of instruction for at-risk students. In order to strengthen intervention and to prevent problems for disadvantaged students later on, Arizona's legislature earmarked $3 million for competitive  grants. The funding was to be awarded in increments of up to $250,000 to school districts that developed projects to identify and test effective early interventions with at-risk students. This information brief profiles three Arizona schools that received the funding: the summer school at Ash Fork, the before- and after-school programs at Littleton, and the school-within-a-school in Ganado. Each of the schools is characterized by a challenging student population and is the lone elementary school in a small district. In each school, themes such as concentrated staff effort, enriched curriculum, and extended quality time are prominent. (RH)",

        "description":"This report documents the internal investigative process that was used at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop a model of child care and services for MIT parents which might be relevant to other institutions. Topics discussed include: (1) the history of MIT's involvement in child care; (2) the origin and charge of MIT's Committee on Family and Work; (3) the committee's data gathering activities; and (4) the committee's preliminary findings. Findings concern MIT culture; marital status, dual career families, and parenthood; child care and services for MIT parents; and elder care. The presentation of findings is supplemented by materials identifying major issues regarding work and family and discussions of the ways in which these issues are manifested in the  MIT community. It is recommended that MIT should adopt a statement of principle dealing with the relation between work and personal life; make its informal policies about flexibility more explicit; clarify and improve its parental and personal leave policies; create a family and work program and council; use a broader concept of family when defining family privileges and benefits; help parents attend conferences held at MIT; and provide more housing near campus.

        "description":"In 1987, the United States Senate established the Special Committee to investigate American Indian affairs. Fraud, corruption, and mismanagement were found pervading the institutions serving American Indians. Corruption was also discovered in Indian tribal governments. The Committee faulted Congress for failing to adequately oversee and reform Indian affairs. After 2 years, the Committee reported that the pattern of abuse is endemic because Congress has never fully rejected the paternalism of the 19th century. The U.S. government maintains a stifling bureaucratic presence in Indian country, and fails to deal with tribal governments as responsible partners. The Committee recommends the creation of a new federalism for American Indians which negotiates agreements with tribes,  abolishes paternalism and, while providing the requisite federal funds, allows tribal governments to stand free, independent, responsible, and accountable. This report provides a brief history of congressional investigations and American Indian affairs from 1789 to 1989. The report lists findings on economic development and Indian preference contracting, child sexual abuse in federal schools, the federal government and American Indian natural resources, the Indian Health Service, Indian housing, and corruption among tribal governmental officials. Legislative recommendations are included. (ALL)",

        "author":["Salstrom, Paul"],
        "description":"The roots of Appalachia's economic dependency go back to the region's first settlers in the 1730s. Historical and theoretical analysis of this phenomenon is useful in understanding the current status of the area, including, the status of education. The early settler sought a &quot;competency&quot;--enough productive property to support a family. Under preindustrial conditions, dependence on outside markets was not likely to cause impoverishment. But industrialization elsewhere in the United States led to far greater productivity outside Appalachia than inside, followed by unequal exchange of the time and work required to produce units of comparable economic value, thus cheapening the value-in-trade of Appalachia's labor. Appalachia's people could have avoided impoverishment by maintaining  their competencies and sustaining themselves through self-sufficiency and local exchange. Unfortunately, farmers practiced partible inheritance and tended to produce large families that continually diminished their competencies. In the early 1900s many men worked away from home in mines, logging camps, and other enterprises, while women ran the farms. In macro terms, this amounted to a process whereby subsistence farming subsidized industrialization in Appalachia by furnishing non-monetized income to industrial workers' families. During the Depression, New Deal relief payments greatly increased Appalachia's import surplus, weaned many people from their customary self-supporting activities, and eroded the mountains' informal economy--networks of subsistence production, bartering, and  borrowing. Today, non-monetized networking could be the basis for a new model of voluntary reciprocity that would increase Appalachia's internal purchasing power and subsidize grassroots economic development.

        "author":["Blaustein, Richard"],
        "description":"As a multidisciplinary approach, Appalachian studies may provide insights for understanding the context of education in the region. Appalachia is marginal to the official centers of political, economic, and cultural power in the South just as the South is marginal to the core of official power in the United States. In both cases the result is ambiguous identity and conflicting tendencies towards acceptance or rejection of the hegemony--the authority of a dominant elite who establishes society's cultural standards. Questions of cultural dominance and subordination divide core from periphery in any complex society and create identity conflicts that pull marginal, nonelite personalities between the poles of assimilation and separatism. A continuous history of marginality and  subordination has left the descendants of North British borderers who migrated to Appalachia with an impaired sense of autonomous identity and self-worth. This ambivalence is compounded by the ambivalence of the core culture towards its own advancement. As in many other places, the &quot;folk&quot; is seen by intellectuals as both a backward illiterate segment of the population and the romanticized remnant of a national patrimony. The selective reconstruction or wholesale invention of folk traditions compensates for feelings of cultural inferiority in peripheral intellectuals. Folk revivalism is only one form that counter-hegemonic movements have taken. In Appalachian studies, the apparent conflict between the &quot;action folk&quot; and the &quot;cultural folk&quot; has become less intense with the growing  realization that these positions represent alternate solutions to the fundamental problem of marginality, subordination, and the consequent need for self-actualization.

Part I discusses developmental phases in the formal education of indigenous minorities: (1) initial rejection of formal education imposed by the majority society; (2) gradual acceptance of formal education as the minority becomes acculturated and urbanized, sometimes accompanied by a rejection of native language and culture; and (3) revitalization of the traditional language and culture, a process often nurtured by the majority society within the school system. Part II discusses Sami schooling within this framework and describes bilingual education efforts, school financing and organization, specialization of teacher education for the Sami school, and school governance by Sami  councils. Part III weighs questions of educational equity and the feasibility of cultural revitalization for a small cultural minority group, and suggests differences in the situation at the individual and societal levels. Part IV outlines a systematic framework for investigating these questions at the societal level and for determining economic, organizational, and administrative solutions. (SV)",

        "description":"This guide is intended to help districts and schools think about how their programs for educationally deprived children are designed and how they can be improved. In view of new Chapter 1 legislation (P.L. 100-297), which places strong emphasis on program improvement to disadvantaged students, practitioners need to internalize elements of new policy and integrate them with age-old principles of good teaching. In its first section, the guide describes five basic principles for successfully planning and implementing Chapter 1 programs: (1) acquisition of basic and advanced skills; (2) intensive early intervention; (3) staff coordination; (4) extra quality time for students to learn new concepts and skills; and (5) parent involvement. The second section of the guide describes  Chapter 1 programs in three school districts, which differ in size and educational approach, to illustrate successful attention to the five principles. Chinle, Arizona, is located in the midst of a rural Indian reservation. Its program shows how the local Indian culture and environment can be used to make curriculum interesting and educationally relevant. Juab, Utah, is a small district that has undergone major school improvement efforts. It provides an example of how Chapter 1 services can be integrated into the regular instructional program. Long Beach, California, is an urban district that has successfully coordinated programs and added quality time to low-achieving students' instructional day. This document includes 16 references.

The teacher in the case wants his students to attend college or vocational school and volunteers for the difficult position of &quot;site guidance counselor.&quot; The report describes the teacher's efforts to develop a guidance program, his concerns about whether he is pushing his students too hard and whether his aspirations for  them conflict with their Indian cultural values. It describes how he plans a special 2-week guidance project, the result of his project, and what finally happens to the students the year after high school. Discussion questions encourage prospective teachers to consider cultural shifts and conflicts faced by the rural Yup'ik students, their understanding of possible adult lifestyles, possible modifications in the guidance program, and the measures of its success. Other topics discussed include the following: (1) the nurturing nature of rural Indian villages that might hinder students' ability to prepare for adulthood; (2) college entrance rates in Alaska by ethnicity and gender; (3) participation of Inupiat men and women in the wage economy; (4) counseling programs in small rural high  schools; and (5) broadening students' experience with travel programs.

The case is accompanied by discussion questions designed to present prospective teachers with complex professional problems, asking them to interpret the situation and decide upon possible solutions. The report was written to develop teaching students' abilities to spot issues and frame problems as a new teacher in a highly factionalized school environment. The case opens with a confrontation between a senior student, Jeanne Campbell, and school vice principal Frank Leyden. According to Jeanne, Leyden told her that young women who dressed provocatively were \"asking for it\" when she suggested that he sponsor a rape awareness workshop. The vice principal asserts that  Jeanne had misinterpreted his remarks. Austin Nickerson, a new English teacher, is asked to witness the confrontation and must make a public statement about the meeting when Jeanne's parents consider bringing suit against Leyden. Nickerson is also witness to a host of other gender-related problems involving students, faculty, and administration at the school. Questions following the case report encourage extensive discussion regarding the high school staff's responses to gender-related problems both in the school at large and in the classroom. Two exercises ask teaching students to analyze Nickerson's reading requirements and assess his classroom techniques for possible gender bias. The case is based on authentic occurrences at a large urban high school, but names and identifying details  have been changed to protect confidentiality. (TES)",

        "description":"This paper describes the development and implementation of plans to establish professional development schools (PDS) in West Virginia. The conceptualization of this project began with consultant recommendations and faculty discussions at West Virginia University (WVU) concerning needs for reforms in teacher preparation and in the public schools. The consensus was that improvements in preparation programs had to occur simultaneously and in conjunction with schools. A team of WVU faculty and public school teachers and administrators formed in early 1988 to propose criteria to select PDS--regular public schools with which the university could work intensively. The team visited other collaborative projects around the country, identified opportunities and barriers in the creation of  PDS, proposed pilot PDS projects in clinical experiences, and conceptualized the elements of a 5-year development plan. Following project funding by the Benedum Foundation in December 1988, a new team of university and public school educators was formed to clarify the nature of PDS, develop the belief statements that would guide PDS interactions and activities, develop the PDS application and application process, and select and train the review team that would recommend PDS sites. In November 1989, applications were mailed to all 70 schools in the four-county area around WVU. The review team selected six schools as PDS sites. This paper contains 13 references, PDS belief statements, and the PDS application form. (SV)",

        "description":"This report profiles the condition of education in California's rural and small schools, placing public schooling and rurality into their social and economic contexts. The data focus on three issues: (1) the economic and social environments in which schools operate; (2) characteristics of rural schools, students, and teachers; and (3) school-improvement resources. California's counties are classified as rural, urban, mixed rural, or mixed urban. With more than 28 million people, California is the most populous state in the nation, with a broad ethnic mix. The state's population more than doubled between 1950 and 1980 and its economy is measurably strong. In 1988, the state's employment rate was 67%, slightly above the national average. In general, rural counties experience  greater unemployment than urban counties. Rural schools made up 14.9% of the state's public schools, educating 8.5% of California's students in 1988. Rural schools are more homogenous than urban schools, but the rural student population is becoming more ethnically diverse. Because rural schools vary in size, economies of scale and allocating funds on a per-pupil basis work against rural schools for fixed operating costs. Attracting teachers to rural schools is difficult because of social isolation, lower salaries, limited mobility, and lack of personal privacy. California School Improvement Program (SIP) is a primary vehicle for rural school reform. SIP funds are used to improve curriculum, instruction, school climate, and school-community relations. The California School Leadership  Academy offers a training program to address managerial, instructional, and curriculum leadership skills. (TES)",

Representing the most comprehensive such study to date, the project was initiated by Appalachian residents in 1978 to examine whether and how land ownership patterns, especially corporate and absentee ownership, underlie or contribute to policy issues the region faces. The study surveyed 80 counties in 6 states: Alabama; Kentucky; North Carolina; Tennessee; Virginia; and West Virginia. In general, the study found ownership of land and minerals in rural Appalachia to be highly concentrated among a few absentee and corporate owners, resulting in little land actually being available or accessible to local people. These ownership patterns are a key underlying element  in explaining inadequate local tax revenues and services, lack of economic development, loss of agricultural lands, lack of sufficient housing, education, energy development, and land use in the region. A listing of chapter headings follows: (1) &quot;Land Ownership: A National Issue, and an Appalachian Issue&quot;; (2) &quot;Who Owns the Land and Minerals?

        "description":"Health needs and health services in rural America are key issues directly related to education as well as community well-being. This report examines rural America's access to basic health care services and discusses options for congressional consideration. The focus is on trends in availability of primary and acute rural health care and on factors affecting those trends. The report describes the characteristics of rural populations and health programs, the availability of rural health services and personnel, and delivery of rural maternal and infant health and mental health care services. On each subject, options for congressional action are examined. The federal government currently finances several different types of rural health care programs, and has a strong interest in  health care trends. Major declines in inpatient utilization, compounded by increasing amounts of uncompensated care, have undermined the financial health of many rural hospitals, which also are faced with the outmigration of rural residents to urban areas for care. Policy reform options are presented in regard to: (1) improvement of rural health facilities; (2) availability and training of health professionals in rural areas; and (3) enhancing maternal and infant care programs and mental health care programs in rural areas. This document contains numerous charts, graphics, data tables, and appendices that present background information about the study. It also includes a 745-item bibliography and a subject index.

        "description":"This collection contains 15 essays by teachers who participated in the First Annual Rural Alaska Instructional Improvement Academy in Fairbanks in May 1987. The essays were written as a follow-up to the academy, based on the teachers' reflections on their own experiences in rural schools as well as on the academy workshops they attended and on the four readings included in section 3 of this publication. The teachers were asked to write about either their own notions of the ideal schooling process for rural Alaska (section 1 of the essays) or what they considered to be an appropriate curriculum unit for village schools (section 2). Essays in section 1 discuss culturally relevant education for Alaska Natives; empowerment of communities, particularly Native villages with tribal  governments; a process-oriented curriculum with a project-centered approach to experiential learning; school-community cooperation; parent-student involvement in activities strengthening different types of intelligence; community-based curriculum; obstacles to educational change; and cultural and multicultural education. In the second section, the essays on proposed curriculum units contain suggestions for: (1) use of rabbit snaring to teach kindergarten and first grade language arts; (2) implementing a senior research and writing project on jobs held by non-Natives in Native villages; (3) involving third graders in projects related to the Sister School Exchange Program and the Australaska Writing Project; (4) teaching Japanese culture to high school students using the movie &quot;Ran&quot;; and  (5) teaching Japanese culture to elementary students through music. The teachers' background readings contained in the third and final section are the following: &quot;The Axe Handle Academy: A Proposal for a Bioregional, Thematic Humanities Education&quot; (Ron and Suzanne Scollon); &quot;Culture, Community and the Curriculum&quot; (Ray Barnhardt); &quot;The Development of an Integrated Bilingual and Cross-Cultural Curriculum in an Arctic School District&quot; (Helen Roberts); and &quot;Weaving Curriculum Webs: The Structure of Nonlinear Curriculum&quot; (Rebecca Corwin, George Hein, and Diane Levin).

        "author":["Brown, Ralph B."],
        "description":"Effective rural education depends on active community involvement. This ethnographic case study examines three models of community organization as an explanation of how community action occurs. The three models are: (1) individuals interacting in formal and informal groups; (2) networks of \"weak ties\" effective for diffusing information and capitalizing on opportunities created by access to that information; and (3) a centralized weak-tie network based on the premise that a small number of people who know many is more effective than a large number of people who know few. The study attempts to reconstruct events leading various community actors to seek formation of an industrial base as an economic development alternative to agriculture. The study also examines the roles of unique  events, specific people, and strategies for the formation of the industrial base in a small community. It was found that unique macroevents played a large role in the community's concern for economic alternatives and in its success in developing those alternatives. Such events also were important to certain community individuals, placing them in key positions to act for industrial development. Thus, community-action strategies were found to be most consistent with the \"centralized weak-tie network\" hypothesis. However, the irony of this type of centralized leadership network and the type of community action it creates is that its very success at the community level is dependent on only a select segment of the community having a vital say, thus excluding the community population as a  whole.

        "description":"The 1988-89 study reported in this paper focused on teacher attrition, examining the characteristics of beginning teachers in North Dakota. The purpose was to compare characteristics of those teachers who stayed in their first positions with those who left. The study gathered data by surveying school administrators and elementary and secondary teachers, primarily those who stayed in their positions. The data suggests that 22.4% of North Dakota's new teachers leave their first teaching jobs after only one year. A majority of teachers who leave their first jobs accept teaching positions elsewhere, usually in larger communities. Teacher characteristics associated with high attrition included: (1) not being certified in a portion of the teaching assignment; (2) beginning by working  in a small community; (3) beginning a career in the northwestern part of the state; (4) being new to the community; and (5) being a specialist. Teachers who left their first jobs were likely to be among the more effective teachers, and were unlikely to be recipients of appropriate staff development. Teachers who reported dissatisfaction did not necessarily leave their positions. The paper concludes that support is needed for new teachers in North Dakota and for the schools that receive them. Recommendations for reducing the attrition rate include building-level orientation, fair assignment practices, provision of housing, &quot;home base&quot; schools for specialists, outreach to new teachers on the part of professional networks, and, perhaps most critically, staff development. The appendix  contains the two survey questionnaires. (TES)",

Not all the desired information was found in every report, due to the fact that the states develop their own locally-relevant criteria for  collecting and reporting information. The report should not be viewed as a national data collection or as an attempt to provide a statistically valid national profile of migrant programs.

The tribe has grown from a $6,000 budget in 1965 to todays' multimillion dollar enterprise. In 1980 the Tribe implemented a plan for socioeconomic self-sufficiency to improve the living conditions, health, and education of tribal members. Eighteen participants, including members of the Winnebago Tribal Council, tribal administrative staff, and community dissidents, were involved in a 2-day planning session. Two consensus methodologies were used to identify, clarify, and structure the anticipated problems relevant to implementing a self-sufficiency plan. The Nominal Group Technique (NGT) was used to  guide the participants through the identification and clarification of the barriers to implementation. Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) was used to assist the participants in organizing the problems in a priority structure. A third consensus methodology, idea writing, was used to help teams focus on a particular set of problems identified in the priority structure and to generate options for alleviating the problems. One figure and one table of problems and priority structures are included; 19 reference are attached. (GGH)",

        "description":"Recent work by both neoclassical and political economists suggests the scope of the influence of economic structures on rural socioeconomic conditions and rural education. In particular, dual labor-market analyses look beneath the surface of the macroeconomy--the national economy--to the underlying reality of regional or sectoral economic structures. According to Jane Jacobs' economic critiques, macroeconomic analysis in large nations or empires obscures the importance of local structures and processes. Rural areas render specialized service to the national economy by serving as sites for specialized production of marginal enterprises including energy, minerals, food, and simple manufactured goods. A frequently endorsed strategy for rural development is the improvement of human  capital in rural areas through education and training. This strategy is of questionable value as the socially created structures that govern the macroeconomy appear to require the economic marginality of rural areas. Rural schools that aim only to develop students' human capital are preparing them to accept the increasingly marginal role reserved for rural areas by the American macroeconomy. Schools can not directly change the social and economic structures in which they are embedded. Their mission, rather, should be to equip students with an intimate knowledge of their culture and with the tools of judgment and reason. This paper contain 68 references. (SV)",

        "description":"This paper examines the degree to which high-school course offerings are unequally distributed across schools, paying attention to relationships between school size and the incidence of new course titles in various curriculum areas. The inquiry is based on the presumption that economies of scale play a role in educational opportunity. The study is based on data from 1,015 New York high schools responding for the &quot;High School and Beyond&quot; surveys. It asks how economies of scale manifest themselves in curricular offerings, differentiating between academic and vocational offerings and among high schools across urban, suburban, and rural settings. The data reveal a strong positive relationship between school size and the available number of unduplicated full-year courses and credit  offerings. Among like-sized high schools, those considering themselves &quot;rural&quot; offer fewer unduplicated full-year courses. Rural schools, however, offer a comparable or larger number of part-year courses than their like-sized counterparts. The results suggest that large-school students benefit disproportionally in the foreign language and arts portions of the curriculum. Rural schools offer fewer different courses compared to similarly sized nonrural schools. As school size increases, the number of basic courses grows at a rate slower than the number of both remedial and advanced courses. The findings show that both school size and rurality have consequences for educational opportunity and that these consequences are distributed unequally across areas of the curriculum. The document  concludes by raising a wide range of educational-equity and research issues. (TES)",

        "description":"This report identifies those federal programs that are essentially rural and pursue economic development purposes. Using the 10 Beale population codes, 2,097 of the 3,096 U.S. counties, containing 16% of the U.S. population, were defined as rural (had urban populations of less than 20,000). The approximately 800 federal domestic assistance programs were placed into six categories based on development objectives. The four categories containing the principal rural development-type programs were economic development, agriculture and natural resources, infrastructure, and human resources (including education). In these four categories, 88 programs met the definition of rural development-type programs. The 88 programs provided total funding to both rural and nonrural counties of about  $29 billion in fiscal year 1987. Rural share data for fiscal year 1985 was available for 48 programs; these provided about $17 billion total, of which about 21% went directly to rural counties. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) administered the greatest number of rural development-type programs, was the only agency with programs in all four rural development categories, and provided the highest percentage of funding to rural counties. Thus, USDA would be the federal agency with the broadest experience base for implementing a rural development policy via the proposed Rural Development Administration. Extensive appendices categorize all U.S. counties by Beale code, provide information on total funding and rural share of all federal domestic assistance programs, and describe the 88  rural development-type programs.

        "description":"This Senate report provides background material to accompany Senate Bill 2167, which reauthorizes tribally controlled community colleges, reauthorizes the tribal college endowment program, and authorizes the establishment of demonstration centers for gifted and talented children in Guam, American Samoa, and Alaska. The 22 tribally controlled community colleges are located in 10 midwestern and western states, and all but 2 are located on Indian reservations. Present enrollment totals about 18,000, of which about 10% is non-Indian and not counted for purposes of federal funding. Senate Bill 2167 provides $3.2 million for technical assistance, $30 million for operational grants, and funds necessary for construction. On a matching basis, 20 tribal colleges received endowment grants  in fiscal year 1989 averaging $12,000. The bill reauthorizes the endowment program at $5 million for 1990 and 1991 and at $10 million for 1992, and allows real and personal property donated to the endowment to qualify for matching funds. In the Pacific Islands, educational resources are extremely limited. New demonstration centers authorized by the bill will provide the same opportunities for gifted and talented programs that are available to children nationwide. Important functions of the centers will be to develop criteria for identifying gifted and talented Samoan, Guamanian, and Alaska Native children; to develop culturally relevant programs; and to provide cross-cultural training for teachers. A scholarship program will cover higher education tuition and travel costs for Samoan and  Guamanian students. (SV)",

The framework opens with a discussion of the nature of science and the need for science educators to model the attributes of scientific investigation including objectivity, testability, and consistency. The framework also calls for a thematic presentation of science concepts so that students appreciate the connections across science disciplines and learn how science relates to other subjects. Three chapters address the content of science. The repeated use of &quot;sidebars&quot; helps teachers appreciate the connections among the sciences. The final part of the framework demonstrates how science education might be implemented in the 1990's. There are specific  recommendations for the teaching of science and the restructuring of science education at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. There are also suggestions for attracting into science classes students who historically have been underrepresented in those classes. Finally, the framework closes with ideas on how other facets of the system, including staff development, assessment, and, especially, instructional materials, need to be changed to help all students achieve scientific literacy.

The findings suggest that the combination of discipline problems and inexperience of teachers might be important variables influencing the internalizing of locus of control. Doing science activities that emphasize cause-and-effect relationships improved attitudes on the attitude subscales Social Implication of Science, Normality of Scientists, and Inquiry; however, such activities did not contribute to the enjoyment of science classes.

        "description":"With the advent of inexpensive microcomputers, the availability of microcomputers in the schools has mushroomed. Teacher training in the use of microcomputers has not kept pace with the increased availability of computers. There is little current information about how physics and physical science teachers actually use microcomputers in their teaching. Information about this usage and the teachers' perceptions of the values of microcomputers for teaching is valuable for policy planning and in understanding the needs of teachers for increased training and equipment. This study surveyed physics and physical science teachers in Iowa concerning their use of and perceived values related to microcomputers in teaching. Results included information concerning the number of students in  teachers' classes, teacher interest in microcomputers, availability of microcomputers, and types of software used. Correlations between teacher interest and usage are reported. Survey data are presented in tabular form. (Author/CW)",

        "description":"For more than 12 years, the Atlantic Science Curriculum Project (ASCP) has attempted to find a feasible path for educational reform in Canada. This search for a voluntary, regionally initiated path to educational reform was necessitated by the absence of substantial federal and provincial and private foundation sources of funding for science curriculum development in Canada. This report is based on research comprising: (1) an examination of the paper trace of the ASCP's history, including correspondence, records of meetings and conversations, contracts and curriculum documents, designs and materials; (2) a review of research and theoretical literature on the questions addressed by the study; and (3) consideration of the written and oral feedback to an initial draft of this paper  from the representatives of those constituencies with whom the ASCP has interacted. The paper is organized in four parts. The first part presents a model of educational change advanced in response to a discussion by teachers and curriculum developers involved in the ASCP. The second part considers the relevant interests of students, teachers, authors, researchers, subject matter specialists, policymakers, parents and publishers in relation to curriculum change. The third part examines the relationships between the various participants in the process of curriculum development. The fourth part discusses the process of curriculum development with the ASCP specifically in mind. (CW)",

        "description":"Informal learning environments compel the design of activities that are both appealing and educational. This paper addresses issues involved in the design of science television programs for preadolescents, drawing more specifically on the case of a French-language series currently in production in Montreal. The program goals and format are discussed in relation to the target audience's developmental characteristics, their attitudes toward science, and their experience with the television medium. Such a series, it is proposed, should attempt to provide an emotional experience that is entertaining, involving and relevant as well as a cognitive experience that is challenging and empowering. Suggestions are offered as to how these qualities might be implemented in a television  program. Experience with the series leads one to believe that the initial tension between learning and entertainment may be resolved creatively. (Author/CW)",

It provides immediate feedback to the learner and can be easily modified for use in many curriculum areas. It is self correcting because the student can identify errors without assistance and provides skills practice materials. The materials can be used with lower primary children once they can identify numerals 1 through 12. Lower grades have used the material to reinforce basic number facts, shapes, and sizes. Older students have used the same material to identify equivalences of fractions, apply division and multiplication algorithms, and work computations involving currency and time.

There is some debate about how much the Earth's surface temperature will rise given a certain amount of increase in the amount of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, chlorofluorocarbons, methane, water vapor, and ozone. The activities in this document are designed to encourage students to explore the issue of the greenhouse effect and its future implications, envisage and assess various solutions, share ideas with other students and the community, and adopt appropriate actions to limit the greenhouse effect. The activities, which are suitable for photocopying, are designed for use by  secondary students. Topics include: (1) &quot;Background to the Greenhouse Effect&quot;; (2) &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;; (3) &quot;Keeping Cool and Dry Inside&quot;; (4) &quot;Designing New Cities&quot;; (5) Greenhouse Fun and Games&quot;; (6) Changing Coastlines&quot;; (7) Where Will the Tourists Go?&quot;; (8) &quot;Trees Can Help Us&quot;; (9) &quot;Running Hot and Cold on Coal&quot;; (10) &quot;Changing Things for the Better&quot;; (11) &quot;Living in a Greenhouse Culture&quot;; and (12) &quot;Beyond the Greenhouse Culture.&quot; A list of audiovisual and print reference materials is appended.

At this crutial time, school boards should define their role in curriculum and encourage positive change based on sound decisions regarding what knowledge, skills, competencies, attitudes, and values students will need in order to become responsible citizens, productive workers, and effective parents in the world. This paper is divided into several sections. The introductory section addresses such basic problems as defining curriculum and establishing its priorities. The next section deals with the roles of the school board and others at the local level, as well as the role of the State Education Department. Science and mathematics are used  as the context for the discussion of several issues. In the final section, teacher preparedness is addressed. The question of national curriculum standards is raised, as are issues related to the achievement of female and minority students in the sciences.

The programs are designed to fit into courses for students from grades five through high school in which ecology is taught. They can be used separately or in sequence. Through a survey of the specific features of each of Alaska's four main ecosystems, the programs illustrate and emphasize fundamental concepts of ecology: web of life, food chain, habitat, carrying capacity, natural community, adaptation, predator and prey relationships, plant succession, photosynthesis and energy transfer, and the water cycle. The guide contains a separate lesson for each of the six video programs. Each lesson contains a detailed program  summary; student objectives; pre-viewing activities providing advance organizers, including a list of terms to be introduced in the video, post-viewing questions for thought and discussion; and a set of reproducible handouts for deskwork, including a crossword puzzle, word search, and quiz. Extended activities, most of them related to several of the programs, are grouped after the lessons. The guide also contains visual aids for overhead projection or reproduction, a glossary, and a list of further resources. A textbook correlation with six different textbooks is included. (CW)",

Frayer models, semantic mapping, and graphic organizers from Reading in the Content Area (RICA) were used to increase student understanding of the scientific principles involved. Computers and a variety of computer programs from COMPress and Knowledge Factory were used by the target group for review, drill, and practice in relating their math skills to solving problems. The results indicated a considerable increase in the ability to solve problems related to the mole concept. It was concluded that better understanding of scientific concepts coupled with computer use for  drill and practice was very effective in helping students relate science and mathematics.

With recent UN successes negotiating resolutions in Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq war, and with radically improved relations between Washington and Moscow, there is a new sense of optimism about the United Nations. In fact, international support for UN peacekeeping, symbolized by the Nobel Peace Prize of 1988, appears to be at an all-time high. However, unless solutions are found to three unresolved peacekeeping problems--financing, management, and peacemaking--the current optimism about the UN could sour. The United States is urged to take  advantage of this unique chance to improve the peace process by acting quickly to address these problems. The book includes a map and a chronology of current peacekeeping operations, excerpts from the UN Charter, illustrations, discussion questions for students and other groups, and a 16-item annotated reading list.

        "description":"Despite a long-standing commitment to citizenship education throughout the United States, relatively few researchers have examined what civic learnings are acquired from particular topics in the curriculum such as the Revolutionary era. Researchers have largely neglected the substance of classroom life, the specific curricular context and subject matter being studied. This paper presents the results of a study that explored the relationships between civic learning and learning about the Revolutionary era. Specifically, the study considered the reactions to an elementary-level textbook chapter on the deterioration of Anglo-American relations prior to the Revolution by: a professor of history, a professor of social studies education, an elementary school teacher, a junior high  social studies teacher, and two bright sixth graders. Four major topics relevant to civic education emerged for the readers' responses: (1) political values, (2) the lessons of history, (3) fair-mindedness and balance, and (4) learning history. The topics are examined in detail and the following recommendations are made: strategies such as class discussions should be more frequently employed than recitation; researchers need to examine much more closely what children now learn, and take these perspectives into account when they make suggestions for improvements in curriculum design and for more effective teaching practices; and more attention should be paid to civic learning in particular topics in the curriculum. A 38-item reference list is included, as are appendices containing the  protocol for study of the text and a list of the major topics and ideas emerging from the study with related tables. (DB)",

The program, designed to help students learn about Canadian history, is outlined. The program simulates the events and atmosphere of the years 1864-1873, formative years in Canada's history; the student user is cast in the role of a journalist on the staff of a newspaper. As the student covers various news stories of the period, decisions concerning day-to-day life, as well as the larger social, economic, and political issues of nation-building are faced. This report discusses various aspects of the software field tests in two eighth grade classrooms (36 students) including descriptions of: the software, field test sites, the sample, procedure, findings, discussions of revisions, and  retesting. Both teachers and students were impressed by the program, and students benefitted from using it. Three appendices contain: teacher materials, observer materials, and excerpts from transcribed tapes.

The purpose of this bibliography is to guide the investigator toward the principal sources that cover the area of health and the Amish. It is by no means comprehensive, but the attempt was made to completely cover 1980 to 1989. During the compilation of this document, five major areas of exploration became evident and comprise the five major sections of this bibliography. These are: (1) general works (4 items); (2) health care practices and attitudes (15 items); (3) medical studies (82 items); (4) psychological studies (35  items); and (5) population studies (20 items).

        "description":"Pay equity, sometimes referred to as comparable worth, is a remedy for wage discrimination based on race or sex. It's basic premise is that pay should be based on job-related factors such as skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions, not on a worker's gender or race. Studies have consistently demonstrated that jobs predominantly held by women and/or people of color are paid less than comparable jobs held by white men. Furthermore, studies have shown that these jobs are undervalued because they are held by women and/or people of color. In the 1980s, pay equity became a major political issue. During the decade pay equity initiatives in the public sector brought over $450 million to thousands of women and people of color working for states, cities, counties, school  districts, community colleges, and hospitals. The facts about pay equity activities during this period are documented in this comprehensive report. Three levels of pay equity activity are identified: research/data collection; pay equity study; and pay equity adjustments. The means by which the activity at these levels has come about also are discussed and include collective bargaining, legislation, litigation, and grassroots advocacy. The body of the report is given to discussion and analysis of these pay equity activities as they have occurred in the federal government, states, counties, municipalities, school districts, and colleges and universities. The appendix includes a 22-item reference list, a glossary of terms, and a questionnaire on public sector pay equity activity.  (DB)",

This volume focusing on New Guinea is one of a series that provides a comparative view of the position of and progress made in UPE in six countries with particular reference to female enrollment and  participation in primary education. The six chapter topics in this volume are: (1) universal primary education; (2) poor female enrollment and retention, the incidence of the problem; (3) factors affecting the enrollment and retention of girls in community school; (4) retention, what the drop-outs and their parents say; (5) who drops out? and (6) present policies, projects, and proposed strategies. A number of tables displaying data appear throughout this volume and a 16-item bibliography is appended. (DB)",

A six-step process for systematically addressing these problems would urge the schools to: (1) identify the at-risk populations within the school district (e.g., underachievers, alcohol and drug abusers, students with high stress, etc.); (2) consult the professional literature to determine the known causal factors for each at-risk classification; (3) using the PRECEDE Health Planning Model, catagorize these factors as predisposing, enabling, or reinforcing factors and identify which are common to all classifications of being at-risk; (4) collect and  analyze data to validate whether factors found in the professional literature apply to the local district; (5) conduct an inventory of existing programs that address causal predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors; and (6) propose additional program components to fill identified voids. In this way, local districts can develop programs for at-risk students by building on existing school, family, and community program components rather than inventing an array of new programs which may be costly but no more effective.

        "description":"A study was undertaken to derive, demonstrate, and appraise a form for pragmatic studies of schoolteaching--a form defined as eclectic deliberation on a practical problem in schoolteaching. The exploration of the pragmatic form addressed the problem of beginning the year in the introductory biology courses of a high school. The analysis framed the schoolteacher's task as a fourfold problem involving: (1) the teacher's responsibility; (2) the subject matter regarded as a set of valuables to be placed in reach of students; (3) the students regarded as experienced actors in the class; and (4) the class regarded as an organization with properties of its own. Within that framework, eight arguments from educational theory and research were employed to interpret the teaching problem.  The analysis was completed with a deliberation, conducted in terms of the assembled arguments, on the relative merits of two procedures for starting the year. This paper, which describes the study, draws on precedents for considering educational design as a form of educational inquiry, outlines the analysis of the problem of beginning the year in introductory biology, and concludes with an appraisal of the form of inquiry.

These modes of organizing thought condition classroom planning, shape meaning from a virtual didactic knowledge-store, and scaffold further pedagogical interactions. The semio-cognitive grammar proposed is adapted to the analysis of teachers' verbalizations. The purpose of this metasemantic and pragmatic grammar is to analyze the procedures of didactic embedding. This grammar can prove to be useful in the analysis of didactic transposition in other subject matters. This model might lead to pedagogical applications and help bring about some understanding of expert ways of didactic improvising in a pedagogical context thus inducing a new metacognitive and  pragmatic instructional design.

Dewey's marked and enduring influence on Chinese educational thought and practice is a central theme. The paper argues that because Dewey himself and his ideas grew and matured in a dramatically changing and developing social-historical context no simple-minded judgments should be made in regard to his educational thoughts. The analysis and discussions are presented in four sections: (1) John Dewey, a son of his times; (2) John Dewey, a fighter against dualisms; (3) John Dewey a resolver not perfect; and (4) John Dewey, a thinker welcomed and attacked in China.

        "description":"Pragmatic epistemology of focal teacher thinking appears tightly shaped by modular connections between task domains and pragmatic organizers. Discussions with a group of language teachers identified four domains of tasks: (1) oral activities; (2) writing activities; (3) reading activities; and (4) language technique activities (grammar, spelling). Three pragmatic functions are noted: the narrative pragmatic function, which transforms curricular knowledge into themes and images; the instrumental pragmatic function, which organizes curricular intentions in terms of skills, operations, and procedures that could be transferred from one domain to another; and the experiential pragmatic function which transforms curriculum knowledge into global actions, interactions, and actualized  experiences. These three pragmatic functions of focal teacher thinking, spontaneously developed in teachers' epistemology, seem to be ways of motivating students. An excerpt from an interview with one teacher is presented and analyzed to demonstrate its pragmatic epistemology. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper reports on some speculations arising from a long-term research project which utilizes data from teachers' autobiographies in understanding the nature of teachers' knowledge and development. The work is part of an increasing body of research which uses biographical methods to aid in understanding teachers' lives, careers, cultures, and life worlds. At the beginning of the paper in understanding is used to provide a human and personal example in which a discussion of teacher development may be grounded. Following this, the general characteristics of how teacher development occurs, and under what conditions, are considered as discerned from a study of over 75 teacher autobiographies. Finally, the autobiographical approach is examined for its potential for self-initiated,  peer-assisted teacher development. A university course in the construction of autobiographies through dialogue and discussion is described which seemed to demonstrate that, while autobiography is a fundamental form of personal and professional inquiry, it can be done more easily when supported and catalyzed by colleagues. The potential for collaborative autobiography for team building and mutual bonding at the school level is also explored and it is concluded that collaborative authobiography provides a facilitative context for staff development that can be adapted for school-based projects and collaborative action research.

        "description":"John Dewey's vision of communication posits an important ideal that educational researchers are hard pressed to meet, for the language that facilitates exchanges between scholars often encumbers their attempts to convey their work and findings to a wider, lay audience. The canons of inquiry (of foremost concern to researchers) rarely coincide with the exigencies of policy (of foremost concern to laypeople). Three potentially incompatible conditions must be met in order to bridge this communicative gap: access, belief, and impact. The condition of access requires that the language and style researchers use to present the findings of their investigations be comprehensible and appealing. The condition of belief demands that researchers gain and maintain credibility in the eyes of  their audience. The condition of impact emphasizes the inherent tensions between the perennial tentativeness of knowledge and the immediate need for certainty in action. Israel Scheffler's notion of a \"double consciousness,\" consistent with the author's notion of \"second thoughts,\" is proposed as an aid in enabling resolute commitment while holding action and decision open to revision in light of new insights and wider knowledge.

This paper examines justifications for such \"breaks\" centering, first, on the limitations of what teachers learn through experience and, second, on comparisons of teacher learning with socialization in other professions. The argument questions the notion of teachers as experts and cautions against the confident pursuit of reforms. (Author)",

The most problematic element for the reflecting student is becoming aware of essential aspects and evaluating action. The study compared the effects of two types of reflective training on two groups of students. One group (N=30) was taught to engage in structured, systematic thinking about reflection; the other group (N=29) engaged in unstructured journal writing as a means of encouraging reflection. The effects of the training were assessed by measuring the quality of pedagogical thinking. The Taxonomy of Teacher Reflective Thinking Rating Scale (TTRT) and the Description, Interpretation, Evaluation, Planning Rating Scale (DIEP) were used as pre-  and posttest instruments. Before training, all students were given the TTRT as a pretest. Both groups received six 1-hour training sessions approximately 1 week apart. One group wrote DIEP reflections and the other wrote daily journal reflections. At the end of 14 weeks, the Reflection Attitude was administered, as well as the TTRT, as a delayed posttest. Results did not indicate that the treatment alone caused student gains from the pretest to the posttest. The amount of structure in reflective training did not appear to be a significant cause in changing pedagogical thinking. (JD)",

Chapter 3 presents a rationale for the importance of such investigations and reviews four recent studies on effective K-12 educational  practice. Chapter 4 describes how inquiry on teaching has been conducted, presents some significant findings, and discusses both limitations and utilization of such research. Chapter 5 reviews research on teacher education according to four categories: preservice teachers, preservice curriculum and instruction, the education professoriate, and the context of teacher preparation.

        "description":"This paper highlights recent trends, issues, and research related to the roles and authority of states in policies for teachers and teaching. A review of literature demonstrates an increased role for state policymakers in education decision making. Decisions that had typically been within the domain of professional educators are now subject to state mandate. Trends, however, suggest that state policymakers will focus their attention more on educational outcomes and accountability systems and less on prescribing how education should be delivered, thus making the role of local institutions increasingly important. While there is major agreement between educators and policymakers that systemic changes in the education system are necessary, in contrast to the surface changes of  earlier reform mandates, there is substantial disagreement on how such change will be achieved. Many policy analysts advocate a capacity-building approach to effecting changes in the education delivery system. Many state policymakers are looking at system-changing policies rather than capacity-building strategies as the best method for effecting change; e.g., the advocacy of alternative teacher certification programs that bypass traditional education programs entirely.

        "description":"In this study, different educator groups had to rank a total of 112 behaviors that had previously been judged to be important to the performance of first-year teachers. Focus was on determining which behaviors are important in the assessment of beginning teachers' performance and whether or not such assessment should be differentiated according to the context in which teaching is to take place. Experienced teachers (n=1,033) across 32 certification areas, three groups of principals (n=125), and four groups of faculty (n=139) from teacher training programs participated as part of the development of valid assessment procedures for the Kansas Internship Program. The 112 behaviors were randomly separated into two sets of 56 behaviors, each representing two parallel forms of the  ranking task. Seven behaviors from each form were added to the other form, creating two forms each containing 63 behaviors. Forty-nine of these behaviors were unique to each form, and 14 behaviors were common to each form, resulting in an anchor block of 14 control behaviors. The 35 group mean importance ratings on a 9-point scale were computed for each of the 112 behaviors. The forced ranking by the subjects of these behaviors resulted in considerable disagreement. Using the criterion that 34 of the 35 groups included a behavior as important, 41 behaviors were identified as a common core. When the top 10 behaviors recognized by each group were compared with the common core, 28 of the 35 groups would have had at least one behavior important to that group ignored. While some consistency  was found over the certification areas and professional groups represented, the choices of important behaviors were not consistent, suggesting that the assumption of a single common core of behaviors could seriously compromise a teacher performance evaluation system. Two tables present study data. The master list of behaviors for the Kansas Internship Assessment Inventory, and two sample behaviors and their respective descriptions are appended. (SLD)",

        "description":"Two techniques for detecting differential item functioning (DIF) of test items are compared: (1) item response theory (IRT), using the three-parameter model; and (2) Mantel-Haenszel chi square techniques (MHCS). The steps necessary for identifying differentially functioning items are identified for both approaches. Using data from the 1988 Maryland Test of Citizenship Skills (MTCS), the following parameters were investigated: (1) the stability of the MHCS statistic across sample sizes; (2) the stability of the DIF index (MH Alpha) in the MHCS approach across several score groups; (3) the correlation between IRT DIF indices and MH Alpha; and (4) agreement between the IRT and MHCS techniques in identifying biased items. The MTCS was administered to about 50,000 ninth-graders in  January and February of 1988. For IRT purposes, random comparison groups of 1,000 students each were created, while the MHCS procedure used samples of 1,000, 750, 500, and 200 examinees. The IRT DIF procedure identified four items in male/female comparisons and three items in white/black comparisons in the MTCS that have significant unequal probabilities of a correct response. While correlation results indicate that the two techniques disagree regarding item bias, agreement in terms of total hits indicates that the MHCS technique is an adequate substitute for the three-parameter IRT approach if the sample size is at least 750. In terms of the percentage of items identified as biased, the techniques appear to be equally good in detecting DIF. Five graphs and 11 tables present study data.

In particular, different studies in a metaanalysis may involve different treatment comparisons, while centers within the same trial usually consider the same treatments. The Bayesian statistical approach focuses on the probability distribution of any unknowns given the available information. An advantage of Bayesian methods is that they allow the use of all available information. In the case of a multicenter clinical trial of the  effects of a particular drug, Bayesian methods require assessment of the information available before the trial as a probability distribution. A comparison of the Bayesian and frequentist approaches indicates that Bayesian methods have greater flexibility. Results from nine studies of an antidepressant drug illustrate the Bayesian hierarchical approach. Bayesian updating for multiple treatment studies is the same as for a single treatment. Three tables present study data and 15 figures illustrate the analysis. (SLD)",

        "description":"Two school entrance assessments were compared to determine whether or not they are theoretically unique approaches to kindergarten screening. The first test was the &quot;Brigance K and 1 Screen&quot; (Brigance, 1982), a kindergarten entrance assessment which focuses on perceptual-motor development, background experience, and rote memory as determinants for school success. This test does not focus on language development. The second test, a battery of Piagetian tasks, focused entirely on cognitive functioning. Subjects were 30 students (14 males and 16 females) who scored 90 and above and 30 students (17 males and 13 females) who scored 80 and below on the Brigance test administered as part of school readiness screening in a school district in Idaho. Scores for each assessment were  tabulated, compared, and analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance and Pearson product-moment correlations. Students scoring high on one test were likely to score high on the other test; low scorers on one test were likely to be low scorers on the other test. The implications for readiness assessment of the correlations between the subtests are discussed. Further study could provide greater insight and more recommendations for school practice. Nineteen tables present study data. The Brigance K and 1 Screen scoring sheet, a sample contact letter to parents, the parents' response card for testing, two-way and three-way classification test materials, and the Piagetian tasks scoring sheet are appended.

Validity becomes a problem if an educational system adapts itself to the characteristics of the outcome measures. The concept of systematically valid tests is introduced; these tests induce curricular and instructional changes in education systems and learning strategy changes in students that foster the development of the cognitive traits the tests are designed to measure. Two characteristics are analyzed that contribute to or detract from a testing system's systemic validity: (1) use of direct rather than indirect cognitive assessment; and (2) the degree of subjectivity or judgment required to assign a score to represent the cognitive skill. These  characteristics are then applied in developing design principles for creating systematically valid testing systems. These principles are illustrated in the design of a student assessment system that includes the means of teaching the process of assessment to system users. A list of 29 references is attached.

An initial sample included 329 males and 342 females, of whom 352 had working class careers and 319 had middle class careers. Relationships among social origin, gender, and career were analyzed; school performance, differentiation, and careers were determined for a final sample of 655 young adults. Social background had a heavy impact on career. Two-thirds of the working class children remained in a working class career, and two-thirds of the middle class children stayed in the middle class. Working class children were more likely to remain in the same career position, with less shifts of class position, than  were middle class children. Class position shifts were also more common among women than men. In primary schools, differences in cognitive performance among students increased and students followed different career paths. Student perspectives on schooling in retrospect indicated more school acceptance among middle class students and among those with middle class careers. The results highlight the need to view the impact of the educational system in terms of cultural responses and social mobility in the welfare state. Three tables and two diagrams present study data.

The four studies used in the comparative assessment of The BPCS and the BPCS-RS involved: (1) 233 urban university undergraduates; (2) 58 undergraduates; (3) 48 seminary graduate students; and (4) 34 undergraduate psychology students. Correlations between the 85-item BPCS and the 45-item BPCS-RS indicate that the two scales are equivalent. Evidence from a series of studies is presented to support the  reliability and validity of the revised scale. It is argued that the BPCS-RS provides an efficient and empirically sound means of assessing several rarely measured dimensions of personal control. Both instruments have the same three-factor structure. Additional evidence for the validity of the exaggerated internal control and God-mediated control factors was provided as well.

Frequently, these evaluations take the form of faculty surveys and student surveys. This paper explores the following general considerations associated with mail surveys and other surveys: avoidance of response bias; reduction of non-response; reliability and validity in survey research; and the effects of different response models. Practical suggestions are offered, in non-technical language, for implementing survey research methods and developing more useful questionnaire items. The advantages and disadvantages of open versus closed question forms are described. Open questions allow respondents to state opinions in their own words and may reveal  important issues that the evaluator may not have anticipated. However, the results of open questions are more difficult to analyze than are those of closed questions, which generally produce more reliable data that accommodate statistical analysis and allow the responses of individuals and groups to be quantified and compared. It is concluded that the question format not only determines the quality of information or opinion elicited, but also affects data analysis and interpretation. (TJH)",

Teachers from three school districts involved in the study received 18 or more hours of training in cooperative learning principles prior to the study, and supplementary support during the study. Four classroom observations, extending 30 to 60 minutes each, were made of each teacher during one semester. Teachers were interviewed based on a guide form for 10 minutes after each observation  session. Teachers completed the SCQ after the last interview. Results are provided relevant to grouping structure, duration of cooperative lessons, interdependence and accountability strategies, processing strategies, monitoring procedures, cognitive complexity, social skills, and teacher supports and constraints. Results indicate that across-the-board training programs in cooperative learning are useful for teachers at all grade levels and that a focus on social skills is particularly pertinent to teacher training.

Study objectives were to determine: the impact of reform on the seven EI measures; geographic differences among the states in the implementation of EI measures; which states have implemented EI measures without reform movement pressures; and the regions most responsive to educational reform pressures. Responses to survey questionnaires were received from educational officers in  all 50 states. Reform influenced each of the four geographic areas (East, Midwest, South, and West), but the South was the most influenced by the reform movement. A significant result of educational reform has been increased control by state agencies of local school boards. Pressures from business/industrial leaders have required several state education agencies and/or legislators to develop and require a variety of mandated programs for local school districts. State-mandated programs have taken away control from many local school boards. School districts that have not kept pace with sound educational practices may benefit from the first phase of educational reform. Four tables present study data. (SLD)",

The objective of these technical notes is to provide information to allow the reader to judge the utility of the design, quality of the NAEP data, reasonableness of the assumptions made, appropriateness of the data analyses, and generalizability of the inferences made from the data.  Topics addressed include: development of objectives and items; sample design; assessment instruments; field administration; materials processing and database creation; processing assessment materials; professional scoring; data transcription systems; editing data; quality control of data entry; database products; weighting procedures and estimation of sampling variance; scaling procedures; data analysis for the various subject area assessments; and the statistical summary of the samples and estimates of proficiencies of U.S. students. A total of 204 data tables and 14 figures are provided. Appendices provide: a list of consultants for development of the 1988 NAEP objectives and items; distributions of weight components for the 1988 NAEP samples; contrast codings and estimated effects for  1988 NAEP conditioning variables; 1988 NAEP derived and composite conditioning variables; revision of 1984 NAEP post-stratification weights for grade 4/age 9 years and grade 8/age 13 years; 1988 NAEP item response theory parameters; and NAEP reporting subgroups, composite and derived common background variables, and subject-specific composite and derived reporting variables. A glossary of terms, a list of references cited in the text, and an index are included. (TJH)",

Prior to addressing the study proper, the paper reviews the literature on memory for complex phenomena, ill-structured problems, expert-novice differences, administration as problem solving, and assessment of complex learning outcomes. Study subjects included 31 elementary school principals (representing a full range of experience) recruited from six moderate to large county school boards in southern Ontario, Canada. The study design involved group discussions, fact finding, thinking aloud, and a case study review involving problem solving. The case study presented a conflict between a school staff and school librarian and involved elements of supervision, curriculum,  policy, interpersonal relations, physical plant, budget and supply, and staff attitudes. The schema procedure involved construction of a collective story line, across subjects, capturing the variety of responses to the problem, including values exhibited, perspectives taken, and actions planned. Within this collective framework, individual responses to the problem can be highlighted. Results raise the question of whether these methods can be applied to assessment of outcomes of schooling including written as well as verbal student output. The case study, a narrative version of the schema, and six data tables are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"Data from 20 years (1970-90) of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) are summarized. The NAEP represents the nation's only ongoing assessment of the academic achievement of American students. Its assessments of educational achievement of students in grades 4, 8, and 12 are presented as &quot;The Nation's Report Card&quot;. Chapter 1 of this report contains information about the students' competency in subject matter across the curriculum and their ability to use their minds well. Chapters 2 and 3 include information about the trends across time related to the performance of elementary school, middle school, and secondary school students in higher-order reasoning, problem solving, and communication skills as well as information about the academic achievement of minority  students. Chapter 4 summarizes information about background variables related to education. In general, the data indicate that the educational performance of U.S. students is low and not improving. It is estimated that more than half of the nation's elementary through high school students are unable to demonstrate competency in challenging subject matter in English, mathematics, science, history, and geography. Fewer than half of all U.S. students appear to be able to use their minds well. Although considerable progress has been made in closing the performance gaps among different racial/ethnic and gender groups, the gaps still remain too large to meet the nation's objective of close parallels between the performance of minority students and the student population as a whole. Much that  research has identified as effective in improving education is still not being implemented in the nation's schools. Nineteen tables and five figures summarize NAEP data. (SLD)",

This abridged version of the 1989 contractor report does not report any information that could violate the confidentiality requirements of Public Law 100-297. It is designed to be a companion to separately published users' manuals for the NELS:88 Base Year Data Files. The target population consisted of all public and private schools with eighth grades in the United States. Excluded were students with severe mental, emotional, or physical handicaps, and those without sufficient command of English to complete the survey materials. The survey used a  two-stage stratified, clustered sample design, with responses from about 69% of the 1,057 targeted schools and about 93% of the 24,599 students who were contacted. This report reviews: (1) the NELS:88 study background and purpose; (2) sample design and implementation; (3) sample weights; (4) school and item non-response data; and (5) standard errors and design effects. Eighteen tables and two figures contain data from the study. Three appendices contain the standard errors and design effects for the student, parent, and school questionnaire data tabulated for all schools; males; females; Asians; Hispanics; Blacks; Whites and others; public schools; Catholic schools; other private schools; and students of low, middle, and high socioeconomic status.

String comparators are used in production computer matching software during the Post Enumeration Survey for the 1990 U.S. census. A string comparator metric is described that partially accounts for: (1) typographical variation in strings such as first name or surname; (2) decision rules that use the string comparator; and (3) improvements in empirical matching results. The string comparator metric for comparing partially agreeing strings extends the Jaro string comparator. How general methods of accounting for partial agreement fit with the Fellegi-Sunter (I. P. Fellegi and A. B. Sunter, 1969) model of record linkage is described. A formal method of modeling  how to adjust matching weights between pure agreement and pure disagreement is presented. The procedure is illustrated for files for which the truth of matches is known. It is demonstrated that the theoretical rules of Fellegi and Sunter are still valid when general weighting adjustments accounting for partial agreement are performed.

The results do not support specific skill independence, even across such major domains as reading and mathematics using very different methods to measure proficiency.

The American sample included 115 preadolescents (53 males and 62 females), and the Polish sample included 64 children (34 males and 30 females). The American subjects came from a suburban racially heterogeneous school district near Cincinnati (Ohio), and the Polish subjects were located in the state schools of Gdansk. Data were obtained from both subject groups during the 1987-88 school year. The construct validity for a revised version of the Multidimensional Multiattribution Causality Scale of H. M. Lefcourt and others was studied. While significant differences between the two cross-national samples and within the eight subscales were  reported, significant correlations of the rank orderings of the eight subscale means among the American and Polish samples were believed to be evidence for the construct validity of the revised instrument. Additional correlational analyses contrasted these samples with a sample of 87 Anglo and 64 Hispanic American adolescents responding to the original instrument. Since the data support predictions based on the self-worth motive of M. V. Covington (1984), it is argued that construct validation of the revised instrument was achieved. Since construct validity was found in both samples, it is suggested that a successful translation was accomplished. Seven tables and one bar graph present study data. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"Effect sizes have been increasingly emphasized in research as more researchers have recognized that: (1) all parametric analyses (t-tests, analyses of variance, etc.) are correlational; (2) effect sizes have played an important role in meta-analytic work; and (3) statistical significance testing is limited in its capacity to inform scientific inquiry. However, effect sizes tend to be biased by sampling and measurement error. The performance of the statistical corrections for sampling error bias of R. J. Wherry and P. A. Herzberg is illustrated and reviewed. The corrections are compared with empirical estimates of sampling error derived using &quot;bootstrap&quot; methods. A data set involving the responses of 31 college undergraduates (18 females and 13 males) on the Finding Embedded  Figures Test (FEFT) and the Group Embedded Figures Test, is used for illusrative purposes to make the discussion concrete. It is suggested that bootstrap methods provide important insights for the researcher and are readily accessible to researchers due to the availability of user-friendly computer programs that automate the procedure (i.e., programs designed for use on microcomputers). Seven tables illustrate the example. An appendix provides an item analysis for heuristic FEFT data. A list of 65 references is included. (Author/SLD)",

Subjects included all 589 students seeking admission to the college mathematics curricula at a private university in the South during the course of the study. Common misconceptions about reliability are also reviewed, such as the misconception that tests, as opposed to data, are reliable; and the idea that longer tests always yield more reliable data than do their shorter counterparts. The test was a revision of items previously reported. The revised version of the 50-item test included 2 subscales of 25 items each: an arithmetic scale, and an algebra scale. Reliability estimates and various  item analysis statistics were reported. Revisions of the test yielded slightly better than expected alpha coefficients for the arithmetic and algebra subscales. Overall, the results suggest that the revised test can yield reasonably reliable data, and the test can be used to place students in an appropriate curriculum. One table contains the study data.

The Attitudes towards Science and Scientists Scale (ATSSS) of J. R. Cummings (1969) was administered to preservice elementary school teachers in 1989 and 1990. The ATSSS consists of 67 Likert-type items intended to measure seven facets of attitudes about science. Items for a revised scale were chosen based on factor analyses and the results of item analysis. The revised version, the Inventory of Science Attitudes (ISA), was administered to 72 preservice elementary education majors taking mathematics, science, and music  methods courses over the summer session in 1990. Factor analyses and measures of reliability indicated that the revised version was more valid and reliable than was the ATSSS. Two tables present the rotated factor pattern for Promax rotation and the distribution of scores on the ISA. The 30-item ISA is included. (SLD)",

Questionnaires were sent to all superintendents, assistant superintendents, and curriculum directors in the state. Of the original 67 questionnaires mailed, 51 (76%) were returned after a follow-up mailing to non-respondents from the first mailing. Data were coded, and frequencies were tabulated for each item on the questionnaire. In all, 42% of the respondents reported that their testing program was primarily norm-referenced. Another 42% reported that a combination of norm-referenced tests and CRTs was in use. Over half (53%) of the respondents  reported great or extreme need, 27% reported moderate need, and 16% reported slight need or no need for professional development in constructing, validating, and using CRTs. On-site consulting, professional development seminars, extension course work through the University of Wyoming (Laramie), and a summer institute were seen as most desirable or feasible. Results indicate that Wyoming schools are in a state of transition in terms of criterion-referenced testing; these schools are willing to adopt CRTs, but are too weak in skills to use them effectively. A list of 16 skills that educators need in order to use CRTs appropriately is included. Five tables contain information about survey responses. (SLD)",

Journal and book sources of information about mail questionnaires were reviewed to yield 83 items in 7 categories that comprised the study survey. The survey was mailed to six authors of books on survey research and six experienced practitioners of survey research. Only one author failed to reply; the response rate was 92%. Detailed background information was provided by 10 of the 11 individuals who participated in this phase of the study. Eight of the 83 items were judged desirable for all mail questionnaires, possibly because of a lack of clarity in the  instrument. A revised instrument was submitted to a validation panel of 10 individuals experienced in survey research as well as to 8 of the original 11 participants. Of the 64 items that a majority of the participants in the first phase of the study would usually recommend, 38 were supported by the validation panel, with 80% or higher indicating that they also would usually make the recommendation. The attached &quot;Check List of Desirable Characteristics of Mail Surveys&quot; is a compilation of the items usually recommended by at least 87.5% of the first group of experts and 80% of the validation panel. These results indicate that questionnaire design may be a science up to a certain point, but beyond that point it is an art.

        "description":"The impacts of the Grade 12 Provincial Examination Program on the educational system in British Columbia and its participants were studied. Beginning with the 1983-84 school year, students in British Columbia have been required to take an end-of-course provincial examination in each academic course they take. The study began with a review of pertinent literature to establish the history and purposes of the examinations. Instruments developed through interviews and separate survey questionnaires were used to survey and obtain responses from the following groups: (1) 1,833 12th-grade students; (2) 608 parents of 12th-grade students; (3) 947 teachers of 12th-grade students; (4) 137 school counselors; (5) 160 high school principals; and (6) 35 district superintendents. There was no  clear indication of the effects of the Provincial Examination on individuals' standards for student achievement. Students recognized increased stress as a major problem with the program, but they acknowledged that the program led them to work harder and study more than they had before they participated in the program. Teachers, principals, counselors, and superintendents indicated that the program has had a major effect on teaching practice in that the examination has become a focus of instructional content. Recommendations based on the study findings are summarized for the continuation and enhancement of the examination program. Twenty-nine tables present study recommendations. Eleven appendices comprising about half of the document provide a preliminary description of examination  impacts and a summary of in-school interviews conducted in June of 1989, and present the student, parent, teacher, principal, counselor, and superintendent questionnaires.

During that year, 4,494 LEP students were served by the AISD schools: 3,481 elementary school students, 531 middle/junior high school students, and 482 high school students. The LEP population in the school system was 90% Hispanic; Vietnamese speakers were the next largest segment, at 4%. In all, there were 4,042 Hispanic students; 32 Black students; and 420 American Indian, Asian, and White students. Most (90%) LEP students in the AISD were from low-income families, and 38% were overage. Most (88%) LEP students were in regular LEP programs, with a few assigned to special education or modified instruction. Students  needing additional services transferred to other schools that provide enhanced services. Such transfers in the year are detailed. In general, rates for the LEP program were similar to districtwide rates for attendance, discipline, retention, dropouts, and mean grade point average. However, compared to the districtwide ranges, LEP students performed less well in discipline at the middle and junior high levels; there were higher dropout rates and lower mean grade point average at the high school level. Data about the LEP students in the AISD are presented in four graphs and five tables. (SLD)",

        "description":"The Austin (Texas) Independent School District (AISD) has received federal funds through the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986. The AISD has established a four-fold approach to educate students in kindergarten through grade 12 about the dangers of drugs and alcohol. The four components of the program include: (1) a core committee called Prevention and Remediation in Drug Education (PRIDE), which provides drug/alcohol education programs at the schools, makes materials and curriculum available, and also provides staff training; (2) Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) for grades 5 and 7; (3) Peer Assistance and Leadership (PAL) for students in grades 8 and 12 who are trained to assist younger students; and (4) support groups and crisis intervention through the Office  of Student Support Services. A survey of high school students in 1989-90--the third year in which the AISD received federal funding for drug-free school programs--revealed that many students were aware of drug and alcohol use, and most believed the district was doing an effective job combating them. Although the decline could not be attributed directly to any one component, the drop in drug- and alcohol-related offenses in the schools in 1989-90 may have resulted from the program interventions. Use of the PRIDE units and curriculum increased in 1989-90. Most DARE students reported that DARE taught them about the effects of drugs and alcohol. The PAL program assisted 911 students at the elementary school and secondary school levels in the school year. Twenty-one graphs and 11 tables  illustrate the report and provide information about program components. (SLD)",

The Pregnancy, Education, and Parenting (PEP) program was started at Robbins Secondary School to provide maximum academic and support services, as well as licensed day care, for male and female eighth- and ninth-grade parenting students. PEP supplements services provided through the Teenage Parent Program (TAPP), a program in which middle school students can participate through the semester in which their children are born. PEP has been operating since the spring 1990 semester, and has served 21 eighth and ninth graders and their infants. Progress was made toward all objectives of the program, and 30 of the planned 52  activities were implemented. While dropout rates compared favorably with those of TAPP, most students in the PEP were not earning credits at a rate to allow timely graduation. Most PEP students were more confident about finishing high school, and believed the day care made it easier to attend school. However, less than one-half (46%) of the PEP participants reported that their reading, writing, and mathematics skills had improved; and less than one-fourth (23%) believed that their knowledge of child and parenting topics or job preparation had improved after participating in the program.

The project provided: (1) staff development workshops; (2) consultants to develop a secondary scope and sequence; (3) funds for teachers to attend professional meetings; (4) materials; and (5) tuition and stipends for teachers to attend staff development workshops. In the 1989-90 school year, the AISD employed 1,835 elementary school teachers, 305 secondary school mathematics teachers, and 282 secondary school science teachers. Development workshops were evaluated through questionnaires completed by 116 participants (79 teachers,  28 administrators, and 9 other professional personnel), representing a response rate of 78%. High ratings were given to the instructional materials by the 171 teachers who completed questionnaires on their usefulness, although 5 elementary teachers of the gifted and talented commented that the materials were too advanced for their students. A major outcome was the coordinated scope and sequence developed for secondary mathematics beginning with grade 6, and a comparable scope and sequence developed for science in grades 8 and 10. Scopes and sequences for the other grades are to be developed over the next 5 years. Overall, Title II funds were used effectively to improve mathematics and science teaching in the AISD. The workshops were very well received by the participants, and all of the  professional meetings were given high ratings. Teachers appraised elementary school and secondary school mathematics and secondary school science materials as useful/effective for improving instruction. Materials for instructing gifted/talented students received mixed reviews. Seven tables and 22 graphs are provided. (SLD)",

Components of the grant were: (1) curriculum collaboration; (2) service to the school district; (3) mini-mentorship--a progam in which Science Academy freshmen advised sixth graders; (4) video lesson enrichment; (5) the Science Academy Summer Institute; (6) recruitment efforts; and (7)  promotion of private sector involvement. Evaluation indicated that private sector involvement remained extensive. Program efforts resulted in 93 new lessons created for elementary science classes. Recruitment efforts encouraged participation of many students. More than half of the students who participated in the Summer Institute showed increased interest in science. Neither teaching nor mentoring younger students had a significant impact on the Science Academy students' interest in teaching; however, for the younger students, both were successful in generating interest in science.

The microworld (or toolbox) is a collection of mouse-driven interfaces that facilitate a transition between manipulative models of arithmetic word problems (such as those using physical blocks) to the more abstract symbolic models (such as an open-sentence equation). The expert module is composed of mathematical and linguistic problem solving models. A linguistic or reading expert first generates a conceptual representation of the actions and sets in a word problem, and the mathematical expert then attempts to assign part-whole roles  to the conceptualized sets and arrive at a numerical model. The focus is on the expert reading model. A conceptual analyzer, EDUCE (Explaining Discourse Understanding with Conceptual Expectations), reads English word problems and generates conceptual representations of the quantities and actions in the word problem. By altering its linguistic abilities, the learning environment will perform real-time diagnoses of students' erroneous solutions and give the teacher hypotheses of potential misunderstandings. In its instructional role, EDUCE is designed to explain the role of certain words and phrases in a word problem. In its cognitive modeling role, it helps explain why some problems are harder than others. Four tables are included. (SLD)",

        "author":["Tittle, Carol Kehr"],
        "description":"The role of technology and the measurement of educational progress are discussed, with an emphasis on the development of school report cards. Comments are made from the perspectives of (1) a member of a university community and (2) a researcher in evaluation and measurement. Efforts to formulate school report cards in Florida, California, and elsewhere make it apparent that universities can look forward to extensions of recordkeeping and reporting for accountability purposes. An evaluation perspective leads to two concerns: (1) the view of the organizational change or school improvement that is assumed by the school report card; and (2) the need for reflection on and evaluation of the school report card programs. Standardized tests have constituted a key element in school report  cards. The National Assessment of Educational Progress is an example of the direction that testing should take. Developing assessments that are meaningful to teachers and learners will require long-term cooperative efforts of teachers and specialists. It is concluded that more information does not necessarily mean better schools or postsecondary education. Technology does not determine the choices for what a school or postsecondary report card contains or the system/legislation that fosters the report card. The challenge is to study the meaning and use that is derived from accountability measures; develop alternative or multiple assessments, and change from thinking that a single accountability system or any accountability system can meet the goal of accountability and the goal of school  improvement.

The use of the model is discussed and illustrated through a hypothetical evaluation of a compensatory (Chapter 1) program. The one group posttest only evaluation model makes it possible to evaluate a compensatory program when there is no available comparison group and no pretest data are available. The design is valuable for three reasons: (1) evaluators seldom, if ever, find a perfect comparison group; (2) it can be very difficult to find a test that serves as a pretest and can also measure the objectives adequately at posttest; and (3) the design allows for identification of the components of the  program that are not successful, providing guidance for program improvement decisions.

Confirmatory methods are especially useful because they explicitly consider measurement error influences and because the methods are inherently theory-driven and theory-oriented. Second-order confirmatory methods, which have not been applied with great frequency in the literature, allow the researcher to explore more thoroughly a reality that may be just as complex as are other formulated models. To make the explanation of applying confirmatory second-order methods more concrete, a data set involving responses of 487 undergraduates and graduate students (representing three pooled samples from previous research  studies) to the Hendrick-Hendrick love instrument was analyzed for heuristic purposes.

Following a brief overview of the logic of factor analysis, a review of several studies comparing the common factor and principal components methods is presented. Actual educational research data are used to demonstrate cases in which the two methods will produce different results. Data used in these analyses were collected from 70 preservice and inservice  teachers using a 3-subscale &quot;logic of confidence&quot; measure developed by K. R. Okeafor and others (1987).

Benefits of partnerships are considered in terms of gains for business, education, higher education, parents and students, and the community. Three typologies of BEPD are presented: (1) levels of involvement (incorporating three stages--support, cooperation, and collaboration); (2) partnership structure (simple, moderately complex, and complex); and (3) levels of  impact (containing six categories--partners in special services, partners in the classroom, partners in teacher training and development, partners in management, partners in systemic educational improvement, and partners in policy). The first two typologies illustrate the relationship between partners and the structure of these relations, respectively. The third model focuses on goals and emphasizes the partnership's impact on the educational system, and is therefore considered the most useful of the three typologies. The six levels of impact categorized in the third typology serve as the framework for presenting numerous specific examples of partnerships corresponding to each level; this is followed by a section in which the following more generic elements of successful educational  partnerships are outlined: top level leadership; grounding in community needs; effective public relations; clear roles and responsibilities; racial/ethnic involvement; strategic planning; effective management and staffing structure; shared decision-making/interagency ownership; shared credit/recognition; appropriate well-timed resources; technical assistance; formal agreements; action and frequent success; patience, vigilance, and increased involvement; and local ownership.

Otterbourg and D. Adams (1989), which surveyed about 24 EBPs to ascertain planning, implementation, and evaluation priorities, showed that only 25% of the programs used outcomes data to measure effectiveness. Otterbourg and Adams concluded that: the current state of the art of partnership program evaluation is at an elementary level; leaders are just beginning to use evaluation to collect data needed for making informed program-related decisions; and there is a lack of precedent and experience and an absence of appropriate systems and instruments for evaluating partnership programs. Methods used to evaluate  several EBPs are reviewed, including: documentation of collaboration and long-range planning processes of the METROLINK program by the Institute for Educational Leadership (IEL); qualitative review by Public/Private Ventures of nine school/business partnerships through site visits, observations, interviews, and document review of program materials; site visits, observations, interviews, debriefings with and written reports by technical assistants, questionnaire administration, phone follow-ups, and document review of the Ford Foundation's Urban School/Community Dropout Prevention Collaboratives from 1986 to 1990; a Rand Corporation study of school/community collaborations via case studies, semi-structured interviews, and document searches; case studies and &quot;mini&quot; case reviews of EBPs;  document review, phone interviews, and site visits of 16 urban colleges by the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges in 1981-84; interviews and impact evaluations conducted by the Career Beginnings program; questionnaire administration, phone interviews, and site visits by the IEL to evaluate 70001's Work, Achievement, and Values in Education Program in 1990; and day visits, interviews, and observations used in a study of local science education alliances in 1988. The review illustrates the need for more systematic evaluation of EBP programs; and the need for additional inquiry, elaboration, and refinement of evaluation models. (RLC)",

Although graduation rates have improved greatly since the late 1940s and early 1950s, school restructuring is necessary if the basic skills of the nation's youth are to be improved sufficiently to meet the economic challenges of the 1990s. State governors are particularly concerned with education for the following reasons: (1) education is one of the largest items in state budgets; (2) a skilled labor force is required to attract modern industry to a state; (3) there is a direct relationship between the percentage of dropouts and the percentage of incarcerated persons in a state; and (4) the United States has always had a leadership role in education. The &quot;Governors' 1991 Report on Education&quot;  suggested the following key recommendations to improve the quality of education: (1) make strategic investments in education; (2) treat teachers and principals as professionals; and (3) provide more choices among public schools. Empowerment of teachers and low-income parents in New York (New York) and Cambridge (Massachusetts) has resulted in the development of innovative curricula, reduced teacher attrition, and increased achievement test scores for minority group students. School choice plans in Minnesota, Florida, Arizona, and Michigan have increased academic achievement and improved college preparation. Responses to questions from participants are included. (FMW)",

Hispanic youth drop out of school at a rate of 40 percent; 25 percent of those who graduate are not qualified for good jobs. In Latin American countries, parents are expected to leave education to the teacher. Given the situation here, however, parents are enjoined not only to care for their children's health, but also to prepare them for school by conversing with them as much as possible, teaching them the numbers and the letters of the alphabet, and fostering an appreciation for books. When children have begun school, parents are invited to confer often with teachers and counselors, volunteer if possible, and join parent organizations.  (DM)",

        "description":"The purpose of the study described in this report was to ascertain why students in New York City high schools are earning insufficient credits to graduate in four years. Specific objectives of the study include the following: (1) to identify patterns and trends in credit accumulation among high school graduates and dropouts; (2) to determine and analyze the prevalence of noncredit bearing courses in students' schedules; (3) to identify New York State, Chancellor's, and High School Division regulations, requirements, policies, and practices that significantly affect student programs and course credit accumulation; (4) to identify innovative practices in program structure and scheduling that might improve credit accumulation; and (5) to determine the quantity and impact of  assistance provided to students in course selection. The main report contains a summary; a section of background information; and sections on the study purpose, study methodology, and study findings. Based on the findings, the report concludes with the following recommendations: (1) beginning in the ninth grade, the school system should systematically provide students, parents, and schools with the number of credits accumulated and the number needed for graduation, as well as how each student compares to others at the same level; (2) more funds and remedial resources should be directed to pre-high school and ninth-grade programs; (3) programs to promote credit accumulation should be studied so that successful programs can be replicated and unsuccessful ones phased out; (4) the student's  accumulation of credits should not depend on the high school he/she happens to attend; and (5) the Board of Education should establish a citywide policy on credit accumulation. Appendixes include the study instruments and responses; a summary of follow-up interviews; and the pertinent Commissioner's and Chancellor's regulations. (MYM)",

        "description":"The key to high school student motivation is recognizing and rewarding academic effort. Compared to the United States, students in foreign countries study harder and their parents demand more of the schools because labor market success is determined by how much is learned in high school. Schools in the United States, however, reward students for time spent in school, but offer few benefits for students who study hard. This failure to reward academic achievement is the result of the following phenomena: (1) the labor market fails to reward effort and achievement; (2) college admission is based on relative measures, such as Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores and class rank and grade point average (GPA); (3) classmates actively discourage academic effort that would result in an  upward shift of the grading curve; and (4) parents do not demand higher standards that would place students at risk of not graduating, but would not improve SAT scores or GPAs. The following reforms are suggested: (1) institute statewide achievement tests; (2) establish new graduation credentials; (3) expand the Advanced Placement Program; (4) replace the SAT; (5) modernize the cognitive content of the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB); (6) encourage employers to use high school grades and a spectrum of achievement tests for hiring; (7) require all applicants for civil service positions to submit school and college transcripts; (8) base admission to the armed forces on competence in science and technical subjects; (9) extend school operations; (10) require students who are experiencing  academic difficulty to attend remedial programs; and (11) institute cooperative learning strategies.

Each of these sections concludes with a profile of the most frequently given answers. A tenth section synthesizes the data into 24 similarities among the four groups and 17 differences.

        "description":"This is the second annual report to Congress required by the Hawkins-Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988 (P.L. 100-297). It presents data on high school dropout and retention rates for 1989 and time series data since 1968. It also examines high school completion and graduation rates. Two kinds of dropout rates are reported: (1) the event dropout rate; and (2) the status dropout rate. The event dropout rate represents the proportion of students who leave school during a single year. In the past 3 years the rate has been 4.5 percent for students in grades 10-12, which represents about 429,000 per year. The status dropout rate represents the proportion of individuals who are not enrolled in school and have not completed high school. In October  1989, 12.6 percent of 16- to 24-year-olds were status dropouts, representing about 4 million. A third kind of dropout rate--the cohort rate--was not covered because no new data have become available since the last report. Nationally, the status dropout rate has been declining since the late 1960s and the event dropout rate since the late 1970s. The status dropout rate for Blacks has declined by almost half over the last two decades and is now only 1.4 percentage points above the White rate. Hispanic dropout rates show no consistent trend since 1972 and remain high. High school graduation/completion rates ranged from 68 to 86 percent in 1989, depending on the age range of the group surveyed and whether an equivalency certificate is counted. Several possibilities for improving the accuracy  and extending the relevance of the data are discussed. Data are presented in 12 tables and 9 graphs. Time series and standard error tables and technical notes are included in two appendixes. (MYM)",

Children of color are the most rapidly increasing population group and the largest group at risk for disabilities. Black and Hispanic American children are more likely than White children to live in poverty, which makes them more vulnerable to disabling conditions and learning problems. Preschool children comprise the poorest of these at-risk minority groups. Interviews with two administrators, one parent, and one teacher from states with varied cultural groups suggest the following strategies for identifying and meeting the special needs of young minority group children: (1) target  public awareness locally; (2) involve local programs in planning statewide awareness campaigns; (3) translate public awareness materials into appropriate languages and dialects; (4) involve cultural groups in planning public awareness activities; (5) develop initiatives for increasing the number of minority professionals and paraprofessionals in the early childhood field; (6) increase the number and involvement of minority group members in advisory and policymaking groups; (7) collaborate with cultural communities providing services; (8) increase trust by being a resource for cultural communities; (9) support community groups with services they identify for themselves; (10) provide services for persons of color who serve in advisory and policymaking groups; and (11) train service  providers to work with families from a variety of cultures.

        "description":"This study assesses trends in public school segregation using the index of dissimilarity calculated from racial enrollment data for the period 1968-1986. Here desegregation is defined as a cumulative decline of at least 20 points and resegregation as an increase of at least 10 points from the district's lowest score. In 87 percent of the 960 school districts that underwent racial desegregation, the most recent segregation score was within 10 points of the lowest score observed at any prior date. Many of the 129 districts that experienced resegregation exhibited a slow drift upwards from the low score. Resegregation of more than 20 points occurred in 29 districts. In a multivariate analysis, contextual characteristics (region, size, and racial composition) have insignificant net  effects on the likelihood of resegregation. Characteristics of the district's prior desegregation experience (timing, pace, and extent) have stronger net effects, but no combination of characteristics makes resegregation likely. Statistical data are presented in four tables and four graphs. A list of 28 references is included. (Author/DM)",

This study examines changes in patterns of racial and class segregation in the residential structure of Milwaukee (Wisconsin) between 1970 and 1980 and their effect on poor, black children living in the inner city. Statistical data from the 1970 and the 1980 censuses were analyzed using segregation indexes and measures, after adjusting for data suppressed by the Census Bureau for reasons of confidentiality. The following summary conclusions are discussed: (1) racial residential segregation clearly decreased, especially for high  status blacks; (2) blacks displayed higher levels of intragroup class segregation than whites in 1970; (3) black intragroup class segregation increased more than white intragroup class segregation; (4) changes in the class isolation of poor black children were due to changes in the aggregate population rather than to changes in class segregation patterns; and (5) racial residential segregation is the predominant influence on patterns of class isolation. A discussion of the suppression of data in the census tape files, a list of 34 references, and 9 tables of statistical data are appended. (FMW)",

Calculations of high national and urban dropout rates based on the number of students who do not graduate by age 18 have resulted in a &quot;phantom crisis.&quot; Reforms are needed that encourage greater parental school involvement and give students greater incentives to stay in school. Many characteristics associated with high dropout rates, such as parental educational attainment and criminal involvement, are not school-related and may not have school-based solutions. Those factors that can be traced to schools should be addressed through  programs that offer the student a choice among competing schools. Compulsory attendance regulations, which prohibit students from transferring to nonassigned schools, often make these choices unavailable. In areas with open enrollment policies, some choice programs have encouraged dropouts to complete their education. Minnesota, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin have developed innovative programs that combine both choice and incentives. Statistical data are presented in two tables. (FMW)",

School Based Management/Shared Decision-Making (SBM/SDM) gives school professionals and parents the ability to choose among available strategies for reducing risk by implementing those strategies that most closely target their students' needs. Poor and minority students are at the greatest risk of failure because of a gap between home and school. This gap is the result of differences in the expectations parents and teachers have of students, and between the social and language skills required of students at home and at school. When schools represent an alien culture to students and fail to represent parental interests, students  disengage from the school culture and the socioeconomic universe it represents. The following traditional compensatory education approaches are not effective in educating at-risk students: (1) retention; (2) pullout programs; and (3) in-class aides. The following strategies are more promising: (1) reducing class size; (2) early intervention; (3) cohesive social unit; (4) comprehensive effort; (5) intensive intervention; (6) bilingual instructional services; (7) culturally sensitive programs; (8) built-in flexibility; (9) active teaching; (10) engaged learning; (11) cooperative learning; and (12) community involvement.

This paper reviews research linking homelessness among children to hunger and poor nutrition, health problems and lack of health and mental health care, developmental delays, psychological problems, and academic underachievement. In every category explored, children growing up in shelters and hotels are worse off as a group when compared with their permanently housed peers of the same age. Yet homeless children continue to be warehoused in uninhabitable shelters and hotels for excessive periods of time. Since the problems associated with homelessness have only recently been recognized, only the short-term consequences have been examined;  little attention is being paid to the long-term trauma to these children. The social costs of producing a lost generation of children, which will include increased costs for criminal and juvenile justice, medical care, and special education programs, are likely to exceed substantially the costs of providing sufficient amounts of permanent housing to end the crisis of homelessness. Our cities and our nation must develop means to defray the enormous societal and human costs of homelessness. A list of 20 references is appended. (AF)",

That there may be as many as three million homeless persons in the United States, with families representing one-third of this population, indicates that homelessness is a social problem of catastrophic proportions. This paper finds that while Federal initiatives such as the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act have provided limited emergency aid to homeless families, the following three major categories of challenges remain unmet: (1) reducing the number of homeless families; (2) providing a legal right to emergency shelter; and (3) providing the necessary support services. The paper reviews research on the following serious threats to homeless children's ability to thrive and their  future well-being: (1) health problems and inadequate health care; (2) hunger and poor nutrition; (3) developmental delays; (4) increased frequency of psychological problems; and (5) educational underachievement. Findings of this research indicate that an entire generation of homeless children faces truly unacceptable risks. These risks must be countered by housing assistance, food, health care, mental health care, early intervention programs, and the same public education received by permanently housed children or better.

Although homeless children want to go to school more often than their permanently housed peers, they typically confront significant obstacles to access because of local enrollment requirements, including problems involving residency, guardianship, special education, school records, and transportation. Beyond access, the most serious educational problems for homeless children are poor school attendance and poor academic performance. The principle Federal response has been the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, 1987, which aimed to facilitate integrating homeless children into existing public school systems  and programs. Title VII, Subtitle B of the McKinney Act guarantees homeless children access to public education and provides Federal funding to states to implement this policy. Challenges that remain unmet relative to McKinney Act homeless education measures include the following: (1) noncompliance at both state and Federal levels, arising from the Act's failure to provide a statutory guarantee for a free and appropriate education for homeless children; (2) failure to ensure that homeless children receive adequate educational services once they are enrolled in school; and (3) inadequate funding levels for educational services.

Career Beginnings targets urban high school juniors from low-income families who demonstrate average academic performance and helps them enter college and upgrade their educational choices. The program served students at 24 sites and included the following common features: (1) collaboration between a college, the public schools, and the business community; (2) employment between the junior and senior years; (3) summer workshops and classes; (4) counseling; and (5) mentoring. In all, 1,574 students who qualified for services were randomly assigned in equal  numbers either to the experimental group (which was encouraged to take part in CB activities) or to the control group (which was excluded from CB). Evaluation was based on the responses of 1,233 participants and controls to two follow-up interviews conducted 1 and 2 years later. The following findings are reported: (1) during their senior year, controls received considerably more services similar to those received by participants than had been anticipated; (2) participants received more services than controls at most sites; (3) participants reported liking the program; (4) across the sites, 48.5 percent of the controls attended college; (5) more participants than controls (53.2 percent) attended college and reported raised educational aspirations; (6) differences in the college enrollment  rates of participants and controls persisted throughout the post-high school year; (7) sites varied greatly in their impact; and (8) participants worked less and earned less than controls during the follow-up year.

        "description":"This review examines literature on the community's role in the achievement and psychosocial outcomes of disadvantaged students. It identifies three classes of factors as pertinent: community structure, community climate, and community involvement. Community characteristics were found to have only a weak effect on achievement at the individual level. Noise and household density were found to have an adverse effect on student behavior, however. Community involvement is described here as comprising four processes: mobilization, allocation of resources, academic improvement, and conversion, or turning a student around via a powerful message. This report includes many case studies of programs and descriptions of research on program effectiveness. The types of programs discussed  include dropout and pregnancy prevention, projects that link students to various community institutions, and activities that engage students in pursuits that are constructive and enriching. Research is needed to help program developers address two tough challenges: identifying effective practices from among the scores that now exist, and fostering student participation in program activities. This report includes bibliographical references, a separate annotated bibliography on community support for disadvantaged students, and a directory describing programs mentioned in the body of the report.

        "description":"On September 26, 1990, the Census Bureau released its 1989 figures on poverty and income which showed that no significant progress was made in reducing poverty in 1989, and that gaps between rich and poor and between the wealthy and the middle class hit their widest points in more than 40 years. Although 1989 marked the seventh year of economic recovery, the poverty rate remained higher than in any year of the 1970s. Projected job layoffs and growing food stamp and welfare rolls indicate that the poverty rate has begun to rise in 1990. The new data also show that the lion's share of recent income gains has gone to the richest fifth, in fact, the largest share ever recorded. Furthermore, the Census Bureau does not record an individual's capital gains income, a substantial amount  for this sector of the population. The maximum personal income it records is $299,000. If a person earns $1 million a year, it is recorded as $299,000. The poverty rate was much higher in 1989 than in 1979, although the unemployment rate was similar in both years. The poverty rate for Hispanics and children rose dramatically from 1979 to 1989; it declined for the elderly. Declining wage levels, reductions in government benefits, and an increase in the number of families headed by single women have contributed to this trend. In a separate report released the same day, the Census Bureau discussed alternative measures of poverty, such as counting after-tax rather than before-tax income, counting medical benefits as income, omitting the homeless from poverty data, and including food stamps as  income. Data are presented in four tables and four graphs. (DM)",

Case studies were used to gather information from the schools in the New York City, Chicago, and Metropolitan Los Angeles school districts. The research yielded 10 factors that may be associated with the success of the schools: (1) a safe and orderly environment conducive to teaching; (2) a businesslike attitude of teachers and students; (3) a warm and caring school climate; (4) an admissions process that makes students feel special--based on student interest in the career specialty, not solely on test scores; (5) a dual mission to prepare students for an occupation and for college; (6) high  expectations for all students to succeed accompanied by attempts to minimize grouping students by ability; (7) a curriculum organized around an industry or a discrete set of subjects; (8) the integration of theory and practice in the courses of instruction; (9) strong linkages with business and industry and sometimes with local institutions of higher education; and (10) leadership in the office of the principal that is inspiring, sensitive, and firm. These schools sometimes encounter barriers in the form of school district and teacher union regulations about teacher hiring and training of teachers as well as from budget constraints. However, they are not much more costly than regular schools and are much more effective in their urban neighborhoods than other schools.

It first provides a brief history of the development of dental education. The second and most extensive section analyzes global trends for dental caries, periodontal conditions, tooth loss and edentulousness, developmental disorders, systemic diseases, and traumatic injuries. The third section considers what these trends will mean in terms of the demand for different categories of oral health personnel and for low-, moderate-, and high-technology care. The report notes that the clinical functions required of oral health personnel will change from the simple to the complex. The second half of the report discusses the immediate  educational changes needed to protect against an oversupply of oral health personnel, overqualified for routine clinical functions yet inadequately trained to perform necessary specialized, sophisticated procedures. Topics include advantages of a health sciences approach organized on modular lines, changes in curricula that can support revised educational objectives, and methods for setting and maintaining educational standards. Fifteen specific tasks that can contribute to effective changes in educational systems for training dentists and auxiliary personnel are outlined. Eleven references are listed.

The report, \"Workplace Competencies: The Need to Improve Literacy and Employment Readiness,\" points out that past measures of literacy have lacked comparability, resulting in no accurate way to determine if Americans today are more or less literate than they were 20 years ago. Because of the complexity of society, literacy assessments should take into account that different life and workplace tasks require varying levels of competency. The 1986 National Assessment of Educational Progress found that most young adults can read, but a large percentage cannot solve problems presented to them in formats simulating real-life  situations. Focus should be on the skills workers need today and not on uncertain projections of future job-market demands. The findings have these implications for policymakers: (1) the most pressing literacy problem is the large number of adults who can read but lack information processing skills; (2) tests are needed that assess real-life literacy skills; (3) schools must develop student proficiency in real-life tasks; and (4) better measures are needed to evaluate the nation's literacy progress.

These distinctive attributes include open enrollment, irregular attendance, time on task, student diversity, and teacher characteristics. Research concerned with instructional outcomes shows that effective teaching methods cannot be disentangled from context, purpose, curriculum, and other variables. Suggestions for needed research include identifying: (1) errors, strengths, and weaknesses that characterize adult readers at different levels; (2) length of time for adults to progress through different reading levels; (3) needed amount of direct instruction; (4) needed amount of independent  reading; (5) differences between development of literacy skills in adults and children; and (6) alternatives to conventional diagnostic and assessment tests. Three approaches that characterize contemporary practice in adult literacy education are competency-based adult education, tutorial approaches, and community-oriented approaches.

Studies that have researched reasons for the choice of distance study are highlighted. Research on student types that best suit distance education is also reviewed. The next section focuses on the thorough research into the two constituent elements of teaching and learning in distance education: the presentation of learning matter in preproduced courses and the communication between the supporting organization (its tutors and/or counselors) and its students. A brief overview of research on the administration of distance  education considers various forms of organization. Studies of supervised distance education are addressed as a special application. Other research areas touched upon include course and systems evaluation, theoretical approaches to distance education, the history of distance education research, and methods applicable to research into distance education.

Respondents were surveyed during the 14th-17th weeks following the end of their JTP participation. Five outcomes were studied: number of weeks worked, employment status, earnings during week 13, welfare status during week 13, and educational status. Among the findings were the following: (1) JTP services received by Title IIA and III participants differed sharply; (2) for outcomes other than earnings, the effects of JTP services were similar for both Title IIA and III participants; (3) ending JTP participation to enter employment  increased weeks worked and the chance of working during week 13 and decreased the likelihood of receiving public income assistance; (4) being black had a negative effect on weeks worked and the chance of being employed in week 13; and (5) assessment was an important aspect of increasing earnings for dislocated workers.

Analysis of the data found that, overall, the employers hold a moderately favorable opinion of JTP and JTP participants as employees. Nearly 52 percent of the employers would be &quot;very likely&quot; and 35 percent would be &quot;somewhat likely&quot; to continue hiring JTP trainees. Employers also said that JTP trainees are a good source of skilled labor and that the benefits of participation in the program outweighed the costs. On the  other hand, employers believed that JTP participants are below average in mathematics skills and they need more on the job training and more supervision than nonparticipants. The most important reasons for employer participation in JTP are wage subsidy and lowered recruitment costs. Part two of the study was a survey of 4,012 completers of JTP Ohio training programs. There were many discrepancies between employee- and employer-reported data on employment dates, wages, and reasons for job leaving. Recommendations were made to enhance the job program and to improve data recording instruments. The employer and employee survey instruments are appended. (KC)",

Five outcome variables were studied: weeks worked, employment status during week 13, earnings in week 13, welfare status during week 13, and school attendance status. Demographics, reason for termination from JTP, and service delivery area effects were also analyzed. Among the findings were the following: (1) preexisting differences had a significant influence on the outcomes--females, blacks, and older workers earned less and JTP services had the intended effects of increasing likelihood of employment and number of weeks worked and decreasing likelihood of being on welfare; (2) these  differences were found even though indicators such as education, training, and labor market experience were controlled statistically; (3) classroom training, job search assistance, and on-the-job training increased the likelihood of employment in week 13 and the number of weeks worked thereafter and decreased the likelihood of receiving public assistance. It was concluded that JTP Ohio services have the intended effects on labor market outcomes. Reason for termination from JTP programs is a critical factor.

        "description":"Follow-up surveys were conducted of adult clients who participated under Titles IIA and III of the Job Training Partnership (JTP) Act in Ohio. Data were gathered from JTP clients 13 and 26 weeks after completion of the program and combined with data from the state management information system, and a survey of a sample of employers of JTP-Ohio services. The survey found that a little more than two-thirds of both Title IIA and Title III participants enter employment. These former clients are far more likely to be employed and to have higher weekly earnings when they are contacted after termination than clients who leave JTP-Ohio for other reasons. During the first 13 weeks after leaving JTP-Ohio, former Title IIA clients work an average of 8 weeks and Title III clients work almost  10 weeks. After 13 weeks, 59 percent of the Title IIA clients and 73 percent of the Title III clients, are employed. The Title IIA clients who are employed earn an average of $218 and the Title III clients earn $363. About the same results were found after 26 weeks. However, persons who were welfare recipients when they began the programs were working less and earning less than those not on welfare when they enrolled. About half of those on welfare at the start of the program are not on it after 13 or 26 weeks. Employers were generally favorable to the program. The study concluded that the JTP-Ohio program has been successful in helping more people with more problems than on-the-job training alone could have been, but that some individuals have more problems than the program can address.

Findings included the following: (1) 42% had returned to education and training, almost half to courses lasting 6 or more months; (2) almost three-quarters of managerial/professional persons had participated, but 77% of semi/unskilled workers had not; (3) reasons for nonparticipation included lack of interest/time, family responsibilities, and lack of job relevance; (4) job relatedness, improved qualifications, and personal satisfaction were reasons for participation; and (5) lack of interest in participation may stem from negative school experiences. Conclusions and  recommendations included the following: (1) more efforts to encourage participation of semi/unskilled workers and adults under 35 are needed; (2) the utility and benefits of education and training and their distinction from prior school experiences should be stressed; (3) additional services such as day care should be provided; (4) distance learning opportunities and the diversity of adult education courses should be advertised; and (5) a wide variety of part-time and evening courses should be offered.

Part 1 previews the many available definitions of technology and attempts to synthesize what technology is. Five defining attributes of technology are identified, providing a structure for the subsequent discussion. Part 2 elaborates on the nature of home economics as currently taught in Scottish secondary schools. Part 3 explores how technology as it is here interpreted might, in general terms, be integrated into home economics courses without damaging the subject's integrity. Part 4 is essentially a compendium of examples of technology in home economics and collects information from journal articles and other published sources, from work proceeding in Scottish education authorities, and from a number of  initiatives and projects underway in England and Wales. Part 5 considers briefly the implications for the individual home economics teachers, for the profession as a whole, and for education authorities and other bodies of placing home economics in the technological activities and applications mode. Appendixes provide detailed information on definitions of both technology and home economics, the aims and objectives of courses in the latter, some suggestions for teachers, and a five-page bibliography.

        "description":"Leadership development is needed in vocational education; the field lacks an adequate number of leaders and is making almost no systematic effort to develop them. In order for leadership development activities to be undertaken, however, a definition of leadership is needed. An overview of the literature suggests that leadership can be seen as both a process and a property, and the leader's role can be seen to be the accomplishment of four broad tasks: to inspire a shared vision, to foster collaboration and ownership, to exercise power effectively and enable others to act, and to set the right external context for the organization. This conceptualization of leadership also advances the proposition that leadership behaviors result from the interaction of the leader's attributes,  the group's attributes, the task at hand, and the general context. Desirable leadership attributes predispose leadership behaviors. However, some leadership attributes can be developed through deliberate educational interventions, especially through professional development. A study by the National Center for Research in Vocational Education at Minnesota's 34 technical colleges validated this concept of leadership through a survey of 510 vocational-technical institute faculty (with 282 responses). Results pointed to the need for more studies to promote confidence in these findings. At the same time, the Center must also begin to provide leadership development services to the field of vocational education. (Includes 61 references and 5 appendices detailing survey results.)

More than 95 percent opt for an additional 2 or 3 years of upper secondary school, after which they have free access to further education. The system of adult education is designed to bridge the gaps between generations and to provide opportunities for recurrent, lifelong education. The traditionally strong position of adult education is partly tied to the large number of providers. Formal adult education comprises basic education operated by authorities through government grants and municipal adult education. Popular adult educational activities are studies at folk high schools or under the aegis of adult educational associations. Labor market training takes the form of specially organized  vocational training or uses the regular educational system. Personnel education and inservice training are educational activities aimed at employees and organized on the employers' terms and at their expense in companies and national or local authorities. The government has tried to establish the necessary preconditions for adult educational activities, including adult education in all municipalities, educational financing, educational leave, studies as part of the renewal of working life, and adult education as an expression of general welfare policy.

Formal adult education is offered by the local education committees in all of Sweden's 284 municipalities and, in certain educational fields, by the 23 county councils. In addition, two national schools for adults provide supplementary educational opportunities. Municipal authorities are required to organize a special form of adult education known as basic education for adults who are illiterate. Swedish language instruction for adult immigrants is offered free of charge. Public libraries  and audiovisual centers play an important role in adult education. Labor market training is any program for which allowances are granted for vocational training by the National Labor Market Board. Personnel and in-house education is financed by employers. Sweden's two largest employee organizations also sponsor training programs. Radio, television, and correspondence schools are also available. The government inspects and finances adult education to a large extent. The rapid growth in adult education has been aided by collaboration among the agencies and organizations involved. (YLB)",

Although the educational system must be reformed to remedy this problem, that will take time. Meanwhile, employers need other ways to maintain staffing and productivity. They could go outside the United States to recruit workers, or they could add more automation to reduce the need for workers. An easier solution, however, would be to hire Army alumni to fill their jobs. The Army produces trained personnel who have job skills, are literate, and have good work habits. Employers who hire Army alumni will get productive workers without providing extensive training. Employers can find Army alumni to hire through a new  Army Career and Alumni Program. They can also use additional government resources. Most important, companies can encourage their personnel departments to look for Army alumni to fill job openings with skilled, dependable workers.

During the project, the following activities were carried out: (1) programs and systems in use in ABE programs in the state of Washington during the 1989-90 school year were identified; (2) an advisory committee was formed; (3) evaluation criteria for use in looking at large computer-based instructional systems were developed; (4) five systems currently in use in Washington that have high consumer interest were identified; (5) an in-depth, on-site examination of these five systems was conducted; and (6) a final report was prepared with specific  information about each system. Systems evaluated and described in this report are the CCC Instructional System (Computer Curriculum Corporation, Palo Alto, California); CCP System (Comprehensive Competencies Program, U.S. BASICS, Alexandria, Virginia); ClassWorks System (Computer Networking Specialists, Walla Walla, Washington); PLATO System (Control Data, Rolling Meadows, Illinois); and WICAT System (WICAT Systems, Orem, Utah). A matrix compares characteristics of the five systems. Survey results and the evaluation instrument and checklist are appended. (KC)",

Two of the main sources of information related to adult education are information databases and clearinghouses or resource centers. Two comprehensive references that can be used to select the most appropriate database are the &quot;Encyclopedia of Information Systems and Services, 10th Edition&quot; (1990) and &quot;Datapro Directory of On-Line Services&quot; (1990). The Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) database is considered to be the primary source for adult education due both to its purpose and its history of service to the field. National and state-level clearinghouses and resource centers disseminate information about adult education to a  variety of audiences. &quot;The Directory of National Clearinghouses: Resource Centers and Clearinghouses Serving Adult Educators and Learners&quot; (1990) provides information about national clearinghouses and resource centers. Two common strategies used to identify information resources are asking other people and searching information databases. Most information databases can be accessed both manually and by computer, and many are available in CD-ROM format. Guidelines to evaluate and select resources based on their content include authority of source, timeliness, relevance, depth, accuracy, and replicability. (Seven references are listed.) (YLB)",

        "description":"Four major types of approaches to learner assessment are standardized testing, materials-based, competency-based, and participatory assessment. Standardized tests are easy and inexpensive to administer. Objections are their intrinsic defects and misuse. Materials-based assessment, the practice of evaluating learners on the basis of tests following the completion of particular curriculum materials, creates a closed system. Because competency-based assessment recognizes the importance of prior learning and rewards what individuals can already do, it is more compatible for use with adults. A criticism is that it is still a test given under classroom conditions. Participatory assessment has these features: a view of literacy as practices and critical reflection, the use of a broad  range of assessment strategies, and an active role for learners in the assessment process. A criticism is that alternate forms of assessment lead to less demanding levels of achievement. Guidelines for selecting assessment instruments and procedures include: purpose of the assessment; appropriateness of the instrument; reliability, validity, and practicality of the instrument; and congruence between instrument/approach and instruction.

        "description":"Communication, mathematics, science, and vocational skills are critical to an individual's career progression, but they do not guarantee job success. Many employers believe that employability skills are of primary importance. Because of the changing nature of today's employment picture, employers need creative, flexible workers who have a broad range of interpersonal and managerial skills. Categories of employability skills include individual competence, personal reliability skills, economic adaptability skills, and group and organizational effectiveness skills. Another grouping includes presenting a positive image, exhibiting positive work attitudes, practicing good work habits, practicing ethical behavior, communicating effectively, accepting responsibility, and cooperating  with others. The best results in developing these skills seem to be achieved when employability skill training is integrated with academic and vocational skill training--forming a set of five basic skills. Strategies for incorporating employability skill development concepts in the classroom include demanding good deportment, expressing work values through classroom instruction, encouraging self-esteem, promoting and displaying a positive attitude, and using instructional materials that illustrate the importance of employability skill development.

        "description":"Interactive videodisc (IVD) offers a combination of media with practical applications in vocational education. IVD is superior to videotapes and other media in quality, applicability, and effectiveness. IVD can be used in different settings and for a variety of instructional applications. Although not appropriate for every learning situation, IVD has strengths, including student control of the interaction, instant feedback, and a two-way dialogue that engages the learner mentally and physically. Vocational educators have applied IVD in various ways: to teach employability skills; to provide remedial instruction for technical students with low math skills; to provide training in safety, security, and quality standards through simulation of workplace problems; and to provide  tutorial and simulation of the use of a welding torch. Key factors in using IVD in vocational education are related to instructional design, teacher role, and costs. A basic question is whether IVD is the appropriate medium for the subject or situation. IVD, a highly learner-centered medium, definitely changes the role of the teacher, who acts more as a resource person or facilitator. Although cost seems to be a barrier, most equipment is modular and additions can be made over time. (11 references) (YLB)",

The analyses presented are based on a variety of secondary data sources, as well as data from nationwide surveys of plant managers, their local union leader counterparts, and executives of parent companies of the plants sampled. The first chapter reviews the existing literature and sets the stage for the analyses that follow. Chapter 2 develops a general theoretical framework, which broadly guides the subsequent analyses. Chapter 3 describes companywide labor relations strategies that have recently emerged and examines why some parties have embarked on cooperative relations and why just as many have not. In addition, the objectives and  structure of joint programs, as reported by a sample of plant managers and local union leaders, are described. Chapter 4 examines how effective these joint efforts have been and identifies factors that appear to enhance or diminish their effectiveness. Chapter 5 addresses the underlying problems arising in the joint decision-making process that undermine the potential success and longevity of cooperative efforts. Finally, how the parties can go about resolving, avoiding, or minimizing the costly effects of these key problems is addressed in chapter 6. In that final chapter, implications for the union movement also are discussed and survey forms are appended. The book concludes with 96 references and an index. (KC)",

Two general types of outcomes are included: individual and societal, with a subset of societal outcomes specific to employers. Chapter 3 parallels chapter 2 in structure, but focuses on the elements of quality related to the educational experience. The educational  experience is divided into two domains: school context and school process. Chapter 4 presents some issues and guidelines regarding the development of quality indicators for the elements within the proposed model.

Discussions identified several principal incentives to encourage corporate support of community services and education: tax incentives, public recognition for corporate efforts, clear communication of community needs and priorities, and leadership by various levels of government. Principal disincentives to corporate involvement were administrative time and costs, adverse economic conditions, drawing of resources from the firm's main business activities, and difficulty of measuring and monitoring results. Factors that recently influenced business  philanthropy were businesses' endorsement of a broad concept of social responsibility, federal encouragement of greater private sector involvement, and concern about the inadequate development of basic skills among entry workers. For many, the marginal cost of giving, in after-tax dollars, had a major effect on the inclination to make contributions. Another large segment said they would be unaffected. Public policy implications and recommendations for federal, state, and local government units were identified. (The interview protocol and 12 references are appended.) (YLB)",

To implement the project, these activities were conducted: (1) each marketing instructor completed a survey instrument for the assessment of each core competency in the current curriculum; (2) the data were tabulated and reviewed by the project advisory committee and revisions were made; (3) a review was conducted by selected business and industry personnel; (4) focus groups reviewed the revised core curriculum and suggested instructional resources; (5) revised core competencies were cross-referenced with selected textbooks and resource materials; and (6) a final review was  conducted by the Missouri marketing education curriculum team. As a result of the project, revised core competencies for the Fundamentals of Marketing and Advanced Marketing courses in the marketing education curriculum were developed. The final product is a new competency listing for the two courses and a marketing education teacher's resource guide that details the cross-referencing of competencies to instructional materials. The project recommended that the core competencies be reviewed and revised at least every 5 years. (Appendices include the survey instrument, list of members of the curriculum team, and competency list and mean scores.) (KC)",

The employment outlook for the typical work-bound high school graduate is gloomy due to a shrinking labor force and poorly prepared workers. Employer complaints of poorly trained youth, weaknesses of secondary vocational education programs, the increasing need for improved continuing education, and concerns of legislators are addressed. Suggesting that the solution must be multifaceted, the report considers an approach that includes developing and making available appropriate tools to determine abilities of the U.S. work force, updating curriculum and methods in the public education system to develop these skills, integrating student part-time work into the student's studies, and providing programs  and support services that train for the work force or smooth the transition into a career-track job. The report concludes that new ways of looking at the old problems should be created and that increased funding as well as a more positive attitude concerning the career goals of work-bound students are needed. Four vignettes describe the Job Training Partnership Act, Worklink, Jobs for America's Graduates, and Educational Testing Service research on workplace literacy training.

This module is designed to help the teacher plan and direct individual and group field trips that will enrich students' classroom learning experiences, spark their interest in the world of work, and provide concrete, real-world applications of their learning. It is made up of three learning experiences containing activities that may either provide background information or practice experiences, or combine these two functions. Upon completion of these experiences, the user should be able to achieve the terminal objective in the fourth and final learning experience. The final experience requires the user to demonstrate  the skill in an actual teaching situation when that user is an intern, student teacher, inservice teacher, or occupational trainer. The learning experiences are based on the following enabling objectives: (1) demonstration of knowledge of the rationale for and procedures involved in directing field trips; (2) direction, or critique of the direction, of an individual field trip; and (3) direction, or critique of the direction, of a group field trip. The terminal objective is actual direction of field trips. (YLB)",

The study sought to: (1) document the incidence and level of basic skills instruction, along with the teaching methods and materials used, in the vocational and academic classrooms; and (2) assess the perceptions of vocational and nonvocational teachers of the two participating sites. Classroom observations were conducted in 29 classrooms by one observer, using the techniques in &quot;The Dynamics of Secondary Vocational Classrooms&quot; (Weber et al., 1988). Focus groups were conducted for teachers at each site. The results of classroom observation and focus group study indicated that basic academic  competencies are being addressed in the vocational and nonvocational classrooms. Applied methodology is becoming a part of academic instruction, and basic skills integration is becoming a part of vocational instruction. Teachers support the project and have noted a number of positive outcomes, such as positive changes in student performance and self-esteem, changes in the ways teachers approach teaching, and increased awareness of and communication among teachers. Finally, there was hope that support would continue to be given to the project. (KC)",

Members also receive training in methods and skills that they can use in supervising their colleagues and themselves throughout their professional careers. In addition, the approach emphasizes development of conceptualization skills and enhances cognitive growth in general.

Rates are reported both in terms of percentages of individuals who engaged in specific criminal acts and in terms of rate of offenses per individual. Results, reported through a series of tables, showed that illegal behavior in general declined with increasing age, with the important exception of rates of assault as reflected in arrest  records, which did not peak until age 21. Another set of tables presents results for time trends in self-reported illegal behavior and corresponding indices of arrest. One implication of these findings is that time trends in crime rates are not at all uniform across offenses, and thus do not reflect any change in a general tendency toward deviance. Yet the results also suggest that rates of assault have increased significantly over the period covered by the survey. (Twelve tables and 8 line graphs are attached.) (TE)",

It notes that this approach views a person's life style along two dimensions: the first dimension examines the person's relational experiences at the family, relational, and self level; the second dimension involves an understanding of how well each spouse has dealt with developmental issues and what impact these events (birth, death, marriage, divorce) has had upon them. A discussion of assessment in systemic therapy notes that presenting problems are viewed for their greater symbolic value rather than for their content value. The areas of tracking, genograms, sculpturing, circular  questioning, inventories, hypothesis testing, and the holding environment are addressed. The next section examines several interventions in systemic therapy: alliances, homework assignments, reframing/relabeling, contracts, paradoxical interventions, prescribing the symptom, and split opinion. Reasons for the failure of therapy are considered, including family secrets, affairs, nodal events, symptom relief, and reactivity levels. (NB)",

        "description":"A recently published national profile of caregivers of the frail elderly suggests potentially negative consequences of caregiving for work and employment for as many as one-third of the employed caregivers in a large 1983 sample. The study was undertaken to explore a comprehensive set of issues on informal caregiving and to determine the extent to which caregiving by employees has consequences for work and job. A survey instrument adapted from The Travelers Employee Caregiver Survey was completed by 583 employees, 159 of whom identified themselves as caregivers for at least one person age 60 or older. Women are not more likely to be caregivers than men. Of all women in the sample, 28.71% were caregivers and of all men, 27.27%. The findings revealed that only 10% of men surveyed  experienced caregiving related problems on the job, compared to 52% of the women. The difference was accounted for in part by men's greater freedom to rearrange their job schedules and reduce work time to render care. Men are more likely than women to give personal care and medication care. Men are almost as likely as women to offer companionship. (NB)",

        "description":"This report examines the 1988-1989 Attendance Improvement Dropout Prevention (AIDP) program as it operated in 30 New York City public high schools under new guidelines and broadened student eligibility criteria. Part I introduces the dropout prevention program, lists program guidelines and objectives, and describes the evaluation methodology. Part II focuses on program implementation, noting that all participating schools implemented attendance incentives and parent outreach, individual and group counseling, and P.M. schools; and that 70 to 80% implemented 9th and 10th grade houses, block programming, part-time jobs, work-study, vocational training, and independent study. Part III presents student outcomes and part IV gives conclusions and recommendations. A review of the data  revealed that all five of the identified program objectives were met in more than 50% of participating schools: (1) 63% of schools met the average daily attendance objective in 9th grades and 53% met that objective in 10th grades; (2) 94% met semester attendance objective in 9th grades and 100% met that objective in 10th grades; (3) 50% reduced their percentage of long-term absentees in 9th grades and 63% met this objective in 10th grades; (4) the 9th graders in 23% of the schools and 10th graders in 97% of schools met the credit accumulation objective; and (5) 67% of schools reduced their dropout rates by the requisite amount. A list of variables used to measure each objective and a list of participating AIDP schools are appended. (NB)",

Kain) surveys the sociological and psychological development of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s and sets the stage for future developments of the crisis in the 1990s. It reviews the significant medical, political, social, educational, and psychological events of the AIDS crisis, relying on the concept of emergent trends to tie together the events of the first 10 years of the epidemic. In exploring future trends, 10 areas  of importance to counselors are identified. \"A Research Update for Counselors\" (Joseph R. Guydish and Maria Ekstrand) provides an in-depth review of psychosocial research on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spectrum disease. The chapter is clinically focused and surveys literature on HIV epidemiology, persons at risk for AIDS, asymptomatic seropositive persons, and people diagnosed with AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex. The central theme of the chapter is prevention, described as the greatest hope counselors have for slowing the continual spread of AIDS. Both chapters describe AIDS work in its broadest scope and emphasize the major thrust of the guide--that counselors must become involved. (NB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine how adolescent and parental perceptions of selected parental qualities predicted adolescent conformity to parental expectations, using symbolic interaction as a conceptual foundation. Self-report questionnaire data were collected from a sample of 326 families with adolescents. Four separate multiple regression analyses were used to examine adolescent and parental perceptions of adolescent conformity to fathers and mothers. Each of the four regression models explained significant amounts of variance in perceptions of adolescent conformity. Results indicated that several dimensions of adolescent perceptions of parental power and behaviors predicted adolescents' reports of conformity to their parents. In contrast, parental reports of their  own conformity yielded a significant beta for only one relationship, mothers' reports of positive induction as a predictor of mothers' reports of adolescent conformity. A major conclusion drawn from these findings was that adolescent perceptions of parental power and behaviors may serve as better predictors of adolescent conformity than parental perceptions. Further, the need to examine multiple perceptions in parent-adolescent relations within the symbolic interactionist framework was supported. (Author)",

        "description":"Clinical research in the area of severe psychiatric disorders constituted the major focus for the discipline of applied behavior analysis during the early 1960s. Recently, however, there appears to be a notable lack of a behavioral focus within many inpatient psychiatric settings and a relative dearth of published behavioral treatment studies with this population. To examine this trend, a review was conducted of nine journals, within the behavioral literature, which deal with the treatment of severe psychiatric disorders (including schizophrenia, psychotic disorders, dissociative disorders, and personality disorders, among other diagnostic categories). A total of 256 articles published between 1963 and 1988 were reviewed and findings on 9 separate variables were reported. The  data indicated that behavioral treatment studies concerned with severe psychiatric disorders significantly decreased in frequency over the past 10 years, following a peak of interest during the 1970s. Subsequent analyses suggest that research in the area of anxiety disorders has replaced the early focus of behavioral researchers on the severe psychiatric disorders. Following an introductory discussion, the bulk of this document consists of the source list or bibliography of the 256 articles identified in the review. (NB)",

COC staff identified 123 students who were originally scheduled to attend COC classes during fall 1990 but whose fall 1990 schedules did not contain COC courses. From these students, 75 were interviewed. The primary question asked of students was why they were once scheduled to attend COC classes but were no longer enrolled in those classes. Sixteen respondents reported that they needed additional classes for graduation; 11 reported a schedule conflict with either a job, a class, or extracurricular activities; 9 gave no reason; 8 reported needing some other classes  but not for graduation; and 7 simply changed their minds. Secondary questions focused on the students' high school coursework and goals. The results revealed that most students intended to go to college and then begin a career. Most felt that their coursework was related to their goals and felt that they would be able to reach their goals. Based on these findings, several recommendations are made to school counselors who help students with class scheduling.

        "description":"Measures of automaticity have shown different developmental trends in the speed and accuracy of processing in learning disabled (LD) and normally achieving children. This study extends this research to young adults, comparing the learning disabled with normal achievers. Its primary focus was to document the presence of basic processing deficits in adults similar to those characteristic of learning disabled children. Tasks sensitive to automaticity in work retrieval included rapid serial naming, Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN), and Rapid Alternating Stimuli (RAS), used to assess the speed of categorical and cross-categorical naming. Scores on these tasks were analyzed with respect to a measure of verbal retroactive inhibition--trigrams--purported to tap mechanisms of attention and  processing. Results were further analyzed with respect to measures of reading achievement. Forty learning disabled and 40 normally achieving college students were matched by gender, age, and scores on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised. Results indicated that learning disabled adults were slower and more variable in automatized naming across all tasks. Additionally, the learning disabled were significantly poorer on trigrams performance than their normally achieving peers. When compared to achievement, the variance observed in automatized processes did not account for significant differences in reading levels; however, when the variance of trigrams was removed, significant differences in reading achievement were eliminated. The results of the investigation support the position  that the learning disabled demonstrate deficits in basic processing skills involved in automatized processing. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"Recent literature indicates that ministers' families face not only the normative developmental stressors of other families, but an additional set of stressors created by the interface between the family and the church systems. Based upon the Double ABCX model of family stress, particular ministers' families will vary in their ability to adapt to stressors based upon a variety of factors including: the particular stressor event; the family resources; the family definition of the stressor; the amount of family crisis resulting from the event, the resources, and the definition; the pile-up of prior strains and current hardships; the resources and support; redefinition of the situation; and coping skills. Implications of this model may be considered at these levels: (1) church  leadership may seek to reduce stressors while providing resources to help families; (2) seminary training and continuing educational opportunities for ministers and their spouses can emphasize that stress is a normative part of life and ministerial lifestyle requires a special type of family/occupational coordination; (3) workshops for those currently pastoring churches can emphasize that stress is a normative part of life and provide suggestions for coordinating family and occupational concerns; (4) written materials to minimize stress while maximizing family and occupational effectiveness can be published; and (5) diagnostic tools can be developed for assessing stress and adaptation in ministerial families.

The Commission's findings and recommendations are  presented. Observations about drug problems are provided and ways that schools and communities can begin to solve them are suggested. Examples of some effective drug prevention programs and activities the Commission found in its investigations appear throughout the report. It is noted that although the Commission has given considerable thought to the contents of the report, unanimity on every recommendation was not possible given the diversity of perspectives and strongly held views.

        "description":"One aspect of the student personnel field which has not been researched is a list of the basic books in the fields related to the profession with which professionals-in-training should be familiar. This study sought to identify those books by surveying Chief Student Affairs Officers (CSAO) (N=45) and heads (N=58) of student personnel preparation programs listed as being most important for students in master's degree programs to read. Titles of books were checked to determine if they actually existed. Each book was assigned to the following categories based on the Library of Congress designation: management, counseling, higher education, research, college students, social issues, or student personnel. Results indicated there was not much agreement among respondents as to which  specific books are most important for professionals-in-training to read, although there was more agreement on the category of books these students should be reading. Tables list the top 11 books related to student personnel; the categories of related books; choices by heads of programs approved and not approved by Commission XII; and choices of books by heads of programs, classified as administration, counseling, or student development.

        "description":"In China, psychologically oriented student counseling services are just beginning to appear on college campuses and professional assistance is badly needed from all sources. In order to help these counseling centers to develop, this paper attempts to discuss what Chinese counselors can do to help students to cope with their academic and emotional difficulties at school. Specifically, the paper begins with a description of some of the most common problems among Chinese college students. It then addresses the psychological significance of these problems to students' intellectual growth and their needs for counseling assistance. This is followed by a discussion of four suggestions as to what Chinese counselors can do to develop, expand, and improve their services to students. A  tribute is paid to Chinese counselors for their enthusiasm, energy, and efforts in helping to develop more fully their intellectual and emotional potentials. It is noted that their work may not be fully appreciated by society now, but they certainly have a bright future ahead of them. The paper concludes with a plea for more social and governmental support for the development of student counseling services in China. (ABL)",

Specifically, the monograph addresses normative ethics in the use of automated systems in the field and practice of counseling and guidance. It is noted that the immense growth planned for computer applications in guidance and counseling suggests the potential value in looking at ethics from the perspective of philosophical analysis, or metaethics. These legal issues in the use of computers in counseling are discussed: confidentiality; reliability; records; research; security; and networks. These ethical issues are discussed: screening of clients; literacy; testing and interpretation; popular misconceptions; counselor intervention; system access;  unattended access to software; software bias; freedom of choice; climate of integrity; confidentiality within and among groups; notes and records of client sessions; orientation to expectations and limitations; and experimentation and research. These professional issues are discussed: learning styles; decisionmaking and planning; graduation requirements, tracking, and determination; professional renewal; systems evaluation; purchase guidelines; video enhancements; informed consumerism; conflict with counselor advice; and individual and computer scoring. The monograph concludes with the recommendation that new ways must be found to take advantage of technology in order for counselors to have more supportive, insightful, private time with clients.

        "description":"Some men are not sensitive to women and the way some men treat or think of women is a problem. Men, especially those in key leadership roles, need to challenge other male colleagues and students and to speak out in support of women if the relationship between men and women is to improve. More specifically, male administrators need to make clear value statements and engage students in an examination of their attitudes and behavior surrounding those values. The goal is to instill a spirit that extends beyond purely attending to what is obligated by law. Men need to encourage each other to examine their personal attitudes and feelings toward women. Male leaders need to talk candidly about rapes that occur on college campuses. Male administrators need to learn to listen as a way of  becoming more informed and sensitive. Men need to write and distribute material that speaks to men about rape. A male administrator needs to take a lead role in raising the campus community's consciousness about sexism. Men need to listen to and learn from women so that they have the knowledge and ability to carry on a dialogue. (The author's experiences at the University of Maine at Farmington are described. A list of 11 questions to consider when evaluating events/activities on campus is included.) (ABL)",

A survey was conducted of 54 interns in Clinical Psychology at the Boston Veterans Administration Hospital from 1983 through 1988. The findings revealed that one in six subjects had experienced a patient suicide during their training years. Eight of the nine trainees who had experienced a patient suicide and 10 former trainees who reported a patient suicide attempt completed two copies of the Impact of Event Scale (IES): one with reference to the 2 weeks following the patient suicide or suicide attempt and a second with reference to the 2 weeks immediately preceding completion of the scale. Trainees who had experienced a  patient suicide reported stress levels on the IES equivalent to patient reference samples with bereavement, and higher than professional clinicians with patient suicide. Trainees who experienced a patient suicide attempt also reported initially feeling high levels of stress. No significant difference was found on the IES ratings between the Patient Suicide Group and the Patient Suicide Attempt Group. Most frequently, trainees turned to supervisors for support and formulation of the suicide. Preparatory efforts via suicide education were found to be minimal and inadequate. (Author/NB)",

Under each stage, major health issues are addressed. \"Career Development and Counselor Preparation\" (Kenneth B.

Data were gathered from clients of approved Australian marriage counseling agencies (n=540) who took a pre-counseling survey during a 4-week period in October-November 1987 and a post-counseling survey 8 months later. To determine effectiveness, the study concentrated on the following outcomes: change in relationship status; change in level of commitment to relationship; satisfaction with counseling; and improvement in problem area, personal life, and viability of relationship. This book reports in detail the findings of this study. After an executive summary and introduction, part 1 provides an overview of marriage counseling in  Australia, with chapters on: (1) the role of government in providing counseling services; (2) the role of marriage counseling agencies; (3) a definition of marriage counseling; (4) a review of the literature on the effectiveness of marriage counseling; and (5) the demographies of the users of marriage counseling. Part 2 delineates the pre-counseling survey results, including research design, procedures, and response rates; characteristics of participants; why clients came to counseling; expectations of counseling; and pathways to marriage counseling. Part 3 likewise delineates the post-counseling survey results, with chapters on the effectiveness of marriage counseling, client satisfaction, counseling outcomes, predictors of perceived counseling effectiveness, assistance from counseling,  number and type of interviews, and perception of marriage counseling services. Part 4 discusses the cost-benefits of marriage counseling, while part 5 concludes the study with implications for policy, government departments, and marriage counseling agencies.

The first part reviews standard approaches to secondary prevention of delinquency, such as diversion of responsibility for delinquents from the juvenile justice system to family, school and community-based systems. While most of these diversion programs have not substantially reduced subsequent arrests, successful community-based activity programs are also cited. Other strategies reviewed include educational and vocational training and family-based interventions. The message emerging from this review is that broad-based interventions and settings with multiple purposes and opportunities appear to consistently yield the best results  because they provide numerous opportunities for adolescents to develop positive self-concepts and behavior patterns in a variety of contexts.

The central concept of the program is \"FIG TESPN\" (an acronym for a sequential set of problem-solving skills: Feelings; Identification of the issue; Guiding oneself to a goal; Thinking of possibilities; Envisioning end results for each option; Selecting the best solution; Planning the procedure; and Noticing what happened). Accordingly, Chapter  1 addresses the central role of social decision-making and problem-solving in education. Chapter 2 discusses the methods of social decision-making instruction, including assessment of skills and instructional procedures. Chapter 3 describes activities to promote self-control, social awareness,. and group participation. Chapter 4 presents details of the \"FIG TESPN\" model as an instructional unit for teaching social decision-making and problem-solving. Chapter 5 provides a variety of strategies for incorporating social decision-making activities into the classroom. Chapter 6 discusses ways to adapt social decision-making to different school populations, including learning disabled, gifted and talented, students with attention deficits, emotionally disturbed students, and culturally  different populations. The conclusion reiterates the basic principles of the \"FIG TESPN\" model. Appended are sample stories for students, resources for teachers, a glossary of acronyms, and a bibliography. (TE)",

Qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed four patterns of success/nonsuccess in literacy development within the classroom context: (1) the &quot;independent explorer&quot; children who began kindergarten with the &quot;big picture&quot; of written language and successfully interpreted  the skills-based instruction while engaging in numerous self-directed explorations of print; (2) the &quot;curriculum dependent&quot; children who did not have the &quot;big picture&quot; of written language from the start and exhibited major mismatches between their understandings and those required by the curriculum; (3) the &quot;passive nonweavers&quot; who failed to actively construct relationships between the many skill activities required of them; and (4) the &quot;deferring learner&quot; who moved from a knowledgeable, active stance to a passive one after confronting mismatches between her knowledge of print and the curriculum.

        "description":"A practicum addressed the problem of reading comprehension skills in low achieving students by monitoring their progress utilizing precision teaching. Based on referrals from classroom teachers, guidance counselors, and parents, five students ranging in ability levels from kindergarten through grade 8 were accepted into the program for one or more 8-week tutorial sessions. An individualized learning plan, based on precision teaching principles, was designed for each student's specific needs. Students were introduced to precision teaching, task sheets, and several learning strategies. Results revealed an improvement in reading comprehension for most of the students in the target group. It was concluded that individualized remediation plans, continuous monitoring of students'  progress, and daily charting of the results of utilizing precision teaching facilitated students' learning. (Appendixes include student profiles, analysis of progress, sample assignments, task sheets, and logarithmetic charts.) (Author/MG)",

This practice view of literacy can be sketched out by reporting the continuation and changing focus of a study conducted on adult learners' perceptions of literacy and learning. Subjects, 20 adults from Lancashire, England, between the ages of 20 and 30 years who had left school as early as possible and with minimal qualifications, underwent detailed interviews concerning the part literacy plays in their lives. Additional data consisted of ethnographic case studies of individual households, observation of neighborhood uses of literacy, and the collection of recorded data on access points for literacy.  Preliminary findings suggest categories of significant topics necessary for a complete view of literacy: (1) literacy practices; (2) social practices; (3) roles people take; (4) networks of support; (5) the value of literacy; (6) literacy and change; and (7) how everyday processes of learning are revealed in the home. Examples from the data gathered illustrate the categories. How the social practice of literacy impinges on children is also illustrated with examples from the data. The practice view of literacy moves the focus from a static model of an individual with a set of skills to a more dynamic notion of social practices which people participate in. (RS)",

The skills mentioned by the subjects were coded according to nine categories derived from reading research literature and discussions with several experts in reading research.

Students were grouped by affinity and interests. A reading corner offering a multitude of books of diverse interests was used as a classroom resource. Students also checked out books from the library and researched foreign words on a daily basis. Students shared the results of their reading and research on a weekly basis. As the readings progressed, students compiled lists of foreign words organized into three categories: literature and psychology, social studies, and music. After a period of 2 months, the students authored a  floppy disk containing vocabulary activities using their lists of foreign words. At the end of 3 months of implementation, the results of the practicum were positive. Students were checking out three or more books per month in addition to visiting the library frequently for research. There was a 50% increase in vocabulary acquisition and students were able to use words of foreign origin in sensible sentences with an accuracy of 60%.

Six third-grade classes (149 children) received 2 lessons in which the teaching emphasis was on global story meaning and 2 lessons in which the teaching emphasis was on surface features of language. The study demonstrated that an emphasis on story meaning leads to superior performance on an array of outcome measures, especially for children in low and average reading groups. The study confirmed that children taking an active turn reading aloud and answering  the teacher's questions, particularly children whose reading fluency is low, learn more at these moments. The study found that the average ability of a reading group, especially average group fluency, is more strongly related to outcome measures than are the abilities of individual members of the group. The study showed that the importance and density of information on a page and the serial position of the page, but not its readability, are associated with outcomes.

        "description":"A study examined whether a beneficial effect on children's literacy development accrues from the use of the Little Books with kindergarten children, and identified differential effects on kindergarten achievement according to treatment type, community status, and school type. From a sample of 40 Newfoundland schools, schools were grouped into rural village (drawing students from one small community), rural collector (drawing students from several small communities), and urban, and four schools were randomly selected from each grouping. Schools were assigned randomly to one of the treatment groups (Little Books used in the home only, Little Books used in the home and school, Little Books used in the school only, and control). Complete pretest and posttest data were obtained for  309 children. Quantitative analyses showed the children entering kindergarten in this study to be at risk of school failure. On average, urban kindergartners scored higher on all measures, and village and collector students scored about the same. Differences in posttest means were not related clearly to treatment. However, the Metropolitan Reading Readiness Pretest x Treatment interaction, which showed that the lowest achieving students profited most from the Little Books when they were used at home only, and the highest achieving students profited most from the Little Books when they used them in school only, helps to support the hypothesis that the home has a crucial role to play in literacy development.

        "description":"The message about general literacy standards in Canada (as reported in the Southam Literacy Survey) is that approximately five million Canadians are illiterate. The validity of this message must be challenged because a group of middle-class Canadians with middle-class values established the criteria for being &quot;literate&quot; and felt that all other Canadians must subscribe to their value system. A big question is also how literacy levels relate to the economy. While figures for the rate of illiteracy in Canadian prisons is often placed as high as 80%, it must be remembered that the prison setting is not an ideal setting for literacy development or academic upgrading, and that a more significant factor that must be considered by those who believe that literacy automatically leads to  rehabilitation is the lack of definite goals by prisoners. The messengers are generally newspaper reporters, writers in popular magazines, business officials, and politicians. The first responsibility for receivers of messages is to put the problem of literacy in context. Literate persons also have the responsibility to produce clarity of print and to negotiate via print. Literacy is not in a crisis situation, and the educational system is not falling apart. However, some problem areas do need to be addressed, and these include accountability, qualifications of literacy experts, adult literacy versus children's literacy development, and models and definitions of literacy.

Subjects, 60 college freshmen required to take a developmental reading/study skills course, were tested for prior knowledge on several topics, given an interest rating questionnaire and randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. Subjects assigned to the experimental group were trained to read passages consisting of scientific expository text with a comparison-contrast internal organization; annotate the passages and identify and organize comparison/contrast information; use telegraphic writing to  complete a graphic organizer; and incorporate the comparisons and contrasts into a summary statement. The control group carried out several comprehension development activities that did not deal with text structures. Posttests for both groups consisted of reading a scientific passage, annotating it, completing a graphic organizer of the passage, and completing an immediate retention multiple choice test. Results indicated that: (1) training in recognition of expository text structure was successful in improving students' ability as measured by the graphic organizer task; (2) improvement due to training was found only for the poorer readers; and (3) instruction did little to improve students' summarizing scores or passage comprehension. Findings suggest that in-depth training in graphic  organizers may be superfluous for the average college student.

        "description":"If feminist values are to penetrate and undermine the masculine systems which contain them, it is essential to believe that any serious writing that women do is literature. Only in the last few years has scholarship in women's studies begun to address women in the history of rhetoric. The contemporary woman rhetorician faces the tendency of the established academic community to reject her work because of its association with practice, rather than theory. What she produces is more pedagogical than theoretical, suitable for teaching, but hardly the basis for &quot;understanding&quot; human discourse. Feminist rhetoricians such as Mina Shaughnessy, Andrea Lunsford, and Janet Emig, who are loud voices in the field of composition, have been silenced in rhetoric. Part of the unwillingness of the  rhetoric establishment to accept feminist theory stems from the sexes' different conceptions of self. As Nancy Chodorow and Carol Gilligan have demonstrated, girls' early identification processes with their mothers tend to be relational, while boys in general reject relationship in favor of hierarchical thinking. The feminist rhetoricians identify a different voice, one which allows the collaboration of the multi-vocal text. Women &quot;do&quot; rhetoric differently, and are reinventing the rhetorical tradition. Because of women's contributions, rhetoric will be judged in part on the basis of relationship, growth, community, and learning. (Twenty-one references are attached.) (SG)",

The currently popular metaphor of &quot;scaffolding&quot; alone cannot capture the challenge of responding to the diversity of young children's intentions in literacy activities. An additional metaphor of &quot;weaving&quot; may enrich the ability to make sense of and respond to, in sensible ways, the often puzzling behavior of young children. While the scaffolding metaphor refers to the interactional support that adults and more skillful peers offer learners, weaving imagery suggests how children's progress in any one activity is supported by their experiences in varied activities. To truly scaffold or assist children in weaving the literacy web, educators must appreciate the complex  intellectual and social history of children's stories, designs, pictures, and letters. These works provide insight into friendships, curiosities, and significant themes. The conversations of two students in their first 4 months of school illustrate the possibilities of metaphors.

Language feeds back the sexism, sexism feeds back through language. Treating symptoms of disease alone will not eliminate the disease, but may help, while treating the disease caused by sexism alone may lead to reinfection from the language. &quot;Kids' Meal&quot; boxes, available from &quot;Wendy's&quot; and featuring &quot;Potato Head Kids&quot; engaging in activities on the outside of the box, reinforce sexist values in the culture. Women are portrayed as incompetent, passive, caregivers, lacking rank and authority. Men are authoritative, adventurous, and rescuers. The boxes became a matter of discussion in a college  composition class. As an exercise, the activity of discovering the values inherent in the box helped students to recognize that equalizing representation--say by alternating &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot;--is not enough. The content of the representation matters every bit as much, if not more than, the numbers, and this holds for issues of race, gender, sexual preference, and all of the other &quot;-isms&quot; based on prejudice.

        "author":["Knight, Melinda"],
        "description":"The advances of contemporary rhetorical theory can be drawn upon to resolve the competing values of the two constituencies that have a stake in performance appraisals: the manager and the employee. One reason for problems in the existing model of performance appraisals is that the two sides perceive themselves to be in opposition, and that very fact of opposition can prevent the performance appraisal from reaching what should be its most important goal: helping both sides to work together to improve performance. In this context, one particular advance in rhetorical theory is useful: research and pedagogy on writing groups. All writing group theory is based on the concept of writing as a social activity, but if this is to be taken seriously, it means finding different objectives  for assigning peer writing groups or collaborative writing exercises in the classroom. It means that the most important goal should be the collaboration itself, and in this new objective is a viable application of writing group theory to a new model for performance appraisals in organizations. The modern collaborative classroom translates well into a modern environment for performance appraisals. The appraisee, like the student writer, could be empowered to direct the process; the manager should facilitate collaboration, not simply pass judgment. A collaborative model for performance appraisal can ultimately help students and employees gain the skills in critical evaluation that will enable them to analyze problems and formulate strategies for change.

Such creative responses include: personal response; imitation; parodies; replies to biased or slanted literature; diaries written from the viewpoint of a literary character; modern recreations of literary settings; newspaper articles or interviews with literary characters; letter writing; character sketch; a &quot;Who's Who&quot; entry; case studies of author or characters; and script or scenario writing.

        "description":"A corporate employee newsletter offers an ideal opportunity to discover how literacy functions as a means of assimilating individuals into a social structure. Underlying the corporate newsletter's assimilative function are the assumptions: (1) that in reading, employees rely on attitudes toward types of texts evolved within society as a whole; and (2) that employees create and enter into roles and relationships cued by the text. The newsletter is designed to resemble an ordinary newspaper, so that readers accept the newsletter as truthful and reliable. Furthermore, stories contained in the publications, such as articles praising heroic acts of particular employees, are intended to define the role of the good corporate employee. Analysis of story selection and revision also  reveals that articles seek to humanize the corporation as paternal caregiver, and to portray it as active rather than passive. Because the corporate newsletter is a means of attempting to shape the attitudes and roles of readers, teachers must enable students not only to be literate, but to be critical of the messages they receive because of their literacy. Otherwise, students may be all too easily subjugated by those who would inflict identities and roles upon readers. (SG)",

One student, in particular, made sense of the work done in class by returning, in his final essay, to a class discussion on the various ways the film reviewers had &quot;read&quot; the film to problematize a way of reading described as &quot;giving the author power.&quot; This student's essay shows that film can be used to bring to the surface the complex literate acts involved in reading both printed and visual texts.

Data were developed from a detailed, written document in which the experts (three university professors who had made significant scholarly contributions in children's literature and three elementary school teachers with glowing reputations in the pedagogical area) provided feedback about ideal curricula in general and the literature curriculum in the elementary grades in particular. In terms of commonalities and differences, results revealed that all the experts agreed with the features of ideal curriculum described in the set of framing questions sent to each respondent. They favored a curriculum in literature that is much more focused  and coherent than currently is the norm. Most respondents also viewed literature as an opportunity for fostering important goals--both within language arts and across other subject matter areas. Literature was considered a good tool for teaching writing, for example, or as a vehicle for teaching content in social studies. One respondent thought that good literature led to greater self-understanding. Results also revealed that the concept of literature as an aesthetic object worthy of study in its own right was notably absent in the perspectives represented.

Secondly, the WPA could rely on the &quot;teaching conditions&quot; section of the Statement in calling for  smaller writing class sizes. The administrator would deny transfers of academic credits from schools that make a mockery of the teaching conditions guidelines. Cries for the WPA's removal, threats of lawsuits, charges of academic incompetence, and so on, would focus new attention on the unjust conditions that gave rise to the Statement. The call to action that began with the Wyoming Resolution now must go further, to include sanctions for noncompliance. (SG)",

Little was found in the way of actual research but much was located in the way of authoritative statements from practitioners of journal writing. The literature suggests that journal writing is beneficial in students' personal life, in the educational process as a whole, and, in particular, in the enhancement of thinking processes. There is considerable support for the notion that writing and thinking are interrelated processes. In undertaking journal writing in the classroom, educators suggest that teachers must be prepared to acknowledge and respect the rights of students to express their opinions freely. It appears to be helpful to establish certain guidelines for journal writing in  the classroom. To encourage the development of a variety of thinking processes, it appears to be useful to assign specific modes of response such as summarizing, comparing, and interpreting.

A study examined whether this held true when unconventional nonliteral language is used. Respondents rated the familiarity of 119 proverbs. Literal and nonliteral contexts were generated for 12 familiar and 12 unfamiliar proverbs. Overall, familiar proverbs were read more quickly than unfamiliar ones. Furthermore, unfamiliar proverbs used in their figurative sense were read more slowly than unfamiliar proverbs used in their literal sense. A follow-up study examined the  equivalency in processing of familiar and unfamiliar messages. Students were handed 32 sheets, each bearing a proverb or its paraphrase. The participants were to paraphrase the statements. A familiar proverb, even when placed in its literal context, often generated its figurative meaning, while the reverse was true of unfamiliar proverbs.

Kuhlmeier, The United States Supreme Court ruled that school administrators &quot;need not tolerate&quot; student speech deemed inconsistent with a school's educational mission. To study the effects of the ruling, a 36-question survey was mailed to a random sample of just under 1,600 American public high school English/Journalism departments. Questions addressed the following issues: demographic information; each school's newspaper and its purpose and content; school policy about content; changes in content since the Hazelwood decision; the type of prepublication review carried out; censorship; and student-adviser conflict. There was no majority position on the purpose of the newspaper, but nearly two-thirds of respondents identified the paper as an open forum for student  speech that was not libelous or obscene or did not advocate violence. Little change in school administrators' treatment of the papers as a result of the Hazelwood decision was reported. Over half of respondents indicated that advisers objected to student stories most often because they were seen as unfair or unbalanced. The findings suggest that the Hazelwood decision was not the disaster many people in journalism education feared, and that student press freedom can co-exist with the Supreme Court ruling.

Across-the-curriculum writing finds its merit in removing students from their passivity. Cross-curricular writing activities fall into two groups--expressive writing and product writing. Proponents of writing-across-the-curriculum agree that when teachers incorporate writing in their content areas, the need for review and the need for reteaching after testing is sufficiently reduced to more than make up for the difference in the amount of instructional time required. While hard statistical evidence that writing-across-the-curriculum improves student performance is scarce, a few studies show  positive results. To overcome the problems of implementing a writing-across-the-curriculum program, most school districts have found a year-long plan for inservice education and group dialogue necessary. When content area teachers incorporate writing in all areas of the curriculum, students benefit in three ways: (1) they have a resource for better understanding content; (2) they practice a technique which aids retention; and (3) they begin to write better.

Idea generation techniques can help students generate quantities of creative ideas more quickly and fluently. By looking at ads and recreating the workings of the creative minds behind them, ways in which ideas are produced can be highlighted. The beginning of idea generation is a matter of isolating themes as they are derived from features, selling points, and benefits. If a theme is the &quot;matter&quot; of an ad, an idea is the &quot;manner&quot; of the ad. An idea bank, consisting of layout pages where seeds of ideas are sketched and including a grid logging key features, selling points and benefits, is a means of  keeping track of one's creative consciousness. Idea generation techniques include: (1) associations (again based on features, selling points, and benefits); (2) opposites, including list opposites, media opposites, expectation opposites, and competition opposites; (3) verbal plays, including onomatopoeia, rhyme, alliteration, and multiple meanings; and (4) clocks and calendars (referring to time, seasons, etc.).

Using the metaphor of the mind of the speaker as computer, students can learn about the essentials of effective speech communication: (1) subject; (2) audience; (3) style; and (4) persuasive process. A third hypothesis relevant to speech instruction involves rhythm, a neglected concept, especially in its semantic and thematic guises. Through student speeches in class, students and instructors alike can learn lessons about the  rhythm of language which would not be detected simply by reading the speeches. The basic communication classroom can contribute enormously to the research programs of its teachers, and such scholarly inquiry makes the class a far more valuable experience for students as well.

        "description":"This paper presents an outline of rehearsal procedures designed to provide instructors and students of the beginning interpretation class with a concrete, consistent framework for preparing literature for solo classroom performance. The outline offers a five-step process, and discusses each step in the process. First, the student must select a literary text that is within the range of the student's analytic and performance abilities, which fulfills the requirements of the assignment, and in which the student is willing to make the personal investment that performance requires. Second, the student must achieve an understanding of the literary text, based upon a critical method that is appropriate to the text and the assignment. Third, the student must memorize the literary text.  Fourth, the student must select specific performance choices with which to present the literary text, considering psychological, physical, and vocal choices, and beginning rehearsal sessions with physical and vocal warmups. Lastly, the student must &quot;set&quot; the performance choices and polish the performance, rehearsing before others and in the performance space. (SR)",

        "author":["Bahm, Ken"],
        "description":"In competitive debate, a view of meaning as something that a team has a right to pre-select is inconsistent with Ludwig Wittgenstein's conception of meaning as use. The &quot;language-linked value objection&quot; rejects conventional value objection of identifying the negative consequences of taking a stance in the hypothetical world of the resolution. Instead, the language-linked approach focuses directly on the opponent's actual language practices. The approach mirrors Wittgenstein's theory of meaning as use. He rejected the notion of meaning as representation in favor of a focus on the function of language. What is most useful to a student of language is what function a word can serve, not a precise description of the word's phonology and grammar. Wittgenstein's perspective challenges  the presumed ability to define words in isolation. The use of language is determined by rules and norms established by the overall society of language users. As such, term meaning is not a prerogative to be exercised in debate. Linking value objections to language by considering social use may lead to consideration of ideologies embedded in language forms, the ways in which language structures political thought, the &quot;personas&quot; created by various language styles, the cultural embeddedness of meaning, and other issues.

        "description":"This paper focuses on musical theater in the high school in British Columbia. It gives a rationale for incorporating musical theater in secondary schools, exploring the impact that a theater program may have on the music program, teachers, students, and community. Further, the paper presents a detailed guide to the process of producing a musical. Following the results of a survey of high school teachers in Vancouver, British Columbia, that elicited their views on producing musicals in school and their motivation for becoming involved, the paper concludes that the benefits to the secondary school and students are many, and that musical theater should be part of a well-rounded program. The paper is in 11 sections: (1) Introduction; (2) Musical Theater--Choosing to Get Involved; (3)  Choosing the Musical; (4) Scheduling the Musical; (5) Organizing a Production Team; (6) Budgeting the Production; (7) Auditions and Casting; (8) Rehearsal Schedules; (9) The Rehearsal Process; (10) Sound Reinforcement; and (11) The Performances. A summary concludes the paper. Thirteen references are attached.

        "description":"An oral communication course, offered at Michigan State University during the 5-week summer session, was conducted for academically talented high school students. Students learned about the responsibility of creating and delivering ethical, informed, and rhetorically sensitive messages. Each student researched one socially significant issue, and delivered three different speeches (one informative and two persuasive) based on this single issue. Feedback and critique of famous and peer speeches were also integral parts of the course. Review of student presentations included: (1) immediate oral critique by peers, led by the speaker; (2) peer and faculty written critiques; and (3) critiques following video playback. Students were also required to play back their video at home.  Throughout the 5-week summer session, instruction emphasized personal and social responsibility. Students were responsible for several roles--researcher, contributor, supporter, critic, and orator. The students learned to value their own voices and the voices of others. (KEH)",

        "description":"Speaking across the curriculum (SAC) programs let students in on the educational act and thus require faculty members to attend to their own development as participants in communication interactions. When faculty development efforts are directed toward improved classroom teaching, they become important for SAC. As SAC programs have developed at various institutions, the faculty development component is almost always instituted, and participants welcome it as necessary and useful preparation. The workshop is an instrumentality of faculty development that almost universally accompanies SAC programs. Workshops address such topics as assignment options, student reports, assessment, and listening. Later, periodic follow-up meetings may be held, at which teachers may share new  discoveries and approaches to instruction. Both the workshops and the meetings tend to promote collegiality within the faculty, and to give rise to interdisciplinary possibilities. Because of the speech communication faculty's knowledge of assignment options, communication behaviors, and the like, its members are especially qualified to work with colleagues on these topics. Furthermore, the speech faculty can help move the vision of classroom performance beyond presentational skills to the heart of the speech teacher's expertise, namely, communication interaction; they can also serve as resource persons for both teachers and students.

        "description":"In 1989, some Springfield, Missouri residents demanded cancellation of the Southwest Missouri State University (SMSU) theater department's production of Larry Kramer's play, &quot;The Normal Heart,&quot; which they alleged to be obscene. Opponents purchased newspaper advertisements which charged that the publicly funded production promoted a &quot;homosexual, anti-family lifestyle.&quot; They held a rally, which attracted approximately 1,200 demonstrators. SMSU's attorney argued that the First Amendment barred cancellation absent substantial government interest, and asserted that the play was not obscene. Play opponents did not raise constitutional arguments, but suggested that freedom without commitment to moral order amounted to a &quot;free-for-all.&quot; Some proponents of the production used the occasion  to further AIDS education, while others labelled the play's critics as bigots. An arson incident brought national attention to the controversy and accusations from both sides in the dispute. The university formed a committee to oversee security for the play's performances. Rhetorical strategies used by SMSU managed to divert attention away from the idea of public funding for allegedly immoral activities and toward the idea of free expression, while assuring the play's presentation. While AIDS awareness may have been heightened, gay rights issues were overshadowed by the controversy. (Forty endnotes are included.) (SG)",

The paper also enumerates the following strategies to reduce anxiety unrelated to skills  deficiencies: realize that some speech fright is normal; seek &quot;friendly faces&quot; in the audience; do not expect perfection in speaking; use objectification to reduce speech fright; understand that speech fright is more evident to the speaker than it is to the audience; employ cognitive modification; and employ systematic desentization.

The model is based on three primary categories for generating, evaluating, and executing advertisements: rational, emotional, and moral. Focusing on computer advertising as an example, it is argued that technology shapes language and culture. An exploratory study hypothesized that in lesser developed countries there is more use of rational advertising appeals than of emotional advertising appeals. In contrast, for countries with more advanced technologies the emphasis will be on greater visual orientation. These concepts are illustrated through a comparative study,  after which models for content analysis are presented as a proposed empirical study. It is hoped that the new model will benefit instructors who teach students to appreciate differences in language and culture and who also teach appreciation of the general economy.

        "description":"A strategy for revitalizing public education by stimulating the creation of new public schools is proposed in this report. The proposed system goes beyond school choice and is based on the withdrawal of local districts' exclusive franchise to own and operate public schools. The proposal is based on the premise that the state must provide both \"choice\" and \"choices\"--granting choice of school as well as providing alternatives to public schools. The new system for chartering schools would allow enterprising people to open innovative schools under contract to a public agency. Also examined is the notion of \"divestiture,\" or allowing districts to relinquish operation of public schools while retaining a broad policy-setting role. This proposal for fundamental educational reform is  based on the following assumptions: (1) school restructuring has limited potential; (2) school districts' monopoly on public education is the heart of the problem; (3) the states are critical actors in revitalizing education; and (4) a competitive school system requires a variety of agencies that are free to charter new schools. The final section offers 11 guideposts for creating a competitive but publicly controlled and service-oriented public school system. (LMI)",

This document offers a three-part synopsis: a brief and selective review of the testimony given in February 1990; an overview of general finance methods; and a state-by-state executive summary of the individual states' facility finance provisions. The testimony argued that for legal, ethical, and economic reasons Kansas should consider assisting districts with their facility needs; more generally, there is a history of litigation that intimates that states may increasingly be held responsible for assisting local districts. In regard to finance methods, capital outlay as an issue of equity has been subjected to three standards: resource  accessibility, wealth neutrality, and taxpayer effort. Currently 30 states provide some true grant-in-aid assistance, and 35 states provide either grants or loans. The methods are generally: (1) full state support; (2) equalization grants; (3) matching grants; (4) flat grants; (5) state loans; and (6) building authorities. In the third part, details of individual state methods are provided in alphabetical order by state. (17 references) (MLF)",

In October 1988, SREB's Commission for Educational Quality put forward 12 specific goals of education and a number of &quot;indicators of progress&quot; for  reaching these goals. This report presents SREB's 12 goals and focuses on national benchmarks to which SREB states can compare themselves, addresses the adequacy of reporting systems for measuring progress, and highlights the status of states and the region on key educational indicators.

The inclusion of individual interpretation is crucial to understanding the link between actions and their intended impact on a situation. The methodology used in this study assesses principals' own interpretation of their behavior at the time of an action. An &quot;Instructional Leadership Inventory&quot; consisting of 48 items designed to measure the &quot;Five Dimensions of Instructional Leadership&quot; (defines mission, manages curriculum, supervises teaching, monitors student progress, and promotes instructional climate) was given to each of the 81 principals representing schools from the Chicago metropolitan area studied along with a  beeper. Five times each day during a regular work week, principals were signaled at random to fill out a behavioral assessment form. Results of the survey relate the dimensions of instructional leadership to behavioral reports made by the principals. The most dramatic finding is the absence of consistent differences in the types of activities that effective vs. less effective principals engage in. Distinctions lie in specific meanings leaders ascribe to what they did. A comprehensive listing of explanations and results is included. (EJS)",

School-level differences in principal leadership behavior, student and teacher perceptions of the school culture, and student and teacher commitment were assessed using data from 160 principals, 171 teachers, and 1,492 students from Illinois. Principals' reports of their behavior were similar across three school levels. Junior high teachers reported more stress on accomplishment and affiliation goals and less emphasis on power goals than teachers at other school levels. Elementary students had the highest, and senior high students the lowest, means on both the culture and the commitment scales. At all three  levels, student perceptions of a cultural stress on accomplishment and affiliation were positively related to commitment. At the elementary and junior high levels a perceived stress on recognition, and at the senior level a stress on power, also predicted student commitment. A considerable discrepancy between student and teacher perceptions of the school culture was found. Numerous tables are included. (14 references) (Author/MLH)",

A theory of conflict management that looks at the shift in the administrator role from nonpartisan to political professional is applied to case studies of three Illinois school districts in which superintendents involved in teacher contract conflicts chose to fight, avoid, or mediate the conflict. The degree of community conflict was found to have a significant effect on superintendent behavior. A high degree of conflict was conducive to an assertive, compromising, or presiding superintendent role, and a low degree contributed to a professional, delegator, and facilitator role. A conclusion is that the superintendent seeks system maintenance and personal survival  amid conflict, and that opposition between excessive attention to trivial matters and serious conflict management contributes to superintendents' lack of time and inclination to provide instructional leadership.

This has been found to be true in the case of smaller learning settings, such as the classroom. Recently, research on school culture has suggested that schools do indeed differ in the kind of learning environment they provide. The present paper advances this research one step further. An extensive study of school achievement (in conjunction with a statewide assessment program) involving over 16,000 students in 820 Illinois schools was conducted. Primary variables considered in this report are the school's psychological environment or &quot;culture,&quot; student ethnic background, and motivation. Results showed that school culture was more  important for minority than white students, so far as facilitating motivation was concerned, and that one school environment may not fit all equally well. Whereas a stress on accomplishment is likely to be important to Whites, Asian students seem especially susceptible to isolation and could benefit from a collegial school environment. If these results are valid, educators are faced with the problem of creating different school cultures within the same general school context. More research is needed on school culture influences.

The first uses data collected from 9,693 high school juniors and examines school characteristics and family background in relationship to student motivation and academic achievement in specific subjects. The second study, drawn from the responses of 4,002 10th-grade students, explores the viability of the causal model in which school culture affects motivation, which, in turn, affects achievement. Also discussed are the  influence of peer and family achievement pressure on motivation and achievement. The third study uses the same database as the second and examines the relative influence of the five dimensions of school culture--namely, accomplishment, power, recognition, affiliation, and overall sense of purpose--on student motivation. Lastly, the degree to which student ethnicity, enrollment orientation, and education of parents influence the effect the different facets of school culture have on motivation is discussed.

Results generally provided support for a causal model that links school culture to motivation and motivation to achievement, though the relative importance of school culture varied at different school levels.

        "description":"Recent school effectiveness research has underscored the importance of teachers' personal investment and commitment--not just to education, but to the particular mission operating in their own school setting. There is growing evidence that aspects of the school organization are related to both job satisfaction and commitment. Employing path analysis techniques with a sample of 101 teachers from four schools in the Champaign, Illinois, area, the study summarized in this paper tests a causal model linking leadership behavior to school culture to teacher job satisfaction and commitment causal model. Results provides support for the model. A school culture that stresses accomplishment and recognition is likely to elicit job satisfaction and commitment, whereas a culture emphasizing  affiliation is of lesser significance. Power has a negative influence on these orientations. The perception of an organizational emphasis on accomplishment and recognition is associated with specific types of action taken by principals. Surprisingly, the principal's active involvement in supervising instruction and monitoring student progress does not emerge as an important factor. Further research is needed to substantiate these findings. (31 references) (MLH)",

Four core dimensions of principal work--supervision, administration, management, and leadership--are analyzed in terms of their contributions to underlying cultural processes, showing how these work activities encourage a different approach to teaching and other school-related tasks. The tension between \"settlement\" and \"frontier\" cultures is explored as a way of clarifying the difference between routinized and problem-solving approaches to the principalship. Five research hypotheses for empirical verification of the theoretical framework are developed. (12 references) (LMI)",

The model identifies a causal chain of factors leading from school goal stresses through motivation to achievement for grades 6, 8, and 10. Findings point to the importance of the school psychological environment at the tenth-grade level, especially for nonwhite students, the significance of ethnicity in motivation, and the crucial role of the family at the fourth-grade level.

The two final sections address the questions of when to consider changing schools again and what to do if no good schools can be found.

The IPLA was created to be a national training model for principals, as leaders of instructors, empowered with effective behaviors and practices. The academy's focus is on four proficiencies: (1) leadership; (2) communication; (3) culture; and (4) school programs. Four days of instruction are devoted to each proficiency over a 2-year period. During the leadership phase, self-awareness, learning styles, and values are emphasized. Oral, written, and nonverbal communication are second-phase components. The culture phase compares and contrasts school culture and climate, exploring how each can be positively influenced. School programs for  reform are the focus of the fourth phase, as school improvements can only take place after assessment of needs, resources, and priorities. The IPLA's instructional model is based upon the &quot;effective inservice model's&quot; six components: (1) rationale; (2) delivery; (3) humor; (4) human development; (5) evaluation; and (6) celebration. Principals are asked to evaluate the program at the end of each session and when they graduate from the academy. (EJS)",

Nine white female administrators at the rural district or school site level, located in the San Joaquin Valley in California, were interviewed using 10 open-ended questions derived from literature on women in leadership. The examination of the results of the study and the numerous direct quotes from the interviewees provided in this document serve to shed light on female administrators' thoughts, feelings, and  perceptions regarding: (1) qualities of women in educational leadership; (2) difficulties experienced; (3) differences in the ways that they perceived women and men work; (4) issues surrounding authority; (5) leadership in instructional improvement, evaluation, student and community relations, and decision making; and (6) life experiences. The study's implications for research on women in administration and for current women administrators are also mentioned. (30 references) (CLA)",

Strategies mentioned include the Concept Attainment Model, the Inductive Thinking Model, the Group Investigation Model, a continuum of teaching styles, classroom climate, listening, wait-time, active learning, recognition, a contingency strategy, and a permeation strategy. The documents reviewed include: \"Understanding Thinking Skills\" (Bijaya K. Shrestha); \"Teaching Critical Thinking Skills in the Psychomotor Domain\" (Ron E. McBride, Carl C.

Although the problems they were faced with differed, educators found that by working together for a common goal in school cooperation committees, they could arrive at some innovative and exciting answers. School cooperation committees develop ways to overcome potential roadblocks. Once teachers and administrators begin talking in a positive way, labor-management relations improve, making the resolution of more controversial issues easier. The first five sections of the guide give details on the nature and origins of the school cooperative committee and provide information on how to start such a  committee, how public-sector collective bargaining affects school labor-management cooperation, and how to know if a labor management committee will work in a specific district. The last two sections provide, respectively, six case studies of individual Pennsylvania districts and a list of resources for more information on each case. (EJS)",

No differences were found in educational effectiveness between half- and full-day programs, with the costs of half-day programs being about 75-85% of full-day programs. No significant differences were found between groups served by professionals or paraprofessionals on posttests of Intelligence Quotient, fine motor skills, gross motor skills, receptive language, and expressive language, with mean costs per child slightly less for the paraprofessional treatment group. Comparison of parent-and clinic-delivered intervention for speech and language problems found a greater mean change in language scores and greater economic efficiency for the parent-delivered intervention.  Evaluation of the Abecedarian Program indicated that it is a sound economic investment with benefits including child care, reduced cost of special education and/or grade retention, earnings increase, and welfare and crime cost reduction. Recommendations concerning the design of economic studies of early intervention include additional studies of children's age at start of intervention, use of sound methods such as quasi-experimental and experimental designs, use of statistical procedures that increase the interpretability of quasi-experimental designs, use of large sample sizes, and more collection of longitudinal data.

        "description":"This paper reports on several projects conducted in Georgia over the past 2 years that move the development of respite care services toward the goal of becoming a &quot;cooperative, collaborative, and coordinated&quot; effort. An overview of respite care in Georgia is provided as well as a summary of strategies used to provide such care. Emerging principles, directions, issues, and guidelines are identified, and the present provision of services primarily by area-based developmental services programs is noted. The networking and cooperative strategies that have occurred at three levels (county, metropolitan, and statewide) are summarized, and 10 guiding principles are described. They include respite care as a community wide need, the involvement of families and caregivers in the planning  and delivery of services, the development of community ownership of respite needs services, and respite care as providing benefits for everyone involved. A few pointers for others are offered; they include the impossibility of forcing networking, the importance of family involvement for maintaining common ground, and the value of starting small. Also included is a summary of results of a 1988 survey of 30 Georgia program offices; insufficient funds was the most frequently cited problem and the provision of services to clients with severe medical problems was cited as the most difficult need to meet.

Students had previously attended either a special school setting or were integrated with regular students in their home schools. The study examined: students' achievement; their progress and well-being in academic, social, and personal domains; course work; transition from junior high to senior high school; high school graduation; and preparedness for post-high school life. Subjective data obtained included the views of students, parents, and teachers over the 5 years. Objective data included student scores on tests and academic grades. Additional data included students' areas of strengths and weaknesses, choices  made by students, activities engaged in, and recognitions they received. General findings included: students on the whole were successful, well-adjusted individuals; special school and mainstreamed students were comparable with respect to skills, abilities, and progress in academic, personal, and social domains; achievement of the two groups of students was generally comparable; students who had attended the special school were more likely to report satisfaction than mainstreamed students; and fewer special school than mainstreamed students reported social adjustment problems at the postsecondary level.

Consumers with disabilities are seeking empowerment through their presence and participation in political processes and community events. Choices regarding housing, employment, and other aspects of life cannot be made by a professional on behalf of disabled persons. Quality of life issues should be incorporated into research of the life settings of individuals with disabilities. Findings from existing research indicate that more joint planning with consumers is needed, and ways that the service sector can get consumers involved are considered. The Consumer Job Satisfaction Scale, being  developed by the National Association of Rehabilitation Facilities, is presented as a tool to assess factors contributing to quality of working life. Techniques for measuring satisfaction in nonverbal individuals are also addressed. Implications for consumers, state and federal agencies, and rehabilitation service providers are examined.

Strategies are provided for supervising staff, negotiating with funding agencies, and allocating resources. The text is organized so that portions of it can be used as working documents for executives, mid-level managers, and supervisors as they plan for supported employment. A chapter titled \"Managing Change: The Challenge to Executive Leadership\" discusses the role of vision in management, the role of mission in management,  strategic planning for supported planning, guidelines, and resource management. The implications of supported employment programs for mid-level facility managers are then discussed in a chapter titled \"Managing Discrepancies: The Mid-Level Management Challenge.\" Changes needed in the roles of traditional government funding sources in order to provide intensive initial job site training and continuing long-term support are examined. Ways in which supported employment redefines and challenges supervisory management to be more flexible in staffing and personnel retention are reviewed. An appendix contains a form for supported employment self-diagnosis. (Includes 37 references) (JDD)",

The guide proposes that quality be measured by emphasizing direct outcomes that meet consumers' specified needs and concerns in terms of decision making, determination of quality, and access to choice. A section on approaches to quality assurance discusses levels of quality assurance, national regulations, national standards, and quality through the promotion of exemplary practices. A rationale is offered for voluntary monitoring of quality assurance. Evaluation criteria of model monitoring systems are specified, and steps involved are outlined. A modified system is then proposed by the National Association of Rehabilitation Facilities  (NARF). The system is based on management practices that promote quality, management components of exemplary supported employment programs, and categories for evaluating quality of exemplary programs. The NARF system includes two basic components: (1) the NARF Quality Indicators Profile which functions as a self-checklist; and (2) the Six Guiding Principles of outcomes, vision, consumer satisfaction, collaboration, organizational development/staff development, and self-evaluation.

A study of 10 professional associations was conducted to determine their plans for additional certification standards to include service to infants and toddlers, the kinds of training initiatives their association was planning, and what they were doing about existing personnel shortages. One organization, the Division for Early Childhood in the Council for Exceptional Children, has encouraged the establishment of certification within each state for an early childhood special educator. Five  organizations (the American Nurses Association; American Occupational Therapy Association; American Physical Therapy Association; National Association of Social Workers; and American Speech, Language, and Hearing Association) have developed guidelines of best practice for professionals working with infants and toddlers. Other organizations, including the American Psychological Association, National Association of School Psychologists, American Dietetic Association, and Council of Social Work Education, have refrained from developing specific personnel recommendations. All of the organizations are encouraging and supporting inservice training opportunities. They indicate little interest in extending the length of existing training programs or adding to certification or licensing  requirements. A list of 19 references is included.

        "description":"This study assesses progress made by the states, as of 1990, in the implementation of the 14 components of Part H of Public Law 99-457, the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments, 1986. Fifty out of 51 jurisdictions completed the State Progress Scale, which contains items for each of the 14 components and determines the stages of policy implementation: policy development; policy approval; and policy application. Two major messages emerged from the study: (1) that a major national effort is being made to comply with the complex set of requirements that are a part of this legislation and that status of the states has considerably improved over the first administration of the State Progress Scale a year earlier; and (2) that most states have not yet obtained official approval  for their policies. The states were farthest along in establishing definitions of developmental delay and procedures for developing individualized family service plans, a child find system, a central directory, and contracting services. Those components of the law that showed the least progress in policy development were the development of data systems, procedures for assigning financial responsibility, interagency agreements, and timely reimbursement. Instructions for completing the assessment instrument are included in an appendix. (JDD)",

The monograph discusses cultural identifiers and terms of reference, gives a historical overview of the SEA population, and provides information on the following topics: demographics of the SEA-American population (including numbers of refugees arriving by year, cultural grouping,  and birth rate); educational experiences of SEA- American students (including exposure to education prior to coming to the United States, cultural values, and college enrollment); health issues (including culturally influenced health behaviors and health care service utilization); and general characteristics of the SEA-American population (including non-assertiveness, embarrassment at receiving praise, &quot;loss of face,&quot; diet, religion, community leadership, and family). An exemplary recruitment and retention approach is outlined, with eight main components such as outreach to SEA-American community leaders and financial, educational, and social supports for college students. Three exemplary programs are described. (16 references) (JDD)",

        "description":"The position that intelligence and achievement are essentially different measures of the same construct has often been referred to as a &quot;jangle fallacy.&quot; Such a position challenges the present practice of placing children in learning disabilities programs based on a discrepancy between Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and achievement. This study examined scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) for 1,090 children (818 boys and 272 girls) ages 8-16 from a large midwestern school district. These children were all referred for learning problems and were determined to have IQ and achievement discrepancies. Results showed an asymmetrical redundancy between measures, with 18.8% of the WRAT found to be redundant with  7.2% of the WISC-R. This finding suggests that there was little overlap between the measures of achievement and intelligence. Results were interpreted in light of the differential format of measurement instruments when used with various levels of academic ability. (21 references) (Author)",

        "description":"This research explored cognitive-motivational patterns of learning-disabled and nondisabled adolescents by employing the theoretical model of C. S. Dweck, which posits that a \"learning goal\" orients students toward the development of competence, whereas a \"performance goal\" orients students toward the documentation of competence, and that these different goals result in different interpretations of the achievement context. Specifically, this study examined whether the experimental manipulation of the achievement context enhanced or impaired 63 learning-disabled and 69 nondisabled adolescents' cognitions, affective responses, and task choice behavior when confronted with success and failure feedback on a complex and ambiguous problem-solving task. Data indicate that Dweck's  social-cognitive model holds explanatory value for conceptualizing cognitive-motivational processes. Nondisabled adolescents were found to feel better after success and to use more low-effort attributions after failure than learning-disabled subjects. Learning-disabled subjects tended to blame inadequate ability more for their failure than nondisabled subjects did. A belief in the fixed, static nature of intelligence promoted negative affect in the face of achievement obstacles. Level of confidence mediated future challenge-seeking for adolescents who subscribe to a belief in the stable nature of intelligence. (24 references) (JDD)",

The two terms are seen to represent distinctive social constructs embedded in the cultural traditions of each country. Differing cultural contexts are examined in terms of either the &quot;mainstream-minority&quot; model which assumes the desirability of assimilation into the &quot;mainstream&quot; or the &quot;group-integration&quot; model which assumes a more complex configuration in which groups maintain their integrity within the larger society. Noted is the social integration model's goal of complete integration with no  special classes. Stressed is the two-way process inherent in integration in which both group members (e.g., the disabled) and other group members (e.g., the non-disabled) change toward mutual adaptation. Administrative implications of the social integration model are discussed in terms of actual services provided in various Canadian provinces. Finally, Canadian research based on the integration model stressing mutual influence, learning, and adjustment in both groups is encouraged. Includes 46 references. (DB)",

To assess the program's effectiveness, students were administered writing tests (descriptive and persuasive essays and business letters) and teacher logs were analyzed. It is concluded that teaching writing as a process resulted in improvements in the writing of deaf students.

The project involved 37 teachers of the hearing-impaired and 127 completed journals written by students, aged 10 to 18 years, with at least a third grade reading level. Completed journals were coded using a discourse analysis approach. The coding system identified the initiation or maintenance of topics, the type of topics written about, and the degree of interpersonal involvement of the correspondents. Results showed that hearing writers exhibited greater use of self-expressive responses and hearing-impaired writers showed greater use of observations. Neither group showed a preference for initiating an  interest in the other. As the relationship progressed over time, the writers became more interested in each other. It is concluded that the social and emotional benefits of journal exchanges between hearing and hearing-impaired school-aged writers are substantial to both sides of the exchange.

        "description":"Thirty hearing-impaired children at a residential school for the deaf, a day school for the deaf, and a day program for the deaf in a regular public elementary school were shown picture books, asked to tell the story, and asked to respond to specific questions. Results showed that the ability to process questions was related to the structure of the information the respondent held. The ability to process simple identification questions was related to the presence of the response within the immediate environment, while the ability to comprehend questions involving predictions about events in a narrative not immediately present were related to the ability to retrieve the salient elements of the narrative. Questions involving the recall of detailed information or questions about  causal relationships appeared to be dependent on the ability to retain more than the salient events of the narrative.

It involved a survey of 63 secondary mathematics teachers (with an 87% response rate), teacher logs of assignments and class work, and live observations. The study found no main effect for type of classroom (mainstreamed or special), achievement level of the class, or for 10 classroom process variables (such as positive feedback, homework frequency, and degree of individualization.) There was no interaction effect for the type of placement and the level of achievement. There was an interaction between the type of placement and the process variables, but no interaction effect between process variables and achievement. It appeared that successful  mainstream placement may be defined by a greater degree of oral presentation and less seatwork, while a successful special class may be defined by less teacher talk and more seatwork. It is concluded that effectiveness was not found to be identical in the two situations, but the specific differences could not be clearly established. (14 references) (JDD)",

Subjects were aged 4-11, and were the only girls in a small rural Australian school. Data were gathered by analysis of spoken and written language used in the classroom. Analysis focused on relationships and socialization as reflected in language use. The texts discussed include stories written by the girls and transcripts of conversations. Style of writing, perceptions of their own role in the world, awareness of the future, the influence of popular fiction, differing relationships with different adults, and awareness of others' attitudes about women are examined. It is concluded that in all the language samples, the relationship between language and social  structure is apparent, and that the encoding and transmission of culture occurs through language. Construction of text can either maintain the status quo or allow for change. Linear, non-linear, and non-structural aspects of text are all viewed as essential considerations. (MSE)",

A formative process and product evaluation was conducted by an evaluation team. This report contains the results of the evaluation both in summary form, including findings of program effectiveness and specific recommendations for program improvement, and in full report form. A  section on student achievement looks at results in English speaking, listening, and reading; Kosraean reading comprehension; and supplementary English testing. Data on classroom observation includes information gathered on each teacher's performance and in ethnographic school observations. Staff development results include data on professional experience and attitudes from a survey of teachers and descriptions of 1989 staff development events.

The studies examined the following: (1) auditory versus phonetic processes in the discrimination of consonants; (2) auditory versus phonetic processes in loudness and pitch judgments; (3) auditory versus phonetic processes in the categorization of consonants; and (4) phonetic processes in the categorization of consonants. Subjects were male and female Canadian francophones of different ages and varying degrees of knowledge of English. The third study gave the clearest results, allowing dichotomization into two separate processes by finding differential patterns of development for two tasks. It was possible  to postulate that the processes were linguistic and non-linguistic by finding the expected specific patterns of development, specific patterns of sex by age similarities and differences, differential patterns of correlation between degree of bilingualism and consonant contrasts, and, unexpectedly, a different pattern of performance on one contrast, all according to task. Results are discussed mainly in relation to other experiments on the phonetic mode.

A semantic differential questionnaire measuring 10 levels of politeness was administered. The instrument consisted of three sections, namely: (1) ratings of requests that might be used in four situations; (2) ratings of frequency of use of request forms; and (3) demographic information, including language background. In the request situations used, relative status of the addressee is high in two situations, low in a third, and equal in the fourth. Familiarity was low and request magnitude small in all  situations. Analysis of responses found support for almost all hypotheses concerning relative politeness of request forms, including the use of interrogatives, declaratives, imperatives with and without tag questions, tense, use of modals, positively and negatively worded requests, requests with tags, and negative politeness. No significant differences in perceptions were found between Americans and Japanese, but the Japanese in the United States perceived the requests as more polite than the other Japanese.

Analysis of student use of the books found that 161 read at least 1 book and turned in a report, and 69 of 207, who were offered extra credit did book reports. Choice of difficulty level was similar for students doing required reading and earning extra credit. About 90% of the books read were at the elementary  or low-intermediate levels. Book level correlated positively with number of pages and time spent reading the book. Students evaluated the books for interest, maturity of content, usefulness, satisfaction, their own willingness to recommend them to friends, organization, difficulty of grammar, vocabulary, overall English, and prior knowledge needed for comprehension. Students also ranked their favorite books. Implications for language instruction are discussed. Materials used in the study, including the student survey and a list of graded readers, are appended.

One model for this kind of analysis classifies utterances according to the structural predictions created by the preceding utterance, giving four minimal interaction units: initiation (I), response (R), response/initiation (R/I), and feedback (F). The typical classroom interaction takes the form I, R, F. Illocutionary acts (acts through which something is done when being uttered, e.g., \"I promise\") make up an illocutionary structure here as in other forms of discourse. Discourse may be seen as a goal or as a means in the classroom; the ideal is to achieve both functions.  In product-based curricula, the teacher controls discourse, which is then necessarily limited. In process-based curricula, the responsibility of learning is given to the students, who have more illocutionary freedom and whose discourse better approaches the language outside the classroom.

Many teachers have not reached functional language levels, and language skill upgrading is a more relevant issue than skill maintenance. Other teachers have used their skills only or largely in restricted classroom conditions, with limited opportunities to hear native speech. Teachers can participate in formal and informal programs to enhance their proficiency, including study and travel abroad programs and institutes and summer seminars. The concept of academic alliances, in which teachers assume some responsibility for their own pedagogic and linguistic  growth, has taken root in many areas. Local groups identify their own needs and arrange opportunities to practice and improve language skills. Research supporting the effectiveness of these learning experiences is limited. Programs with specific missions to upgrade language proficiency are designed to concentrate on improving teachers' abilities in higher-level tasks of narration, explanation, hypothesis, negotiation, and supported opinion. As future programs are developed, assessment of their effectiveness should be included. (MSE)",

        "description":"Interest in elementary school foreign language programs has resurfaced in recent years, and the number of programs is increasing. Many states are requiring foreign language study at the elementary level. For a local school or community seeking to implement elementary school language programs, it is important that a rationale be developed to meet the needs and priorities of the area or institution. A rationale should address the benefits of language learning, the choice of languages to be taught, and the type of instruction to be used. A general rationale for teaching foreign languages in the elementary school includes: the advantages of a longer sequence of instruction in terms of higher achievement levels; development in children of a global attitude; enhancement of general  cognitive skills; enhancement of communication skills; and personal and career benefits. Research reports and studies, state curriculum guides, and school curriculum guides can all provide useful information on developing a foreign language program rationale. The educational system should provide as expansive a curriculum as possible if education is to prepare children for the complicated world they live in and give them tools to understand new challenges.

        "description":"Recent increased interest in content-based language instruction is due to new developments in second language acquisition theory, and to the need to provide equal educational opportunities to the growing number of immigrant children. Facets of second language learning that need to be developed in content-based instruction include specialized vocabulary, language functions for academic communication, language structures and discourse features associated with different disciplines, and classroom language skills. This language development component distinguishes content-based from traditional language instruction. An integrated approach to content-based instruction derives learning objectives from the academic content, language content, and ongoing assessment of the student's  language skills. To foster communication, much content-based language instruction should be activity-centered. Interest in integrating mathematics content and English language instruction is relatively new and offers some pedagogical challenges for limited-English-speakers. At the elementary level, attention must be given to concepts, computation, applications, and problem-solving. A series of four class activities for grades 1-4 are designed to promote communicative language exchange in classroom settings while fostering mathematics learning. A brief bibliography is appended.

Subjects were 15 students in intensive college ESL courses. The students wrote essay drafts, which were turned in to teachers for graded comments. The students were then interviewed within three days after receiving the graded final papers. Open-ended interviews focused on the changes students made in successive versions of their essays. Questions elicited an explanation of why each change was made, and how the student decided to make each change. Teacher comments (which could consist of implicit comments, explicit comments, direct corrections, or pointing out an error by underlining, etc). The focus of the comments (content, organization, lexicon,  syntax, orthography, punctuation) and student changes (addition, deletion, rearrangement, substitution) were tabulated and analyzed. Results yielded three main conclusions: (1) students did read and use teachers' comments to edit and expand compositions, but did not always understand the need for revision or substantially improve the compositions; (2) teacher comments did not do a good job of intervening in the writing process; and (3) comments often appropriated meaning and the students tolerated the appropriation.

The program's major goals are bilingual proficiency and increased understanding of the second language culture. During 1989-1990, the program enrolled 205 students in kindergarten through grade 3. Students were taught mathematics, social studies, and some language arts in Spanish for half the day and were taught reading, language arts, and science in English during the other half. Participating students made normal progress in achieving district curricular objectives and in developing skills in understanding, speaking, reading, and writing Spanish. Student achievement exceeded the district average  in reading, mathematics, and language usage by grade 3. The initial lag in first language skills was short-lived. The program appears to have stimulated basic skills development, especially in mathematics. Parent interviews suggest that the program sustained parent involvement. Program continuation and expansion are recommended, with six specific additional recommendations for curriculum refinement, student monitoring, improved Spanish language objectives and assessment, maintaining student diversity, and participant tracking.

The survey questioned 517 Virginia citizens over age 18 whose households were chosen through random-digit-telephone dialing. Among the findings of the survey were the following: (1) even though Virginians would give a grade of &quot;B&quot; to their state four-year and two-year institutions, 50% of the respondents felt tuition at these same colleges and universities was too high; (2) 54% of those surveyed said they would support a tax increase for higher education; (3) 95% of the respondents could name the community college in their area; and (4) 60% considered community colleges very important to the  economy of their communities. Nearly 90% of those surveyed considered Virginia a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot; place to live. Regarding the environment, 89% favored regulation of pesticides and fertilizers, and 94% supported recycling of trash. Additionally, 92% of those surveyed were aware of pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. Respondents expressed a strong concern with the &quot;greenhouse effect,&quot; and a majority favored government-funded programs to plant more forests and help people save energy; however, they were also opposed to higher taxes on gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and other kinds of energy. Appendices contain information on characteristics of the sample and survey methodology. (GLR)",

The report, which used multiple data sources in its analyses, found that college tuitions and other costs of attendance have increased as a share of median family income  throughout the 1980s, particularly in the private sector. Costs rose to cover rising expenditures, to make up for shortfalls in other revenue sources, and in response to growing demand for college education. Assumptions about such variables as enrollments, financial aid availability, and economic conditions are used to predict the future course of tuitions. Strategies such as containing costs and increasing revenues from sources other than tuition are explored as ways to reduce future cost increases. Includes approximately 100 references. (JDD)",

The study analyzed multiple data sources to determine that college tuition growth has outpaced general price inflation since about 1980, but the American public believes that the cost of attending college is much higher than it actually is. Beginning in 1980, the proportion of family income needed to pay tuition increased. Between fall 1980 and fall 1987, the amount of student financial aid provided by all sources increased 7% faster than inflation, and students increased their reliance on loans. Academic expenditures did not increase as rapidly as overall expenditures, while administrative expenditures went up  much faster. Between fall 1975 and fall 1985 faculty salaries increased by 87% in real dollars. Differing rates of enrollment growth greatly impacted per-student expenditures. Between 1975 and 1985, tuition and fee revenues made up a larger proportion of overall revenues. Analysis of the 100 most expensive private institutions and a small number of prestigious public institutions found that each type spent, on average, more than twice as much money per student than the average institution in its respective sector.

College courses students had taken were grouped according to the gains reflected as graduating seniors on nine Graduate Record Examination (GRE) item types to determine which of the competing hypotheses explain student course taking behavior. Findings supported the distributive model. However, they  did not support the current use of a wide range of options in distributional general education requirement. Instead findings suggested that discrete arrays of coursework be identified which are more appropriate and productive for different ability levels of students. Includes 21 references. (LPT)",

The data indicate that enrollments have increased by 16% since 1986. The enrollment of women has grown at a faster rate than that of men. Although about two-thirds of all undergraduate students received Pell Grants during 1988-89, the amount of student aid derived from this source accounted for only 25% of all student financial aid. Various loan programs accounted for nearly 40% of student aid dollars in 1988-89. Business  continued as the most popular major for bachelor's degree recipients. Degrees in business exceeded those in the second most popular field, education, by a margin of nearly four to one. Faculty salaries trail those found at other private 4-year colleges. (JDD)",

The project is a collaborative effort between the Department of Psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University and the Richmond City Public Schools. The ACT program is directed at preventing and changing health-compromising behaviors, such as alcohol and other drug use, unsafe sexual practices, violence, and delinquency. High school athletes are used as peer leaders in seven sessions which teach life skills, including learning to set goals, developing plans to attain the goals, identifying and overcoming roadblocks, solving problems effectively, developing social support, and rebounding. The high school athletes receive special training provided by the ACT staff  with the assistance of Virginia Commonwealth University's college athletes. Because these high school students are regarded as positive role models who have grown up in Richmond, they are felt to be in a unique position to be effective teachers for middle school youth. A shortcoming of the ACT program is the need for a context in which students can apply and generalize the skills learned. This project proposal describes progress made in the second year of the program and plans for the third year. (JDD)",

Based on need surveys of various constituents of school life (administrators, students, teachers, and parents), a faculty-led movement within the school formed four guidance committees: a Teacher-to-Teacher Committee, a Teacher-to-Administrator Committee, a Teacher-to-Student Committee, and a Teacher-to-Community/Parents Committee. A fifth committee, the Steering Committee had representation from the other four committees and the building principal. From an initial focus on faculty autonomy in shared decision making with administrators, the faculty moved towards democracy  and shared decision making within their classrooms, involving students in curriculum decisions, playground arbitration, and other aspects of their school lives. Appendixes include a school statement on shared decision making, a survey for curriculum input, and a faculty inventory and its results. Contains 15 references. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"This report presents the results of a study that was conducted concerning the progress through the educational system, since the enactment of the Higher Education Act of 1965, of four large groups of Americans: women, Blacks, Hispanics, and low family income students. The study found that women have made steady and substantial progress over the last 40 years compared to men, and by the late 1980s, their chances of earning a baccalaureate degree were very nearly equal to those of men. The progress of Blacks compared to Whites was stalled after the mid-1970s. Progress in high school graduation and college access was offset by increased attrition in college. Consequently, Blacks' chances for a baccalaureate degree remained only half those of Whites. The low-income family student's  chances of earning a baccalaureate degree improved during the 1970s, but was found to be deteriorating sharply during the 1980s. Educational equity achieved by Hispanics as a whole was found to parallel that of Blacks. For Mexican-Americans, however, nothing seems to have helped improve their preparation for and participation in American higher education by the late 1980s.

The college, shifting in demographics from its historical junior college mission to that of a comprehensive baccalaureate institution, required a forecasting model that took into account this transition of student enrollment from a college providing largely associate and transfer degree programs to one that provides baccalaureate degree programs. An explanation is provided of the model's development and use and includes the assumptions that were required for projecting the composition of the 1988-89 and 1989-90 academic year enrollment. In addition, statistics are provided showing the  forecast's enrollment projection error rates and the retention percentages per term and by degree program at admittance. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the forecasting model benefitted the college in its budgeting and strategic planning processes. Contains 17 references. (GLR)",

Also, the report stresses the importance of the major in the intellectual lives of students and advocates significant changes in the way major programs are offered at colleges and universities across the country. Organizing principles for properly structured majors are discussed; these principles are designed to help the students: (1) develop their capacities to understand and analyze; (2) provide opportunities for students to explore questions and generate their own; (3) help  students reflect critically on various approaches to knowledge; and (4) relate to general education in a way that helps the students gain perspective on their own fields as well as others. In addition, the report discusses the elements that are determined to be necessary for every major so that the curriculum structure is clearly understood and meaningful. Finally, examples of promising practices are provided that illustrate the different elements of a well-structured major: curricular coherence; critical perspectives; connected learning; and inclusiveness.

This volume, volume 2, contains abridged versions of 12 field reports, written by task forces appointed by the participating learned societies. In the reports, campus practices within the liberal arts majors across the country are reviewed. The findings reflect the problems and challenges that are present in these 12 majors, both within their disciplines and as a part of liberal learning in general. The field reports take into consideration the twin agendas of maintaining the intellectual purpose and coherence of the major program as designed by faculty versus concern for the students' growing competence in making connections through  their particular study. The task forces' reports in each field: (1) formulate a rationale for concentrated study that describes the specific contributions that advanced study should make to the overall purposes of undergraduate liberal learning: (2) frame a set of recommendations on ways to strengthen studies-in-depth in the field; and (3) identify exemplary campus programs whose practices suggest promising and significant ways that study-in-depth in the field can contribute to liberal learning.

The paper traces the income background of Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE) schools and shows how students from backgrounds that are middle income and below have weathered the recent period of tuition increases. Shifts in the income distribution of students at COFHE institutions are compared with those of students at other institutions. In addition, a sample of high-achieving high school students is analyzed to examine how application, admission, and matriculation rates at COFHE institutions vary by income group. The report discusses the destinations of top  high school students who either turn down an &quot;elite&quot; school or never apply to one, and the same sample of students is used in an analysis of how the net price of attending a COFHE institution varies with income. Finally, the attitudes of parents of top high school students who did not apply to a COFHE school are studied to determine how much these parents believed a COFHE institution would cost them; these are compared to actual costs.

Headcount and full-time student equivalent (FTSE) data were collected for fall semesters from 1985 through 1989. The average yearly change in enrollments was calculated and presented in table and graph formats. To determine the PC service area, enrollment totals by zip code were collected for fall 1989 from which a map of the service area was drawn. It was revealed that PC day headcount increased an average of 4.04% per year, and day FTSE increased on the average of 1.92% per year. Evening headcount declined an average of 1.38% per year, and evening FTSE declined an average of 1.76% per year. Zip code analysis showed that approximately 70%  of the students at PC lived within an area less than six miles in radius, and enrollment from zip codes that include major thoroughfares extended beyond the six-mile radius. It was concluded that the overall average enrollment trend over the past 4 years at PC has been stable; average growth was approximately 1% per year. Additional enrollment trend studies are recommended, including an examination of trends within demographic subdivisions such as age, gender, and ethnic identity. Contains 14 references. (GLR)",

Chapter 1 begins with an examination of how and when time to the doctorate (TTD) has been lengthening, illustrated by the rise in mean total TTD from 1967 to 1986 in each of the 11 fields studied. Chapter 2 reviews five avenues of inquiry in the literature as they relate to TTD and models of student decisionmaking. Chapter 3 introduces a causal model of the determinants of TTD based on an opportunity-cost framework of student decisionmaking. Chapter 4 presents selected data on the  zero-order correlations between the independent variables in the model and TTD (and its components). Chapter 5 introduces a statistical model and presents a summary of which regression coefficients are significant (and of their signs) for alternative specification of the model. Chapter 6 presents the regression coefficients for the basic model and several variants using registered time to the doctorate (RTD) as the dependent variable. Finally, chapter 7 discusses the findings in this study, their implications, and research questions that warrant further study. Contains an appendix and selected bibliography. (GLR)",

Evidence is presented from national surveys showing that many, perhaps most, higher institution faculty do little or no research and publication. Faculty frustration is fostered when they accept the conventional view that all faculty are supposed to be scholars and publishers, but they know they are not. In view of the evidence, it should be possible to persuade institutions of higher education that they can improve teaching performance while  simultaneously relieving the feelings of guilt and frustration experienced by many faculty because of the pressure to conduct research and to publish, by establishing policies that recognize that some faculty are productive researchers and some are not. Information is provided about how such a policy would be designed and implemented, with particular attention to the model offered by the land-grant universities and a specific example of such a policy in action, namely, the policy developed by the University of Texas of the Permian Basin, is presented. Finally, a brief analysis summarizes the reasons why universities should implement such policy changes regarding teaching and research requirements. Contains 7 references. (GLR)",

        "description":"A sample of 725 out of 3,241 incoming freshmen to the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) were administered the University New Student Census (UNSC) to determine a group profile for 1990. A selection of basic statistics included the following: (1) 53% of the incoming freshmen were male, and 71% were white; (2) approximately 20% had an A or A+ average in high school, and slightly more than 66% had a B or B+ average; and (3) the average high school GPA (grade point average) for all first-time freshmen was 3.00, and the mean SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) score was 1,086. Student responses revealed that about 33% were attending college to get a better job, and their choice of UMCP was because they wanted a good education. All but 1% planned to get at least a baccalaureate  degree. Attaining a Master's (M.A. or M.S.) degree was most popular, and 33% of the students planned on attaining a higher degree (doctoral, law, medical, or divinity). Additionally, more than 33% of the students thought incoming freshmen would cheat on exams if they thought they wouldn't get caught, that the two most important issues to solve in society were the ecology/pollution problem and drug abuse, and both men and women said they were not encouraged to explore nontraditional interests in their high school studies and activities.

The common context variables that are seen as effecting student evaluation of instruction are as follows: (1) course variables, such as required/elective, day or evening, course level, lecture versus discussion, and others; (2) instructor variables, such as rank, gender, full-time versus part-time, years teaching, individual rapport, and personality characteristics; (3) student variables, such as academic major versus minor, full-time versus part-time, gender, personality characteristics, and others; (4)  administration variables, such as student anonymity, direction giving, timing of semester evaluations, etc.; and (5) instrument variables, such as placement of items, number of response alternatives, negative wording of items, and the labeling of all scale points versus labeling only end points. The paper examines teaching effectiveness through the communication style used by the instructor, as well as the biased expectations that can be held by instructors of their students' intellectual performance. Conversely, student bias towards teachers is discussed within the contexts of gender and sociocultural stereotyping. Contains 46 references. (GLR)",

The investigation's findings reveal that loan defaulters may have obtained about $109 million in new loans, and that students received millions of dollars in loans over the legal loan limits. Areas where the Department could do more to prevent abuse are highlighted, and the inadequacy of data available to identify abuse is discussed. Also, suggestions are made for interim measures to improve the internal controls in the program. Finally, recommendations designed to help curb the abuses, as well as comments from the Department of Education concerning the evaluation, are  presented.

Results showed that from 1986 to 1989 there was a general decline in  satisfaction ratings on specific aspects, though students' overall view of the institution remained positive. Areas demonstrating the largest increases in satisfaction were day care, credit by examination, and college mass transit, while areas demonstrating the largest decreases in satisfaction were personal counseling services, career planning services, and parking facilities and services.

        "description":"This report describes alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use among 715 University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) students. The report focuses on drug use at the higher frequency levels, rather than reporting proportions who have ever used various drugs. The separate classes of drugs distinguished are alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, marijuana, and non-prescription &quot;stay-awake&quot; pills. The study investigated such issues as drinking to get drunk; driving after using drugs or alcohol; riding with a driver who has used drugs or alcohol; and drug/alcohol possession, consumption, and intoxication on campus. In addition to analyzing use, the report addresses negative consequences of drinking, perceptions of close friends concerning alcohol and drug use, perceived risk of becoming an alcoholic, and  personal knowledge of alcohol and drugs. It is concluded that, although UNO students are well below the national average in terms of drug use, the problem of alcohol abuse is of disturbing proportions, with heavy alcohol use accepted as normal consumption.

Returned surveys (N=4,853) were analyzed for information on the student demographics, racial attitudes, satisfaction with institution, minority recruitment, college choice, and academic and social climate. Analysis underscored the need for colleges and universities in the SREB region to re-examine the status of  minority students on campuses. Study findings included the following: (1) opinions about campus climate most often reflected status and not race; (2) students generally expressed open-mindedness toward race relations; (3) many white students opposed special considerations for minorities; (4) students questioned the sincerity of minority recruitment efforts and only in this case did opinions diverge along racial lines; and (5) minority group students indicated a lack of opportunity to express their concerns.

The project analyzed data from a 10% sample of the S4 cohort of 1983/84. The central question examined whether an earlier transition to higher education is associated with a higher-than-expected transition from S4 to S5. The study found that, compared to Scotland overall, there was a higher voluntary continuation rate in the Strathclyde region both before and after allowing for the individual characteristics that influenced transition. This effect, however, was apparent only for pupils with five or fewer A-C awards at O-grade in S4. The&quot;Strathclyde effect&quot; in voluntary continuation was reduced but remained substantial after controlling for the higher local unemployment rate and could not be explained by the effectiveness of denominational/non-denominational schools. The research left undecided the question of whether the Strathclyde effect resulted from the fact that post-compulsory courses in Strathclyde are more often terminated after 1 year. The report presents conclusions and outlines the likely consequences of any 2-year post-compulsory course for voluntary participation. (10 references) (JDD)",

The report: (1) reviews evidence and arguments concerning voluntary participation and attainment at school, and entry to higher education; (2) analyzes participation in S4  (fourth year, and, for the majority of pupils the final compulsory year), S5, and S6; (3) discusses courses and attainment in S5 and S6 and trends and comparisons in overall attainment; (4) examines destinations after school, mainly applications and entry to higher education, and considers attainment in higher education; (5) attempts to place the functions of the S5 Higher courses in the overall context of post-compulsory participation at the secondary and tertiary levels; and (6) considers what would happen to participation in higher education if the S5 Higher were discontinued, based on empirical research and natural quasi-experiments.

The study included a review of higher education planning literature, a survey of administrators at 256 institutions, and intensive interviewing at 16 of those institutions. The study found that the following factors, among others, limit successful formal institution-wide planning: lack of trust and fundamental disagreements over the character of an institution; ideological conflicts over planning concepts; expectations that planning will eliminate decision-making politics; inconsistencies between planning structures and regular institutional decision-making  structures and processes; incorrect assumptions about sources of initiatives for change; lack of advocates for specific changes; incorrect assumptions about types of information needed to plan; failure to find a planning process that effectively balances requirements for flexibility with those for control; pressures to address immediate concerns; costs of comprehensive planning processes; and failure to view planning as learning.

It offers an overview of the roots and assumptions underlying the conduct of planning; summarizes higher education's experience with formal planning; and offers insights into factors that may limit its effectiveness, including the nature of the organizational contexts within which planning takes place and the problems involved in predicting critical events affecting institutional well-being. The review examines basic world views that affect perceptions of the feasibility of planning and describes implications that various theories of organizational behavior hold for planning. It traces the development of formal planning concepts, and examines  literature regarding the feasibility of planning from both theoretical and practical perspectives. A series of conclusions and implications are presented, which answer such questions as \"can planning help reconcile the need for collective action with the values of professional autonomy?\" and \"should planning approaches vary according to institutional circumstances?\" Approximately 120 references are appended.

This report assesses the program by comparing the progress of 388 members of the first two PYI groups with 204 comparable PYI nominee finalists and 197 NSF grantees of similar backgrounds. The study also surveyed individuals who had contact with PYIs. The study examines how they compared in terms of the scope and pace of their research; career progression; development of linkages to, and funding from, industry; and the  balance of teaching and research in their activities. Findings indicate that the PYIs were more likely than the other groups to have gained tenure and full professorships. Greater percentages of PYIs reported changes in the direction, pace, and &quot;riskiness&quot; of their research than did regular Grantees, but so did a comparable percentage of Finalists. The program was successful in securing research funding from industry. Department Chairs and faculty colleagues of PYIs found that the program had a positive impact on research quality, but did not indicate a positive impact on effect on teaching, collaboration among faculty, and attracting students.

        "description":"This survey of 66 4-year state universities with enrollments greater than 5,000 students in the North Central census region investigated the availability of condoms on campuses to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The survey sought to determine condom availability, location, cost to students, and the institutional levels at which this issue had been raised. Results indicated that condoms were available to students on 57 of the 66 campuses, or 86 percent. Condom availability had been a campus issue on 62 of the campuses. Of the nine institutions not making condoms available on campus, five indicated it had been a campus issue. Condom availability did not appear to be as strong an issue with parents, faculty, or boards of trustees  as it was with students, chief health officers, and student affairs staff. The most common areas in which condoms were reported to be available at colleges and universiites were at health centers and in restroom vending machines. It is concluded that the extent of condom availability on campuses may be too limited to effectively deal with the increase in sexually transmitted diseases. (17 references) (JDD)",

        "description":"Supplemental Course Instruction (SCI) at Olivet Nazarene University is described as a program in which a high achieving student retakes a course successfully completed in order to model desired behaviors for other students. The SCI Leader demonstrates good study skills and organizes small group study sessions. This study examines the effectiveness of the SCI program. Confounding factors such as the voluntary nature of the study sessions and the open admission policy of the college were controlled through structural equation modeling. Structural equation modeling requires that all of the hypothesized relationships between the variables be posited in advance. A total of 461 students enrolled in four freshman-level courses were surveyed, with complete data being obtained for 253  cases which were used in the structural equation analysis. The analysis studied: (1) the effect of factors affecting SCI participation, such as high school rank, marital status, semester load, and expected grade; and (2) the effects of SCI participation on course grade, semester grade point average, and re-enrollment. The study found that the more a student is &quot;at risk&quot; the more likely he or she is to use SCI. The study also found a positive impact of SCI participation on course grade. There were direct effects of SCI on grade point average, suggesting the transfer of study skills learned. (10 references) (JDD)",

The course syllabus experienced three changes in terms of specific objectives, contents, learning activities, instructional resources, and evaluation criteria. The findings of the study suggest that the changes introduced to the course syllabus did affect the final grade performance of students.

A study was conducted to determine the relationship of cognitive learning style to academic performance with 66 second year dental students at Virginia Commonwealth University (Richmond). A brief demographic questionnaire and the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) were administered to the students who had completed three pre-clinical courses containing laboratory components which required demonstration of psychomotor skills. Pre-clincial grades based on laboratory projects requiring pscychomotor skills were also gathered. Results indicated that: (1) students as a whole were field independent; and (2) there were no statistically  significant gender, race, or ethnic differences concerning cognitive style. However, a statistically significant relationship existed between the Group Embedded Figures Test scores and preclinical course grades, and also between student handedness (right versus left hand dominance) and cognitive style. Students who were ranked upper third of the class by course grades were the most field independent learners. Right handed students were more field independent than left handed students. Dental educators can identify FD students through the GEFT and institute program changes to meet their learning needs. Seven references and one figure are included. (Author/LPT)",

        "description":"This report discusses the nature of research in the context of distance education and suggests that qualitative research be included as a research methodology for distance education research. Noting that qualitative research represents a shift toward more perceptual, context-embedded interpretive inquiry, the paper argues that it is well suited to the study of complex contextual factors in learning. Three overarching qualitative issues are discussed: (1) the application of traditional criteria such as validity, reliability, and objectivity; (2) coping with sexist biases in everyday and research settings; and (3) coping with apparently chaotic, incomprehensible findings. Five arguments in support of temporary understanding through qualitative research are reviewed, including  individual differences, chaos theory, the evolutional character of development and learning, the roles of consciousness and free will in human activity, and quantum mechanics theory. It is concluded that qualitative research is necessary to gather and interpret people's multiple constructions of reality. (86 references) (DB)",

Three additional rationales are also noted and  discussed: the information technology industry rationale, the cost-effectiveness rationale, and the special needs rationale. It is concluded that priorities for using computers in schools are changing rapidly and should be further examined. (5 references) (DB)",

The examined articles excluded editorials and recurring invited columns such as &quot;On My Mind&quot; and &quot;Library Instruction.&quot; The data source does include the apparently invited paper included in the frequent &quot;Symposiums&quot; that  gather the responses of a number of noteworthy or appropriate authors on a topic of interest to academic librarians.

In addition, they noted those institutions with which 7 or more first authors were affiliated; the average number of references in relation to the professional position of the authors; those articles with 40 or more references; and the length of titles.

        "author":["Vasi, John"],
        "description":"A Systems and Procedures Exchange Center (SPEC) survey conducted in 1986 investigated the collection and use of management statistics in Association of Research Libraries (ARL) member libraries, and SPEC Kit #134 (May 1987) summarized the kinds of statistics collected and the reasons given by the 91 respondents for collecting them. This more recent SPEC Kit looks at the next step in the process--how libraries use the statistics they collect. SPEC Kit #134 categorized the types of statistics collected by placing them in one of five groupings: measures of activity and workload; measures of holdings; measures of facility (building) use; measures of resources generated and expended; and \"others.\" In this document, ways in which libraries use these statistics are categorized in four  groupings: (1) comparative data: i.e., presentation of numerical data showing year-to-year increases or decreases within or among libraries; (2) required reporting: provision of quantitative information for a given period of time to satisfy internal and external reporting requirements; (3) cost of operations: use of public service or processing statistics together with costs to determine a cost-per-unit figure or to gauge efficiency of specific operations; and (4) formula data: provision of appropriate statistics as raw data for funding or space allocation formulas. Following a brief overview of the study and the SPEC survey results, the kit provides examples of the use of statistics in each of these four categories. Materials used as examples were contributed by the Association of  Research Libraries, the University of California at Santa Barbara, the University of California Libraries, the University of California at Los Angeles, Dartmouth University, the University of Houston, the University of Missouri, Northwestern University, Notre Dame University, the University of Rochester, the University of South Carolina, and Waterloo University.

        "description":"Based on information from the 1988-89 IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) Academic Libraries Survey, this report presents data from the higher education institutions in IPEDS, i.e., all colleges and universities with accreditation at the higher education level in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Analyses of these data indicate that the three largest individual expenditure items for libraries at the 3,438 institutions of higher education were salaries and wages, current serial subscription expenditures, and print material expenditures. It was also found that libraries of the 466 doctoral-granting institutions (13.6% of the total) accounted for more than half of the 101,000 operating expenditures of almost $2.8 billion, half of the 101,000 full-time  equivalent (FTE) staff, and more than half of the total of 200 million circulation transactions at all academic libraries. The number of volumes held at all academic libraries at the end of fiscal year 1988 totaled almost 720 million. The narrative portion of this report includes highlights of the findings, a brief introduction, technical notes, and definitions. Detailed data are presented in tables for library operating expenditures, FTE library staff, library collections, library loan transactions, and library service per typical week. A copy of the questionnaire and instructions for its use are included. (MAB)",

The first of 12 sections, the introduction to this report highlights a multifaceted initiative undertaken by the preservation community under the leadership of the National Endowment for the Humanities' (NEH) Office of Preservation to preserve over three million brittle documents over a 20-year period. In the second section, a special report by the Technology Assessment Advisory  Committee (TAAC) outlines the preparation of a series of analytic and conceptual papers that will explore options for reformatting preservation copy and the rapidly developing telecommunications technologies. The remaining sections focus on: (1) the organization, support, and 1989-90 initiatives of the Commission; (2) archival preservation; (3) preservation research; (4) librarian and archivist education; (5) the Brittle Books Program; (6) the selection-for-preservation process; (7) the International Project; (8) institutional programs; (9) the collaboration of the Commission with other preservation-related programs; and (10) the dissemination of information by the Commission to preservation audiences. Appended materials include a list of the Commission's reports and publications for the  fiscal year; lists of the members of Commission committees, task forces, and the Board of Directors and staff; and the Commission's audited financial statements.

Archivists are no longer faced with preserving relatively simply numeric files, but with maintaining a vast array of electronic information holdings ranging from complex databases to compound electronic documents composed of text, images, sound, graphics, and data. Although information in electronic form may offer several research advantages over paper records, archivists find preservation of and access to electronic records problematic for a variety of reasons: (1) electronic information is system dependent; (2) electronic information resides on fragile storage media; and (3) electronic information can be easily erased or changed.  Archivists have devised several approaches to ensure the preservation of information in electronic form. These are: (1) archival involvement with information systems at their inception or design stage to ensure the availability of historically valuable electronic information; (2) the development and use of standards to ensure the transfer of data across fragile media and constantly changing technological environments; and (3) the development of interdisciplinary projects to test possible solutions that build upon others' expertise. Recommendations for five categories of activities to be supported during the coming years conclude this report. (11 references) (MAB)",

        "description":"Prior research on the information-seeking process, conducted by Kuhlthau in the school library setting, led to the identification of a six-stage model of the search process, describing cognitive and affective symptoms commonly experienced by library users. The present study was designed to determine whether that model is generalizable to other types of libraries. Findings indicate that, in general, the model also holds for users in academic and public libraries. The problem addressed is the complex sense-making process of users in an information search over an extended period of time, particularly changes in thoughts and feelings as a search progresses. The work is in the tradition of Belkin's anomalous state of knowledge, Taylor's levels of information need, and Dervin's  sense-making. Findings indicate that thoughts about a topic become clearer and more focused as one moves through the search process, seeking more relevant and pertinent information. Feelings accompanying these changes matched those predicted in the Kuhlthau Model with confidence steadily increasing. Uncertainty, confusion, and frustration decreased and feelings of being satisfied, sure, and relieved increased during the search process. However, participants' perceptions of the search task often did not match the cognitive and affective symptoms predicted by the early stages of the model. Activities designed to infuse the findings into practice included the development of an institute for practicing libraries and the design of learning modules for MLS programs. A symposium for scholars  actively engaged in this field of research was also planned. (MAB)",

While microform lacks volatility and multiple access points, preservation programs find it to be ideal storage media: it has a longer life expectancy than the other media; its use life is less limited; and it has a lower maintenance cost. Library operations have been significantly impacted by the large storage capacities and volatility of online databases and CD-ROMs. A few commercial publications provide information on additional physical forms in which a work is available, e.g., &quot;Law Books and Serials in Print: A Multimedia Sourcebook&quot; (Bowker, 1985) lists, in addition to books,  audiocassettes, videocassettes, computer software, online databases, and microform. However, the shortage of bibliographical control of multisources, lack of data structure standardization, and the diversity of software programs often frustrate the user's information retrieval methods. Two charts compare and contrast the operation diversities of the BRS, Dialog, and ORBIT systems. Some of these diversities have been minimized through the emergence of gateway and the more sophisticated front end software, although a completely standardized interface which enables the users to access multiple systems has yet to be developed.

Six sections divide the report. Section I provides an overview of the types of literacy activities that have found funding, e.g., projects which establish literacy collections, train tutors, offer English-as-a-Second-Language instruction, or provide family literacy services. Discussed in section II are the major developments in the areas of evaluation, family literacy, computer instruction, and  special populations that have occurred in these projects. Examined in section III are such common characteristics of the 1989 project activities as collaboration, cooperation, coalition building; public awareness; training; collection development; technology-assisted approaches; special instructional components; and employment-oriented projects. Section IV provides an exhaustive list of the project activities and their activity codes, and section V presents descriptions of each project. Listed alphabetically by state, the project descriptions include the library name, address and phone number, director's name, amount of funding, and codes for activities encompassed by the project's scope. Finally, section VI presents an analysis of the 1989 applications, grants, and project activities and  provides statistics on the applications received and funded; it also investigates state and local public library activities.

The typical services reported include the recordings of books and magazines on disk, cassette, and magnetic tape; the printing of books in braille and large-print; and outreach activities aimed at the handicapped. An examination of library services for the handicapped in FY 1987 revealed the following trends: (1) the use of volunteers to record printed media and repair playback equipment; (2) library automation to improve the management of regional libraries; (3) the installation of  Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf (TDD), which provide closed captioning on videotapes and television programs; (4) a growth in the number and diversity of radio reading programs; and (5) the establishment of toys for disabled children programs. Over 90% of the report consists of syntheses of the reported activities by state and subgrantee.

These children have the same information needs as their peers, and they want equal access to information in the school library media center. To create an accessible and functional school library, many requirements and considerations must be incorporated into this facility's early design phases. This paper establishes a checklist of considerations for library media center design for physically disabled young people by searching and analyzing research literature of the mid-1970s to the present. The checklist presents the following essential points: establishing a design planning committee, being knowledgeable about the school philosophy and building standards,  developing a timetable for discussion and development of design specifications, examination of blue prints for specifications integration, and continued communication between the architect and planning committee from the first planning meeting to completion of the library media center building project.

        "description":"This study was funded by the Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA) to enable the Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA) to plan the automation of the state's school libraries. The research was intended to identify current national programs of interest to ISLMA, identify current automation programs within Illinois library systems, and define automation options available to ISLMA. School librarians in 37 states were surveyed to reveal the extent of existing automation and resource sharing in their libraries; three states--New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin--described programs involving a majority of the school libraries in the state. It was discovered that several pre-existing programs in Illinois--ILLINET Online, various system databases, Chicago Schools  Project Inform--offer a good foundation for expanding access to school holdings. In addition, data were gathered on the wide variety of vendor technologies and product costs. On the basis of this research recommendations were made to the ISLMA which include the continued promotion of resource sharing and SILO (Serials of Illinois Libraries Online), developing awareness of telecommunications technology, utilization of the research material and statistical data collected by the survey, development of statewide guidelines for school automation, and the continuation of more grant-funded proposals and projects. Appended materials include copies of the survey questionnaire and forms, an automation product vendor list, and retrospective conversion costs. The special report provides a summary of  the survey and its findings. (52 references) (MAB)",

The seven chapters of the monograph contain a rationale for the individual strategy described, a discussion of the specific techniques involved, charts and lists for implementing the strategy, sample assignments, and a worksheet for use by the reader in applying the strategy to his or her own classroom. Following a brief introduction, chapter I discusses the use of student journals in  which students express their personal reactions to the given subject through \"expressive\" writing. Chapter II discusses the development of other meaningful writing assignments, focussing in particular on the use of \"microthemes,\" or short, focussed essays. Chapter III presents specific techniques for correcting, evaluating, and grading written assignments. Chapter IV provides recommendations to aid instructors in their selection of appropriate and understandable textbooks for their classes. Chapter V provides examples of good syllabi and stresses their importance in student comprehension. Chapter VI provides techniques for encouraging students to take effective notes from lectures and readings. The final chapter stresses the importance of well-constructed exams, and describes techniques  for helping students become sophisticated test takers. A 61-item bibliography is included. (JMC)",

The study compared the financial support provided by five counties in Maryland (Prince George's, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Howard, and Montgomery) to their community colleges. Data were obtained from the Maryland Department of Fiscal Services and from the State Board for Community Colleges. Study findings included the  following: (1) examining the share of county general fund expenditures, and the share of total county expenditures from all revenue sources, Prince George's county ranked lowest among all five counties in dollar support per full-time equivalent (FTE) student for each year from 1985 to 1989; (2) for fiscal year (FY) 1989, PGCC received $842 per FTE, while Montgomery County colleges received $2,518 per FTE; (3) when the real property assessable tax base was used to adjust for differences in county wealth and ability to support local colleges, Prince George's County continued to provide a lower level of support than its peers; and (4) an examination of tuition and fees, and college expenditures-per-student revealed that PGCC was the most cost efficient of the counties, but charged the  highest tuition in order to cover its costs.

Students were classified as having adequate preparation, having marginal preparation, or being in need of preparatory college work (CPW). Preprogram variables were then compared with such indicators of academic achievement as grades in  the first core nursing course, first-semester grade point average (GPA), and status in the program after 2 years. Study findings included the following: (1) 55% of the students with adequate basic reading skills received grades of A or B in the nursing core course, while only 19% of those needing CPW performed as well; (2) 90% of the students with adequate reading basic skills obtained a 2.0 GPA or better, while only 65% of the CPW students had a 2.0 or better; (3) 50% of the students who had three or more repeats of prerequisite science courses earned a GPA of less than 2.0; and (4) the best predictor of first-term GPA was a combination of reading basic skills and the number of repeats in prerequisite science courses. Graphs, pie-charts, and detailed data tables are included.  (GFW)",

        "description":"A recent study of Dade County Public School (DCPS) graduates attending Miami-Dade Community College (M-DCC) revealed that 64% of those who graduated high school in 1989 had failed one or more of the basic skills sub-tests of the Florida Multiple Assessment Programs and Services test (FL-MAPS). Another study was conducted in 1989 to determine the percentage of recent high school graduates with basic skills deficiencies as measured FL-MAPS and all other placement tests, to compare the placement test performance of public and private school students over time, and to assess the performance of students who received the General Equivalency Diploma (GED). The 1989 study focused on students who enrolled at M-DCC in fall 1989 and had graduated from high school between September 1988 and  August 1989. For 95% of the study population, test scores were available on at least one of the following: the Scholastic Aptitude Test; the American College Testing program test; the English Placement Test; and the FL-MAPS. Study highlights include the following: (1) DCPS graduates experienced a 58% failure rate as compared to 44% of Dade County private school graduates; (2) students who did not graduate from a Dade County public or private school, including GED recipients and foreign students, experienced a 70% failure rate; (3) pass rates were similar for out-of-state high school graduates and DCPS graduates; and (4) including scores from all available test instruments reduced the overall test failure rate of recent high school graduates attending M-DCC from 64% just using the F-MAPS  to 58%.

        "description":"In 1990, a study was conducted at Florida's Miami-Dade Community College (MDCC) to identify institutional factors that predict pass rates on the College-Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST). Statewide results of the October 1989 administration of the CLAST were used for the study, including the scores of all students who indicated that they had completed 60 or more credits toward the associate degree and who were writing the test for the first time. The percentage of students passing all four subtests of the CLAST was recorded for each community college in the state. The study assessed the validity of the following institutional characteristics as predictors of CLAST pass rates: minority enrollment, the percentage of entering students with below college-level basic skills, student  attrition before the CLAST, and institutional size. Findings indicated the following: (1) pass rates ranged from a low of 46% at MDCC to 83% at Indian River, one of the small colleges; (2) the combined average pass rate for the state's community colleges was 69%; (3) among the colleges, MDCC had the largest minority enrollment (73%), the largest percentage of students requiring basic skills remediation (65%), and the highest proportion of remedial to college-level enrollments; and (4) for the colleges as a whole, low CLAST pass rates were positively correlated with high minority enrollments and a high proportion of remedial to college-level enrollments. Based on the study finding that percentage of minority students was a more significant predictor of an institution's CLAST pass rate than  either the basic skills level of entering students or the percentage of students being screened out before taking the CLAST, it was concluded that state funding for special instructional support for minority students be allocated on the basis of the number and percentage of minority students at an institution.

        "description":"In 1990, a study was conducted to review and evaluate the condition of transfer and articulation among the four community colleges and two universities within the University of Nevada System (UNS) and to propose policies and procedures to strengthen and support the transfer system. Over 2,000 transcripts of UNS graduates from the classes of 1986 and 1989 were analyzed for information on the patterns and performance of Nevada community college transfer students. This four-part report provides background information, profiles transfer students, identifies major issues, and offers recommendations for system improvement. Section I discusses articulation within the UNS, reviews the community college mission, describes the faculty articulation task forces and special program  articulation, and highlights significant trends in student demographics. Section II provides a profile of the UNS transfer student, noting that students transfer at all points in their educational careers, and that a number of four-year college students return to community colleges or enroll simultaneously to earn supplemental credits. Section III discusses 11 major issues and offers 32 recommendations concerning admission requirements, easing the transfer process, capstone programs, course and program articulation, equitable in-state and out-of-state policies, board of regents' requirements and general education core requirements, common introductory-level courses, impact of community college enrollment patterns, improved student records system, performance of transfer students, and  communication among students, faculty, and administrators. Section IV offers conclusions about successful articulation. The UNS Board of Regents' policy on articulation is appended. (JMC)",

A.S. program review standards set by the State of Florida require that 70% of program graduates either have found employment utilizing their education or be in the process of continuing their education at an institution of higher learning. Sources of data on graduates included state-level employment, university enrollment, and defense department information; a mailed survey of graduates; program managers' input; a survey of prospective graduates applying for graduation; job placement officers; and telephone interviews with employers. Study findings included the following: (1) the overall rate of positive placements for A.S.  graduates climbed to a high of 89% for 1987-88 graduates, with this figure rising to 94.6% with the deletion of those of unknown status; (2) in comparing programs on the 70% placement criterion in 1984-85 against 1987-88, 12 (27%) of the programs improved while 4 of the programs that passed in 1984-85 failed to meet standards in 1987-88; (3) 18% of 1987-88 A.S. graduates were continuing their education; (4) 67% of the 1987-88 A.S. graduates in early childhood education, 61% in vision care technology, and 53% in aviation and allied studies were continuing their education; (5) as a group, health programs surpassed the overall placement rate of 89%, as did the law enforcement (99% successfully placed) and fire science technology (100% successfully placed); and (6) Hispanic, White, and Black  A.S. graduates experienced equally high successful placement rates.

        "description":"In 1990, a survey was conducted of students at Miami-Dade Community College (M-DCC) to determine their perceptions of their high school preparation for college. The survey was distributed to a 5% random sample of English classes. Surveys were returned from 502 students in 26 of the 31 sampled classes for a response rate of 84%. A comparison with findings from a similar study conducted in 1982 revealed no significant differences in student perceptions of their high school preparation. Major findings of the study were as follows: (1) on questions designed to assess students' level of commitment to educational goals, 43.6% of the respondents indicated that they had not studied a great deal in high school; over 70% said they usually studied for tests, handed in reports/papers on  time, and did their homework; slightly more than one-third said they had a special time and place to do their homework; 54% participated in extracurricular activities; 25.1% indicated that they picked easy courses in high school; and 84.9% planned to attend M-DCC for at least 2 years; (2) on questions focusing on students' perceptions of their high school performance, 54% said their courses were easy for them, 54.6% said they received mostly A's and B's in high school, 39.4% reported receiving mostly C's and D's, and 55% felt ready for college when they graduated from high school; (3) in terms of the academic demands made by their high school, 30.9% said they rarely had to do their homework at home, 69.3% indicated that they had not read 50 pages per week, only 22.7% indicated that they  used the library more than 10 times to obtain information, 10.8% indicated that they had no essay exams in high school, 44.6% felt they had not learned to study in high school; (4) less than one fourth of the respondents indicated that they would do everything in the same way if they could do their high school years over; and (5) only 39% agreed that their high school courses prepared them for a job, just over one-half felt high school prepared them for college, and less than one-half agreed that high school prepared them to be an adult. Responses of remedial students are compared with those of students in college-level courses. The survey instrument and student comments are included. (JMC)",

        "author":["Einspruch, Eric"],
        "description":"Determining the overall pass rates on the College-Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) for a given cohort of students involves an analysis of both the first-time examinee performance and subsequent pass rates of students who failed the test and retook it at a later date. Two increases in the scores required to pass the CLAST in 1986 and 1989 have complicated the process of determining the actual pass rates for any given cohort of students and of predicting future pass rates. A study was conducted at Miami-Dade Community College (M-DCC) to examine the impact of increased cut-off scores on eventual pass rates, analyze the percentage of students failing any of the CLAST subtests following the 1989 raise in pass scores, determine the effectiveness of the models used to predict pass  rates after the cut-off scores had been raised, and predict what the pass rates will be a year after the third raise in cut-off scores goes into effect in fall 1991. Study findings included the following: (1) 41.3% of the 2,713 first-time examinees in 1989 passed all four subtests on their first attempt, and another 15.3% passed when they retook the CLAST on one of the following two administrations, bringing the total pass rate for the cohort to 56.6%; (2) 49.3% of the examinees who initially failed one subtest passed all four subtests within the next two test administrations, as compared to only 19.6% of those who initially failed two subtests; (3) higher passing scores have led to an increase in the proportion of examinees initially failing multiple subtests; and (4) pass rates for the  fall 1989 examinees very closely approximated the predictions previously made.

However, there is little consensus on the minimum levels of hours and credits needed to adequately prepare early childhood educators, and on the professional roles and responsibilities to be assumed at the various levels. Research indicates that formal education and specialized preparation for educators result in improved quality of care for children. However, the number of teachers with such training is insufficient to staff all classrooms. There appear to be emerging needs for training that the field is not prepared to handle. As for model practices of educational training, baccalaureate programs are erratic  because of their reliance on state certification standards. In-service training has become a substitute for adequate pre-service training. There is a weak relationship between in-service training and improved teacher behavior. Steps must be taken to provide improved training programs, but early childhood educators must clarify their long-term goals before these steps will enhance progress. Appended are a table that offers a comparison of teacher preparation guidelines and a figure that concerns early childhood professional knowledge at various levels of professional preparation. (BC)",

Two themes were dominant: (1) improvement of training must be accompanied by increased compensation; and (2) effective training requires sensitivity to cultural differences. Participants concluded that training is a process of professional development that involves three components: access, content, and follow-through.

The review of research findings prompts questions about the advisability of: (1) initiating center- or classroom-based programs for all children regardless of their developmental level or socioeconomic status; (2) the trend toward increased emphasis on academic achievement in the early childhood curriculum in public and private preschools and in early intervention programs for low-income and developmentally delayed children; and (3) leaving unchecked the global enthusiasm for early childhood  education as a way of &quot;saving&quot; today's children. The discussion of transition to kindergarten views kindergarten (and perhaps the first three grades) as a developmental transition in the educational process rather than as a discrete curriculum entity. Implications of this view are pointed out. The discussion of the preparation of personnel argues for a systematic plan of personnel development that includes five tiers of activity ranging from in-service training to senior leadership preparation. Four main themes for future research are pointed out. Four figures illustrate, respectively, the delivery modes of the Head Start program, and the parent and child effects of the Center-Based, Home-Based, and Home/School programs. Seventy-eight references are included. (RH)",

The nature of thinking is discussed in terms of its key components--cognitive operations, certain kinds of knowledge, and certain attitudes and dispositions. Other characteristics--purpose, development, modalities, context, and environment are considered next, as are various perspectives--particularly the constructivist perspective. All of this information provides background for the final consideration, namely, strategies which have been suggested by various experts to enhance the development of thinking skills among children. Teaching strategies include placing the  cognitive demand on the child; drawing the child's attention to a discrepancy, contradiction, or inconsistency; and involving the child in mental activity that requires going beyond the obvious concrete event. It has also been suggested that teachers should encourage students to interact with each other--to generate cognitive demands on their fellow students. (BB)",

        "description":"Two examples of students' self-evaluation in writing are used to illustrate the wide range of tasks that can be addressed in self-evaluation and initial exploratory procedures for furthering self-evaluation. The first example illustrates the use of records for self-evaluation of handwriting by a 4-year-old, and the problem that can arise when evaluation criteria are not clear or meaningful to the student. The second example illustrates the use of records for self-evaluation of creative writing by a 7-year-old and some techniques that can aid in the circumvention of the problems of criteria that are not easily defined. Both projects illustrate that criteria will need to be revised even when initial criteria are reasonably well-selected. It is concluded that joint teacher-learner  assessment in writing is useful in testing the adequacy of task specifications and modifying such specifications as needed. Student participation in the production, evaluation, and revision of student writing provides a means for turning the evaluation of writing over to the students themselves. The identification of illustrations of criteria and improvements in meeting criteria is aided by student self-recording. A recommendation for extending these procedures to classroom-wide peer tutoring is offered. (RH)",

The professors were also asked to present their own personal recommendations. This document summarizes the eight papers prepared by the professors. The papers revealed that some disciplines have a long history of policy statements about elementary education; others have made statements only recently; and others have not yet addressed the topic. The papers tend to emphasize instruction that will encourage  development of interest in the subjects and acquisition of values and dispositions emphasized in the disciplines, rather than formal courses in disciplinary knowledge. Recommended curriculum and instruction practices are similar to those being recommended by educational psychologists and subject-matter curriculum and instruction specialists who are concerned with instruction that emphasizes understanding, thinking, and authentic applications.

During a 3-month period, students participated in a program in which they learned to identify their problems, get along with peers, use appropriate conflict resolution strategies, and receive rewards for their success. Parents, staff, counselors, and students participated in the program. Evaluation data indicated that the suspension rate was  reduced dramatically and school staff used counselors in the program to prevent suspensions of disaffected students.

        "description":"Rural schools in the western region states of California, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada are facing enormous challenges due to major shifts in the demographics of the region. Rapid growth in student enrollment, particularly of minority and limited English proficient students, the increasing rate of rural poverty and homelessness, and a projected teacher shortage, are only a few of the pressing problems which are stretching the limits of the &quot;make-do&quot; attitude prevalent in rural communities. To respond to the challenge, the Rural Schools Assistance Program was organized in 1987 to: (1) identify, gather, and disseminate information about programs, practices, and resources to rural, small schools in the region; (2) develop and strengthen networks of rural education service providers in  the region; and (3) provide or broker technical assistance services to rural, small schools. This report evaluates the program based on interviews with the project participants from the four states. The program has hosted a wide variety of workshops and a regional conference on issues related to rural schools, developed and disseminated numerous research briefs and resource materials about promising rural practices, and conducted collaborative technical assistance projects in all four states in the region. These projects focused on interventions which improve rural staff development, enhance rural schools' ability to offer coursework, improve the performance of rural at-risk students, and help rural schools organize for school improvement. The measure of success for the projects is the  assessment by participants in rural improvement consortia of the program. Appendixes include summaries of interviews with the project participants, student evaluations of distance learning, and evaluation of three workshop. (ALL)",

        "description":"This document examines the background and the changing nature of property rights from feudal times to the present, and is intended as an educational booklet. The existence of property implies the presence of an owner, an object that can be owned, and a sovereign power to protect the property right. Property involves a number of separable rights, such as right to sell or grant easements and rights to minerals and other interests. Fee simple owners have all the property rights that individuals are permitted to hold, but their rights are not absolute. The powers reserved to the state are the rights to tax, to take for public use (eminent domain), to regulate or control use, and to escheat. In addition, governments have auxiliary powers to influence operators in their land use. Our  present concept of property rights has evolved from the feudal tenure system, which viewed the king as the technical owner of all land, at the top of a pyramid of rights. Fee simple ownership reached its height in the late 1700s in England and in the mid-1800s in the United States. After that, the concept was narrowed by expanding interpretations of the powers reserved to the public. The growing acceptance of a larger role for government is related to population growth, rising incomes and living standards, increased competition for available resources, broader education, wider suffrage, and growing awareness of conservation and environmental concerns.

Three of the remaining papers provide respectively, an overview of the South's political and economic history, educational history and trends, and need for new leadership; suggestions for needed changes in the structure and role of the Cooperative Extension System; and an outline of public policy perspectives on rural revitalization). Two other papers briefly discuss Extension's role in enhancing the quality of life and the foundations and challenges of rural America. Presentations in the economic  development section discuss Extension education's role in rural economic development and entrepreneurship, major trends shaping the business environment in the 1990s, recent federal legislation related to rural development, paradigms for building community leadership programs, value-added activities, three case studies of rural industrial development, and three case studies of home-based or small business development. Papers in the human capital section discuss education as empowerment; job and labor force trends in the 1990s; a resource development approach to community health issues; a community program to develop decision-making skills in adolescents; and combatting the problems of adult illiteracy and high school dropouts through a partnership of family, school, and community. Papers  in the infrastructure section discuss the relationship between infrastructure and economic development, the need for strategic capital improvement planning, local infrastructure needs in the rural South, strategies for improving housing at the community level, wastewater management, and Extension's role in strengthening Georgia's community health infrastructure.

        "author":["Stone, Deanne"],
        "description":"Rural schools are having difficulty recruiting and retaining teachers. The national teacher turnover rate is 6% annually, but in rural areas reaches 30% to 50%. Rural teachers often leave due to social, cultural, geographic, and professional isolation. They are often unprepared for rural realities that demand knowledge in multiple subjects and know-how, in conducting a range of school activities. Few universities offer preservice programs that prepare teachers for rural jobs. Recruiting teachers for rural settings requires effective recruitment strategies targeting persons with a rural background. Realistic marketing is the key in this effort, and it would stress the real benefit in teaching in rural schools, such as few discipline problems, less red tape, more personal contact,  and greater chance for leadership. Retaining rural teachers requires the coordinated effort of the school and the community. The community can recognize the new teachers' accomplishments and invite them to participate in various activities. The school can ease the new teachers' transition by: (1) assigning a mentor; (2) streamlining paperwork; (3) providing a well-planned inservice program; and (4) arranging released time for visiting other teachers' classrooms. Universities need to prepare teachers for service in rural areas and need to develop cost-effective distance learning courses to keep rural teachers current and up to date.

The land-grant university cooperative extension system should continue  to deliver educational programs that address the needs of rural residents, but should consider: (1) establishing interdisciplinary teams created to fit the nature of the particular problem it seeks to resolve; (2) coordinating efforts in rural development with various organizations within and outside a single state's land-grant university; and (3) strengthening its leadership role in rural development.

To explore the process by which rural schools define and work towards change, case studies were conducted on two rural schools that have established unusually strong links with their communities. Information was collected by personal interviews with school personnel, students, and community members. The two case study sites, Belle Fourche, South Dakota, and York, Nebraska, developed programs to consistently work with the community. Both communities are struggling, however, facing increased social and economic needs at a time when fiscal resources and the population are decreasing. Belle Fourche uses the entrepreneurial curriculum as a vehicle to link the school to community  development efforts; York has broadened a community education effort to coordinate social services for lifelong learning among the community's adults. In relation to the case studies, the document also reviews the decade-old themes that the rural school should be involved in local development. It focuses on (1) the reciprocal benefits for educational and economic development between the school and the community; (2) involvement of rural schools in community social services; and (3) rural schools' active role in lifelong learning for community adult members. A list of resource persons, a case study framework and questions, and a 45-item bibliography are included. (ALL)",

        "description":"This paper reports on a 1989 survey administered to superintendents of the 24 South Carolina school districts considered to be 100% rural. The purpose of the survey was to identify the most critical problems or concerns facing rural school districts in the 1990s. The superintendents were asked to rate 28 different items as being a critical problem or concern, somewhat of a problem or concern, or not a problem or concern. The survey was completed by 19, or 79 percent, of the administrators. Most superintendents rated most items either somewhat of a problem or critical problem or concern. The most critical problems or concerns were: (1) low funding for capital improvements; (2) increasing costs of fringe benefits; (3) increasing demands of federal and state programs; (4) funding;  and (5) high costs of maintenance of facilities; and (6) recruitment of minority teachers. When asked if the problems could be solved, 68 percent of the superintendents answered in the affirmative. The survey indicated that most superintendents agreed that increased state-level funding and support for education has to be part of the solution if significant improvements are going to be realized by South Carolina's 100% rural school districts.

        "description":"This document is a stand-alone training package for staff development providers in rural small schools. Based on research and best-practice information, the school improvement model used promotes cooperation, content transferability, and adaptations for long-term program maintenance. The underlying assumptions of the model are that when school improvement is to be brought about through staff development, the staff development should be: (1) related to district goals and priorities; (2) focused on the school as the unit of change; (3) planned and implemented by a school leadership team; (4) &quot;participant-oriented&quot;; (5) an ongoing process; and (6) incorporated into the district's planning process. School leadership teams are an integral part of the process. This training is designed  to be given in 2 days to a group of 10-30 participants. Each section of the manual contains objectives, preparation, an overview, a trainer script, transparencies to use with the training, and resource and supplemental materials. Sections: (1) establish the context in which systematic staff development occurs in relation to the history of the effective school movement; (2) define the purpose and composition of the school leadership team; (3) discuss the relationship between district priorities and school goals, and the rationale for conducting a needs assessment; (4) describe the elements in designing staff development activities; (5) explore the steps in implementing a new practice; and (6) address the skills needed for effective team functioning.

        "description":"Today's industrial economies were founded on the use of vast quantities of materials and energy, and the economic health of nations has often been equated with the amount they consumed. The amount of materials that originally enters an economy tells nothing about the material's eventual fate or its contribution to human well-being. It tells a good deal, however, about the damage the economy inflicts upon the environment. The devastation wrought by economic production is closely related to the amount of materials consumed. Discussed in this booklet are the causes of waste problems and attempts of people around the world to find alternative solutions to waste problems. Chapters are: (1) \"Materials and the Environment\"; (2) \"The Mess We Are In\"; (3) \"Changing Products--and People\";  (4) \"Pushing the Limits of Recycling\"; and (5) \"Discarding the Throwaway Society.\" (KR)",

The versions of the tutor were built around several core components, including an algebra expert system and a student modeling component that can make inferences about misconceptions underlying students' errors. The different versions help students learn distinct kinds of mathematical reasoning skills. The first discussion concerns the equation-solving tutor, which focuses on the acquisition of relatively low-level symbol manipulation skills. Next, the model-building tutor which helps students acquire important mathematical reasoning skills that are not part of most algebra curricula, including the ability to formulate a mathematical model of real-world  situations and to test mathematical hypotheses, is discussed. This document concludes with a discussion of the implications of the tutors for curriculum change. The pedagogical approach implicit in the tutors diverges from most classroom teaching principals. An \"embedded\" and \"global-before-local\" practice is advocated. (Author/CW)",

A policy focus on the teaching force is reinforced by the fact that the ability of the United States to compete in an increasingly technological world economy depends in part on the production of a larger, better, trained scientific workforce, while further educational improvement depends largely on improving the caliber of the teaching force. However, development of appropriate policies for effecting the required changes has been hindered by the lack of data and analyses on the nation's teacher workforce. Without a clear understanding of the scope and qualifications of that workforce, targeted  policies are difficult to design and implement. This document reviews the available data on teacher supply, demand, and qualifications, examining both what they reveal about the nature of the mathematics and science teaching force, and how existing data on teacher supply and demand may be better utilized.

Students' abilities are developed to ask questions, investigate and experiment, gather, analyze and assess scientific laws and principles and their applications. In the process, students exercise their creativity and develop critical thinking skills. Through experimentation, problem-solving activities and independent study, students develop an understanding of the processes by which scientific knowledge evolves. Included are the program rationale and philosophy, general learner expectations, specific learner expectations, and a course overview. The four units are: (1) &quot;Energy from the  Sun&quot;; (2) &quot;Matter and Energy in Living Systems&quot;; (3) &quot;Matter and Energy in Chemical Change&quot;; and (4) &quot;Energy and Change&quot;. Each unit contains an overview, attitudes encouraged of students, major concepts, science knowledge, science skills, and science-technology-society connections. This final draft is being used to prepare support material and to validate the course of studies. (KR)",

Specific teaching strategies are listed that are associated with standard and exemplary teaching. Five proposed domains for science teaching and assessment include concepts, process, creativity, attitude, and connections and applications. Contrasts between student outcomes of classrooms taught by typical teachers and exemplary teachers are listed under each domain. Included are the results obtained when exemplary teachers assessed student growth in the five domains using a standard textbook format versus a  science/technology/society (STS) framework. It was determined that teachers who use exemplary practices are able to stimulate growth in their students in all domains other than concept mastery to a far greater degree than when standard teaching practices are employed. Ten features of exemplary programs produced by exemplary teachers are listed. (KR)",

The literature is replete with reports and research findings which highlight problems and shortcomings associated with the teaching and learning of science. In order to provide a refreshing alternative to the majority of research reports which malign science education and highlight its major problems and shortcomings, a series of case studies of exemplary practice in science teaching was initiated in three nations to provide a focus on the successful and positive facets of schooling. It was assumed that much could be learned from case studies of exemplary practice that would stimulate and guide improvements in science education, especially with such an international perspective.  This symposium was designed to permit the first comparison and discussion of results in Australia, Israel, and the United States. Included are three papers entitled &quot;Case Studies of Practices Used by Exemplary Science and Mathematics Teachers,&quot; (Barry Fraser and David Treagust, Australia); &quot;Research on Exemplary Chemistry Teachers in Israel,&quot; (Avi Hofstein, Israel); and &quot;The Practices of Teachers Who Develop Exemplary Science Programs,&quot; (Robert E.

        "description":"This book is an outlined for the short study (1- to 2-weeks) of chronobiology, a field of science that explores the relationships between time and biological functions. It develops step-by-step the reasoning that leads to the current scientific understanding of biological rhythms. The unit can be inserted into a standard middle or high school biology course. Because the scientific study of biological rhythms begins with data, Chapter 1 provides a brief review of the ways to collect, graph, and interpret data. Chapter 2 introduces some of the cycles in nature, especially those of the human body-from dream cycles to menstruation to body temperature. Chapter 3 explores how these cycles come about and explains the differences between external and internal influences. Chapter 4  explores the internal workings of organisms to determine whether there is a single master source of timing information that synchronizes an organism's many interacting cycles. Chapter 5 discusses the impact of rhythms on society and asks how an understanding of them could bring progress in medicine, work schedules, and everyday life. Chapter 6 offers a brief historical perspective on the study of biological rhythms, and chapter 7 outlines eight activities that demonstrate cycles in chemicals, plants, and animals. Each activity includes an introduction, materials, set-up, procedures, and possible extensions. (KR)",

The project was initiated to promote the use of TVOntario's science programming and television as a teaching tool in science instruction. Using this model, the training was first concentrated on a small group of carefully selected teachers. After completing their own intensive training this &quot;model&quot; group became trainers of their colleagues. The colleagues then trained others with the expectation that the effects of training would continue to ripple throughout the school area. The teachers used a variety of training methods, including informal sharing with colleagues, workshops, and peer coaching. The present evaluation is designed to  investigate the value of using this utilization strategy for future projects. The research assessed the success of the SQEP strategy in bringing about change in teaching attitudes and practices. It also examines the factors that contribute to the model's effectiveness as well as areas for improvement. Chapters include: (1) &quot;The Science Quality Education Project&quot;; (2) &quot;The Evaluation Design&quot;; (3) &quot;The Success of the SQEP in Affecting Change&quot;; (4) &quot;The Effectiveness of the Trainer-of-Trainers' Model&quot;; (5) &quot;Factors Affecting Implementation&quot;; and (6) &quot;Conclusions and Recommendations.&quot; (KR)",

From its analysis, the commission concluded that inadequate and inaccurate coverage was given to the history and culture of Eastern Europe. The commission made 12 recommendations based on its evaluation, including the creation of state guidelines emphasizing the importance of the Eastern European region, making grants available for the development of curriculum  materials and other educational resources, and providing teacher training to give sufficient attention to the history and culture of Eastern Europe.

        "description":"This paper forms part of a preliminary survey for work on the application of artificial intelligence theories and techniques to the learning of music composition skills. The paper deals with present day applications of computers to the teaching of music and speculations about how artificial intelligence might be used to foster music composition in the future. The field of music composition makes use of computer aided instruction in the areas of music theory, music history, and aural testing. Music Logo, the use of the programming language, Logo, to create music, is another application of computer technology to music. Computerized musical instruments allow students to compose and play music at their own level; to listen and adapt these compositions; and to analyze existing music  for pitch, note intervals and values, and pattern recognition. Interactive videogames provide untrained students with opportunities to compose music and hear it immediately and to teach musical transformations through simple visual manipulation of music. In the future, artificial intelligence may make modest contributions to support the learning of music composition in the areas of intelligent tutors that focus on music theory, aural training, harmonization, and some highly formalized and artificial styles of composition. Intelligent tools in the form of editors, instruments, and analytical aids along with educational games also could help students learn about music composition. The document contains 16 figures.

Formal knowledge of the domain (popular music) is too incomplete and fragmented to support a traditional expert-based tutor for precisely constrained tasks with clear-cut rules. Instead the proposed system will try to construct teaching plans on the basis of what novices can do, and equally importantly, what they like, in order to help them find paths to personally important goals. As well as an attempt to tackle the stringent demands of the particular domain, the research is an exploration of whether it is possible to tutor effectively with incomplete knowledge in a complex  domain.

        "description":"Locating the issue of abortion in a global public policy context, with the array of public health, human rights, and social questions that are implicated, is the aim of this paper. Abortion laws around the world have been liberalized since the 1950s, with a resultant decrease in abortion-related mortality among women. The proportion of the world's population, governed by laws that permit abortion on medical or broader social and economic grounds, is 75 percent (nearly 4 billion people). In addition to women living in those countries that have resisted liberalization of their abortion laws, many women have restricted access to abortion, even those in countries in which abortion is technically legal. There are a number of reasons for this, including a lack of government or public  commitment to provide or fund services, lack of trained specialists, administrative roadblocks, a woman's ability to pay, and a lack of truthful information about legal rights and services. Abortion rates from countries around the world are examined and discussed in terms of the varying demographic and social realities. The large number of maternal deaths due to abortion that still occur is not due to a deficiency in technology, but a deficiency in the value placed on women's lives. The numerous roadblocks to safe abortion services drive women to seek illegal or clandestine abortions that greatly endanger their lives. The debate surrounding abortion has been too often portrayed as a conflict between black and white hues. The debate needs to take place in a larger context, complete with  public health, family planning, and human rights concerns. Equality of political rights for women, and likely the lives of many, hinges on political decisions regarding abortion. (DB)",

        "author":["May, Wanda T.",
          "And Others"],
        "description":"An analysis and critique of two elementary textbook series: &quot;Discover Art&quot; by Davis Publications and &quot;World of Music&quot; published by Silver Burdett &amp; Ginn are presented. &quot;Whose content, context, and culture?&quot; is an ideological question that assumes that equitable social relations and diverse ways of knowing ought to be valued and fostered in classrooms and curriculum materials in a democratic society. While this question deserves to be asked of any subject area's curriculum material, it is a crucial one for the arts. First, there is little evidence of analysis/critique of existing materials within the disciplines of art and music. Second, contemporary discourse in discipline-based art education (DBAE) recommends equitable treatment of production/performance, aesthetics, history,  and criticism and more explicit attention to sequencing content in arts curricula. (Both of the above series claim to do this.) Finally, little research in art and music education has been conducted in the natural setting of classrooms to study how curricular content and materials are used or socially mediated. Two theoretical frameworks guide the analysis: (1) From a critical sociological perspective, texts are viewed as guiding or constraining the construction of meaning, and often this construction reflects the interests of a dominant social group (class, gender, race, or culture)--particularly when the texts are used uncritically as expository, authoritative texts. What is possible in textbooks and schools partially depends on connections between schooling and its structures to  economic, cultural, and political power in a larger sociopolitical context. This is one reason, for example, why textbooks look more alike than different across subject areas; (2) From the perspective of mediation, the text is viewed as another &quot;participant&quot; in instruction (rather than authoritative object) because teachers and students impose their own meanings on texts, and these meanings are derived from their past experiences and social relations in the classroom. Thus, neither teachers nor students are viewed as passive recipients of others' texts. Neither the curriculum nor the subject matter is to be found only &quot;in the text.&quot; Both perspectives, however, suggest that knowledge is socially constituted and produced. Both acknowledge how and why particular ways of knowing may be  mutually produced/reproduced in light of other possibilities. (Author/DB)",

The theoretical framework used to describe curriculum deliberation draws from the work of Dewey, Reid, Schwab, and Walker. Schwab's curriculum \"commonplaces\" (teacher, student,  subject matter, and milieu) are used as a framework for analyzing the primary interests expressed in teachers' deliberations and to illustrate the reflexive interplay of these concerns in how teachers frame curriculum problems, make decisions, and act upon these decisions in their practice. Implications for action research, collaborative inquiry, and professional development are raised throughout the paper. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"It has been noted that students have an influential role in determining the nature of classroom events in the middle grades and that their teachers adjust their classroom behavior in response to the characteristics of students in the class. This paper analyzes instruction as discourse between teacher and students and the collaborative nature of their interaction. In considering reciprocity in instruction, the characteristics of high-quality instructional discourse are examined. These characteristics include: (1) authentic questions which seek a high input from the student; (2) the teacher's incorporation of a previous student answer into a subsequent question; (3) teacher response which validates the student's impact on the course of discussion; (4) questions eliciting nonroutine  generalizations, analyses, or speculations; (5) encouragement of thoughtful student questions; and (6) high level of student participation. A discussion is presented on the effects of classroom organization on instructional discourse and the effects of instructional discourse on student achievement. A brief description is given of a pilot study conducted to examine the conditions of instructional discourse. A bibliography is included as well as data from the pilot study. (JD)",

        "description":"A workshop was attended by 36 instructors from departments of education in colleges and universities throughout Ohio for the purpose of identifying criteria for teacher selection. The participants sought to determine ways to achieve a fit between the selection committee's values, perceptions, and personality characteristics and the teacher candidate's values, perceptions, and personality characteristics. The focus was on three major screening areas: skill competence, personality characteristics, and interpersonal skills. Three instruments were used to describe the personality characteristics, and interpersonal skills of hypothetical successful teachers: the Scales of Worker Functions; the Successful Employment Profile (SEP), and the Osgood Semantic Differential. The similarity of  colleges and universities in their responses to the SEP and the semantic differential permitted the creation of a statistical model to represent the perceptions of all of the sample colleges and universities in Ohio. A summary of the workshop findings describes areas of agreement among the participants on what constitutes a successful teacher and lists six functions that a teacher should be able to perform, at least minimally. It is concluded that a statistical screening model based upon the data collected in this study can be used and validated concurrently using teachers who are already experiencing varying levels of success in the teaching field.

        "description":"A continuing concern in a number of teaching fields is the shortage of fully qualified teachers. The decisions of fully qualified teachers to continue in their teaching assignments (retention), to transfer to another assignment (transfer), or to leave the profession for some other activity (exit attrition) are the major determinants of the degree to which teacher shortages occur. This paper describes the &quot;Comprehensive Retention and Attrition Model&quot; (CRAM), a conceptual framework for organizing the numerous forms which teacher retention, transfer, attrition, and reentry can take. The model also incorporates teacher characteristics such as qualifications, age, and marital status, and an analytic approach to identifying teacher incentive variables having an impact on career  decisions. CRAM provides a framework for conceptualizing teacher movements within the profession and exiting from it, and for designing research on teacher retention, transfer, attrition, and reentry from a national perspective. A short paper by the same author is attached: &quot;Incentive Effects on Teacher Behavior.&quot; The focus of this paper is on using the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) of the National Center for Education Statistics to study incentive effects on teacher career decisions.

Follow-up questionnaires administered to the program interns focused on: (1) their overviews of the experience of being an intern; (2) continuance of the relationship with their mentor; (3) current benefits and problems; (4) the influence of participation in the program on the decision or opportunity to teach and commitment to a career in teaching; and (5) retrospectives on the influence of the internship. The key objective of the report was to examine the impact of the program on the new teacher beyond the first year of practice. The great majority of the  teachers reported a positive impact from their participation in a mentor-intern project. The impact also appeared to continue into the second year of teaching and, in many cases, into the third year. Often the heart of the interns' experiences was the relationship with their mentors. Relatively few respondents reported negative feelings about their participation in the project. Participation in the program also appeared to strengthen the teachers' commitment to teaching. (JD)",

There is widespread disagreement about the nature of the &quot;musician&quot; who eventually ends up as a teacher in front of children in the schools. Interviews with music education students reveal a difficulty in clarifying their roles as &quot;performer,&quot;&quot;musician,&quot; and &quot;teacher.&quot; These  students typically view themselves as either a &quot;performer&quot; on some specific instrument or as a general &quot;musician.&quot; It appears that this latter category is the perception of self for students who see themselves less able to compete for the &quot;performer&quot; status. Despite the fact that all of these students are training to become teachers, they see themselves not as teacher candidates but as musicians. (JD)",

Analysis of the data revealed that: (1) the perception of the prevalence of instrinsically-oriented work incentives and perception of aversive conditions in the workplace were powerful predictors of commitment to teaching, while the perception of the prevalence of extrinsically-oriented incentives was not; (2) overall, the respondents expressed greater intrinsic motivation than extrinsic; and (3) respondents who were predominantly intrinsically motivated expressed a slightly higher degree  of commitment to teaching than did respondents who were predominantly extrinsically motivated. Professional incentive efforts need to address the intrinsically motivated goals of teachers, while de-emphasizing the use of extrinsically-oriented work incentives. However, in light of the additional effects of perceived aversive work conditions, it is recommended that, to more fully account for teacher commitment, the teacher work incentive position be expanded to include the effects of aversive conditions in the workplace.

        "description":"The Research About Teacher Education (RATE) Project is an ongoing data collection effort to establish a reliable database about institutions of higher education where teachers are prepared, and about the faculty, students, and programs at these institutions. The data reported in this monograph were taken from four questionnaires--separate faculty and student questionnaires; an institutional questionnaire; and a school-based cooperating teacher questionnaire. Ninety institutions randomly selected from the membership of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education constituted the sample for this year's RATE Project. The focus of this study was on laboratory and clinical experiences. After an introductory section on methodology, 5 sections elaborate on the data  collected. Section 1 deals with institutional characteristics and enrollment data and trends; section 2 focuses on laboratory, clinical, early field, and student teaching experiences; section 3 discusses data on faculty supervisors and cooperating teachers; section 4 discusses student profiles (demographic data, altruism and career horizons, cultural insularity, and student teaching experiences); and section 5 focuses on preservice preparation and clinical training. The report concludes with a summary of findings on the positive aspects of teacher preparation, especially as they pertain to perceptions about the laboratory, clinical, student teaching, and early field experiences. The summary also underscores some serious constraints to quality laboratory, clinical, and student teaching  experiences. Tables, figures, and 11 references are included. (JD)",

This is the seventh in a series of annual analyses of wage comparability studies. In addition to comparing average earnings, the report represents several other comparisons between teachers and other college-educated workers, e.g., the growth in earnings throughout a career. One purpose of the analysis is to determine amounts teachers need to be paid to make their salaries equivalent to the earnings of college graduates with similar education and work experience in other occupations, e.g., executives, administrators, and managerial  supervisors. It is noted in the conclusion that despite the growth of teachers' salaries over the last 7 years in the Southeast and a slower rate of growth for the earnings of other college-educated workers in the region, teachers' salaries are still not competitive enough to ensure the attraction and retention of adequate numbers of qualified teachers.

        "description":"This casebook was developed collaboratively by a researcher from Far West Laboratory, a staff developer/researcher from the San Francisco Unified School District, and 11 veteran teachers who teach in large metropolitan settings. It contains 14 narrative cases written by teachers about problems that all teachers face who teach ethnically and racially diverse young people in their classrooms. The teachers describe problematic events from their own experience. Some reflect back on incidents they encountered as beginning teachers, describe how they handled the situations, and examine what they have learned during the ensuing years. Others portray problems they are presently facing. The commentaries that follow each case analyze the situations and are designed to take different  perspectives in interpreting the accounts. The book is grouped into four sections highlighting the ways in which the cases are similar to each other. The first two chapters deal with instructional events: the challenges of teaching new concepts and skills to diverse learners, especially when the teacher is white and the students are of color, and the problems of integrating non-English-speaking students into the classroom. The focus of the third chapter is interactions with individual or groups of students who are particularly challenging. In these cases, the teachers wrote about the ways in which their relationships with students contributed to, or in some cases, detracted from a learning experience. The cases in the last chapter portray the importance and influence of school/family  relationships on student learning. An annotated bibliography of 16 items is included, as well as guidelines for writing a case. (JD)",

Data for 99 mathematics teachers and their 4,030 eighth graders (the 14-year-old cohort) were taken from the Second International Mathematics Study (1981-82) of the International Association for the Assessment of Educational Achievement. The 13 primary sampling units were the 12 national educational regions of Thailand plus the capital, Bangkok. The schools in this sample were equally effective in converting pretest into posttest scores; there were essentially no variable slopes in this respect. When group and individual effects on total variance were examined, group level effects contributed 32% of the variance and individual effects contributed 68% of the variance in  posttest scores, with achievement higher for: (1) boys; (2) younger students; (3) children with higher educational aspirations; (4) those with higher self-perceptions of ability; and (5) those with greater interest in and perceived relevance of mathematics. The model developed explained most of the between-school, but less of the within-school, variance. It is suggested that schools in Thailand are more uniform in their effects than previous research in developing countries has suggested. Nine tables present study data.

In analyzing these concept learning strategies, an effort was made to triangulate sources of data and take into account aspects of the environment that are important to instructors and instructional designers. This study attempted to: identify major research questions regarding complex learning outcomes, and evaluate the utility of corresponding data sources. Focus was on increasing the effectiveness of studying a complex process (i.e., internalizing a cognitive strategy). Two pairs of matching rational set matrices of coordinate concepts related to chemistry  were presented to 45 high school chemistry students in two chemistry classes at a southern public high school. Students (with one exception) worked cooperatively in two learning groups with the same instructor. In a second sequence, Group 1 used the teaching strategy, while Group 2 constructed their own concept matrices. After instructional matrix use, students took a quiz similar to one of the matrices. The result show that the concept matrix was a successful teaching strategy. The group constructing their own matrix as a learning strategy retained less information than did those who were taught via the matrix. Implications for instruction are discussed.

In Study 1, subjects' significant others were asked to provide ratings of subject SCs. In Study 2, students in Sydney (Australia) were followed from grade 7 through grade 11. Androgyny theory predicts that both M and F contribute to SC, but previous research, relying on undifferentiated SC measures, has found no unique contribution by F. These two studies show that both M and F contributed to the prediction of  well-differentiated facets of SC. Consistent with a new model of MF/SC relations, the differentiated additive androgyny model, the relative contributions of M and F varied substantially depending on the area of SC: F contributed more positively to facets for which girls had higher SCs than boys; in some areas the contribution of F was more positive than the contribution of M. In Study 1, the pattern of MF/SC relations was similar for self-responses and ratings by significance others. In Study 2, the MF/SC relations were consistent across the 5 years of school studied, spanning the early to middle adolescence period. In conclusion, the two studies support neither the androgyny interactive nor sex-typed models, and provide only weak support for the additive androgyny and the masculinity  models. In contrast, both studies strongly support the differentiated additive model. Eight tables provide study data; and an appendix describes the SDQ-II and SDQ-III scales.

Earlier research was extended by considering: (1) affective variables (e.g., self-concept, locus of control), academic choices (e.g., course selection), and postsecondary activities as well as academic achievement outcomes; (2) Catholic single-sex and Catholic coeducational schools separately; and (3) academic self-concept, school policies related to discipline, and academic orientation as mediating variables. Data for 4,378 students from public schools, Catholic coeducational schools, Catholic boys schools, and Catholic girls schools were analyzed. A sample size of 4,000 was used to test  statistical significance in all analyses. Results indicate that growth in the last 2 years of high school on a variety of outcomes was modestly larger for Catholic school students than for public school students. Effects favoring Catholic schools were relatively larger for the selection of academic courses, relatively smaller for achievement and university attendance, and almost zero for affective variables. Subsequent analyses suggest that Catholic schools encourage students to take more academically challenging coursework and that this difference explained other public/Catholic differences. Three tables contain study data. A 49-item list of references is included, and an appendix defines the variables considered. (Author/SLD)",

Based on a social learning model emphasizing efficacy, outcome, and reinforcement, the Computer AVersion Scale (CAVS) was developed for use with mental health clients who were high school age and older, as well as mental health professionals. The original CAVS item pool consisted of 45 true/false items. The CAVS produces four scores: (1) efficacy expectations (one's ability to perform behaviors required to operate a computer); (2) outcome expectations (one's knowledge of the required behaviors); (3) reinforcement expectations (whether outcomes produced by computer use meet one's goals); and (4) a total score, reflecting the cumulative effects of goals. A  fourth summary score reflects the cumulative effects of the other three scores. Two groups of subjects were employed to reduce the 45-item CAVS to a 31-item instrument, which was then administered to 270 undergraduates enrolled in a large northeastern university. The Attitudes Toward Computers Scale was also administered to 78 subjects who completed the CAVS. The CAVS was also compared with other instruments designed to measure negative affect, including two instruments for use in diagnosing feelings about computers, as well as an instrument for assessing levels of computer experience. Results, which cover such variables as gender and educational background, indicate that the CAVS is a reliable and valid measure of computer aversion. Seven data tables, a 23-item list of references, and  the CAVS are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"The consistency by which shared abilities are assessed on three intelligence tests was investigated. Instruments under consideration include: the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition. A list of shared abilities and the subtests measuring them was developed for each test. Of the 52 shared abilities, 15 (29%) were measured by all three tests, 9 (17%) were measured by two of the tests, and 28 (54%) were measured by only one instrument. These results are presented in a table that lists the subtests of each instrument and which abilities are measured by each. The consistency by which shared abilities are measured was analyzed by nature of the stimulus (verbal, visual, or  a combination of the two), mode of response (verbal or non-verbal), and task demands of the subtests. Of the 15 shared abilities measured by all three tests, only one is measured by subtests in which the nature of the stimuli and response mode are the same and in which there are no differences in the nature of the tasks. The analysis of each shared ability is presented along with a discussion of the results of the analysis. Guidelines and precautions in the use of shared ability analysis across tests are presented.

        "description":"Results from North Carolina's End-of-Course Testing Program in 1989-90 are presented. Participation, student characteristics, and achievement are summarized, largely in table form, for the following subject areas: (1) Algebra I, (2) Geometry, (3) Algebra II, (4) Biology, (5) Chemistry, (6) Physics, (7) U.S. History, and (8) English I. Background information is also given on the history, purposes, and development of the End-of-Course testing program. Of the 391,611 end-of-course tests taken in 1989-90, 919 were perfect scores, and 8,817 had no more than three items answered incorrectly. Many results from previous years are summarized, documenting modest gains over the last 5 years in the proportion of students taking advanced mathematics and in the percentage of students beginning  an accelerated mathematics sequence in grade 8. Strengths and weaknesses of schools and school systems can be identified by examining relative performance on the 2,240 test items assessed in 1989-90. Eleven tables and 26 figures illustrate comparative performance for previous years, and 1989-90 results. The last two sections of the paper present eight tables of results for outstanding school systems, and five tables of results for public school systems, respectively. (SLD)",

Included among the alternative options are the interpretation of effect size estimates and the evaluation of sample specificity (invariance testing). Using a hypothetical data set of 64 cases and two predictor variables, this study explains one approach to estimating whether the results in a study are sample specific--the jackknife method. The jackknife technique is useful with many statistical procedures and is especially appropriate when the sample size is small. The results of a descriptive discriminant analysis followed by the application of the jackknife are discussed to illustrate the procedure. When used with discriminant analysis, the  jackknife technique evaluates the stability of the discriminant function coefficients. Ten tables and a 23-item list of references are included.

Policy shifts and program direction during the selection process for these projects are described. Applications were reviewed by three readers looking for innovation and for significance beyond the local impact. Many factors of program delivery and finance were considered. A final factor was the requirement that a certain minimum be in special areas such as  effective schools. The first 25 projects of statewide significance were selected for implementation in spring 1990. Some of the projects highlighted include: (1) alternative methods of credit accumulation; (2) an interdisciplinary curriculum development project for at-risk youth; (3) music education curricula; (4) transition from middle school to high school; (5) use of multimedia technology in cooperative learning and critical thinking; (6) total child student management programs; and (7) educational materials related to a museum collection.

The papers include: (1) \"Are the Very High Dropout Rates Being Reported Greatly Exaggerated?\" (George H.

The first paper purports that: much of the confusion concerning national dropout rates  (estimated at 25% to 50%) is due to recordkeeping problems; and if student accounting methods are improved, dropout rates will decrease. The second paper reviews three studies conducted at the Austin (Texas) Independent School District on predicting dropout and graduate rates, and describes characteristics of effective dropout prevention programs. The third paper describes legislative efforts in which new social policies related to schooling are used to convince parents and their children that all students must graduate from high school, and considers educational reform and school restructuring. The fourth paper takes the perspective of the Texas Research League, and considers the multifaceted role of private industry in preventing school dropouts.

An exploratory analysis of 1983 selection data was undertaken, resulting in elimination of one selection test and establishment of a provisional cutoff for 1984 applicants. In the principal study, the following four aspects were examined: (1) selection tests; (2) the selection interview; (3) the personal information asked of applicants; and (4) the role of the written assignment required of applicants. Selection tests included: a test of general mental ability for use at the tertiary level; a story written after interviewing another candidate; and a test of listening comprehension. The pool of about 162 successful applicants from 1982 to 1984 (about 54 applicants per year) and about  150 unsuccessful applicants from 1982 to 1984 (about 50 applicants per year) formed the sample. Correlations were determined for the course grades, selection tests, and the ratings of candidates by three course instructors. Selection tests demonstrated satisfactory validity against course grades. It is suggested that the general ability test would be best complemented by a composite test sampling the skills measured by the other tests. Recommendations incorporated into the 1985 selection process and suggested for future use are discussed. Appendices provide information about students and forms used in the study. (SLD)",

An explanation of how individually-biased items can combine through a test score to produce test bias is provided. It is contended that bias, although expressed at the item level, should be studied at the test level. The model postulates an intended-to-be-measured target ability and nuisance determinants whose differing ability distributions across examinee group cause bias. Multiple nuisance determinants can produce item bias cancellations, resulting in little or no test bias. Detection of test bias requires a valid subtest, whose items measure only target ability. A long-test viewpoint of bias is also developed. Four  graphs and a 30-item list of references are included. (Author/SLD)",

Although there are some disagreements about what a portfolio should be, the NREL has concluded that a portfolio must be a purposeful collection of student work that exhibits a student's progress in a given area or areas while including: (1) student participation in selection of the portfolio content; (2) the criteria for selection; (3) the criteria for judging merit; and (4) evidence of student self-reflection. Examples were  derived from the areas of writing and integrated language arts, where most of the work with portfolios has been. Issues in using portfolios are discussed, with emphasis on: purposes, curriculum and instruction, content, assessment, management and logistics, and staff development.

        "description":"The history of the Educational Testing Service (ETS) Factor Kits is summarized. The original ETS Factor Kit was developed in 1954 and contained 51 items, three each for each of 15 factors and six for a 16th factor. The next edition was developed in 1963 and included adaptations (clones) of the defining tests instead of the exact copies. These tests marked 24 factors. The current edition of the ETS Factor Kit was developed in 1976 and consists of 72 tests marking 23 cognitive factors. Some limitations of paper-and-pencil versions of the kits are identified, and computer-administered versions being developed are described. Information is given about a study comparing computer and paper-and-pencil tests. The Factor Kit tests were intended to be used as markers in factor-analytic  studies of cognition and have been widely used in psychological research. Tests that could be used to determine a number of major factors were assembled in &quot;kits&quot; for factorial research. Limitations of the format restricted the kinds of cognitive processes that could be assessed and the ways in which tests could be scored. Questions of test misuse arose. Creating computer-administered versions posed a number of problems in the areas of timing, confirmation and correction of responses, and pacing. For the computer administered versions, system features are described. A small pilot study compared the two formats using data for 30 secondary school students aged 13 to 19 years, who took part of each kit of 10 tests in each format. Results suggest that the factors measured by these 10 tests  were not affected by the use of the computer version. Versions of the computer-administered kit for field testing are anticipated in 1992. Three tables provide details about the 1954, 1963, and 1976 editions of the Factor Kits. A 17-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

        "author":["Rowell, R. Kevin"],
        "description":"This paper explains how commonality analysis (CA) can be conducted using a specific Statistical Analysis System (SAS) procedure and some simple computations. CA is used in educational and social science research to partition the variance of a dependent variable into its constituent predicted parts. CA determines the proportion of explained variance that is unique to a predictor variable and the proportion that is common to two or more predictors. Whereas the ordering of the predictors using stepwise regression may lead to faulty data interpretations, CA is a method by which all possible predictor combinations are tested to determine the model that best explains predicted variance. Data from a study of life satisfaction (LS) among 198 elderly residents in 17 Texas nursing homes  illustrate procedures for conducting CA with regression results. The subjects completed a LS questionnaire to determine if their self-reports of LS differed from those of the elderly living outside of nursing homes. Eight subscale components and the number of years in the nursing home were analyzed by regression to determine which variable best predicted nursing home satisfaction. Meaning was the dominant factor in predicting nursing home satisfaction and accounted for about 80% of all explained variance in the sample. In addition, a SAS computer program for obtaining all possible R-squared values is discussed as an efficient method of implementing the required analyses. CA offers a fairly straightforward method of analysis when no more than four independent variables are of interest.  Three tables of data are presented, and the R-squares of LS scales are included.

        "description":"The argument underlying the ongoing paradigm shift from logical-positivism to constructionism is briefly outlined. A model of evaluation planning, implementation, and management (the P-I-M model) is then presented, which assumes a complementarity between the two paradigms. The P-I-M Model includes three components of educational evaluation: a management information system (MIS), naturalistic evaluation, and rationalistic evaluation. The P-I-M Model of evaluation incorporates the dialectic between logical-positivism and constructionism, and the dialectic between descriptive data and evaluative data. The model implies that for effective decision making within human organizations, both evaluative data and descriptive data are needed. Evaluative data generated by evaluation studies  must, therefore, be strengthened by an appropriate MIS that can generate descriptive data concurrently with the process of program implementation. The P-I-M Model, if fully actualized, will enable human organizations to become vibrant &quot;cultures of information&quot; where &quot;informed&quot; decision making becomes a shared norm among all stakeholders. Eight flowcharts are provided to illustrate the P-I-M Model. A 25-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

        "description":"Factor analysis is used frequently by researchers as a data reduction and summarization technique. Many analysts use exploratory factor analysis to search for underlying dimensions in attitudinal studies. Concern arises when novice researchers rely solely on information derived from computer printouts to factor analyze data, dismissing theoretical consideration of concepts underlying this analytical procedure. A primer on principal components exploratory factor analysis is presented, and five decision rules for selecting the number of principal components to retain are discussed: (1) the K1 rule; (2) the Scree test; (3) Bartlett's test; (4) the minimum average partial method; and (5) parallel analysis. A small data set, obtained in an actual exploratory study, was used to  illustrate the discussion. The study addressed effects of preemployment tests on attitudes toward a firm formed by individuals outside that firm. In a pilot study, responses of more than 400 graduating seniors to three different preemployment tests were analyzed. In a second study, 249 graduating seniors and master's candidates responded to preemployment test scenarios. Dimensions of applicants' attitudes were examined through exploratory factor analysis. It is concluded that the results of different decision rules must be used when determining the number of principal components, and that factor analyses should be run with one or two components above and below those suggested with the five methods in order to avoid underextraction or overextraction. Analysts are cautioned to not rely on  computer programs and preset default outputs as the &quot;last word.&quot; Three figures and four tables supplement the discussion.

Characteristics associated with urbanicity and wealth are also reported. Factors examined are those most commonly used to identify the resources, needs, organization, and special characteristics of education within each state. The factors are displayed in numeric and graphic form to make them useful for a wide range of audiences and purposes. Data were derived from a variety of sources. A major data source was the annual Common Core of Data survey of the National Center for Education Statistics. Data are presented in 46 graphs and 17 tables in four sections: (1) state background information (population totals, total school-age (5-17 years old)  population, and state capacity to support public education); (2) institutional characteristics (numbers, types, and sizes of school districts and schools); (3) education staff and students (counts of students and teachers, administrators, and other education staff and ratios of selected staff to students); and (4) revenues and current expenditures for public elementary and secondary education. Selected highlights include the following: Idaho, Maine, and Nevada have the highest percentage (95.5%) of 5-year-old through 17-year-old students attending public schools; the largest school districts are located within the South Atlantic division, the city-urban fringe locale, and the moderately high relative wealth clusters; Delaware has the highest percentage (10.2%) of special education  schools, and North Dakota has the second highest percentage (5.2%); student/teacher ratio tends to vary by geographic region more than by urbanicity or relative wealth; and Tennessee spends the largest percentage (69.9%) of total current expenditures on instruction.

To test these hypotheses, 19 undergraduate students (9 males and 10 females) of varying cognitive abilities were trained in an alphabetic (n=9) or hierarchical (n=10) manner to use a  word processor. After training, the subjects' task representation was assessed and they were required to perform both controlled and automatic process tasks. The first hypothesis was not supported; the second, fourth, and fifth hypotheses were supported; and the third hypothesis could not be confirmed. Performance on repetitive tasks associated with automatization was influenced by training style and the mental task representation held by individuals. Task representation was also a significant determinant of performance on complex cognitive-oriented (controlled process) tasks. No effect was found for individual differences. To maximize performance, training and task design should consider the mental representation of the task. Two figures and four tables present study data.  (SLD)",

The NAEP is a congressionally mandated project of the National Center for Education Statistics. The operational contract for 1990 and 1992 has been awarded to the Educational Testing Service and its subcontractor; the policy guidelines are formulated by the National Assessment Governing board. NAEP objectives for each assessment take the form of frameworks or matrices for content and process areas such as reading and mathematics. Students are selected through detailed sampling procedures. In 1990, approximately 87,000 students  participated in the national assessment and another 100,000 students participated in the state assessments of eighth-grade mathematics. The NAEP estimates that in 1992, the assessments will involve 419,000 students in 12,000 schools. Data are collected by trained administrators to reduce the burden on participating students and schools. The assessment instruments, which are generally administered in group settings, include a variety of multiple-choice and open-ended items.

Using the Illinois Writing Program (IWP) as an example, this digest also looks at some of the goals, solutions, and experiences of a program that is implementing authentic writing assessment. New directions in authentic assessment are aimed at going beyond writing as an isolated subject unto itself by integrating writing into the teaching of all subject areas, including science and mathematics. An authentic writing assignment should reflect various types of writing as well as levels of complexity related to the task assigned in the assignment's prompt. An increasingly popular format is portfolio assessment, in which students complete a body of writing over a prolonged period of time. The IWP was  designed to represent defined writing skills as well as status and growth; verify that the methods used to construct, conduct, and verify the assessment meet technical standards; and implement an informational network to allow classroom and district personnel to use test results to improve instruction. Criteria for the rating system concentrate on the paper's maintenance of a compositional focus, the use of supportive arguments, organization, and use of conventional English. The assessment also produces a focused holistic score on integration, which reflects how well the composition as a whole accomplishes the assignment. Teacher involvement in the program is fostered via workshops, provided to over 1,000 teachers during the program's 5-year history. A five-item list of additional reading  materials is included.

Authentic reading assessment emerged as a response to research that indicates that reading is not a particular skill but an interaction among reader, text, and the context of the reading situation. Unlike formal assessments of reading, the MESRT uses intact, full-length stories and subject-area reading selections taken from real life materials, such as children's magazines, literature anthologies, and textbooks for different grade levels. The reading selections are then the driving force for developing test items. The MESRT uses the following three types of constructing-meaning items: (1) intersentence items, in which the answer to the test item can  be found in two to three contiguous sentences within the reading selection; (2) test items, in which one or more paragraphs of the reading selection must be read to construct meaning; and (3) &quot;beyond test&quot; items, in which the reader not only constructs meaning from the text but also must bring in some of his or her own prior knowledge to answer the test item. In addition to the constructing-meaning items, the MESRT includes self-report items that assess student knowledge about illustrations or organization of specific texts as well as items that assess students' interest in and feelings about specific reading selections. To date, the reactions of parents and teachers have been positive. The positive impact of continuing research on reading and reading assessment is reflected in the 1992  National Assessment of Educational Progress reading framework as well as in other efforts.

Compared to achievement tests, aptitude tests cover a broader area and a wider range of experiences. Research data indicate that individually administered aptitude tests identify predictors of future scholastic achievement, compare performance across students, provide a profile of students' strengths and weaknesses, assess differences among individuals, identify hidden talents in some children, and  provide information about handicapped students. Aptitude tests provide information for instructional, administrative, and guidance purposes. Overall, research on the improvement of aptitude test scores is inconclusive, but it does indicate that effective training approaches involve the following: longitudinal, non-intrusive techniques; interaction of student abilities and training methods; practice and feedback; incorporating other strengths of the student; and focus on aspects of intellectual aptitude that have been identified as trainable. A five-item list of additional reading materials is included. (TJH)",

        "description":"The nature of neuropsychological assessment and its application in the school environment are discussed. Neuropsychology is the study of how the brain and nervous system affect thinking and behavior. A complete neuropsychological assessment requires gathering and analyzing information on a child's: (1) physical, social, and psychological development; and (2) education. Sources of data for neuropsychological assessments include parental observations, formal observation, standardized measures, and other tests such as the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery and the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery. Educational application of neuropsychological assessment is particularly pertinent today due to recent laws concerning education of the handicapped, the wide range of  programs offered by schools for the developmentally disabled, and the difficulties involved in identification of learning disabilities. Although neuropsychological tests are excellent diagnostic tools, they are limited by the following: thoroughly trained professionals must administer the tests and interpret results; several other indicators must be used along with test results; questions about the validity of norms for such tests; and the time consuming nature of the tests.

        "description":"A brief introduction to the topic of gender bias and fairness in testing is provided. A test is biased if men and women with the same ability levels tend to obtain different scores. The conditions under which a test is administered, the wording of individual test items, and a student's attitude toward the test can affect test results. While gender bias is a characteristic of the test itself, gender fairness refers to the ways test results are used. Detection of gender bias involves checking questions for: references that may be offensive to members of one gender; references to objects that are more familiar to men or to women; and unequal representation of men and women as actors or representation of members of each gender only in stereotyped roles. Gender bias assessments are  particularly important for aptitude and achievement tests. Determining whether test results are being used fairly requires examination of the organizational policies that determine how test results are used. This latter issue is illustrated with a court case (&quot;Sharif v. New York State Education Department&quot;) concerning the use of SAT scores as sole determinants of scholarship awards.

        "description":"Based on material prepared for the California Assessment Program, an argument in favor of authentic assessment is presented, and authentic assessment is contrasted with traditional standardized tests. An assessment is authentic when student performance on intellectual tasks is directly examined. Comparatively, traditional assessment relies on indirect or proxy items. Issues addressed include cost, effort and time requirements, and public suspicions regarding the objectivity of authentic assessment. It is contended that a move toward more authentic tasks and outcomes improves teaching and learning. In authentic assessments, students have greater clarity about their obligations and are asked to master more engaging tasks, and teachers can see assessment results as meaningful and  useful for improving instruction. Conventional testing is probably adequate if the aim is to monitor performance. However, tests must be composed of exemplary tasks, criteria, and standards if the goal is to improve performance across the board. A five-item list of additional reading materials is included.

The establishment of an independent council of respected, bipartisan, and diverse experts to study the nation's educational system was recommended. This council would have the power to make recommendations to the President and the Congress and to issue annual reports in the form of a national report card. Nine voting members and three ex officio non-voting members  were proposed. The council's mandate would include: (1) compiling and analyzing existing information about educational achievement of students and schools in public and private education; (2) developing, monitoring, and reporting progress on a comprehensive set of attainable national educational goals; and (3) identifying gaps in existing data. An interim report should recommend goals to be achieved before the year 2000. The first report card would be due in 2 years, and annual reports would follow. Administrative provisions are described. The Bill was referred to the Committee on Labor and Human Relations. (SLD)",

        "description":"Study effect meta-analysis was used to synthesize the results of explicit instruction on critical thinking (CT). The approach involved the collection of 250 studies (books, articles, dissertations, and abstracts) from the ERIC database and &quot;Dissertation Abstracts International&quot;, coding of the study features, calculation of effect sizes, and examination of relations between study features and effect sizes. To be included in the meta-analysis, studies had to compare the performance of two groups of students on some measure of CT. One group received explicit instruction to improve CT, while the other group did not. Each study was coded for its characteristics within three categories: publication history, methodological and setting features, and instructional features. Instructional  variables were duration of instruction, subject matter of the course in which the instruction was given, and presentation of instruction via the teacher or some other medium. Programs that focused continuously on thinking skills were distinguished from those that addressed such skills periodically. Programs that taught CT in a subject matter domain were distinguished from those that taught CT generally. Finally, the content of programs was coded as addressed to either internal or external consistency. A total of 20 studies, 19 of which were doctoral dissertations, were found to be suitable for the meta-analysis. Results consistently favored programs that used explicit instruction methods. Intensive programs proved more effective than did programs providing only periodic training in CT.  Length of treatment was unrelated to effectiveness. When the content of the CT instruction was internal validity, the average effect size was significantly lower than when both internal and external validity were emphasized. (TJH)",

The data are based on responses from 639 institutions of higher education on the Early Estimates Panel, a stratified random sample that is representative of the universe of 3,598 institutions of higher education in the nation in the 1989-90 academic year. Selected data items from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System &quot;Fall Enrollment&quot; survey and &quot;Completions&quot; survey were requested via telephone from the Early Estimates Representative of each institution in the sample between mid-October and mid-November 1990. The data were edited in light of previous years' survey responses, where available. The overall response rate for the 1990 &quot;Early Estimates&quot; survey  was 99%. In 1990, fall enrollment in colleges and universities increased 3.4% over that for 1989. Total awards of associate and higher degrees rose about 2.7% in the 1989-90 academic year. Women accounted for almost all of the increase nationally. The nine tables presented show the following statistics, mostly by sex: (1) enrollment by attendance status, attendance level of student, and level and control of institution, for the fall of 1989 and 1990; (2) degrees conferred by control of institution and/or level of degree from 1969-70 to 1989-90; and (3) college-age population by age group from 1970 to 1990.

        "description":"Numerous designs using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test ordinal hypotheses were assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation. Each statistic was computed on each of over 10,000 random samples drawn from a variety of population conditions. The number of groups, population variance, and patterns of population means were varied. In the non-null patterns, the power of the alpha-corrected tests was extremely low. Extremely low power was also evident for both the uncorrected and the no significance test for ordering technique. The linear trend test exhibited the highest power in almost every fully monotonic circumstance. The tau and monotonic trend tests also had high power in most fully monotonic population means instances, but they varied as to which was more powerful. Of the tests  for disconfirmations of monotonicity, the curvilinearity test for detecting inversions or ties was too often significant in monotonic but non-linear cases. Combined tests were preferred when they had high acceptance values (power) for the fully monotonic cases, but low acceptance values when disconfirmations were present. Ultimately, the choice of technique comes down to the balance between power when the ordinal hypothesis is correct versus spurious acceptance of the ordinal hypothesis when it is slightly in error. Sweep tests, particularly the linear trend test, have the needed power, but lack the ability to alone detect disconfirmations of monotonicity. The tests of disconfirmation that were evaluated showed far too many false positives to warrant wide acceptance. Six data tables are  included, and the Statistical Analysis System program used to run the Monte Carlo study and the program used to calculate taus are outlined. (TJH)",

The present paper reviews previous analyses of test content and proposes a new empirical method for evaluating the content representativeness of a test. The proposed empirical method evaluates the content of a test by determining if similarity ratings of expert judges reflect the content structure specified in the test blueprint. Three expert judges rated the similarity of items on a 30-item multiple-choice test of study skills. The test was designed to assess the knowledge acquired by students at the end of a five-session study skills course. The  test blueprint specified six content areas: study habits, time management, classroom learning, textbook learning, preparing for taking examinations, and taking examinations. The similarity data were used in a multidimensional scaling procedure to determine the dimensionality of the data. A subsequent cluster analysis was performed to determine whether the item clusters corresponded to the arrangement of items in the test blueprint. The results indicate a strong correspondence between the similarity data and the arrangement of items in the original test blueprint. Advantages of using item similarity data as an alternative to item response data are provided. Five data tables and six figures are included. A 29-item list of references is provided. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"Immigration has historically played an important role in supplying United States labor needs. However, current immigration and immigrant policies emphasize noneconomic selection criteria, such as family reunification, for determining the annual volume and characteristics of legal immigrants. Declining United States fertility rates and an increasing need for professional and skilled labor has prompted policymakers to consider changes in immigrant policies that would respond to the labor market needs of the economy. A greater emphasis on labor market considerations could meet changing demands for labor, minimize negative distributional effects, and speed up the economic and social adjustment of immigrants and their children. However, the following major factors must be considered  in developing effective policies: (1) policies must be flexible in order to respond to rapidly changing labor market conditions; (2) policymakers need an informed basis for developing selection criteria that will ensure a match between immigration and manpower needs while avoiding short-term displacement of native workers; and (3) the absence of good information continues to make policy design and evaluation problematic. Statistical data are presented in eight tables and six graphs. An 81-item bibliography is appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"Research on teacher and school effectiveness indicates that higher expectations for student achievement are part of a pattern of differential attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors characterizing teachers and schools that are effective in maximizing their students' learning gains. This resource document reviews research that indicates how differential treatment by teachers may negatively affect the behavior and learning of students for whom there are low expectations. The effect of negative teacher behaviors is that low-expectation students are given fewer opportunities to interact and participate in classroom activities, and as a result make less effort to get the teacher's attention, gradually withdrawing psychologically from learning in the classroom setting. Teacher expectations  seem to be an especially powerful variable for elementary school students, whereas secondary and postsecondary students tend to rely to a greater extent on self-evaluation and a wider range of significant others to provide them with feedback, support, and encouragement to continue learning when faced with failure. Appropriate teacher expectations must ultimately be based on objective, ongoing evaluation of student performance. The document presents recommendations and sample strategies for addressing differential treatment of low-expectation students. Descriptions of five sample programs and a list of 44 references are included. (AF)",

This study examines the relationship of the following organizational dimensions of tracking systems on the variation in between-track inequality and productivity: (1) selectivity; (2) electivity; (3) inclusiveness; and (4) scope. &quot;Inequality&quot; refers to the &quot;achievement gap&quot; between tracks; &quot;productivity&quot; refers to the average achievement of each school. In addition, differences between public and Catholic schools are examined. Statistical data from the High School and Beyond survey were analyzed for 28,804 students in 964 public and Catholic high schools. The following findings are reported: (1) more flexible systems produce lower inequality in mathematics, reading, and  vocabulary achievement; (2) moderately inclusive systems also produce lower inequality in mathematics achievement; (3) flexibility and inclusiveness have a positive effect on overall achievement; (4) elective systems produce higher achievement; and (5) Catholic schools have lower inequality and higher productivity than public schools, due in part to the way they use tracking.

The paper contends that early in the 21st century, Hispanics and other minorities will constitute the majority of the work force in major markets across the nation. The lack of preparedness of over half the potential pool of minority workers will have a profound negative impact on the U.S. economy. The paper sketches and notes the disadvantages of three potential strategies: (1) expensive retraining of workers; (2) reformulation of jobs so that they require low skill attainment and pay sub-living wages; and (3) automation or the seeking of skilled workers from abroad. The paper summarizes major themes of the education reform movement and presents the following broad policy  recommendations: (1) business leaders must play a more powerful role in the national education debate; (2) strong parent involvement in school-based activities and in supporting education at home must be vigorously promoted; (3) accountability and national standards must be set and upheld; (4) the dependency of the U.S. retirement system on the contributions of minority workers must be publicized; and (5) a balance must be struck between reforms that require increased revenues and those that require behavioral and organizational change.

While individual nonurban schools may be superior to urban schools in preparing the majority of their students to perform well on state standardized tests, the standardized test scores of nonurban minority group students are significantly lower than those of nonurban White students. Minority group students in suburban and rural schools are similar to their urban counterparts in how they are influenced by cultural values, the way they develop self-esteem and locus of control, and the way they process information. However, nonurban minority group students, unlike their urban peers, encounter a school environment where the culture, values, and  attitudes of most of their classmates and teachers may be radically different from their own. As a result, minority group students resist engagement in academic activities, attach less value to education than their White peers, and achieve academically at a lower rate than White students. Nonurban schools need to develop strategies that sensitize teachers to the cultural, psychological, and cognitive styles of minority group students and implement programs such as The Efficacy Committee, Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS), and Foundations for Learning.

RAP sessions, which were held for seven Saturdays during the spring 1990 semester, offered instruction in the following content areas: (1) intensive achievement test preparation; (2) English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) reading development; (3) writing skills development; (4) fundamental concepts of mathematics; (5) study skills; (6)  life skills; and (7) enrichment activities. This report evaluates the effectiveness of the RAP program. The tasks of the inquiry were to: (1) describe demographic data of program and comparison students; (2) analyze data collected for program and comparison students; and (3) conduct site visits to the five RAP academies. Findings indicate benefits for nontargeted students who attended RAP but no appreciable success in improving the grades of the targeted students.

Varied conditions of arrival have a significant impact on their adaption to life in the United States. Earlier Vietnamese immigrants were more educated and Westernized compared to later Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian refugees. The Confucian principles of filial piety, ancestral unity, primogeniture, and lineage influence parental socialization practices, and individuals strive to attain harmony in social relationships. The psychosocial development of Southeast Asian children is influenced by the conditions under which they arrived in the United States and by the tension between traditional and U.S. cultural beliefs. Unaccompanied males and  Amerasian children are particularly susceptible to depression and behavioral problems. Younger children seem to adjust to the school environment more easily than older children, but language presents a major barrier for both students and parents. Educators can facilitate learning and encourage parent participation if they: (1) use bilingual teachers and school-home liaisons as resources; (2) become familiar with Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian culture; (3) identify the specific conditions under which each family immigrated; (4) ask all students to share information about native culture and exhibit respect for individual characteristics; (5) invite children to discuss problems privately; and (6) ask parents who immigrated earlier to help more recent immigrant parents to understand  school policy and to translate communications.

The following parental factors are examined: (1) the press for English; (2) the press for independence; (3) the educational-occupational aspiration for their child; (4) the amount of time residing in the United States; and (5) the level of educational attainment. Information was gathered from the interview responses of a sample of 108 Hispanic American 10th-grade students and their parents. A model developed from the 1976 Marjoribanks Social-Environmental theory was tested using path analysis. The following findings are reported: (1) the  proposed family environment model accounted for 56 percent of the variance in the students' reading achievement and 59 percent of the variance in the students' mathematics achievement; (2) paternal achievement processes played a larger role than maternal processes; (3) the students' educational-occupational aspirations were related to their achievement and to the amount of time they spent on their homework; (4) Cuban fathers displayed higher levels of press for English, press for independence, and educational-occupational aspirations than Central/South American fathers; and (5) Central/South American fathers displayed higher levels of all family processes than Puerto Rican fathers.

        "description":"The objectives of this study were to determine the following: (1) what actions Federal agencies have taken to reduce or eliminate barriers to obtaining and using funds provided by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act; (2) the adequacy of Federal program oversight; and (3) the status of program expenditure rates. The programs reviewed are ones administered by the Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Education, and Labor, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The report finds that HUD, HHS, Education, and Labor have made progress in easing barriers identified as impediments to providers obtaining and using McKinney Act funds. However, HUD and Education have not adequately monitored their McKinney Act programs  and therefore cannot be assured that the programs comply with the McKinney Act and Federal rules and regulations. Efforts are underway at HUD, Education, Labor, and FEMA to improve monitoring and/or to conduct program evaluations. In addition, HUD, HHS, and Education officials are aware that some program recipients have not spent large portions of their fiscal year 1987-88 funds. These officials are urged to monitor all program expenditure rates. Recommendations to the Department Secretaries and the FEMA Director and four appendixes are included. (AF)",

        "description":"This report concerns inequity in public school finance and its impact on students who, because of economic disadvantage or other factors, are at risk of educational failure. The study examines how resources are distributed under state systems for financing public education. Findings indicate that the prevalent system of financing public schools through heavy reliance on locally raised property taxes leads to widespread disparities in expenditures among public school districts within states. Recent state court decisions have revived the movement, begun in the 1970s and early 1980s, to reform school finance systems through litigation. The study finds that inequitable systems of school finance inflict disproportionate harm on minority and economically disadvantaged students.  Educators have reached substantial agreement that several types of educational services are important, and in some cases vital, to the success of at-risk students. Because of a lack of resources, many of these services are inadequate or are not provided at all to children in property-poor districts. A more equitable distribution of resources by states to local school districts could reduce the costs of assuring effective educational services to at-risk children. An appendix discussing school finance litigation prior to 1989 and three statistical tables are included. (AF)",

The successful implementation of a school-based decision making (SBDM) management model depends upon the ability of the local school council to develop an effective working style. The councils are comprised of parents, community residents, teachers, and other assigned school staff. An analysis of information obtained from observations, interviews, and reviews of documents found that the nature of principal leadership was related to the nature of initial council functioning, but the principal was not the sole facilitating factor. The following findings are reported: (1) principals  who exhibited laissez-faire and democratic leadership styles encouraged councils to function cooperatively; (2) authoritarian principals inhibited cooperative council functioning, especially when information was controlled, communication with the central office and administrators was limited, and teachers did not advocate involvement in decisions; and (3) councils were more likely to function cooperatively when chairpersons were strong leaders, council members cooperated with the director and the professional association, and there was a common understanding of the council's role. Four figures illustrating the evolution of council working styles are included. A list of 16 references is appended. (FMW)",

While research indicates that all disadvantaged youth in urban areas are facing impediments to their success, the paper focuses on the realities of disadvantaged young men in their mid-teens to early twenties. The following factors and influences are examined: (1) economic trends; (2) demographic trends; (3) urban poverty; (4) family formation; (5) educational achievement; (6) drugs and violence; (7) incarceration; and (8) lack of supports. The paper asserts that a growing number of youth and families need assistance if they are to overcome the forces of poverty, joblessness, and  racism that place them at risk of not realizing their potential as self-sufficient and productive citizens. Today's disadvantaged young men in urban areas desperately need supervision during nonschool and summer hours while their parents are at work, which should incorporate the following elements: (1) consistent adult relationships; (2) supplemental education; (3) health care and counseling; (4) recreational activities; (5) safe and clean facilities; (6) skills development; and (7) improvements in self-esteem. Efforts to help these young men must comprehend the reality of urban life in the 1990s. A bibliography listing 68 references is appended. (AF)",

This paper attempts to define the issues that will influence the development of comprehensive programs and examines the qualities that have made them a promising alternative for the future. Issues that shape the lives of youth include the following: (1) individual action versus environmental constraints as the root of economic failure; (2) assistance versus empowerment approaches to program development; (3) special problems of adolescence; (4) discrimination by race; (5) discrimination by class; (6) poverty; and (7) media messages. Principles governing successful programs include the following: (1) flexibility; (2) holistic rather than categorical approach; (3)  community-based approach; (4) intervention aimed at institutions rather than individuals; and (5) early intervention. Successful programs have the following characteristics: (1) they address young people on a personal level through caring relationships with adults; (2) they provide a protective, family-like environment; and (3) they link youth to real opportunities within the community. Ingredients generally agreed upon as most needed for program success include the following: (1) individual attention; (2) neighborhood or community-based multiservice approach; (3) trained personnel; (4) social and personal skills training and counseling; (5) job skills training and placement; (6) parent involvement; and (7) peer involvement.

Those students include those who are handicapped, disabled, dropouts, of limited English proficiency, immigrants, displaced homemakers, dislocated workers, disadvantaged, single or teen parents, nontraditional enrollees, blind or hearing impaired, and incarcerated individuals. For the 500 surveys distributed in several states, 366 responses were received from vocational teachers, local administrators, university teacher educators, vocational special needs teachers, special education teachers, and state-level administrators. The kinds of information the respondents thought were most valuable in describing effective programs and  practices were educational goals, including anticipated learner outcomes; special population of students served; and detailed description of the program components or intervention. The most credible student outcome evidence for judging vocational special needs programs and practices was said to be acquisition of employability and survival skills; job placement data and training-related and unrelated jobs taken; and enrollment and completion data. The information most helpful in judging the effectiveness of vocational special needs programs and practices was found to be evidence describing the effects of the program upon student attainment of intended outcomes; number and type of special population students enrolling and completing over the previous 3 years, and case studies describing  individual students before, during, and following program enrollment. Twenty preliminary components of exemplary vocational education programs were identified through this and a related study. (CML)",

        "description":"A workplace literacy program was designed to improve the literacy skills of entry-level workers in the housekeeping, food service, and laundry departments of Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta. Classes were held twice per week for 36 weeks at the hospital on job time. Literacy was defined as reading, writing, oral communication, and problem solving. Materials were developed on the basis of a job literacy audit that included interviews with and observation of workers, interviews with supervisors, and analysis of written materials pertinent to the job. The whole language approach was used by one full-time instructor, one part-time instructor, and several volunteers who taught 66 participants (primarily black women with an average of 10.5 years of employment at the hospital).  Students were assessed before and after instruction by a Cloze reading test, using passages from job materials; a writing sample yielding a writing process score; and role-playing of a job situation scored for oral communication. Statistically significant gains were obtained for reading, writing, and oral communication. Participants believed that the program increased their academic skills (61 percent), improved their oral (39 percent) and written (34 percent) expression, improved their job knowledge (29 percent), increased their confidence (27 percent), and refreshed their basic education (24 percent). Supervisors believed the program benefited workers, especially in oral communications. (The document includes 18 references, a curriculum outline for classes, a process writing scoring  guide, an oral communication comprehensibility rating scale, a sample instructional plan, an external evaluator's report, and a dissemination plan.)

Information was gathered from two surveys, composed of three samples, conducted in 1985. Samples included: (1) 1,001 persons contacted through random telephone dialing; (2) 250 telephone interviews with people drawn randomly from Detroit; and (3) 503 random interviews drawn from Michigan exclusive of Detroit. Results were reported separately for each of the three samples and for geographic subregions within the United States. The survey found that nearly one-fifth of the national sample gave job creation a very high rating as a public issue and that people perceive large businesses as more important than new and small ones in  creating jobs and economic opportunity. One portion of the survey found the perception that entrepreneurs and small business owners were less politically influential than persons holding other occupations such as union leaders, corporate executives, federal workers, teachers, and farmers. Most agreed that entrepreneurship gives more control over one's life, and a substantial number exhibited the risk-taking characteristics of entrepreneurs. Respondents in all samples perceived substantial barriers for blacks and women wanting to start a business. Throughout the discussion, responses to these questions were compared for differences related to regional residence, gender, race, nativity, income and education, size of employer, and experience as a business owner. Relatively little regional  variation in attitudes was found. (KC)",

Employers are viewing training today as an essential element in their competitive business strategies. Second, customer service training is becoming the competitive weapon for U.S. businesses. As competition increases, product differentiation becomes more difficult and product positioning more complex. Third, technological change will have the greatest impact on HRD in the future. With this trend will come the need for new knowledge, skills, and understanding. Fourth, the problem of workplace literacy will take priority. With the increasing use of technology comes a dramatic number of illiterate workers.  Thus, it becomes more difficult to meet the technological demands. Fifth, distance learning and training technology programs are increasing. Distance learning refers to training and educational programs delivered to sites other than those where they originate via electronic or hard copy formats. Sixth, corporations are investing a great deal of time and money in executive education. Seventh, there is a need for training marketing or corporations selling their training services to the general public or to other organizations. There are several implications of these trends for graduate preparation in the field of adult and continuing education. Adult educators should (1) work in corporate settings; (2) understand the issues in workplace literacy; (3) broaden their preparation through  interdisciplinary study; (4) understand the impact of technology on the workplace; (5) participate in meaningful internships; and (6) contribute to the field of HRD.

        "description":"A dynamic community economic development and education process has emerged in Missouri. This effort is bringing about changed awareness and attitudes as well as developing skills and community self-help actions as a result of collaboration between communities, Extension specialists, and the University of Missouri-Columbia. One of the institutions growing out of the need of Missouri communities for assistance is the Clearinghouse for Community Economic Development, initiated in mid-1985 at the university. The primary mission of the clearinghouse is to empower community members to make informed decisions and to shape the future actively for themselves. Community economic development is an education and action process that involves many people thinking through the future of their  community, seeing that the changing world is providing new opportunities for innovation and revitalization, and then working together to make their dreams a reality. The process enables people to believe that it is possible to create jobs or income using local resources through actually seeing others' success. The clearinghouse uses &quot;Rusty Bucket Workshops&quot; to introduce a method of analyzing a local economy for opportunities. Then the participants brainstorm projects which could lead to important substitution, value addition, or resource enhancement. One means of developing a deeper understanding of the workings of the local economy is by using the Economic Base Study, a computer model developed at the University of Missouri which gives a profile of a county's economy that allows for  comparison with all of Missouri's counties plus any other state counties which border on Missouri. Finally, another important tool developed by the clearinghouse, the Tool Kit for Economic Development, helps participants share information and sparks creativity. Adult educators and Extension leaders can play a leadership role in fostering community economic development. (KC)",

        "description":"An 18-month demonstration program was conducted by the Northern Virginia Cooperative Vocational Education Department of the Fairfax County Public Schools, in partnership with the Virginia Merit Shop Foundation, to recruit and train apprentices for eight construction trades. Emphasis was placed on recruiting women, members of minority groups, and English-as-a-Second-Language clients. During the program, approximately 400 apprentices were recruited, with the highest number between ages 26-38, and a large number of 18- to 25-year-olds. Staff included five full-time and two part-time employees. Students were recruited through advertising, public service announcements, and social service agencies. Evaluation at the program's midpoint showed a need to be more selective in recruiting  and to spend more time on job development--changes that were made. As a result of the program, 82 clients were placed in jobs, one-fourth as electricians. Recommendations were made to: (1) tailor the program for each target group; (2) incorporate appropriate intake assessment; (3) make scheduling flexible; (4) allow lead time for job development (which became more difficult as the economy declined); (5) make use of networking; and (6) find creative means of transportation for clients. Products developed by the project include manuals for managers and clients, several brochures, a poster, and a 10-minute videotape now available in Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, and English.

The programs were held in two vocational schools that educate mentally handicapped students, aged 14-21, during daytime hours and adult handicapped persons during evening hours. Program goals were to: (1) prepare learning disabled students for career alternatives in the supermarket industry; (2) place them in unsubsidized employment; and (3) heighten public and corporate awareness of the value of handicapped persons as reliable, stable employees. The project included the set-up of two classroom shops to simulate supermarket operations, development of curriculum,  instruction, cooperative work experience for students, evaluation, and dissemination. Forty secondary students were trained in vocational classes that met 5 days per week for 2.5 hours each day. Three days per week in late afternoon, an additional 30 adult handicapped students took the program. External evaluation of the program showed that it had met its goals, and the program won many local and national awards.

From this assessment, training modules were developed. Some modules were generic and applicable to a variety of technical job categories; the remainder addressed employer-specific needs. To secure students for the generic technical training program, unemployed, underemployed, or existing industry employees whose skills  needed upgrading were evaluated on standardized tests stressing mathematics and verbal competency levels. Industry-specific modules were made available to area companies for use in training their existing labor force. Modules were selected by each participant company and employees were notified of scheduling. The promotional aspects of Project TEAM were directed toward the objective of increasing public interest in and regard for technical careers. Career awareness brochures were developed to educate the public, and particularly students, on technical occupations and opportunities. A speaker's bureau was formed and a video stressing this theme was produced. The project created materials, produced publicity, and enrolled a total of 672 students in technical literacy training. As a result,  the industries of the community have a greatly enhanced number of trained technical employees to consider for career opportunities.

Project goals were to facilitate collaborative vocational and technical training programs between educational institutions and private sector companies and to establish demonstration sites, manufacturing cells, an electronic communications network, and various training programs in high technology areas. Project directors began to implement their programs by establishing local advisory committees. Once these committees had provided a framework for meeting the training needs of manufacturing industries, project staff designed and mailed a needs assessment survey to manufacturers to determine training needs. After receiving survey data,  staff built an organizational structure responsive to the training needs, an outreach program that could deliver services through training facilities available in industry and educational institutions, and a telephone and computer network for information dissemination. Promotional and marketing materials were also developed. Ongoing evaluation solicited perceptions of the advisory committee, instructors, schools and institutions, students, and manufacturers. Overall, all responded positively. (Appendixes include maps, management and organization chart, survey instruments, lists of courses, and survey results.) (YLB)",

In summer 1989, 23 students were accepted into the pilot program. Courses included C programming, calculus and analytic geometry, computer graphics, and computer ethics. During their second semester, students participated in internships. The final program that was developed was a 2-year visualization computer graphics specialist program for an Associate in Applied Science degree. After the conclusion of the original 1-year grant, a summer extension was funded. During summer 1990, 10 students participated in summer internships. Four of them worked together on a project for Motorola, a  corporate partner of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. These students created a program to convert data from an electromagnetic field created by a dipole in free space into images. Thirteen students also attended the SIGGRAPH convention. The quality of the program was demonstrated by success in job placement. Two organizations hired additional scientific visualization specialists just months after hiring a first. The greatest concern of the program was recruitment of new students. (An attached article describes students' experiences in the program.) (YLB)",

An advisory committee for each program area developed a list of entry-level competencies and reviewed and revised curricula to meet industry needs. The Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) process was used to develop courses in plastic injection molding operations, equipment maintenance helper skills, machine shop fundamentals, and computer numerical control. Support services included counseling and job  placement assistance. Of 144 students enrolled in CAREER, 64 percent successfully completed training. The CIPP (Context-Input-Process-Product) Evaluation Model was used for formative and summative evaluation. Sources for evaluation information were project data and semistructured interviews with faculty, staff, and students. The overall success of the program was illustrated by the average external evaluation scores of project components on a scale of 1 to 5 on which a score of 5 was the highest. Component scores were as follows: curriculum review and development--5.0; assessment and counseling--4.6; instructional delivery--5.0; and follow-up services--2.6.

        "description":"A study sought to determine what factors and events have influenced the occupational behavior patterns of 1977-1978 Pennsylvania home economics education graduates. The study examined how women graduates of the traditionally female field of home economics education have experienced labor force participation over the past 10 years. Home economics education has suffered the largest decline and has the largest percentage of females within the educational field. As a result, the difficulty in recruiting qualified home economics teachers in Pennsylvania may result in program elimination. Using triangulation of methodologies, archival information, document questionnaires, and interviews, data were analyzed to identify occupational influences. Data were examined in three phases: (1) the  transition of the Pennsylvania public educational system; (2) the transition of the Pennsylvania home economics education field; and (3) the occupational behavior patterns of Pennsylvania home economics graduates. An examination of phase one and two data, collected from archives and an open-ended survey, revealed a decline in enrollments, programs, and numbers of teachers teaching during this time period. Phase three data were collected from a mailed follow-up survey with an overall response rate of 56.9%. Among the respondents, 69% lived in Pennsylvania and were included in the final sample (N=128). Several factors were found to have influenced behavioral patterns: marital status, education, family status, age, the oversupply of graduates in 1978, the 1982 recession, deteriorating  statewide economy, and loss of state leadership in home economics education.

        "description":"To improve basic skills instructor training in North Carolina's 58 community colleges, the Department of Community Colleges funded a 3-year Adult Basic Skills Training Project. It was designed to develop a cadre of local trainers who could meet the training and development needs of basic skills instructors at each community college. Adult basic education instructors from all the community colleges were selected to participate in five regional workshops and three summer institutes. Seventy-one instructor trainer competencies were identified. Competency training was based on Kolb's experiential learning theory. Participants who completed the 165 hours of instruction represented by the institutes and workshops spaced over a 30-month period would receive a certificate as a Resource  Specialist in Basic Skills Instructor Training. The first three workshops and two summer institutes offered instruction in interpersonal communication skills, assessment strategies, methods and materials, reading comprehension, and instructional management. Evaluations indicated that participants viewed the information as useful and colleges were incorporating the instructor trainer role in their local staff development plan. Attached tables provide: (1) data about workshop participants; (2) indicators of competence; and (3) participants' ratings of the program's usefulness. (YLB)",

After 4 years of elementary school with the same teacher, they enter secondary school, and after 4 years there, Soviet children earn what might be called a partial secondary certificate. They may then leave school at age 14 or 15. If a student chooses to attend a vocational school or higher-level technical school, the training lasts for 3 years with required on-the-job training. A student may also choose to continue in secondary school for 3 years and then study in a vocational school for 1 year of job-related vocational training or in an institute or university for 5 years. Teachers are prepared in pedagogical institutes. The United States can learn a great deal from the Russian educational system with regard to its emphasis  on culture and its close working relationship with local industry. The Soviet system could learn from the United States' experience in demonstrating the practical use of science and mathematics and providing students with access to such tools as computers. (YLB)",

Millions of dollars have been and will be spent to renovate industrial arts facilities and laboratories. Four Colorado middle schools have exemplary technology education programs. The Eagle Crest Technology Education Laboratory is used for both middle and high school courses. Through modular learning techniques, instructors focus on student outcomes as a necessary component of each module. Eagle Crest programs offer students analytical thinking skills, arts and humanities, citizenship skills, communication skills, environmental awareness, family living skills, health awareness, mathematical skills, science and technology, knowledge, and work skills. Delta County Schools have four model middle  school technology education laboratories that provide a positive example to statewide administrators. This program provides students an opportunity to explore the world of technology and how it affects their lives. Boltz Junior High School has provided leadership on the transition to technology education. Erie Middle and Senior Schools have adopted the Lab 2000 philosophy, a process ensuring proper in-service teacher education. Wood shops are being replaced in all four programs with computer-intensive laboratories where students can experiment with the modern technological systems of communication, transportation, design, and manufacturing. Students apply the knowledge they gain to computer-simulated and real products they design, test, and produce. (Descriptions and diagrams of  laboratory facilities are included for most programs.)

Those testifying from the smaller businesses noted the high turnover in workers and their inability to find high quality employees, whereas those from larger businesses described the programs they have developed to train their work force. A veteran high school teacher recommended that the entire  school system be reconfigured out of its traditional factory mold, and a community college official described the programs the college is developing with employers to train or retrain their workers.

Format and contents of the tables follow an established pattern to maintain comparability between years. A survey was sent during July 1990 to 143 institutions that had responded  to previous surveys, were new NUCEA members, or had a professional member of the Independent Study Division. During August, follow-up letters and telephone calls were made to all nonresponding institutions and to those whose survey responses were markedly changed from before.

The High Technology Center offered adults training in one of five electronically-based fields: microprocessor maintenance and repair, computer-aided drafting, instrumentation and control, automated manufacturing/robotics, and computer numeric control machining. These courses were taught on an open-entry and self-paced instruction basis and completion time varied considerably. Tuition assistance was available for those who did not qualify for other types of federal funding. All students were  tested to determine their level of proficiency in mathematics and reading, and a pretechnology laboratory was established for those needing review. Partnerships with industry allowed professional input to curriculum and short-term training internships for selected students. A job bank was established and resume/job search seminars were conducted. All goals of the project were met or are being met as scheduled. More than 400 persons were served during the 18-month period. More than 85 percent of the 38 completers were placed in technology positions in industry. (Ten appendixes to this report include information on the integrated learning system; statistical summaries of scores on Tests of Adult Basic Education; information on lab assignment, the internship program, and placement;  recruitment information by age, sex, race, and education level; a third-party evaluation report; and a financial status report.)

        "author":["Berns, Robert G."],
        "description":"A study explored the relationship between job satisfaction and teacher turnover of practicing and former vocational education teachers in Northwest Ohio. Factor analysis, discriminant analysis, and an instrument with 38 job satisfaction indicator statements were used to determine these relationships. A total of 745 of 1,025 practicing teachers and 116 of 381 former teachers responded. The practicing teachers, retired teachers, and former teachers who left for reasons other than retirement generally expressed job satisfaction. Each group disagreed with certain job satisfaction indicator statements. The factor analysis resulted in nine factors being identified: public perceptions, school support, self-perception, expectations, job satisfaction, job challenge, job effectiveness,  effort, and status. Differences were found between former teachers who retired and former teachers who left their teaching positions for reasons other than retirement. Administrators may have an important effect on whether a teacher continues in that teaching position. The discriminant analysis classified practicing teachers according to whether or not they remain in teaching until retirement and resulted in a misclassification probability of 12.5%. Comparing self-report data in career plans of practicing teachers with the data from the classification procedure, differences emerged. The job satisfaction instrument should determine whether a teacher continues in that position rather than relying on self-report. Six references and nine detailed statistical tables (21 pages) are provided.  (NLA)",

        "description":"A study determined the effectiveness of computer-aided drafting (CAD) and standard drafting instruction on the ability of students with differing visual-haptic perceptual styles to solve orthographic projection problems. A 2x2x2 factorial design was chosen to compare two levels of perceptual style with two levels of treatment and two levels of prior drafting experience. Activities were administration of the Successive Perception I test to determine visual-haptic style; administration of a questionnaire regarding prior drafting experience; provision of CAD instruction to the experimental group and traditional instruction to the control group; administration of the direct measure of orthographic projection ability; and collection of plate grades. The sample consisted of 188  beginning drafting students at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Three-way univariate analyses of covariance were used to test the hypotheses. The lack of significant differences between student scores on plate grades or the unit exam grades indicated that either instructional method could be used with equal success, visual and nonvisual students benefited equally from drafting instruction, and prior drafting experience did not ensure better skills in solving orthographic projection problems. Findings implied that visual-haptic perceptual style may not affect ability to solve orthographic projection problems. (15 references) (YLB)",

        "description":"Among the most important needs of changing economies is the need to respond to technological changes, economic restructuring, and labor market changes. Although formal vocational training schools do not usually respond well to changing economic circumstances, nonformal and proprietary or private institutions usually are highly responsive to the economy and labor market. Public vocational training should become more responsive to changes; five suggestions are given that could help the system respond. Some issues still to be resolved about the role of public vocational education include the following: How can the public sector promote training within enterprises? How can mass retraining be made effective? What role can training play in channeling women into nontraditional  occupations? Should proprietary training be directed and controlled? What can existing training institutions offer to the informal sector in developing countries? and How should traditional apprenticeship be encouraged? The International Labour Office can play a role in helping vocational education systems to become more responsive through its some 140 projects throughout the world in subjects such as instructor training, development of modular training, and development of apprenticeship and by providing advice on retraining, management development, and entrepreneurship.

The target population for the study was all agricultural science and technology teachers in vocational programs during the 1988-89 school year (64 teachers). Through persistence of the researcher, a 100 percent return rate was achieved in teacher response to a questionnaire about their perceptions of the role of state and local supervisor in terms of the degree of authority. The teachers rated the state supervisor as currently having the greatest authority in directing improvement of instruction activities, followed by research and evaluation activities, administration, and public relations. They rated local  supervisors' degree of authority as highest in the area of public relations. The teachers rated improvement of instructional activities as having the highest degree of authority by state supervisors in the future, followed by research and evaluation activities. They expected the local supervisor to have the highest degree of authority in public relations activities. The study concluded that the teachers perceived the local supervisors as having more authority, both current and expected, than the state supervisors. This perception could continue to handicap the state supervisor in bringing about innovative programs in Utah. (17 references) (KC)",

A predetermined sample size was established in order to infer the study's results for the entire state. The Tennessee Secondary Students' Employment Survey resulted in usable responses from a total of 1,980 students (54%) and 1,056 parents (31%). Some of the findings of the study were as follows: (1) in general, both parents and students had positive attitudes about students' part-time employment; (2) both parents and students felt that student employment helped students to manage their money and time,  make realistic career decisions, and learn what employers want; (3) most parents thought that student employment should be limited to 20 hours or fewer during the school year, but students did not; (4) students did not think working more hours would hurt their grades, but parents thought more than 20 hours per week would have a negative effect on students' grades; (5) students who worked in cooperative education had more positive attitudes and earned more money than those who did not; (6) significant differences were found between students' and parents' attitudes for coop and non-coop students and for rural and urban students; and (7) working students contributed more than 14 million dollars in state and local taxes in Tennessee.

Workshop objectives included identifying high priority needs and problems the teachers have in common and encouraging involvement from all levels of the VTIT teacher population. Workshop planning began in the fall. Between October and May, teachers from across Indiana attended four or five planning sessions on Saturdays. The workshop coordination staff provided the committees forms to record the proceedings of the meetings. In May, announcements of the &quot;teacher-planned&quot; workshops were sent to vocational administrators and teachers on the mailing list. Each workshop had a chairman,  co-chairman and chief recorder, as well as presenters. Minutes were compiled and made into a set of workshop proceedings for distribution afterwards. Through workshop participation, teachers could earn graduate or undergraduate college credit. Workshops were evaluated by the teachers participating in them. During the summer of 1990, 126 teachers participated in the workshops, and 82 percent of them answered questionnaires. Participants rated the workshops as very effective and expressed positive attitudes about all phases of the process and the workshops. Teachers suggested involvement of business/industry representatives on future workshop planning committees. (6 tables) (KC)",

Current recommendations include the Holmes Group and the Carnegie Commission proposals for restructuring teacher education. These proposals emphasize strategies for improving the quality of teachers, teaching, and the teaching profession. Three alternative models for the delivery of vocational teacher education identify their relationship to the goals of educational reform: (1) a restricted baccalaureate model; (2) a post-baccalaureate model; and (3) a field-based model for recruiting and inducting nontraditional vocational teachers.  Several activities must support the three models of delivery to meet the challenges of reform: (1) creation of a vocational education and teacher education leadership development institute; (2) active recruitment, preparation, and support of minorities; and (3) ensuring that all tenured vocational education teachers meet minimum requirements. Further research activities include: (1) creating a national commission to investigate alternative delivery models; (2) updating the vocational education knowledge base; and (3) exploring the feasibility of differentiated staffing pattern for vocational education teachers.

Data were collected through focus group sessions, field observations, and interviews with the teachers, principals, vocational directors, other teachers, and students. A total of 1,777 detractors were identified. For both groups of teachers the most important category of detractors is students, followed by the educational system. Alternatively certified teachers' detractors were higher than expected in the areas of curriculum, pedagogy, peers, students, and system, whereas detractors for those certified in teacher education were higher than expected for the community, internal, and program categories.

The framework, called the Teacher Proximity Continuum, has proved useful in analysis of negative influences, positive influences, significant events, and assistance provided to teachers. Based on functional distance from the teacher, the continuum has been used to classify over 5,000 events and influences up to this point and appears to hold great promise for utility in continuing analysis. Two samples of beginning vocational teachers participated in the study, 12 first-year teachers and 13 third-year teachers. Data for the analysis were collected from the teachers  for a year using nominal group technique, interviews, and daily logs. A total of 281 NGT problem statements and 1,777 daily log negative influences were identified. The grouping system that emerged was based on the functional proximity to the teacher. Categories or domains of interest were then developed. The Teacher Proximity Continuum consists of eight domains at five levels of functional distance from the teacher. The five distance levels are personal characteristics, professional skills, interpersonal relationships, educational system, and extra system (outside educational system boundaries). The domains are internal, pedagogy, curriculum, program, peer, student, system, and community. The model was valid for the purpose for which it was used, reliable, and inclusive of the events  analyzed. (Five references and a figure describing the Teacher Proximity Continuum are included.)

One teacher (Mary) entered the profession through a traditional teacher education program in marketing education. The other (Jake) obtained certification based on extensive experience in marketing and a degree in business administration. The case studies were based on: (1) a series of six semistructured interviews conducted over the first 2 years of both teachers' careers; (2) a collection of tape-recorded daily logs for the first year; and (3) a battery of personality, job satisfaction, stress, demographic, and situational surveys. Both worked in similar environments, and each was the only marketing teacher in the school.  Mary seemed to have a better orientation to her job. She also had people volunteering to assist her, whereas Jake had to seek assistance. Although both experienced a successful first year, Mary felt that her third year in teaching would be her last. Teaching was a life goal for Jake, and he spent a long time reaching that goal. Mary decided on a teaching career late in college. Mary graduated from a program with high standards. Jake had no preconceived expectations. Mary simply experienced early burnout. (20 references) (Author/YLB)",

        "description":"In order to remain competitive, a new economic system requires employees to be better educated, be more creative, work in teams, solve problems, make decisions, and improve and upgrade skills and education. As technology advances and companies push employees to assume more responsibility, the traditional vocational system will be in the spotlight. It will be replaced by a system responsive to changing work force and workplace needs. One way to help build a more competitive work force is to strengthen the school-to-work connection. A better system for preparing noncollege-bound youth to enter the work force is necessary for a flexible system. There are several options for students in high schools and two-year colleges for combining school and work. The first is expanding  apprenticeship programs in some form. Efforts to create part-time apprenticeships for high school students have been successful. Work-based learning combines proficiency-based classroom instruction and workplace experience for secondary and postsecondary students. The second approach to strengthening the transition is Tech Prep, which fosters lifelong learning by combining academic and vocational courses. The new Perkins Act provides an education program leading to a 2-year associate degree or certificate, which offers links between secondary schools and postsecondary institutions. The third approach for using work as part of the learning experience is through the use of school-based enterprises (SBE). SBEs are school-sponsored activities that engage students in providing services or  producing goods that improve young people's potential. Business partnerships play an active part of the reform of the educational system to develop young people's potential. Also necessary are the establishment of new relationships between secondary and postsecondary educators and between academic and vocational educators. (NLA)",

        "description":"This paper explores, from two perspectives, the potential contribution of U.S. occupational information systems and other related programs to human resources development (HRD) in other countries, particularly in developing countries. The first perspective arises from initial and subsequent research on occupational information systems design and use in the United States. The second arises from work within the international development community and the United Nations Development Program in particular. The paper: (1) outlines the context for HRD in developing countries, documenting policy and planning problems; (2) discusses the need to improve diagnostic and analytical capabilities, the critical role played by information in reducing the levels of uncertainty encountered in HRD  policy formulation, and the importance of seeking proactive rather than merely reactive solutions; (3) defines occupational information in the context of HRD, specifically within the broader framework of economic and labor market information as a key element in HRD strategies, and reviews recent efforts to organize HRD information flow in the world; (4) assesses the relevance, scope, structure, and technical relevance of the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee/State Occupational Information Coordinating Committee (NOICC/SOICC) network to development assistance efforts in HRD; and (5) presents conclusions and recommendations for further consideration by NOICC, the development community, and countries where the NOICC/SOICC model may be relevant.

The 10th-grade \"Building Your Future\" seminar has 10 sessions, which include self-assessment, communication skills, career and postsecondary institution research reports, adult development, life planning, and decision making. \"A Passport to My Future\" (11th grade), the experiential component, provides a structure that encourages students to visit at least one  employer and one postsecondary institution and participate in job shadowing. Students in the program must identify a sponsor who works with them and provides transportation. The 12th-grade \"Transitions Seminar\" teaches life skills and includes sessions on budgeting, citizenship, wellness, resumes, interviewing skills, and community resources. Each sessions consists of some or all of these components: objective; description; materials required; instructions; homework assignment; references; and handouts.

What constitutes a &quot;coherent sequence of courses&quot; required by the Perkins amendments of  federally funded programs? How can districts give priority to sites that serve the highest concentrations of special population members and that programs be &quot;of such size, scope, and quality as to be effective&quot;? What additional state or federal policies should be developed to govern programs in area vocational schools? What should states require in local applications, in addition to the requirements embodied in the Perkins Amendments? What should federal or state policy require in the timing of reforms? What steps can policy-makers take to prevent integrated programs from being resegregated from other high school programs?

A preliminary issue is whether federal policy makers or the states should establish further definitions of and restrictions on what constitutes tech prep (articulated secondary-postsecondary technical preparation programs). Assuming substantial state participation in defining policies related to tech prep, the next issue is the relationship between the secondary and the postsecondary state agencies. Another issue is the types of approaches to or models of tech prep appropriate for federal funding. Still other issues include whether states should allocate funds for tech prep by a competitive process or by formula; the kind of process states should establish to  set state policies and develop state plans; fields of study that should qualify for tech prep programs; and whether there should be limitations on the ages of postsecondary students supported by tech prep funds. Other issues are the practices federal and state officials should encourage to ensure that as many students as possible complete tech-prep programs; steps they can take to ensure that tech prep programs are well connected to other programs in both secondary and postsecondary institutions; requirements in local applications; and the type of relationship between tech prep programs and efforts to integrate academic and vocational education under basic state grants.

Each of the three UAW Joint Funds programs (Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler) offers a wide array of special programs to active and inactive workers. Study data were collected through interviews with college presidents and program representatives, site visits, and reviews of case studies. Information was received from eight community colleges in Illinois and Michigan that had worked closely with the Joint Funds for the past 3 years. The study found that the UAW Joint Funds programs have extended a new model for industrial relations that emphasizes concern for human resource  development. The existence of the Joint Funds has enhanced the direct involvement of the community colleges in providing customized training programs and courses. The varied programs provided in the plants also directly reflect and support the broad mission of the community colleges. However, the colleges' broader view of educational planning operated in only a limited way in the programs. The short-term needs or timetables of the programs sometimes conflicted with the community colleges' ability to respond. Little research exists with which to evaluate the programs. Recommendations were made for improving the accountability of the programs. (KC)",

These individuals were dislocated workers who had terminated from a subgrantee's program during Program Year 1985. Site visits to 56 subgrantee organizations were undertaken. Findings showed that Ohio dislocated workers suffered considerable labor market distress even after training. About two of three dislocated workers were male; Blacks were disproportionately represented; median age was 39; and about two of three held jobs in the manufacturing sector prior to dislocation. Across subgrantee types, private business programs served  an older clientele, and labor organizations served a younger group. Job search assistance was the most common service provided. Clients were highly satisfied with programs and services. Client satisfaction was similar across subgrantee types. About five of six workers obtained a job after Title III program termination. The wage rates of jobs held after program termination were generally quite low relative to prior wages. Among subgrantee types, labor organizations had the best outcomes. Recommendations to JTP-Ohio were made. (Survey instruments are appended. The document includes 28 tables and 9 references.) (YLB)",

The model was estimated empirically with data from a national survey of public or nonprofit institutions that offer such education, conducted in spring 1987. The survey involved 432 institutions and 3,330 students. Data were gathered in regard to students' choice of type of institution, program of study, part- or full-time status, type of degree, intention to compete, grades earned, education and training background, previous and current work experience, tuition and cost issues, institutional placement rate, location, and student characteristics. The model was estimated using ordinary least squares regression analysis for the following choices: enrolled in a  community/junior college program; enrolled in a technical institute; enrolled in a business and office program; enrolled in a trade and industrial program; enrolled part time; working toward a vocational certificate; and current grade point average. The findings from the various choice-making models demonstrate many systematic relationships between students' educational backgrounds or motivating influences and their choices. The models suggest that the instruction at vocational-technical institutes differs from either community/junior colleges or university/college programs. The findings seem to substantiate the assumed behavior of seeking information and making rational choices. The findings of the study support the suggested model of choice-making behavior to the extent that the data  adequately represent such behavior. Additional research and data collection need to be done to improve understanding of choice-making behavior. (The questionnaire is appended.) (KC)",

At independence, in 1960, unification and economic development were necessary to galvanize the country's direction. Control and domination of the economy by foreigners deprived the country of the development of an indigenous labor force. In addition, the education system was not responsive to the country's needs. Changes in the world economy, technology, and politics required Nigerians to be competitive. Nigeria established five efforts to train indigenous workers. The Industrial Training Fund promoted the acquisition of skills. The National Policy on Education stipulated the definitions, aims, and objectives of education. The National Board of Technical  Education advised the government on matters concerning education, determined labor needs, established standard skills needed and methods of student assessment, and distributed information. The Structural Adjustment Program increased agricultural production and revived Nigeria's economy. The National Policy on Science and Technology emphasized science and technology in order to transform resources into goods and services. Vocational-technical education and training need to have varying strategies. At the national level, strategies include: (1) quality programs; (2) delivery systems; (3) concept-oriented curriculum; (4) positive image; (5) teacher training; (6) national standards; (7) available funds; and (8) program enhancement. At the international level, strategies include: understanding  programs; interaction through conferences, visits, and workshops; and nation building. (16 references and 2 tables are included.)

        "description":"The structure of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) is built on the belief that flexibility and responsibility are necessary at the state and local levels to tailor successful programs. The purposely limited federal role allows state and local decisions to flourish. JTPA's private-public partnership has been a major public relations success with over 2 million persons placed at the highest wage rates ever experienced by a federally supported job training program. JTPA enters its sixth year of operations faced with a number of issues. National policy makers have raised the issue of whom should JTPA be serving. Although JTPA is serving those whom Congress intended, the federal government is suggesting other target populations. Both target groups and cost standards should be  local decisions based on an assessment of local priorities and resources. The issue of what services should be provided shows similar signs of federal encroachment. Again, state and local policymakers are better equipped to judge community needs. The states understand the performance standards system, but improved technical assistance is needed. Better coordination with other programs is another goal. State and local councils should expand their role in coordinating all employment and training programs. (YLB)",

Data were collected in evaluations of welfare employment initiatives in San Diego, Baltimore, and several counties in Virginia. Program participation was required for different portions of the AFDC caseload. Eligible applicants and recipients (primarily female) were randomly assigned to experimental groups, which received program services, or to control groups, which did not. Data were collected using AFDC payments and Unemployment Insurance earnings records. With few exceptions, employment and earnings impacts were consistently smaller than average for the welfare  applicants and recipients who had the best work records and the least prior welfare experience. The impacts were usually larger for more dependent individuals, although not for the cases that were the most dependent. Programs had less consistent impacts on subgroups defined by characteristics such as marital status and educational level. The outcome measures examined were not valid indicators of program performance. Neither job entries nor cases off welfare were a satisfactory predictor of the changes in employment, earnings, and welfare receipt achieved by the programs studied. (20 references) (YLB)",

The Summer Youth Employment Program enhances the basic educational skills of youth, encourages school completion for enrollment in supplementary or alternative school programs, and provides eligible youth with exposure to the work world. A second amendment requires that a service delivery area assess the reading and mathematics skill levels of eligible participants and expend funds for basic and remedial education. Service delivery areas establish written program goals, including improvement in school retention and completion, academic performance, employability skills, and coordination with community service  organizations. Some principles of actions are required to develop a model JTPA summer program: (1) build on already established efforts; (2) start small; (3) take a problem-solving approach; (4) turn programs into year-round endeavors; (4) move toward individual, self-paced instruction; (5) actively seek help; and (6) expect change.

        "description":"Elements of the \"American dream\" are adequate housing, education for one's children, and a secure retirement. Economic growth has long been seen as a way to realize the dream. Recent data indicate that achieving the dream and succeeding in the labor market have become more difficult due to sluggish productivity growth, increased competition from abroad, technological change, and shifts in attitudes and expectations about roles of minorities and women. Recognition of the elements of social scarcity should help in lowering expectations that cannot be fully realized by everyone. A review and critique of U.S. economic growth shows that growth and change impose costs and benefits on individuals, communities, and society. Costs are borne by displaced workers and depressed labor  markets, whereas benefits are more widely diffused in the form of less expensive products. To add value that can justify rising living standards, the quality of inputs must be raised, primarily labor inputs via better education. Basic and recurrent elements of education have increasingly become the foundation for workers' employment security, which in turn requires adaptability to changing work requirements. Work improvements may increasingly take the form of individualized situations that have a positive impact on productivity and economic growth. (25 references) (YLB)",

        "description":"Competitiveness is a function of a nation's resources and how effectively those resources are used relative to that nation's competitors. The people of a nation, with their knowledge, skills, and attitudes, determine how effectively technology, capital, and trade will be used to the nation's competitive advantage. The competitive challenge to the human resources of the United States requires that the nation recognize its strengths and make them stronger, recognize its weaknesses and act together to address them. A crucial weakness that impedes the country's ability to address these and other competitiveness problems is the lack of structures through which the key economic actors in U.S. society--industry, labor, and government--can come together and systematically address the  problems shared by all. To confront this systemic problem, the Commission on Industrial Competitiveness recommends that the federal advisory committees affiliated with the Departments of Commerce, Labor, and Treasury, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative be evaluated and revised to serve as a possible basis for the development of such consensus-building structures. Three other areas are pivotal to addressing the competitive challenge to U.S. human resources: (1) the quality of human resources must be enhanced; (2) the rapid redeployment of labor in the economy must be made possible; and (3) the most effective use of human resources must be made.

        "description":"A case study of machine vision was conducted to identify and analyze the employment effects of high technology in general. (Machine vision is the automatic acquisition and analysis of an image to obtain desired information for use in controlling an industrial activity, such as the visual sensor system that gives eyes to a robot.) Machine vision as a new industry has taken off on an exponential rise. The total employment in the machine vision industry has been growing rapidly and will continue to increase. A large portion of the jobs have been taken by highly trained technical people. However, as the process becomes more standardized, blue-collar workers with additional training will be able to fill some of the jobs. The United States leads the world in the development of machine  vision. It is expected that this industry may help lessen the number of imports coming into the United States and the amount of labor-intensive manufacturing leaving the country. The near-term prospects for the machine vision industry require the identification of markets with sufficient volume of applications and a process technology to produce the vision systems at a low enough cost to attract users and generate profits in the industry.

A study used data from the January 1984 Displaced Worker Survey, a supplement to the Current Population Survey, which analyzed patterns of job displacement, the post-displacement reemployment, and earnings experience of displaced workers. The study sample was limited to 9.5 million workers 21 to 60 years of age, formally employed in full-time jobs. Using econometric models of reemployment and post-displacement earnings, the study found the following: (1) displacement is widespread; (2) displacement rates are lowest in the Northeast and highest in the Midwest; (3) Black and Hispanic workers are overrepresented among displaced workers, whereas women are underrepresented; (4)  displaced workers tend to be younger and have less formal education; (5) two-thirds of workers displaced in 1979 were reemployed by 1984; (6) displaced workers with more formal education are more likely to return to full-time employment; (7) reemployment earnings nearly match those on the old job; (8) a minority of displaced workers experience a large reduction in earnings capacity; (9) more educated workers have smaller earnings losses; (10) displacement results in loss of group health insurance coverage; and (11) most displaced workers are young but 15.9 percent are 50 years or older. There is a need for labor market assistance programs, targeted on the minority of displaced workers likely to face reemployment difficulty and reduced earnings potential unless assisted.

        "description":"A study investigated aspects of the problem of at-risk youth aged 9-15 in the public schools. Focuses were compulsory attendance education; school programs; demographics; developmental characteristics; patterns of behavior leading to academic success or failure; academic achievement; and school/community efforts. Evidence showed that compulsory education varied by state. Existing policy and practice emphasized a standardized curriculum that focused on promotion of college attendance. Disadvantaged youth lived in circumstances that tended to promote family histories of poverty, illiteracy, and unemployment. Research data indicated that the overall quality of the family's life-style best explained why some children succeeded in school. The circumstances for families of low  achieving children was \"depressing.\" At-risk students had an even lower level of academic achievement in reading, writing, and mathematics than the generally low level among youth in the United States. The usual approach taken by public schools to handle at-risk students was to reinforce the standard curriculum. Specific recommendations were restructuring public schools; implementing a differentiated public school curriculum; improving competencies in basic skills; providing occupation and career orientation programs; establishing networks of educational and social welfare programs; broadening job opportunities for disadvantaged youth; and promoting interest in lifelong learning among disadvantaged youth.

The paper begins with a description of the dropout problem in the United States, noting that although the dropout rate has remained steady at about 25 percent for the past 3 decades, the dropout rate has become a problem recently because of the increase in high technology jobs and a need for people with more skills in the labor force. The paper focuses on dropouts first because of the relatively higher incidence of unemployment among high school dropouts as compared with high school graduates. Next comes a discussion of how to identify at-risk  students still in school and how to develop programs that meet the needs of these special populations. The paper then outlines the educational legislation that pertains to the needs of the groups, with a particular interest in whether the legislation reaches youth at risk, aged 9-15. The Education Consolidation and Improvement Act is reviewed. Finally, the paper evaluates model programs to identify local efforts to meet the needs of these at-risk youth. Examples show what has been tried and what has been successful. The report concludes with recommendations for programs and legislation to benefit the at-risk group. The document includes 149 references and appendices detailing limitations of the survey of Chapter I coordinators and providing descriptions of model programs. (KC)",

        "description":"A study examined the issue of contracting out traditional government services and its effect on government employees. It found that local governments contract out for two principal reasons: to cut the cost of providing services and to employ specialized skills and resources unavailable within the government. Findings from a review of the privatization literature were that: (1) only about 5-10 percent of public employees affected by contracting out were laid off; (2) public assistance payments to laid-off workers were very low; (3) private contractors paid lower wages and offered lower fringe benefits; (4) contracting out was not inherently harmful to minorities or women; and (5) contracting may have a slightly positive impact on the number of available jobs. Interviews with local  officials from 17 cities and counties generally confirmed these findings and indicated that very few workers were laid off as a result of contracting out and few cities had formal contracting out employment policies. Policy recommendations were as follows: (1) target new and expanded services for contracting out; (2) establish a \"no layoff\" policy; (3) reduce the government work force through attrition; (4) encourage government employees to form private companies to provide government services; (5) allow the city agency to compete in the bidding process; and (6) develop policies for aiding displaced public employees.

Increased international trade was found to have been associated with shifts in the occupational, industrial, and geographic distribution of jobs in the U.S. economy, but not with any significant change in total employment. Total employment was largely determined by macroeconomic monetary and fiscal policies. Projections of employment growth to 1990 under four different macroeconomic scenarios showed that an improvement in underlying macroeconomic conditions could restore more balanced job  creation across industries. If the federal budget deficit and the trade deficit were not reduced, the decline in manufacturing and agriculture relative to services would continue to be aggravated, even with strong economic growth. As for the program in place for treating dislocated workers, Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act reached only about a fifth of those who seemed to need it. Findings indicated that effective adjustment programs were needed to distribute the burden of change more fairly. (An executive summary and 24 references are provided.) (YLB)",

Findings indicated that even though economic changes were accelerating, worker mobility may have declined since the first half of the 1970s. Three factors that contributed to the decline were limited earnings payoffs associated with geographic migration, rising housing costs, and increased labor force participation of married  women. Displaced workers were much more likely to migrate than other workers. An analysis of government policies aimed at facilitating worker mobility led to three conclusions: (1) relocation assistance, although authorized by the Job Training Partnership Act and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act was not extensively used; (2) increased emphasis on experimental designs to evaluate program options is needed to develop an effective mobility strategy; and (3) programs operated under differing administrative and planning guidelines and did not form a consistent strategy.

        "description":"Youth labor market successes and problems have roots in young people's childhood experiences. The many components of basic skills and employability skills are acquired through the educational process. Each skill has its counterpart in the expected outcomes of young people's education. Data in labor market research can be interpreted as empirical estimates of basic and employability skills. These data can be evaluated to see how various dimensions of basic and employability skills affect young people's labor market experiences. Data suggest that youth who have diplomas have acquired more knowledge than dropouts. Only a few rough estimates of the numbers of young people with deficiencies in their educational backgrounds are available. The major reason for difficulties in attempting  to estimate the dimensions of the educational problem is the lack of agreement on a set of definitions for \"educational deficiencies.\" The literature indicates that the characteristics of young people's families, the schools they attend, the areas in which they live, and youth's own attributes operate separately and in combination to affect dropout status. Research shows that although the acquisition of basic skills has a payoff in the job market, the payoff to a diploma seems to be even greater. (61 endnotes) (YLB)",

        "description":"The Center for Remediation Design and Brandeis University (Massachusetts) conducted a series of telephone interviews to develop a manual of assessment for Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) youth programs. These interviews were conducted with youth planners in each service delivery area during August 1987. The goal of this project was to explore common practices, what JTPA programs are doing about basic skills assessment, and what the stress points and vital signs are. A total of 150 programs out of an original randomly selected sample of 205 participated. The report from the field is encouraging with regard to the advances made toward incorporating basic education skills and refining assessment in the absence of specific guidance or training. The assessment information  generated from these tests was used for a combination of purposes: (1) to appraise basic skills; (2) to diagnose where learning should begin; (3) for benchmarking purposes; and (4) as a posttest to certify attainment. The most common practice was the use of standardized tests for pre and post data collection; 92% of the sample administered standardized tests. The most common additional assessment strategy was the intake interview. When asked about issues or problems, all staff regarded the lack of staff training in assessment and instruction, motivation and lack of incentives for participants, attendance and retention, and lack of cooperation from the school system as real problems. (The survey and survey results are included. Part 1 addresses basic skills remediation in JTPA youth  programs and part 2 addresses JTPA assessments strategies: identifying issues and instruments. In addition, an appendix lists the 150 randomly selected programs used for this study.) (NLA)",

        "description":"Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) is a benefit paid to workers who lose their jobs in industries that face increasing competition from imported goods. TAA is supposed to offset political pressures for protectionist legislation, and it has been justified on grounds of equity and efficiency as well. Research on TAA shows that it has failed to aid many workers in adjusting to job losses in industries hurt by imports. More than 97 percent of the $4 billion spent on TAA from 1962 to 1986 went to pay cash benefits to workers unemployed from trade-affected firms. Retraining and relocation assistance accounted for less than 3 percent of TAA spending. The research suggests that TAA recipients had longer durations of unemployment than did comparable nonrecipients. A serious flaw in the  system is that there are long administrative delays in certifying a firm or industry for benefits. Some researchers have suggested that paying benefits in a lump sum rather than weekly would increase the chance that a worker would seek employment or training. However, it must be considered that there may be no other jobs available that pay as well, so employees prefer to wait and hope for recall. Taking new jobs may be made more attractive by providing wage subsidies or reemployment bonuses. Recent changes in the program have increased emphasis on job search and retraining. (KC)",

        "description":"A labor market-oriented study of the effects of internationalization provided background for National Commission for Employment Policy (NCEP) recommendations on ways to enhance the ability of the U.S. economy to compete in world markets. The analysis focuses on three major dimensions: (1) trade in goods and services; (2) immigrants (legal and illegal) and refugees; and (3) investment in physical and human capital. The first half of the 1980s was characterized by an expansive fiscal policy combined with a restrictive monetary policy. The resulting pattern of demand favored job growth in service and white collar jobs, often displacing workers in the manufacturing sector. Trade can be viewed as part of the solution of economic realignment. Research on immigrants and refugees  concentrated on empirical studies in specific local and regional labor markets. Factors such as time in the United States, knowledge of English, previous educational attainment, and the availability of family or ethnic group support affect the rate at which new arrivals enter the economic mainstream. An important characteristic of investment in the modern world is that it takes place across international boundaries. Investment in human capital is an international phenomenon, an important part of economic competitiveness. In order to remain competitive, the country's work force must be improved to increase productivity. Public and private resources should be allocated to education. Saving and investing is favored over borrowing and consuming, to help the economy work more equitably and  efficiently. However, the international dimension shortens the amount of lead time to respond.

Chapter 1 reviews the original purpose of the JTPA and introduces the investment portfolio management concept as an appropriate approach for management of JTPA programs. In chapter 2, the importance of an effective management process in achieving good results is discussed. Chapter 3 focuses on the elements of the local planning process, the relationship of planning decisions to the performance standards and local goals, and the linkage between planning decisions and contract specifications. Chapter 4 describes a  process, with examples, for defining performance expectations for individual activities and program components. Chapter 5 discusses some of the considerations that are involved in establishing a monitoring system and structure of rewards/sanctions that will guide and motivate performance in a direction responsive to the needs of the recipients and of employers. The final chapter summarizes the significant principles discussed in the previous chapters and provides suggestions for immediate action.

Some of the findings of the study are the following: (1) vocational graduates make up 36-48 percent of all secondary graduates, with women usually outnumbering men; (2) students from families of lowest socioeconomic status are overrepresented in the vocational curriculum compared to their proportion in the general population; (3) less severely handicapped  students are served by vocational education in proportion to their actual numbers; (4) about 42 percent of vocational graduates get first jobs related to their training; (5) the more credits earned in a vocational specialty and the higher the grades earned in that specialty, the greater the likelihood of getting and keeping a training-related job; (6) earnings advantages result to vocational graduates who develop a marketable skill and obtain a job related to that training; (7) participation in vocational education reduces the likelihood of students dropping out; and (8) gender differences are pronounced.

A study compared the literacy abilities of prisoners to those found in the adult general population. Additionally, the study compared male and female prisoner literacy abilities. Assessments were made on a profile of literacy abilities of prisoners, and comparisons were made with those found in the adult general population using a national survey instrument. Tasks were identified in three main dimensions: document literacy, prose literacy, and quantitative literacy. An interview questionnaire surveyed 97 male and 95 female New South Wales prisoners on both background and literacy and numeracy related tasks. Comparative data were outlined based on mean scores and  comparative percentages of correct responses on each item within the three literacy dimensions. Evidence presented strongly contradicts the prevailing views. On some of the literacy items, the prisoner samples actually performed better than the national survey counterparts. Generally, prisoners did as well as their national survey counterparts; findings indicated serious literacy problems that require an educational response, which is also true of the general community. Percentage differences between male and female prisoners appeared very small. (Appendices itemize correct responses and present literacy sample items. A list of 24 references is included.) (NLA)",

        "description":"This booklet is a collection of analyses and reflections by women who have worked with the Women's Secretariat of the Nicaraguan Association of Rural Workers (ATC) at the different stages of conception and implementation. &quot;Ending the Myth of the Weaker Sex&quot; (Ana Criquillon) provides the history of the women's program within the ATC. It identifies the need to incorporate women into agricultural jobs. Next, the article describes the three-stage project undertaken in 1983: a preliminary diagnosis that showed division of labor according to gender as the main obstacle confronting women; training of promoters through the organization of grassroots women's workshops; and a phase of action research. The article discusses the union's adoption of the resolutions that set forth women's  demands and incorporation of the demands in collective agreements. &quot;Linking Production and Reproduction: Popular Education in Action,&quot; based on an interview with Clara Murguialday, describes the publication, &quot;Vamos,&quot; developed for use in workshops on work norms or standards. These sections of &quot;Vamos&quot; are highlighted: understanding work norms; defining problems; and searching for solutions. Photographs and text from the publication are provided. &quot;Reflecting on the Process,&quot; based on an interview with Heliette Ehlers, addresses challenges facing the women's movement, lessons learned on how to organize women, and success in changing men's consciousness.

The CHOICES program offered weekly language activities for the children and gave mothers information about developing their children's reading readiness skills. The CHOICES program also provided: (1) access to various reading materials; (2) skill level assessment and referral to educational programs; (3) assistance with educational goal setting; (4) education in areas of parenting, job skills, basic reading; and (5) self-esteem activities. Activities were carried out by providing shelter libraries; conducting recruitment, assessment, and referral  activities; providing individualized instruction; and holding life skills seminars. Unique challenges were that (1) the number of clients and their children, their needs, and ages varied from daily; (2) finding space for an activity and equipment storage was difficult; (3) and tracking client progress and motivating them was challenging.

Subjects were 296 employees of a marketing division of a large telecommunication company. The readability of 420 passages from job and training materials was assessed by the Flesch Reading Ease index, which generated a value that was transformed to a grade equivalent score. The 153 arithmetic problems obtained from the materials were assigned a grade equivalent score. The literacy test was the Test of Adult Basic Education. Job performance measures were obtained for 96 subjects to evaluate the validity of the literacy test for the prediction of worker performance. Results indicated the reading scores for 90 percent of the workers were at or above the 11th-grade level; 56 percent of  the reading documents evaluated were at or above that level. Mathematics scores for 65 percent were at or above the ninth-grade level; 33 percent of the problems were at that level. The literacy test and a cognitive ability test predicted job performance with equal accuracy. Problems encountered in literacy research were identified, including dimensions of literacy as they relate to the workplace; measuring literacy skills of the workplace; and the level of mastery required to achieve proficiency on the job.

The major portion of the paper presents demographic, economic, and social perspectives on aging in China. It is noted that China remains a heavily rural society; that the current population target for the year 2000 is 1.2 billion; and that life expectancy in Shanghai and Beijing has reached 73 years. Economic and cultural reasons for high fertility and/or birth rates in rural areas are discussed. Filial responsibility and the implications for caregiving of China's one-child per couple policy are considered. The influence of Marxism regarding population control is examined,  the functioning of the pension system in China is discussed, and the formation and functioning of local gerontological organizations in China are described. A section on closing observations compares and contrasts the growth in urban areas of nuclear families and the increase in rural areas of the traditional Chinese extended family.

        "description":"Research attention on men who batter their female partners has focused on psychological and personality characteristics of the men. However, occupational status, educational attainment, and abuse history may have been confounded with the personality variables studied. This study made within-group and between-group comparisons of batterers and nonbatterers selected for \"good\" or \"poor\" psychosocial and demographic characteristics such as employment history, educational attainment, alcohol abuse status, and history of direct and witnessed abuse victimization. Subjects were 99 male batterers referred for spouse abuse abatement counseling (clinic-identified), 32 self-reported batterers (community-identified), and 71 nonviolent men. Within-group analyses for clinic- and  community-identified batterers showed that subjects with unfavorable background characteristics had higher Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) scores on aggression and negativism and lower scores on submissiveness and conformity. Comparing nonviolent subjects with either good or poor psychosocial histories revealed no significant differences. Between-group analyses suggest that when identified batterers with favorable premorbid psychosocial histories are compared with community-identified batterers and nonviolent controls, there is evidence of greater difficulty among batterers, particularly in areas related to mood regulation and sensitivity to rejection. However, compared to previous studies, it also appears that controlling for other variables including employment status,  alcohol abuse, and family-of-origin victimization experiences attenuates the differences observed between batterers and nonviolent controls.

        "description":"With the increasing threat of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), intensive educational programs are implemented and/or planned worldwide. It is usually assumed that providing information and generating concern leads to AIDS-preventive behaviors. Attitude theory and research in social psychology does not necessarily support this assumption. Studies suggest that individuals may use defensive information screening and/or denial strategies to deal with the anxiety that is produced by such information. Also, research indicates that effects on behavior are mediated by normative factors that support or oppose them. With regard to sexual beliefs and behaviors, family, peer group, and sexual partner(s) are important normative groups for adolescents and young adults. The present  investigation is aimed at measuring the relationship between these normative factors and AIDS-preventive behaviors in 274 college students in a small conservative town in the United States. Results indicated that, although knowledge level was high, a considerable proportion of the respondents were involved in risky behaviors. (Author)",

The third section lists symptoms of depression in the categories of expressions of feelings, such as sadness; personal attributes, such as the inability to make decisions; physical complaints, such as sleep problems; behavior  changes, such as heavy drinking; and talk of death or suicide. The final section provides advice on what to do if a teenager suspects his or her friend may be depressed. It is recommended that the teenager encourage the depressed friend to talk to a parent or teacher, or, if the depressed friend does not follow this advice, the teenager is encouraged to seek help from a trusted adult himself.

Patterns such as negative reciprocity, positive reciprocity, and coercion have been described and utilized as predictors of marital satisfaction and parent-child relations. This study examined the relationship between verbal family interaction patterns and reported child behavior problems. Subjects were 70 nonclinic families who participated in 10-minute videotaped family discussions as part of an extensive study of marital conflict. These discussions were encoded according to verbal content and classified on the basis of two systems view approaches--one a holistic descriptive method and the other a moment-to-moment analysis  of the interaction over time. Classification according to the holistic approach yielded several distinct patterns of positive and negative family interactions. These patterns included: couple positive reciprocity, family positive reciprocity, one person highly positive, couple negative reciprocity, family negative reciprocity, one person highly negative, child coercion, and parent coercion. The moment-to-moment time analysis also tested for the presence of coercion. Child coercion was then examined in relation to parent reports of behavior problems on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist. Child coercion patterns detected by either the holistic or the moment-to-moment method of research were found to be significantly related to externalizing behaviors and aggressive behavior problems in  children.

The school was located in a small town in an agricultural county whose population was predominantly black and of low socioeconomic status. The number of students varied from 52 to 48. One aim was to give students an opportunity to discover the relationship of education to their future success. Another aim was to develop decision making and critical thinking skills in these students. The last aim was to expose students to numerous career opportunities. Four interdisciplinary units which centered around the importance of education, decision making skills, critical thinking skills and career awareness were  developed. The project administrator obtained material; arranged initial and culminating experiences for each unit; evaluated each unit; led a teacher workshop; and supervised and maintained the project. The results of the practicum were positive. An analysis of the results indicated that students had more positive attitudes when there were hands-on opportunities. Students were allowed to work in small groups in order to have collaborative learning experiences. Teachers understood the requirements of other teachers and spaced their assignments. Following a calendar demanded preplanning, but it also gave focus for the entire time of the unit. Teachers enjoyed working together as a team and began, in addition, to plan small units of their own. The appendixes include survey and evaluation  forms. (25 references) (ABL)",

This longitudinal study examined persons' cognitions regarding early relationship interactions and/or observations which caused them to think about the viability of the relationship. The role of causal attributions in the dissolution of casual-dating relationships was explored and led to the development of the typology of casual-dating dissolution. This study was part of a longitudinal investigation of dating relationships undertaken at the University of Oklahoma (1982-83). Of the 88 relationships originally in the study, 74 were dissolved during the 6-month collection period. Subjects were 48 participants who completed termination questionnaires.  Results of the study led to the examination of a typology of casual-dating dissolution. This examination was guided by Kelley's (1979) theory of interdependence, and resulted in the discovery of three distinct types: independence break-ups, disposition break-ups, and relationship problem break-ups. These types were validated with information provided at intake (when the relationship was intact) and with information regarding the encounters between the subjects and their partners. The inclusion of types of break-ups in the study clarified an important question regarding alternatives in casual-dating stability: persons in disposition break-ups had a significantly lower assessment of their alternatives to the relationship.

        "description":"Psychologists and psychiatrists are regularly used during civil commitment and other hearings to prognosticate dangerousness for the courts. In this process, the judiciary has shown almost complete deference to the recommendations of forensic specialists despite a number of early studies that did not support a clinician's ability to predict violence. This study examined if the Cognitive Control Battery (CCB) can contribute to discrimination in a model that includes known predictor variables and if the CCB can discriminate violent juveniles based upon actual episodes of violence. A stepwise discriminant analysis was used on a calibration sample (N=175) of dangerous and non-dangerous juvenile inpatients. Forty-five demographic, psychosocial, and cognitive variables were employed.  The resulting statistical model was cross-validated on the remainder of the sample (N=175). Results indicated that 58.6% of the cross-validation sample was correctly classified. Moreover, the CCB demonstrated that dangerous youths processed aggressive/neutral stimuli differently than non-dangerous youths. Results did not suggest that cognition (or type of cognitive style) could be viewed as a cause of violence. Recent advances in cognitive psychology (e.g., the CCB) may assist policymakers, judges, and forensic clinicians to make more informed choices concerning dangerous juvenile inpatients. (ABL)",

        "description":"Research on belief perseverance has demonstrated that a belief persists to the extent that there are more explanations available to the believer to support the original belief than to support alternative beliefs. This study extends earlier work (Slusher, 1988) that demonstrated the role of explanation availability in mediating belief change. Introductory psychology students read causal or noncausal information indicating Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) cannot be spread by casual contact. Explanation availability and beliefs were assessed 3 weeks later, and subjects were given the opportunity to assist an AIDS charity to explore whether behaviors, in addition to beliefs, might be differentially affected by these distinct types of information. Results indicated causal  information affected beliefs and behavioral intentions. Explanation availability mediated information's effect on beliefs. This study has clear implications for those attempting to change beliefs, including those responsible for AIDS education: causal information is more effective than noncausal information in affecting both long-term beliefs and behavioral intentions. Specifically, this study suggests that causal information plays a significant role in altering explanation availability; altering beliefs that rest upon the support of those explanations; and affecting behavioral tendencies based upon those beliefs.

        "description":"The present study investigated factors influencing the decision of employees, who, faced with a facility relocation, either relocated to a new location or lost their current jobs. A large chemical company decided to close a research and development laboratory located in New England and to transfer employees to a laboratory located in the southwest. As such, this study investigated a facility relocation which led to a lateral transfer with relocation. Questionnaires were mailed to 81 employees after they made the decision, with 66 employees (81%) returning useable questionnaires; 47 had rejected the transfer offer. Results indicated that community tenure, perceptions of new job, and the perceived inconvenience of moving were important influences on the relocation decision. In  addition employees with non-working spouses, more positive perceptions on the new location, and greater job involvement were more likely to relocate. Contrary to expectations, neither employee demographics nor the number of children was related to the decision. The study had certain limitations: data were collected after employees had made the relocation decision; the small sample size limits the power to detect true relationships; and the subjects were highly educated professionals. Nonetheless, the study provides further insight into factors that influence relocation decisions. (ABL)",

        "description":"Hyperactive children appear to be at an increased risk for antisocial behavior in life. Follow-up studies using self-report and official criminal data have found that hyperactive children are more likely than controls to commit crimes, to be arrested for crimes, to be convicted of crimes, and to be diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder in their adolescent and adult years. This study examined the relationship between childhood hyperactivity and adult violent criminal behavior utilizing prospective, longitudinal data from a Danish birth cohort of 129 males. Hyperactivity was measured by teacher, parent and neurologist ratings of behavior completed when the subjects were 11-13 years old. Police records of violent criminal behavior were ascertained when the subjects were  20-22 years old. The results supported the view that hyperactivity in childhood predicts an increased risk of violent offending later in life. Subjects who were pervasively hyperactive (rated hyperactive by teacher, neurologist, and parent report) seemed especially prone to violent behavior, with over one-third showing a criminal arrest for violence by early adulthood. Previous research findings, taken together with the results of this study, suggest that very early central nervous system dysfunction may predispose individuals to hyperactive behavior, and that this behavior in turn may increase the likelihood that they will develop into adult violent offenders.

Information is being processed continually in support of our daily activities and interactions with others. For this reason, an individual's cognitive style determines much of what is called personality. It has been observed that behavior patterns associated with personality typologies often have a great deal in common with patterns identified as learning style, decision-making style, and social style. A review of five measures of cognitive style including the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the Learning Style Inventory, the Gregorc Style Delineator, the Decision Style Inventory, and Lifescripts suggested three underlying dimensions despite differences in the terminology and theoretical  bases of these instruments. The purpose of this study was to examine the conceptual similarity among five diverse measures of personality and cognitive style using factor analytic methods. The five measures were administered to college student and faculty subjects (N=143). Results of the analysis identified three underlying factors: a thinking/feeling dimension, an information-processing domain, and an attentional focus dimension. (43 references) (ABL)",

However, the volunteer turn-over rate is quite high, due to factors such as burnout. This study examined stressfulness in relationship to caller problems, as well as variables related to perceptions of stress. In this study self-efficacy was defined as \"efficacy strength,\" e.g., the crisis intervener's belief that she or he could respond to a specific caller problem. Crisis intervention volunteers (N=39) rated the stressfulness of 35 caller problems and indicated reasons for their ratings. Volunteer self-efficacy and demographics were also assessed. Results suggested that volunteers perceived problems as differentially stressful, with life-threatening problems  rated as most stressful. Volunteers varied in their efficacy for dealing with different types of problems, feeling least efficacious for problem callers (e.g., obscene callers). Males reported higher efficacy across all problems. Most commonly endorsed reasons for stress were knowledge and skill deficits and problem complexity. Future research should examine the relationship among efficacy, stress, problem type, gender, and experience for larger samples of crisis interveners from different agencies. (17 references) (ABL)",

        "description":"An important task for children is to acquire their culture's rules for emotional display. Accurate knowledge of display rules prescribing, for example, safe targets for anger or indelicate situations for excitement helps regulate expressive behavior and mediate the impact of emotional expression on the self and others. In this study, children's knowledge of affective display rules was investigated. A sample of 7-, 11-, and 15-year-old children (N=370) and one each of their parents responded to items representing display rules for emotional expression and control. Analyses indicated that display rule knowledge improved with age. There was also a greater perception of adult consensus about control than expression rules among parents and children, and children knew the adult  consensus for control rules earlier than for expression rules. Females knew expression rules better than males, but there was no difference in females' and males' knowledge of control rules. Knowledge of expression rules may emerge later than control rules because of the developmental pattern of related social-cognitive abilities and because adults may exert more pressures on children to control than to express emotion. Gender-related findings were consistent with societal expectations about expressive females and suggested males and females are equally encouraged to learn rules for controlling emotional displays.

        "description":"This study was conducted to examine systematic effects associated with the gender of the participant, the situation, and the interaction of gender of participant and situation for two personality characteristics, dominance and friendliness. Subjects were 24 women and 21 men recruited through a student publication at a university. Subjects were observed twice in each of three types of situations: with a familiar person of the same sex, with an unfamiliar person of the same sex, and with an unfamiliar person of the opposite sex. Observations by independent observers were collected using behavior counts and ratings. In addition, self-reports about dominance and friendliness in different situations were collected. The results indicated that both gender and familiarity of partner  influenced dominance and friendliness. Women were friendlier than men, particularly when they were interacting with same-sex individuals. Men were more dominant than women, particulary when with a same-sex friend. There was evidence of systematic errors in the self-reports, suggesting that men overestimate their degree of friendliness relative to women and that women overestimate their level of dominance relative to men.

        "description":"Because of the high incidence of divorce and increase in the proportion of births to unmarried women, more children are spending at least a portion of childhood living with only one parent. This study uses data from the 1984 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), to address the relationship between family structure and the economic well-being of children. Results suggest that family income available to children drops by 37 percent immediately following loss of a father. The economic differences between children who experience family disruption and those who do not result from two factors: the economic hardship brought on by a father's departure and the fact that economic disadvantage tends to precede family disruption. In addition, children who  experienced a marital disruption were better off after the disruption than those who were in one-parent families throughout the period. Similarly, children whose mothers were observed to remarry or reconcile were better off while they lived in single parent families than children who lived with their mother only throughout the panel.

The survey looked at use and user characteristics. Indicators of use included abuse, familiarity with others who use, and ease of access. User characteristics included age of first drink, trouble with the law, future aspirations, use and availability in the home and role of the school. The results found that alcohol was the number one drug of abuse, and that there was a greater attitudinal tolerance for this drug among students and parents. Patterns of usage and age of onset indicated that prevention programs with a &quot;don't start&quot; message must begin well before the sixth grade. Also, students  appeared to have an inflated belief regarding the extent of drug use by peers, and peer influences increased with age. Sources of influence included home, school and especially the media. Also, many youths were aware of substance abuse problems among family and friends. (90 tables) (LLL)",

        "description":"Over the past decade, there has developed a steadily growing literature on the identification and treatment of survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Much of the literature has focused on the incidence and psychological impact of the abuse, and on techniques and stages of treatment. Less attention has been given thus far to the details and nuances of the analytic work, and especially to the complicated transference and countertransference elements of the therapeutic relationships. This paper outlines a range of possible transference and countertransference themes that may emerge in the psychoanalytic treatment of survivors of chronic incest. Areas of countertransference include: (1) response to the taboo against incest; (2) parental countertransference; (3) denial; (4) sexual and  voyeuristic countertransference; and (5) gender related countertransference. This paper also discusses a few of the transference paradigms which can elicit strong countertransference reactions. These include the patient's mode of affect regulation, experience by the patient of the therapist as the incestuous &quot;father,&quot; and the transference organized around the patient's identification with the aggressor.

There are definite guidelines counselors should follow when helping teachers provide individual help to students in the classroom and school setting. A counselor should help teachers perceive meaning in providing for each student in the curriculum, thus adjusting the curriculum to each student rather than forcing the student to adjust to the curriculum. Counselors should assist teachers in using appropriate pretest approaches so that the present achievement level of each student may be evaluated. It is important that counselors aid teachers in providing for individual differences. Counselors can help teachers view problem solving as a major philosophy of teaching, guiding them to identify vital  problems, gather related data, develop hypotheses, and test the hypotheses in a functional setting. Counselors need to be able to work with teachers to identify and solve problems related to discipline, attention for learning, social development, optimal individual student progress, and specific problems in learning. Counselors may assist teachers in helping students to be accepting of and accepted by others and in providing for both the emotional needs of students and for their individually based learning experience. The guidance counselor needs to assist teachers in understanding and utilizing desired tenets from behavioristic and humanistic approaches. The guidance counselor should assist teachers in providing for individual differences and emotional needs, in utilizing problem solving  procedures, and in accepting students as human beings having much worth.

A total of 21,040 research proposals from academic institutions, which were competitively reviewed and decided in Fiscal Year 1988 by the National Science Foundation's (NSF) five disciplinary research directorates, were analyzed. Some proposals from PUIs were submitted directly to NSF standard disciplinary programs, while others were submitted via a special gateway called Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUIs) and are noted as RUI proposals. The study was designed to see what similarities and differences existed among RUI, PUI-direct, and RCU proposals. Within these three  groups, proposals were examined along institutional type and proposer characteristics (experience, race or ethnicity, and gender). Principal findings include: (1) 12% of the proposals were submitted by investigators from PUIs; 8% of all awards were made to PUI researchers, and they accounted for 5% of the funding awarded competitively; and (2) nearly one-third of awards for PUI-direct proposals and one-quarter of awards to RUI proposals went to researchers who had not submitted any proposals during the preceding 5 years.

Study findings are based on telephone interviews conducted with 657 ROW-eligible women: 255 who applied through the ROW program, 302 who applied through regular National Science Foundation (NSF) disciplinary programs, and 100 who had never applied. The program provides an alternative entry point for proposals to NSF from women seeking their first Federal research grant or from women whose research career has been interrupted for 2 of the previous 5 years. The report outlines the survey and sampling strategy and discusses results in terms of program attraction, impact of  proposal decision, differences among applicant groups and nonapplicants, support from non-NSF sources, proposal preparation assistance, perceptions of ROW and NSF, career development, and suggestions for improving NSF support of female scientists and engineers. The study found that the program was successful in attracting women who had not previously submitted research proposals to NSF, and that ROW principally benefits young female researchers who are substantively ready to conduct sponsored research but relatively unsophisticated about the process of obtaining a Federal grant.

(4) When does attrition occur and why does it occur? (5) What are the costs of attrition? (6) What can ESC do about attrition? The paper attempts to answer these questions by mapping out student flow from the time of initial inquiry to the student's exit from the college. Twelve recommendations are outlined that are designed to form the basis of a college-wide, center-based retention program. They include: improve faculty-student interaction, improve peer  interactions, be responsive to student complaints and expressed needs, present a meaningful and accurate picture of the institution, establish an early warning system, establish a recovery program at the Center level, initiate adult services and resource supports, and improve the quality of financial aid advising.

The Center accomplished its objectives of establishing working relationships with numerous institutions, preparing printed materials, sponsoring workshops, and developing a consortium of experienced assessment practitioners. In addition, Center personnel founded a national publication, planned an international seminar, and supported a cross-national study of assessment in higher education. This final report outlines the  project's background and purpose, summarizes project impact, and documents plans for continuation and dissemination. Appendices, which comprise the bulk of the report, include: (1) an overview of the ARC; (2) an annotated bibliography of 12 items on assessment and a list of 23 representative assessment programs; (3) research on the College Outcome Measures Project, with an 11-item annotated bibliography; (4) title pages and tables of contents of ARC publications; (5) resource appendices from &quot;Performance and Judgment: Essays on Principles and Practice in the Assessment of College Student Learning&quot; edited by Clifford Adelman, containing an annotated bibliography of approximately 75 items and reviews of 22 assessment instruments.

        "description":"This project was designed to demonstrate an effective means of ameliorating the problem of severe underrepresentation of minority faculty members (black faculty members in particular) among active educational researchers in the United States. It sought to address this problem by increasing opportunities for selected faculty in the historically black institutions of the University of North Carolina to engage in educational research, and by increasing the awareness of senior academic officers at those institutions of the types of support faculty must have to conduct research. In addition, the project worked to strengthen a network of existing educational research partnerships among the participating universities, minority educational researchers at universities throughout the  United States, and the educational research faculty at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Project activities included selection of Educational Research Fellows, a mentorship program, seminars, workshops, and attendance at and participation in education conferences. Workshops focused on effective oral presentation of research findings, writing effective grant proposals and scholarly journal papers, advanced research methods, research use of microcomputers, and structural equation modeling. This final report describes project activities and project evaluation.

The pamphlet focuses on audit, investigative, and other activities, in order to provide information about current OIG efforts to prevent and detect fraud, waste, or mismanagement in Department of Education programs and operations, and to request assistance in identifying potentially wasteful and costly practices and fraudulent activities in these operations and programs. Student financial assistance programs are identified as the most vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse, resulting in management improvement reports on the following issues, among others: improper screening of students' ability to benefit,  improper course-length practices, oversight of secondary markets for student loans, diligence of loan collections, and tuition refunds. Other significant OIG activities are described in the areas of elementary, secondary, and other education programs and general Department management. A statistical profile highlights numbers of audit reports issued, processed, and resolved by program managers; investigative case activity and results; actual recoveries from audits and investigations; management improvement reports; debarment/suspension activities; hotline activities; and legislative and regulatory documents reviewed. A list of Regional Inspector General offices concludes the pamphlet. (JDD)",

The group based its discussions on educational outcomes previously identified by the project directors as important for all college-educated professionals. The project involved faculty in eight professional fields: architecture, business administration, education, engineering, journalism, nursing, pharmacy, and social work. The dialogue and dissemination activities were extremely successful in stimulating national interest about integrating liberal and professional study. The project resulted in distribution of: (1) 10,000 copies of a summary report; and (2) a self-study guide for campus use in stimulating  conversation about integration of liberal and professional study, entitled &quot;PLUSS: Professional/Liberal Undergraduate Self-Study.&quot; Appendices contain a copy of the summary report, titled &quot;Strengthening the Ties That Bind: Integrating Undergraduate Liberal and Professional Study&quot; (ED 304 951); a copy of the self-study guide &quot;PLUSS&quot;; press releases, advertisements, and letters relating to release of the report; mailing lists; workshop description; an executive summary; and a list of institutions that ordered the summary report or the self-study instrument.

The paper serves as a case study of the types of assessments that occur on postsecondary campuses where state mandates are planned but nonexistent. A survey of 57 individuals responsible for learning/outcomes assessment resulted in responses from 24 individuals. Findings suggest that a legislative mandate without funds or guidelines lacked the support required to ensure compliance by all public postsecondary institutions. Mandates required by external agencies were critical to the  implementation of assessment in specific areas. Three-fourths of the respondents indicated that their institutions either had or were developing a student assessment program. Most institutions were planning to measure cognitive skills and general education, were distributing results that described institutional effectiveness and professional and technical programs, and were undecided about measuring liberal arts appreciation. Academic administrators and faculty were more likely to be initiators, implementors, and recipients of assessment results, while institutional researchers described their roles as advisors and/or providers of information.

The formula determines whether the aggregate appropriation for the Virginia institutions' positions is sufficient to support each of the positions at a given  percentile of the salary amounts for corresponding positions at peer group institutions. Interpretation of the data found that appropriation amounts placed Virginia administrators between the 38th and 75th percentiles of corresponding positions at peer institutions.

Of 1200 teachers who were sent the 16-page questionnaire, 608 returned completed surveys. The purpose of studying these teachers was to discover the ways in which they use computers in their classrooms, whether and how they believe their teaching has changed as a result of using computers, and the kinds of barriers and incentives that are important to them. Major findings show that these teachers: (1) are comfortable with computer technology, devote their own time to learning how to use computers, and receive local support for using them; (2) work in schools averaging more than twice the number of computers  than other schools; (3) use computers for many purposes including demonstrating an idea, instruction, word processing, and promoting student-generated products; and (4) expect more from their students, are able to present more complex materials to their students, and foster more independence in the classroom. It is concluded that similar accomplishments on a wider scale may be achieved if ample technology, support, and time for teachers to learn the technology is provided, and if an academic and cultural structure exists to encourage teachers to take an experimental approach to their work.

        "description":"This paper is a call for academic and public libraries to contemplate their role in meeting the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) information needs of their patrons. Librarians are urged to consider the potential negative consequences of neglecting to provide up-to-date and representative collections of AIDS materials. It is suggested that optimum success in collecting and disseminating AIDS materials depends on the librarian's knowledge of the many facets of AIDS research and understanding the content of the medical, popular, and social science literature. Several bibliographic guides to articles and papers from the medical literature are recommended for providing access to patients on all aspects of the disease. Librarians are cautioned to exercise care when referring  patrons to the popular press, which may contain inaccurate, redundant, or contradictory information, and to favor the most recent articles. A brief review of how AIDS has been perceived and portrayed by the popular press points out that, until 1984 when it obtained its own heading, AIDS was listed under \"Homosexuality\" in periodicals indexes. Libraries with strong social science collections, particularly in psychology, social work, medical sociology, and medical anthropology are encouraged to offer support to patrons undertaking social science research on AIDS, and two social science indexes are recommended as resources for psychosocial AIDS researchers.

        "description":"In this report, the collective experience of non-professional support staff in academic libraries is suggested to be an invaluable--and often overlooked--human resource in long-range library planning. At Indiana State University Libraries, a special staff development activity was formulated to tap the creative energy of the library support staff as part of a library-wide effort to prepare the institution for the 1990s and the turn of the century. Relying primarily on the technique of small group brainstorming, the day-long activity resulted in many useful suggestions and observations that were helpful in charting the library's course for the future and acted as a morale booster for the staff. The report describes the planning, implementation, and evaluation of staff development  activity. Actual planning and implementation documents are included, as well as the evaluation instrument and a brief summary of evaluation results. (SD)",

        "description":"After briefly tracing the development of modern bibliographic instruction since the 1870s, this report concentrates on the characteristics of bibliographic instruction in the past decade. It points out that the 1980s, dubbed the &quot;second generation&quot; of library instruction, saw an increased emphasis on preparing students to deal critically with the information they find, rather than simply helping them to find the information. Librarians are encouraged to help students to begin thinking critically by indicating biases and limitations in the works they consult and by showing them how to find reviews of books and journals. Librarians are urged to supplement focused teaching on a single subject at the reference desk with a structured, group approach to instruction. The &quot;one-hour  stand&quot; approach is described as an easily implemented form of library instruction. This approach typically features multi-page bibliographies that cite appropriate books and indexes and library guides that explain the card catalog, decipher periodical index entries, and suggest means of designing a research strategy. Research methods classes, which are offered through certain courses as part of the course's requirement and in conjunction with particular assignments, are also discussed, and other types of instruction are briefly outlined. It is recommended that librarians and teachers work together to determine what would best satisfy students' needs. (7 references) (SD)",

It maintains that the experts who provide leadership at each level must be strong advocates for the integration of the library media program into all aspects of the education program. The greatest need in developing a district library media program is identified as having managers with tireless energy, unlimited imagination, and eternal optimism as well as academic and professional qualifications and competencies. Extracts from three publications published by professional associations during the past 15 years summarize components of services that should be developed at the district level, including: (1)  administrative services to handle the establishment and maintenance of system-wide resource services; (2) the coordination of collection development; (3) the establishment of circulation services compatible with the collection; (4) the evaluation of resources; (5) the planning of production and technical services; (6) the development of policies for organizing and maintaining collections and equipment; and (7) professional development and advisory services for school media specialists, classroom teachers, administrators, and consultants. Appendices detail the unique responsibilities of the province, the division, and the school, and provide a copy of a contract between a school principal and the school librarian which shows agreed-upon goals for the school's library.

One of the highlights of 1989 was the establishment of ACCESS ERIC, the first new ERIC system component in over 20 years. Among its first tasks were the development of extensive reference and referral files of organizations that collect and distribute education-related materials, and the compilation of a worldwide catalog of institutions that can provide ERIC searches or documents to clients. Also established in 1989 were four &quot;adjunct&quot; ERIC Clearinghouses in the fields of literacy education, U.S./Japan  studies, art education, and compensatory education. These clearinghouses have expanded the scope of the ERIC database, increased coverage and publications in these areas, and diversified the sources of ERIC funding. ERIC also expanded its international collaborative efforts, working with education associations throughout the world to facilitate greater access to and dissemination of educational resources. Looking toward the future, ERIC has begun to develop prototypes that will provide immediate access on compact disc to the full text of the most significant documents and journal articles cited in the ERIC database. This report includes a profile and an overview of the ERIC system and reports on the ERIC clearinghouses, the ERIC Processing and Reference Facility, ACCESS ERIC, and the ERIC  Document Reproduction Service, as well as examples of ERIC system initiatives during the year. Two tables and a statistical report are attached. (SD)",

        "author":["Fogelstrom, Clarence"],
        "description":"Based on annual reports from the states on project activities carried out under the Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA), this report provides an overview of programs authorized under Title I of LSCA over a 5-year period to support special projects at major urban resource libraries (MURLs) which operated for users on a regional basis. It also summarizes how federal funds have been used to help the states meet user needs through the strengthening of MURLs and metropolitan public libraries which serve as national or regional resource centers. Analyses of the FY 1987 annual reports show that the MURLs continued to strengthen library collections and provide interlibrary loan services. The use of various technologies in providing public library service continued to grow with  the purchase of compact disk recordings and videotapes, and with the use of computers, microform readers and printers, videotape recorders, and other applicable technologies. Some of the state annual reports noted that new patrons were using library services for the first time to borrow videotapes, compact disk recordings, and computer software. The reports also indicated a continuation of projects for database searching and the purchase of large-print books, microforms, foreign language materials (such as Asian, Spanish, and Russian), government documents, Afro-American history and literature collections, Hispanic collections, and the expansion of periodical collections on microfilm. The introduction provides a brief narrative report on LSCA funding requirements and levels, a discussion  of trends in MURLs and metropolitan libraries, and two tables of statistics on expenditures and funding for the MURLs and the national or regional resource centers for each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The appendix, which makes up the major part of this report, presents detailed statistics for each of 42 states broken down by fiscal year. (BBM)",

Chapter 1 contains background information, underscores the need for articulated curricula, and provides relevant definitions. Chapter 2 describes types of needs assessment procedures and emphasizes their importance, while chapter 3 examines the composition, creation, orientation, and use of the curriculum committee. Chapter 4 describes curriculum development, focusing on occupational requirements, career ladders,  instructional analysis, student prerequisites, support courses, course prerequisites, and curriculum finalization. Chapter 5 reviews the content of basic course outlines, including objectives, learning activities, tools and equipment, physical facilities, instructional materials, competency profiles, student monitoring, and performance exams. Chapter 6 offers guidance on instructor qualifications, chapter 7 discusses issues related to program/curriculum accreditation, and chapter 8 considers the roles and responsibilities of &quot;2 + 2&quot; development and implementation staff. Chapters 9 and 10 offer information on conducting student follow-ups and developing articulation agreements. Finally, chapter 11 deals with considerations related to program/curriculum evaluation.

Project activities included the formation of an advisory committee of minority leaders and the establishment of training institutes, seminars, academic internships, enrichment activities, a mentorship program, and a computer data bank listing the leadership skills of minority men and women interested in career opportunities in two-year colleges. In addition, two surveys of post-secondary administrators were conducted,  focusing on minority leadership skills and the barriers to minority advancement in leadership positions. The administrators were also asked to nominate program participants and potential mentors. Respondents indicated that limited institutional commitment, lack of support networks, and the existence of discrimination were the primary obstacles to minority advancement. Based on results of the survey, a program design emerged and 36 individuals were nominated to participate in the program, whose key elements were a 2-day orientation, a 14-hour graduate credit program, and 4 weekend seminars. Thirty-three of the participants completed all components of the program. Formal and informal evaluation strategies were employed to assess program outcomes. In addition to a literature review and a  comprehensive program description giving detailed survey responses, this report contains an extensive reference list and 12 appendixes which include a program evaluation report, summer institute agendas, seminar schedules, a managerial and roles profile instrument, a candidate application form and a set of program participants resumes.

This report presents SIQ results for fall 1988 and includes a longitudinal analysis of SIQ data for the previous 12 years. Following a brief historical review of the use and development of the instrument, section I analyzes trends in students' sex, age, ethnicity, educational attainment at U.S. schools, foreign education, educational goal, semester completion difficulties, current occupation, and reasons for choosing CCSF. Section II presents detailed tables of results for the 1988 SIQ, based on responses from 16,316 students. After addressing various methodological issues, this section breaks down student responses to 36 questionnaire items by  sex, age, ethnicity, and day/evening attendance. Reported findings include the following: (1) among day students, the goal of transfer to a four-year college was the primary reason for attending CCSF among both men (64.6%) and women (60.3%); (2) more evening students than day students were likely to indicate that they received no foreign education; and (3) among day students, more women (11.3%) than men (10.6%) anticipated difficulty with reading/writing skills. The final section of the report contains complete data tables for sex, age groups, ethnic groups, educational goals, and declared day or evening division, with data grouped for day respondents, evening respondents, and total respondents.

The report examines the limited scope of community college longitudinal studies conducted to date, reviews the problems encountered by those who have worked on the development of student tracking systems, and outlines many of the factors to be considered in longitudinally tracking student progress. The report is organized in four parts. Part 1 discusses the challenge of accountability, examining the relationship between matriculation policies and enrollment trends, and advocating research into student flow and progress as a  corollary to reform. Program implementation problems are also reviewed in this section. Part 2 reviews selected longitudinal and student flow studies that have been conducted at the national, state, and local levels. Part 3 considers the concept and interpretation of &quot;indicators,&quot; data used in longitudinal and non-longitudinal studies as proxy measures for student success. Part 4 examines student tracking systems themselves, suggesting useful models, discussing potential and identified problems, and proposing solutions. The report concludes with two appendixes, the first outlining the components of the Texas Longitudinal Student Tracking and Reporting (LONESTAR) system, and the other outlining a closely related system suggested by a panel of experts convened by the American Association of  Community and Junior Colleges.

Illinois Community College Board (ICCB) historical salary survey (1980-89) data were used to examine trends in the employment of part-time faculty. Fall 1989 ICCB faculty and staff data were analyzed to investigate the characteristics of current part- and full-time faculty. The American Association Community and Junior Colleges's (AACJC's) fall 1989 survey data were used to draw comparisons with other states. Study findings included the following: (1) the overall number of faculty decreased both in headcount (by 11.2%) and full-time equivalency (by 6.3%) in fall 1989 compared with the rest of the 1980s; (2)  the number of part-time faculty experienced by 12.8%, compared to 7.2% for full-time faculty; (3) in the case of full-time equivalents (FTE), full-time faculty had a greater decrease (7.2%) than did part-time faculty (5.0%), indicating a trend toward a slightly greater reliance on part-time faculty for FTE positions; (4) during the 1980s, part-time instructors accounted for an average of 71.1% of the faculty headcount, but only 43% of the FTE devoted to instruction; (5) Illinois' usage of part-time faculty was slightly above that of the national average; (6) females and minorities were better represented among part-time faculty than full-time faculty; and (7) part-time faculty accounted for over 90% of the instructional staff in general studies, adult basic education, adult secondary  education, and vocational skills.

Directors from eight select humanities programs which had received National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Higher Education in the Humanities grants were called upon to share their acquired expertise and experience with representatives from the humanities departments of 24 community colleges from across the nation. Selected by a committee of AACJC and NEH officials from among 100 applicants, the 24 participating colleges spent 3 days at a conference in Washington, D.C. that included plenary sessions, model project presentations, and mentor/team meetings with the eight selected directors. At the conclusion  of the conference, each of the 24 teams had produced a written plan of action for their college to pursue over the months that followed. This project report includes brief profiles on the efforts and accomplishments of the eight selected college humanities departments and provides highlight reports from the 24 participating community colleges on the progress in humanities development they have achieved since the conference. Three appendices include addresses of all participating colleges and conference principals, a national map showing distribution of the colleges, and the AACJC policy statement regarding the study of humanities.

The two major sources of information for the review were public hearings and responses to a survey mailed to each public institution's program director. The study identified several areas of concern, including: (1) curricular inconsistency and lack of standards for converting clinical experience to semester hours among the colleges offering accredited programs; (2) lack of articulation to assist program graduates in entering degree completion programs; (3) outdated equipment and inadequate facilities; (4) need  for in-service faculty education; (5) lack of order and consistency in state policies; (6) declines in applications; (7) the need for expanded student recruitment activities; (8) shortages of trained personnel; (9) underrepresentation of males and minorities in program enrollments; (10) the need for greater cooperation with the dental profession; and (11) the need for continuing education options. Drawing from study findings, a program review team developed 13 recommendations related to the development of program approval criteria, the creation of a center for health statistics, supplemental program funding, student financial aid, and student recruitment focused on underrepresented groups. Appendixes include list of persons attending hearings or submitting testimony, and a copy of the  survey questionnaire. (JMC)",

        "description":"Though recent research indicates a stronger sense of purpose and satisfaction among faculty at community colleges relative to four-year institutions, criticism of community colleges for alleged deficiency in facilitating transfer to the four-year schools is widespread. This function however, is only one of the many comprehensive services provided by the community college. Such a comprehensive approach caters to first generation students, those who have previously done poorly as students or workers, those interested in career change and, generally, those who look to the community college as the only adult learning institution prepared to meet their needs as life circumstances change. To focus exclusively, or even primarily on the transfer function as some critics demand,  jeopardizes the efficacy of the community college in its other roles. The diverse ends serviced by the more comprehensive philosophy ought not be subordinated to the attainment of the baccalaureate. Access to the community college, which includes flexibility in terms of points of entry and exit, must be maintained. Transfer cannot be maximized without doing some damage to comprehensiveness, which is not to say that transfer cannot be made more effective within the context of comprehensiveness. Community colleges are not simply the weak link in the transition from high school to college. Given its relative youth, the community college should be left to develop its own unique identity and not be limited in scope owing to its relation to the four-year colleges. Restrictions on movement  within the community college system may ultimately discourage student participation and impede experimentation. The transfer function is an important role, but is one among many played by community colleges. (GFW)",

A random sample of 202 students returned 114 usable surveys for a response rate of 65.5%. Among the respondents, 63% attended part-time, 71% were female, and 82% were degree-seeking students. Study findings included the following: (1) 80% of the respondents considered the availability of student activities to be important or very important; (2) 58% rated the quality of student activities as average; (3) 68% indicated that they had never participated in any type  of student activity at CCC; (4) among students who had participated in activities, involvement was greatest in seminars and workshops, clubs, and guest speaker presentations; (5) students tended to prefer programs scheduled in the evenings or on weekends; (6) over 50 respondents indicated that they would be likely to attend musical and sporting events on campus, while at least 45 students expressed an interest in overnight trips, guest speakers, seminars/workshops, and theater trips; (7) lack of time and other responsibilities were given as reasons for low attendance rates; and (8) among suggestions for additional programs, sporting events for exercise rather than competition was cited most frequently.

In the first report, \"The Partnership Concept,\" partnerships are described as formalized methods of cooperating with secondary schools and helping them be as successful with their students as possible, with the major underlying premise that if local secondary schools are successful, BCC is more apt to be successful in achieving its mission. After stating the mutually shared goals of BCC's Partnership Program, the 10 steps in the partnership process are delineated. The second report, \"The Partnership in Action,\" describes activities conducted under the Partnership Program, including: (1) the Secondary Articulation Council; (2) college catalog and personnel  directory distributed to high schools; (3) college classes taught on high school campuses; (4) new student orientation to college; (5) basic skills assessment on high school campuses; (6) facility and equipment sharing; (7) teaching exchanges; (8) joint staff development activities; (9) job shadowing; and (10) career planning workshops for high school teachers and counselors. Finally, \"Highlights of the Partnership in Action\" focuses on major activities undertaken during the 1989-90 school year, including counselor-to-counselor and faculty-to-faculty activities, course equivalence agreements, high school student visitations to BCC, transition to four-year college activities, student and parent surveys, and the mailing of a promotional brochure, \"Consider College,\" to all high school  seniors.

The survey results included the following: (1) the majority of older adult programs come under what is called Community Services, Adult Education, or Short Courses; (2) most colleges conduct non-credit courses with fees between $25-$50 per class; (3) several colleges allow \"audits\" of regular courses with fees waived for those over 60; (4) 50% of the League schools say they have a special program and/or  center for older adults at their college; (5) League schools involved in Older Adult Education employ many more part-time than full-time staff with more than 80% of those teaching classes for the older adult learner being part-timers; (6) 75% of the colleges surveyed offer non-credit classes to seniors; and (7) full-term courses are often taught to seniors for credit at off-campus sites. Following the summary of survey findings, the report provides individual descriptions of the adult centers and programs offered at 16 member institutions. Then, the report profiles 13 special program offerings, including older adult seminars and curriculum. Appended is a list of contact persons for all colleges and programs profiled. (GFW)",

During the course of the study, the survey team's postsecondary specialist visited community college campuses and centers for continuing education throughout the Pacific rim, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the FSM, and the Republic of Palau, the three nations which maintain a treaty operating the College of Micronesia's multi-campus sites. During these visits, over 102 people were interviewed, including college administrators, teachers, students, state government officials, national government officials, and and off-island educators.  Areas examined by the study included financing of current postsecondary programs including community college funding, scholarships, and Pell grants. Also examined were interviewee concerns and observations regarding eight basic issues for the FSM, including the three nation treaty, college governance, the predominant role of foreigners in skilled occupations, the need for and financing of a four-year institution, and private sector economic development. Recommendations emerging from the study included development of an articulation plan, continued support for the three nation treaty, redefinition of the mission and policies of the community college system, and improvement of scholarship fund management. Appendixes suggest goals and powers of the board of regents, duties and  responsibilities of the advisory board and the advisory committee, and governance structure. (JMC)",

Three major expenditure components were used to estimate direct economic impact: college budgetary expenditures; college employee expenditures; and student expenditures. Indirect economic impact was estimated through application of an economic multiplier which estimates the value of earnings and other college acquired resources which have been re-spent by college employees and students in the economy. Major findings of the study included the following: (1) more than $109 million of the state's economy was a direct result of spending by EPCC (16.8%), its students (65.1%), and its employees (18.1%); (2) a business volume or  economic impact of more than $271 million was generated by expenditures of EPCC, its students, and its employees as determined by application of the economic multiplier; (3) when considering all revenue sources, each dollar which EPCC received and spent resulted in $4.90 of statewide economic impact; (4) each dollar of state aid revenue to the college resulted in an economic impact of $13.45; (5) 6,816 jobs were attributable to the existence and expenditures of EPCC; (6) in El Paso County, nearly $107.5 million are attributable to EPCC student expenditures (66.4%), college expenditures (15.1%), and employee expenditures (18.5%); and (7) an estimated business volume of more than $234.5 million was generated by expenditures of the college, its students, and its employees as determined by  application of the multiplier.

Planning at MTC is composed of a strategic planning cycle and a complementary operational planning cycle. Strategic planning, conducted in two-year cycles, establishes the essential major directions for the college that have emerged in response to the assessment of needs of faculty, staff, students and the community, and the results of the evaluation component of the effectiveness program. Operational planning is an ongoing process at the college in which each spring, departments develop sets of objectives and action plans for the coming year. As part of the evaluation, the President's executive staff reviews the  results of activities undertaken through the action plans. The evaluation process has also included the identification of six Critical Success Factors and the development of specific indicators of effectiveness and a set of measurable criteria to evaluate each factor. Specific activities providing information needed to assess the effectiveness of the Critical Success Factors include: student learning outcomes measures; implementation of student tracking systems; retention studies; and ongoing student satisfaction surveys. Departmental action plan forms, and a matrix chart of Critical Success Factors with the related institutional effectiveness indicators are included. The appendix provides MTC's mission statement, and profiles of each of the six Critical Success Factors, including sources  of the assessment data and specific actions taken. (JMC)",

Another program, Campus Abroad, is a partnership arrangement between the Foothill-De Anza community college district and the American Institute for Foreign Study to conduct educational programs abroad in cities such as Paris, London, and Salzburg. Other activities of the colleges have included the development of instructional divisions for international studies, efforts towards establishing sister-school agreements with colleges in Japan, and programs to bring groups of students from foreign  countries to the colleges for intensive, short-term academic and cultural experiences. At Osaka YMCA College's request, Foothill began offering ESL classes to Japanese students on the Osaka campus in the spring of 1988. This program prepares students to transfer to Foothill to become full-time F-1 visa enrollees. Another international program, founded 18 years ago, is the International Internship Program which provides Americans with much-needed linguistic, cultural, and practical work immersion to supplement their studies of German and French languages. Activities in the planning stages include international support services, additional specialized instructional programs, and short-term ESL efforts. (JMC)",

        "description":"Results of a study of physically abused elementary school children in the four urban boroughs of New York City are reported. The study recruited 106 families with a physically abused child between the ages of 8 and 12 years. A matched control sample was recruited from classmates. The abuse sample was highly representative of the New York City Register in terms of race and ethnic composition, and the abuse and control samples were demographically very well matched on a wide variety of characteristics. Data were derived from peer assessments in the classrooms, self-report, teachers, mothers or guardians, and records from Special Services for Children. Questions addressed were the following: (1) Are physically abused children more disturbed than other children? and (2) What family  risk factors are associated with abuse? Findings indicated that, compared to controls, abused children show signifiantly more general distrubance over a wide range of behavior both at home and at school, show poorer social competence and adaptive functioning, are less preferred by other children, tend to display more aggressive behavior and less cooperative behavior to other children, and are not as discriminating in how they choose their friends. Partner abuse in the child's household significantly differentiated abusing and nonabusing families. A path model reveals two likely paths to child abuse, both of which involve substance abuse by the mother's parents and partner abuse. Concluding discussion focuses on issues of intervention. (RH)",

Several research studies that used the indicator checklist model have attempted to determine whether compliance with state child care regulations has a positive impact on children and whether predictors of program quality can be identified. Findings have revealed that centers with low compliance scores have the lowest program quality scores; centers in substantial compliance have the highest program quality scores; and centers in full compliance have somewhat lower program quality scores than centers in substantial compliance. Regulatory and program quality items that correlated with program  compliance and quality, including items related to effective administration, implementation of a child development curriculum, and parent participation, were identified. These results could have an impact on public day care policy related to day care regulation and monitoring. States can emphasize substantial compliance with the predictor and indicator items of the indicator checklist model. Two advantages of the model are that its use can: (1) reduce state costs for monitoring and licensing day care centers; and (2) save centers time.

Substantial compliance (90-97 percent, but not a full 100 percent compliance with state day care regulations) positively affects children. Low compliance (below 85 percent compliance) places children at increased risk. A Generic Checklist for Child Care offers predictors of child care compliance that state agencies should emphasize in their monitoring of child care programs. Items on the checklist concern: (1) director qualifications; (2) health appraisal; (3) supervision of children; (4) adult/child ratios; (5) sufficient space; (6) emergency contact information; (7) a hazard-free environment; (8) inaccessibility  of toxic materials; (9) nonhazardous equipment; (10) nutrition; (11) medication; (12) transportation of children in a safety carrier; and (13) the orientation of activities provided for children. Concluding remarks emphasize that inasmuch as day care regulations alone will not ensure high quality child care services for children, state agencies should use the Generic Checklist in combination with other evaluation tools to monitor child care programs.

An early childhood education demonstration program, the Visions program aims to facilitate the intellectual development and academic achievement of African American preschool children while strengthening their self-esteem and identity as Afro-Americans. Children in the control group attended a high quality day care center with a highly trained staff. Evaluation data indicated that program participants scored higher than control group children on eight tests. In addition, program participants in the two cohorts of the Visions group scored higher than control subjects on subtests of the Metropolitan Reading Readiness Test, taken before kindergarten entry, and the  Stanford Achievement Test (SAT), taken before entrance into the first grade. Visions program participants scored significantly higher on the visual recognition and vocabulary subtests of the SAT. It is noted that control group children had less of a Caucasian orientation than did program participants. This is surprising, because a major thrust of the program is its Afrocentric perspective. Explanations for this outcome are explored. (RH)",

WORDPLAY is a program specifically designed to provide extensive experiences and supplemental language activities for at-risk kindergarten and first-grade students. In the WORDPLAY condition, a total of 9 kindergarten and 7 first-grade students were engaged in extensive activities in a small group that met for half days over a 4-month period. The WORDPLAY program emphasized weekly field trips, guest speakers, weekly cooking experiences, feelings awareness activities, and extensive small group  discussions in addition to the regular school curriculum. Program evaluation data based on the use of multiple measures and a triangulation strategy indicated positive gains in both receptive and expressive language skills for all students who used the WORDPLAY program.

It was expected that if planning to include facial features increased the size of the head children drew, then heads would be larger in the frontal drawing, in which features are included, than in the dorsal drawing, in which they are not. Drawings of an empty plate and a plate laden with food were collected in an effort to investigate the possibility of a general effect of planning with regard to internal details on the size of an outline. Results showed a highly significant effect of figure orientation on head size at all ages. Children drew larger  heads when the figure was viewed from the front than from the back. There was no comparable effect in drawings of plates. Head to body proportion was largest for the youngest children and declined significantly with age. There were significant differences between drawings of children from different schools. Results suggest that even though children's planning to include facial features may affect head size at all ages, there are wide differences between different populations of children. Additional research is needed to identify the basis of these differences. (RH)",

Initial discussion, on conceptions of the learner, the learning process, knowledge, and the aims of education, contrasts a truly developmental approach with the psychometric approach predominant in the schools. A review of research compares outcomes of various preschool program designs and works toward a clearer definition of the developmental needs of the young child. Sections in the review focus on  basic skills and teaching strategies, defining &quot;developmentally appropriate,&quot; the teacher's role, and program structure and goals. Attention is then focused on implications of research on teacher behaviors and teacher-child interactions. An analysis of the daily schedule in a preschool classroom follows. Concluding discussion probes teacher behaviors within the framework of the daily schedule. It is pointed out that inappropriate teacher behaviors can destroy a daily routine that has been planned according to the needs of young children. And, an inappropriate daily schedule makes even the best and most knowledgeable teacher unable to facilitate learning from a child development perspective. (RH)",

The questions are: (1) What are the fundamental and universal characteristics of persons responsible for rearing and educating young children? (2) Why have women's roles in early education and society as a whole been linked so closely and for so long to the biology and sociology of the home? (3) How can the roles of men and women in the development of the field of early childhood education be understood as complementary  rather than as an adversarial dichotomy? (4) Is today's family day care home a continuation of Comenius' 17th century school of infancy, or is it a new and different thing?

Initial discussion explores three central concepts: music media, adolescence, and mass media effects. A summary of research on music media in adolescence is offereed in two sections discussing exposure to, and gratifications and interpretations of, popular music, and exposure to, and gratifications of, music videos. Also discussed are the messages, interpretation, and effects of popular music. Content analyses reveal that although negative and objectionable messages and images can be found in music and music television, the value orientation of most music is rather mainstream and traditional. Because music videos add the visual dimension and many young  adolescents pay little attention to lyrics, videos may have stronger effects on social learning than audios. Very little taboo or deviant behavior appears on Music Television (MTV). It should not be assumed that what adults see in a song or video will be what teens see, or that all teens will see the song or video in the same way. Although adolescents report learning about important issues from music, little is known about the learning or behavioral effects that occur. Concluding discussion offers recommendations for policy and research. A total of 140 references are cited. (RH)",

        "description":"Preventive programs designed to support and strengthen families with adolescents are being implemented in response to changes in American society and the nature of adolescence. This paper examines such programs by addressing these questions: (1) What are the primary functions of families in the raising of adolescents? (2) What factors support and undermine these functions? (3) What types of programs do families with adolescents need? (4) What kinds of programs support and strengthen families during their children's adolescent years? (5) What programing gaps exist and what types of programs are most needed? (6) What are some characteristics of effective prevention programs? (7) What research and evaluation questions need to be answered if programs of increased effectiveness are to  be developed? Major sections of the paper concern a framework for understanding the needs of families with adolescents, implications of the framework for preventive programs, factors that support or undermine parental competence, programs for families with adolescents and programming gaps, and recommendations. Concluding remarks emphasize several broader themes and issues that should be kept at the forefront when the state of the field is considered and future directions are contemplated.

        "description":"The aims of the International Education Association's Preprimary Project are to examine developmentally relevant characteristics of the socialization environments of 4-year-olds in participating countries, and to ascertain the relationships between those characteristics and selected developmental outcomes. Phase I of the project consists primarily of a household survey of families. The survey concerns families' use of early childhood care and educational services and family characteristics. Phase I questions include the following: (1) In what settings are the 4-year-old children cared for? (2) What is the child's day like? (3) Who pays for the support of the settings, and what services are included in them? (4) Why are children placed in the settings? (5) What is the nature of  the relationships between parents and caregiving settings? A major focus of the project is an attempt to arrive at an accurate picture of what it feels like to be a 4-year-old in the settings in which they are participants. In general, quality of life affects long-term development more powerfully than features of the environment. When adults' and children's views of the world diverge beyond an optimal extent, the child's view of the world provides the most predictive information. (RH)",

Rebecca Maynard explores the child care market for low-income parents, finding that even though family day care is plentiful in low-income areas, child care centers operate at or near capacity, and neither family day care providers nor centers report much capacity to care for more infants. In discussing the importance of quality in child care, Ellen Eliason Kisker identifies five indicators of child care that appear to have a positive influence on child development: small group size; appropriately trained caregivers; stable child-caregiver relationships; educationally oriented curricula; and high staff-child ratios. In Stuart Kerachsky's  article, it is maintained that implementation of the child care assistance provided under the Family Support Act (FSA) will require attention to the continuity and consistency of child care coverage, the method of subsidization, and the procedures for matching care with the needs of parents and children. Kerachsky also asserts that it is important to begin thinking about what will happen to low-income working parents and their children at the end of the year of transitional child care that the FSA provides.

Homeschoolers were divided into groups according to reasons they gave for homeschooling: either academic reasons or reasons related to beliefs. Findings indicated that homeschooling parents had more hands-on involvement in their child's education. Home environments of academically motivated homeschoolers were more stimulating  than those of homeschoolers motivated by beliefs or those of children in public schools. Academically motivated homeschooling parents expected earlier maturity and independence from children than did parents in the other groups. Homeschoolers restricted children's television viewing more than non-homeschoolers. Homeschoolers motivated by beliefs were more authoritarian and involved in church activities than parents in the other groups. (RH)",

Particular attention was given to supporting the development of young children's early mathematical skills. The study took place in a preschool center in the Illawarra region of New South Wales that served at-risk children and families in crisis. The focus of the study was on teaching methodologies and learner experiences that were likely to develop the skills necessary for successful integration into formal schooling. Participants were 11 students (6 in the experimental group and 5 in the control group) who had difficulty in using language fluently and  effectively in a range of situations; were unable to persevere with tasks and activities; lacked purposefulness, imagination, and variety in play; lacked initiative; and lacked normal social skills and emotional maturity. Children in the experimental group took part in 7-12 sessions at a computer over a 6-8 week period. Total computer time ranged from 140 to 240 minutes. Paired control group subjects had access to nonmathematical computer-based activities. Findings indicated that experimental group subjects gained dramatically and significantly in mathematical skills and understanding.

A consideration of characteristics of a high quality preschool program is followed by discussion of the importance of the preschool teacher and early childhood screening and assessment. It is argued that a successful program for preschoolers depends on the perceptive skills and ability of the preschool teacher to be attuned and responsive to each child's developmental readiness for being lured into learning. Knowledge of child development is essential for teacher competency. Observation skills and notes on significant episodes that reflect children's progress in: language skills, social interactions, self-control, attention span, and persistence at  difficult tasks are important assessment tools for teachers. The Denver Developmental Screening Test can be helpful. Teachers should have a good acquaintance with ways to carry out time and event sampling, write up case study vignettes, and use Socratic questioning techniques in order to increase children's reflective and reasoning skills.

        "description":"This paper describes the nature of stimulus and response generalization and identifies a number of tasks related to generalization that are commonly taught in early childhood programs. Substantial research has demonstrated that stimulus generalization does not occur automatically and it can often be achieved only as a result of special programing. It is imperative that early childhood educators actively employ specialized techniques to enhance generalization of learning and assess the functional application of skills in commonly occurring conditions in natural environments. Response generalization is of particular concern in early childhood education, as a number of readiness, preacademic, prerequisite, and generic skill training tasks are commonly included in early childhood  curricula. In terms of readiness, these skills are beneficial only if they undergo response generalization, that is, if they change the form in which they are performed in academic tasks or other functional activities in the natural environment. If response generalization does not occur, children who are taught generic readiness responses will not benefit from instruction. Since specialized techniques for enhancing response generalization have not been reported in the literature, the most efficient course would be to teach functional tasks in the form in which they must be performed in the natural environment.

Four major policy questions were addressed: (1) Who teaches in America's child care centers? (2) What do they contribute to the quality of care provided? (3) Do centers that meet or fail to meet nationally established quality guidelines, that operate under different financial and legal auspices, and that serve families from different socioeconomic backgrounds also differ in the quality of care offered to children or the work environments offered to their staff? (4) How have center-based child care services changed from 1977 to 1988? Participants were 227 child care centers in 5 metropolitan areas: Atlanta  (Georgia), Boston (Massachusetts), Detroit (Michigan), Phoenix (Arizona), and Seattle (Washington). Classroom observation and interviews with center directors and staff provided data on center characteristics and program quality, and on staff qualifications, commitment, and compensation. In Atlanta, child assessments were also conducted to examine the effects on children of such center and staff attributes as program quality and staff training. Part I of this report describes the purpose, goals, and design of the NCCSS. The six chapters of Part II concern child care teachers and the quality of care in America.

(2) What is the relationship between parents' involvement and their perceptions of how they benefited from involvement? Also explored were influences related to parental participation. Data was gathered by means of the Parent Participation Record, the Parent's Perception of Parent Involvement questionnaire, and anecdotal records. Findings concerning the first question indicated which school had the highest parent participation. Findings also showed that  the fewest recorded parent participations occurred in October, the most in March. The average number of parent participations for the year was seven. Home visits and informal parent involvement were the activities in which the largest number of parents participated. There were significant differences between schools in levels of parent participation in conferences, participation in the classroom, home learning activities, and informal involvement. Data on the second question revealed five significant correlations between participation variables and parents' perceptions of the benefits of their involvement. (RH)",

        "description":"This paper examines the literature on the impact of school closures on students and communities in the context of four policy issues: school size, cost savings, educational equity, and public support for education. In closure decisions, a major hypothesis affecting school board members is that larger schools can offer a broader curriculum at lower costs than smaller schools; therefore, bigger is better. Research suggests, however, that student participation decreases with increasing institutional size, and that a school should be sufficiently small to need all its students for its enterprises. Although driven by a desire for cost savings, most school closings realize only slight savings because 75-80% of a school budget is for personnel costs, which are only slightly affected by  closings. Not only are there meager data to support the closure-savings argument, most consolidated districts are unable to document the amount of money saved. The available data suggest that more than half of the districts that calculated actual cost savings experienced no savings or additional costs. School closings produced by retrenchment policy-making often result in clear winners and losers. Investigations of school closings in five major cities indicate that schools with primarily low socioeconomic status and minority students have suffered the brunt, if not the exclusive burden, of closings. Such decisions exacerbate the already difficult conditions that high-risk minority students face. School closings also have social costs: reduced parent involvement in their children's  education, flight to private schools, and decreased public support for educational bonds and levies.

        "description":"This report describes development of the &quot;Prepare Them for the Future&quot; project, a K-3 activity-oriented science curriculum. The program, funded through two grants, was driven by the need to boost the distressed labor-based economy in rural western Pennsylvania. Data showed a drop of 1,100 coal-mining jobs between 1980 and 1986 in Indiana County, location of the &quot;Prepare&quot; pilot program. The program was developed with help from local university personnel and through input from classroom teachers. It was designed to use the most current methods of science education with the expressed objective of influencing teacher and student attitudes toward science. Teachers played a significant role in creating the curriculum. Another goal of the program was to collect data about the impact of  the curriculum change. The research focused on the attitudes held by primary elementary teachers and students regarding science education. Teachers and K-3 students at the pilot school completed a science-attitude instrument before and after the curriculum project began. Significant increases were measured only in the scores of the kindergartners surveyed. Leadership, faculty involvement, and the availability of faculty work time were seen as being important factors in the success of the program. The report recommends further staff development, follow-up inservice training, administrative cooperation, and more follow-up research. (TES)",

        "description":"This survey of North Carolina farmers focuses on the impact of important social changes and their interplay with ongoing changes in agriculture. It provides information for policymakers and education researchers to prepare for possible changes in the rural education system. State farmers were interviewed in 1987 and again in 1988. Of 883 people who completed the first of two telephone interviews, 158 had left agricultural production by the following year. Farmers were generally more optimistic about their future in 1988. Farm income averaged about 50% of total family income. Only 28% of the farmers reported that farming generated more than 80% of the family income. Farmers seemed to have been avoiding the risk of new commodities. Only 6% indicated starting new crop or livestock  activities during the previous 2 years. About 40% of the farmers reported debts as of January 1988, with most owing less than $40,000. Most farmers did not report any severe economic hardships during 1987. Substantial differences existed among farmers and ex-farmers. Ex-farmers were slightly older, had small farms and lower incomes, and were more likely to be black or female. Only 36% of farmers reported having a land conservation plan. Farmers in the northeastern district reported the most serious drought losses. Peanut and soybean producers reported more losses than producers of other commodities. Almost 80% reported they had not received any federal drought assistance. More than 40% of farm operators reported &quot;very high&quot; or &quot;high&quot; levels of stress. Eight of 10 farmers reported having&quot;good&quot; or &quot;fair&quot; health. Almost half of the farm operators reported that they could not read at a level they feel is adequate. Results suggest that 7-12% of the respondents were illiterate. (TES)",

Data were collected by: (1) interviews as to purposes and goals of general health care; (2) case descriptions of the types of programs implemented, and the day-to-day operations of a rural health facility; and (3) measurements of health and nutritional status of health care recipients. Certain programs such as immediate care, child vaccinations and food supplemental programs provided immediate benefits to recipients. However, these benefits were contingent upon the personal characteristics of health care services personnel.  Other programs such as health and nutrition care education appeared to have more subtle and long-term positive effects. The Guatemalan health care system is &quot;dendritic&quot; or a centralized system. There is essentially no local control, input or involvement. On the other hand, little or no personnel and resources are provided by the national government, resulting in inconsistencies, disrupted resources, and constantly changing personnel. (ALL)",

This paper focuses on the social and psychological impact of the 1989 oil spill on Cordova, an isolated Alaskan community with high economic dependence on commercial fishing and a native Alaskan cultural heritage of subsistence practices. Random samples of 118 households and 32 Native Alaskans in Cordova and a matched control community were surveyed 5 months after the spill to assess patterns of social disruption and post-traumatic stress. Data analysis revealed that Cordova experienced significantly more social disruption than the control community, particularly in the areas of work  activities and future plans. Cordova residents also displayed significantly higher post-traumatic stress on 15 of 16 indicators; they had more intrusive recollections of the spill, more behaviors reflecting avoidance of stimuli associated with the spill, and a general diminished responsiveness or &quot;numbness&quot; to activities associated with the spill. Post-traumatic stress was most acute for persons experiencing disruption of family cohesion and uncertainty about future plans.

          "And Others"],
        "description":"Rwanda, a small country in Africa, has experienced declines in per capita food production. Fish culture is one part of a many-stranded effort to increase food production and food security by intensifying the use of land resources to produce a much-needed protein crop. Beginning in 1983, the Rwanda National Fish Culture Project has assisted farmers with the upgrading of their fish ponds and identified and provided a species suitable for the high elevation, cool water environment. Average annual production among participants has been raised from 300 kilograms to 1,550 kilograms per hectare. New technologies like fish culture must conform with the environment and activities of the farming system. Thus, rural extension is relevant in providing technological assistance to farmers.  Data were obtained from 186 Rwandan farmers throughout the nation who had active ponds for 2 years and who received extension services during that period. Responses to the survey suggest a relatively uniform expectation for continuing fish culture, even though many factors affecting the sustainability of aquaculture as a farm enterprise are related to infrastructure beyond farmer control. A great deal of spontaneous emulation is occurring outside the project. Neighbors and relatives are constructing fish ponds, often without technical assistance. One threat to the evolution of fish culture is improperly constructed ponds. These ponds are too small, leaky, or have improper water temperatures, shortcomings that will undermine the success achieved by project participants. The paper discusses  the necessary corrective or technical assistance to these emulators to avoid unnecessary failures. (ALL)",

This second edition is different from the first in the addition of notes on the status of recommendations, in the revision of data in various tables, and in the addition of an introduction summarizing events since 1985. Kentucky has seen some progress since 1985, but the state has not accomplished the &quot;radical&quot; reform that is necessary. While education has become the state's dominant political issue, most of the committee's recommendations have not been implemented. Graduation rates have improved, a higher percentage of Kentuckians are attending college, and there are signs that the state has taken steps to slow the cycles of poverty and  undereducation. But inadequate funding, bad management, and inappropriate political intrusion in the schools continue to hinder progress. The next wave of reform must stimulate structural, attitudinal, financial, and political change. Consistent with the first edition, themes discussed include the following: (1) the necessity of increased and deepened public involvement in state education; (2) interrelationships among the state's economy, society, government, and schools; (3) conditions of educational facilities and equipment; (4) teachers, administrators, and conditions for teaching; (5) the relationship among all educational levels as targets for reform; (6) the need for leadership; and (7) funding problems. The document reiterates the authors' awareness that educational reform requires  time. (TES)",

This paper examines the work outcomes of agricultural college alumni who were previously surveyed as students in 1977. Questionnaires were completed by 1,917 graduates in agricultural majors at 1862 and 1890 land-grant colleges of agriculture. Findings revealed significant differences in complexity of tasks on the first full-time job between agribusiness and non-agribusiness job holders. Compared to non-agribusiness job holders, agribusiness job holders were more likely to be involved in more complex data- or people-related tasks, but less complex things-related tasks. On later jobs, these entry-level differences virtually disappeared. Gender  (male) and academic major (agribusiness or applied engineering) were the strongest predictors of holding an agribusiness job, followed by the state's percentage of rural farm residents. Comparison of results with those of the 1977 study suggests that plans and aspirations for a particular occupation do not increase the probability of entering a particular career upon graduation from college.

        "description":"For the Yupik Eskimos of southwestern Alaska, a primary goal of bilingual-bicultural education is to forge a society that represents the &quot;best of two worlds.&quot; While this is an expressed ideal, educational programs have focused on first and second language learning and have not dealt with the relationship between Yupik and non-Yupik cultures or with the concept of culture change. This thesis describes a secondary-level bilingual-bicultural program designed by an anthropologist to address such issues. Background information is provided on Yupik culture and language and on the history of bilingual education in the region. The results of a survey of parent, teacher, student, and administrator opinions of bilingual education are summarized. The collaboration of the ethnographer with  Native teachers in the development of instructional materials and methods is discussed. The paper discusses in detail the program projects that guide students to examine personal values in light of Yupik tradition and current social, economic, and political conditions. These projects include: (1) student interviews with community members; (2) radio broadcasts in Yupik by students; (3) two projects demonstrating the effects of technological change on culture; (4) a board game focusing on historical and contemporary aspects of subsistence; (5) a &quot;card&quot; game teaching Yupik kinship terminology and roles; and (6) development and publication of a Yupik language book on traditional religion and ceremonies.

        "description":"Despite many folklore and cultural history projects seeking to identify the formative immigrant groups of Appalachia and their contributions, there has yet to be a systematic effort to connect Appalachian English to regional varieties of British English. This paper examines 40 grammatical features characteristic of Appalachian speech and identifies which are most likely Scotch-Irish and which are English. More resistant to change than vocabulary or pronunciation, grammar can be determined from old documents, and can be quantified. Table 1 lists the 40 features by parts of speech, and indicates whether the historical currency of each feature both in Britain and in the U.S. was general or restricted. Table 2 groups the features according to five types of grammatical structures:  inflectional forms; word order patterns; grammatical categories' morphological forms differing from other dialects; and function words. Table 3 removes items whose locale of British origin is questionable and quantifies the five grammatical structural types by general or Appalachian usage and by general British, south British, or Scotch-Irish origin.

          "Parker, Rebecca Robin"],
        "description":"This report describes efforts to develop sampling methods to be used in national or regional studies of migrant and seasonal farm workers (MSFWs). Several facets of the MSFWs' lifestyle create sampling difficulties. One is mobility. Although the dynamic nature of MSFWs' movement is partly understood, it is sufficiently unpredictable to create problems, such as \"multiplicity\"--multiple opportunities for the same individual to be selected. Other problematic aspects relate to identifying all housing locations of migrants in a given area, the transitional periods between migrants' jobs, variations in the timing of growing seasons around the country, and the elusiveness of undocumented aliens. The proposed design involves a stratified four-stage cluster sample. The first stage uses  area sampling methods for small groups of neighboring counties, while other stages use methods of list sampling for enumerating districts or block groups, migrant camps, and households. Sampling units, stratification, selection, and methodological issues are discussed for each stage. A large part of this document consists of Rebecca Robin Parker's 1989 master's thesis on this topic, which provides details on: (1) important migrant worker datasets compiled by the Migrant Student Record Transfer System, Douglas Massey, and Richard Jones; (2) definitions and characteristics of migrant farmworkers population; (3) multiplicity and how to handle it; (4) migration patterns; and (5) a description of a proposed 4-stage sampling design. An appendix contains a related paper by William Kalsbeek that  discusses conceptual framework and design parameters and provides statistical formulas. (SV)",

        "description":"Poverty is an important antecedent factor affecting education. One of the most striking characteristics of rural poverty is the extent to which the rural poor work. About 65% of poor nonmetro families have at least one worker, compared to 54% of poor metro families. This report focuses on federal and state policy reforms that would assure poor rural workers a reasonable return for their efforts. The federal earned income tax credit (EITC) assists low-income families that have earnings and a child living at home, and the credit is \"refundable\" for families whose credit exceeds its income tax liability. Current proposals would expand the EITC for families with several children or young children. An outreach program is needed to inform low-income working families that they must file  a federal tax return to receive the EITC payment. Raising the minimum wage to $5.02 in 1991 would restore its value lost to inflation during the 1980s and would benefit a majority of poor workers. Other strategies to aid the nonmetro working poor are: (1) making the federal dependent care tax credit refundable; (2) removing working poor families from state income tax rolls or establishing state EITCs; (3) restoring unemployment insurance coverage, which has dropped sharply in recent years; (4) extending Medicaid coverage to children in poor working families; and (5) instituting outreach programs to inform poor working families of their eligibility for food stamps.

        "description":"Decades of government interventions, an improved infrastructure, and support for industrialization have not resolved problems of persistent poverty in central Appalachia. This paper investigates characteristics of poverty previously overlooked in development initiatives and poverty research. In particular, it demonstrates the role of gender in the social reproduction of poverty in Pike County and Harlan County, Kentucky. Data are drawn from structured interviews with 44 working class women active in two union organizing campaigns in the early 1970s. Analysis, based on qualitative data of lifetime experiences in market and non-market labor, experiences in public schools and manpower training programs, and the structure and operation of households, reveals that different work and  school experiences are understood through a &quot;gendered lens.&quot; Range of economic opportunity, severely restricted for both sexes in an economy dominated by coal mining, is further limited for females by a gendered division of labor that equates women's work with employment in low-wage occupations or with non-market marginalized labor. Further, female status in households and families often prevents women from acquiring skills and qualifications to compete in highly restricted labor markets. Gender and family structure intersect with rural labor market structure to place women at economic risk, and these structures contribute to persistent poverty in these counties.

        "description":"Entrepreneurship has been one of the major issues in rural education. This annotated bibliography is a guide to theoretical material and to more recent empirical work on entrepreneurs in different economic climates. The material was gathered to enable rural development strategists who want to promote local independent business development to build a knowledge base by using literature specifically on rural entrepreneurs. Research on entrepreneurship has changed during the past 250 years, since the concept was born in economic theory. The focus has shifted from the characteristics of individual entrepreneurs to the current emphasis on the contributions of entrepreneurship to economic development. While descriptive studies abound, the cited literature contains few empirical studies  of rural entrepreneurship that test economic theories. Also, few researchers approach the analysis from a national perspective. Most report only local case studies. Another gap in the literature concerns the characteristics of new businesses in rural areas. The bibliography is organized into four chapters, which are: (1) Definition of the Entrepreneur, 119 citations; (2) Stages of an Entrepreneurial Business, 48 citations; (3) Environments Favorable to Entrepreneurship, 26 citations; and (4) Entrepreneurship as a Development Strategy, 96 citations. Each entry contains bibliographical information and an annotation. Comprehensive sources, periodical and additional citations without annotations are listed. The material is also indexed by author and subject. This bibliography is produced by  extensive computer and manual search of pertinent literature. It includes substantial historical material as early as 1730 as well as current works. (TES)",

The purpose of this study was to study the classroom climate, specifically focusing on the social interactions between teachers and students. The lessons were coded by observers and videotaped to give multiple sources of data. Conclusions from the classroom observations were that boys at each class level receive more attention than girls; a small number of students answer the questions in a class discussion; when given the choice, students prefer to work in single-sex groups; girls appear to be more bothered by a noisy, unstructured class than are boys; boys begin activities  more quickly than girls; boys are more likely to make up additional experiments when they have finished assignments; and girls are more likely than boys to finish written reports.

        "description":"The activities of an increasingly technological society call for greater command of science and mathematics at the precollege level than at any time in the past. Yet evidence from numerous studies indicates that the majority of U.S. citizens are not being equipped with the scientific and mathematical tools needed to participate in that technological society. Some studies point to an increased demand for science and mathematics teachers as well as an inadequate supply of qualified individuals to fill those positions. In this report, statistics on supply, demand, and quality as they pertain to science and mathematics teachers were evaluated and it was concluded that the available data are inadequate. The available data and model of labor market influences were evaluated and  analyzed and it was found that there is a great diversity in labor market situations and in the actions taken by applicants and school systems to balance supply and demand. Chapter titles include: (1) \"Determining Teacher Demand\"; (2) \"Determining Supply: Individual and District Activities\"; (3) \"Monitoring the Supply Pool of Science and Mathematics Teachers\"; (4) \"Statistics Related to the Quality of Science and Mathematics Teaching\"; and (5) \"Data Needs and Research Opportunities.\" Appendices include a list of panel activities, a list of national data sets on teacher supply and demand, availability of state data, a list of acronyms, and a set of biographical sketches of panel members.

In the third chapter, two teachers' beliefs associated with specific roles, their conceptualization of certain teaching roles and their understanding of the  content are described. Chapter 4 examines gender differences examined in the classrooms of these two teachers. In chapter 5, the cognitive demands of the tasks, materials and tests in relation to the cognitive levels of the students are discussed. Chapter 6 focuses on the attitudes of students and the way in which they interacted with one another, the teacher, and learning resources during learning tasks. A view of the classroom through the perceptions of the students in the classroom is presented in chapter 7.

        "description":"This project was a one-year study of California's reform effort in mathematics education. The research focused on two issues of great importance to current efforts to reform mathematics instruction: (1) What distinguishes teaching mathematics for &quot;understanding&quot; from rote performance and what does teaching mathematics for understanding in elementary schools entail? and (2) What can policy do to improve such mathematics teaching and learning? The research addressed these questions by examining effects on classroom practice of a state policy to promote teaching mathematics for understanding. In 1988-89 researchers observed and interviewed 23 second- and fifth-grade teachers concerning their knowledge and beliefs about mathematics teaching and policy initiatives, their efforts to  change their practice, and resources and constraints that influenced their ability to do so. Researchers also interviewed administrators and policymakers at the school, district, and state levels. This report focuses on changes in teaching practices related to the state policy of teaching mathematics for understanding. Detailed case analyses are presented of nine elementary teachers in six different elementary schools (three high SES and three low SES schools) in three different school districts in California. Three themes emerging from these cases are discussed in a final commentary. The first theme concerns texts and other curriculum materials as agents of change; the second theme explores the &quot;layers of reform&quot;; the third theme focuses on the profound influence of practice on policy.

Science and engineering (S&E) personnel are vital in meeting challenges in areas such as scientific research, education, technological competitiveness, and national defense. The growing demand for scientists and engineers, in combination with the current decline in the college-age population makes it essential that every available source of personnel be developed. However, women, racial and ethnic minorities, and persons with physical disabilities have historically been underrepresented among scientists and engineers. A clear and factual picture of the situation and trends in participation is very important to rational and  effective policy formation. This volume, the fifth in a series, is designed to provide the essential information to the U.S. Congress, the Administration, and others concerned with the overall strength of U.S. science and engineering and the provision of equal opportunities and equal treatment for women and minorities in this area. Specifically examined are: (1) the population of women scientists and engineers including employment characteristics; (2) the experiences of women in science and mathematics at all educational levels; (3) the differing experiences and characteristics of Blacks, Asians, Native Americans, and Hispanics in the U.S. science and engineering population; (4) minority experience in U.S. educational institutions; and (5) the employment characteristics of persons with  physical disabilities in the U.S. science and engineering population. Appendices include technical notes and statistical tables. (CW)",

There was considerable ambivalence among the Founding Fathers as to what was the appropriate role for the judiciary, an ambivalence that has continued to the present day. Some regarded the new federal judiciary as a potentially dangerous instrument, while others believed that judicial power would be limited as compared with that of the legislative and the executive powers. The relatively weak power of the Supreme Court was enhanced tremendously by Chief Justice John Marshall and the case of Marbury v. Madison which asserted the Court's power of judicial review. The federal court system evolved to  meet the needs of the expanding nation. Many judicial issues remain controversial today, including what should guide federal judges in their interpretation of the Constitution, the procedure for selecting and confirming federal judges, and whether there is a need for more courts and more judges to meet the growing mass of litigation.

College-Community Forums are designed to further discussion of the constitutional issues that shape the nation's government. The Forums are based on traditional town meetings where citizens voice their opinions on matters of local concern. This handbook was written as part of a Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution program to fund a limited number of Forums.

The guide discusses the several aspects of organizing a Forum: purpose, format, meeting space, selecting panelists, audience, media coverage, finances and fundraising, topics and content, and evaluation.

This view is grounded in the definition of geography that is developed through five themes: location, place, relationship within places, movement, and regions. According to this view, only a very small, usually trivial, part of geography currently is taught in U.S. elementary schools. Often that part is submerged in the questionable integration of geography into the subject of social studies. Geography needs to be taught as a separate subject. The function and use of the field needs to be emphasized over the data and trivial information that for years has distorted the public image of geography. A 27-item bibliography is included. (DB)",

        "description":"Despite scholarly disagreement about the nature and purposes of social studies education, the most widely adopted elementary social studies textbook series tend to be remarkably uniform, consisting of compendia of facts organized within the expanding communities curriculum structure. Content selection and explication tend to be guided primarily by cultural literacy concerns. Texts feature parades of facts rather than networks of information gathered around an idea. Skills are taught largely in isolation from one another with little attention to knowledge content, and values are approached primarily through inculcation rather than through critical thinking and decision making. The textbook series that dominate the market share these and other similarities, so that in effect they  constitute a de facto national curriculum in elementary social studies. This report presents a detailed analysis of a representative sample of these curricula: Silver Burdett & Ginn's elementary social studies series, 1988 edition. The study, a qualitative analysis, was guided by a set of framing questions that called for an examination of the goals and intended outcomes, the content selection and representation choices, the coherence of content explication in the student text, the suggestions made to the teacher about questions to ask the students, the kinds of classroom discourse that should occur, the nature of the activities and assignments provided with the test or recommended to the teacher, the purposes and nature of the evaluation methods supplied or recommended, and the nature  and extent of the rationales and other explanatory material in the teacher's manual.

The experts were asked to treat the topic comprehensively by addressing issues of curriculum (goals and objectives, selection and organization of content); instruction (presentation of input to students, teacher-student discourse, activities and assignments); and evaluation (formal and informal assessment of student progress toward key goals before, during, and after instruction). The experts addressed these issues in the context of both ideal programs (as outlined in their responses to a set of questions about what ideal curriculum, instruction, and evaluation practices in elementary programs would look  like) and typical current practice (as outlined in their responses to questions calling for a critique of one of the most widely adopted elementary social studies curriculum series). This report first summarizes the positions articulated by the six experts considered individually, then compares the responses of the three professors treated as a group with those of the three teachers treated as a group. In the discussion, these group contrasts are considered with reference to their implications concerning the differences in purview between university-based scholars and elementary school teachers who share interests in social education. Finally, points of agreement between the two groups are considered with reference to their implications concerning ideal elementary social studies programs.  (Author)",

The oneset of the debt crisis in 1982 generated fears regarding the future of democracy in Latin America. The focus on the assembled experts was on the role of external pressures and the impact of U.S. policy, such as the Baker and Brady Plans, and of international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The United States can no longer control events in Latin America. The question now is how best to use the influence and resources that remain. Since the Cold War has ended, the United States now should support countries without fear of expansion of Soviet influence in the region. There was  broad agreement among the participants that for Latin America to grow and develop, additional debt relief or loans should be granted by Europe, Japan, and Canada, and other industrialized countries should be encouraged to provide economic resources that are tied to economic reforms.

The group's discussion highlighted five major areas of uncertainty over China's course in the short-term to intermediate future: (1) the extent of changes in Chinese life caused by the abrupt political changes of May and June 1989, and the eroding economy; (2) understanding key relationships within the Chinese military and between the military and civilian leaders; (3) how much change has occurred in the balance of power between the center in Beijing and the provinces; (4) the degree of consolidation of power by China's current leaders; and (5) the effect of stricter  central economic policies on the long-term performance of the economy. The keynote address by Richard H. Stanley, which is given in full, asked the conferees to consider two underlying issues in their deliberations: (1) the changing national power relationships including the relative erosion of U.S. power; and (2) the profound global systemic changes that are rendering old policy assumptions obsolete.

The round-table discussion summarized in this report focused on the future of Africa and the changing global context of U.S. policy toward Africa. While the Cold War has ended, in Africa there is little understanding of what that change in policy means for Africa, for the United States, and for policies toward Africa. The group generally agreed that the United States and the Soviet Union must play a greater role in providing assistance and support for reconstruction in the Sudan, Angola, Ethiopia, and Mozambique. It was also agreed, however, that in economic terms the superpowers have never been the dominant  force in Africa, that Europe as a whole has always contributed more in development assistance to Africa than has the United States, and that as a result of trends over that past decade, the U.S. is becoming an even less influential force in Africa.

The use of systematic instructional technology, an increase in social interactions with nonhandicapped persons, active parent involvement, and transitional planning with community recreation agencies are the major aims of the project. The users of the curriculum are encouraged to teach the skill sequences in natural community settings so as to increase the likelihood of generalization, as well as the opportunity for actual community participation. The  activities of the curriculum plan are organized into four units: (1) sports and fitness; (2) outdoor education; (3) physical recreation; and (4) games and creative arts. Each of the activities includes a goal statement, assessments, lead-up strategies, and suggested objectives for full and partial participation. Entry/Exit checklists of specific skills to be mastered, scored by levels of teacher assistance needed, are included in the curriculum. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper addresses some theoretical implications regarding the concept of spirituality and offers some practical suggestions for including spiritual health in the health education program. A traditionally accepted model of health (Hettler, 1979), the six dimensions of wellness are the intellectual, emotional, physical, social, occupational, and spiritual dimensions. In this model, spiritual health is considered as one of six equally important dimensions of wellness. A contrasting view, however, is that spiritual health is the source of all the other dimensions, and that spirituality is the over-arching umbrella covering all of the other aspects of health, representing the essence of who and what the individual is. An activity is outlined that provides students with an  opportunity to discuss thoughts about spirituality as presented by a variety of authors. An individual's selection of a quotation is assumed to be guided by a personal understanding and view of spirituality. The quotation is read within the group and each student expresses an interpretation of the meaning and implications for spiritual health. The activity culminates with guided discussion by the entire group. The 14 quotations, and their sources, are appended along with 5 transparency masters. (JD)",

        "description":"The school curriculum has been under scrutiny in an attempt to improve the educational experiences of children, often in the form of federal and state control to make schools accountable for students' education. The goal of standardization is to increase minimum standards in all classrooms and to make sure that all students receive a foundation of basic skills. Yet, the result has often been to deny teachers the opportunity to use their professional skills as curriculum planners. When the curriculum is controlled by outsiders, the teachers' roles are reduced to being managers of the learning process. This study investigated the effects of the standardization of a curriculum in one school in a small midwestern public school district, the resulting influences on the implementation  process, the deskilling and reskilling of teachers who use the curriculum, and teachers' compliance with and resistance to this process. The fall 1988 study focuses on one fifth-grade classroom in an elementary school that is working toward regulating the curriculum in an attempt to give students uniformity via a predetermined scope and sequence of activities. To this end, a mastery learning program has been established. Classroom observations and interviews with teachers are reported and questions are raised on the trend of a movement away from teachers as curriculum planners in favor of curriculum standardization.

In addition to pedagogy, the professional dimension of undergraduate preparation should emphasize \"educology,\" i.e., knowledge and understanding of the sociological, economic, legal, and political realities that prevail in the larger society. Each of the disciplines, pedagogy and educology, would consist of subdisciplines. Pedagogy would consist of methodologies in each of the subjects taught in the schools, audio-visual practices, classroom management strategies, measurement and evaluation, computer applications, etc. Educology would consist of such subdisciplines as history of education, philosophy of education, curriculum theory,  theories of learning, economics, politics, anthropology, sociology of education, and policy studies. These areas of intellectual development, traditionally associated with the foundations of education, have been an essential dimension of the preparation of prospective teachers and must continue to be so.

        "description":"This paper describes and analyzes five conceptual orientations that have dominated the thinking of teacher educators in this century: (1) academic; (2) personal; (3) technological; (4) practical; and (5) critical/social. Loosely connected to views of teaching, learning, and/or learning to teach, these conceptual orientations represent sets of ideas about the ends and means of teacher education. The academic orientation focuses attention on the distinctive work of teachers. The personal orientation gives primary attention to the teacher as a person and learner. Technological and practical orientations reflect different ideas about the character of teaching and the sources of knowledge about teaching. The critical orientation focuses on the contexts of schooling, highlighting the  teacher's obligations to pupils and society. To illustrate how these ideas have influenced teacher education practice, examples of specific programs or program components accompany the discussion of each orientation. The paper concludes with a discussion of the values and limits of the conceptual orientations framework as a guide to program development. (JD)",

The purpose of the extensive survey was to provide information on the program of school human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) education efforts led by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Results revealed that CDC-led nationwide education efforts are not yet commensurate with the epidemic's potential for disaster. While two-thirds of the nation's public school districts provide formalized HIV education, it is not offered at every grade level, especially the upper grades, where the probability of sexual activity is highest. Most CDC-funded education departments do not collect from students the essential planning and monitoring information needed  to set program priorities and evaluate successes. This is due to a lack of staff and difficulty in obtaining community support to collect sensitive sexual and drug-use data. Although the majority of HIV teachers did receive training, it was often insufficient, and one of five HIV teachers received no training at all. CDC provides no guidance to districts on the appropriate length of such teacher training. Recommendations are made for improving the programs. Information in the appendixes includes: excerpts from CDC's guidelines, CDC's suggested questions for students, and topics covered in inservice training in CDC-funded districts and nationwide. Four tables and 4 figures are included. (JD)",

        "description":"This study sought to determine if the Fuller Teacher Concerns Theory explains the development of first-year teachers with and without mentors and of reentry teachers with and without mentors. The Fuller Theory identified three stages of concern as teachers develop professionally: self-survival, teaching tasks, and impact on students. Data were gathered in three semistructured interviews with four groups of teachers categorized as beginning teachers with and without mentors and reentry teachers with and without mentors. Interviews were conducted in October 1986, and February and May 1987. Data indicated changes in concerns in the four groups of teachers over the school year. Although all four groups initially identified considerable concern about discipline, this concern declined  during the year. First-year teachers with mentors showed a decline in concern for self and task and an increase in impact concerns over the first year. Those without mentors also showed decrease in self concerns and increase in impact concerns, but remained at the same level for task concerns throughout the year. Reentry teachers with mentors showed limited development; reentry teachers without mentors made the greatest progress through the stages of the Fuller Teacher Concerns Theory. Questions are raised on how closely mentor teachers should work with mentees and when that support should be withdrawn. (JD)",

The Delaware study was also intended to allow comparisons to be made between national and Delaware data. The sampling frame consisted of all 142 regular public schools in Delaware classified by both school level and type of locale. A total of 465 teachers were surveyed. A comparison between the findings of the two surveys indicated: (1) Delaware teachers more frequently report that the amount of disruptive behavior has increased over the past 5 years; (2) proportionately more Delaware teachers report that they have considered leaving teaching due to student misbehavior; (3) a  majority of teachers both nationwide and within Delaware report that while student misbehavior has little impact on their teaching, it does interfere with effective student learning; and (4) junior and senior high school teachers both nationwide and in Delaware report a higher incidence of disciplinary infractions or drug/alcohol use among students than do teachers at the elementary level; (5) a higher percentage of Delaware teachers report having been threatened by students; and (6) teachers nationwide and in Delaware have similar perceptions of the factors limiting their ability to maintain discipline, of school discipline policies, and of actions to improve school discipline.

The evaluation of diverse approaches to teacher assessments is intended to identify the most promising ways in which a comprehensive assessment of teacher candidates could inform the certification process and contribute to the quality of teaching. The introduction to this document presents a review of literature on new teachers, focusing on the incompleteness of preservice training, problems of new teachers, and differences between novice and expert teachers. Specific contributions of the spring 1989 round of pilot testing are discussed. The purpose of the pilot testing was to examine in California the functioning of several  assessment instruments which are considered to be promising exemplars of innovative assessment approaches. The evaluation of the various components of these instruments (e.g., logistical requirements, prompt materials, scoring criteria, training exercises for assessors) was intended to provide information concerning the strengths and limitations of the assessment approaches which specific instruments represented. This final report and analysis of the pilot test administration describes each of the instruments, and the ease of administration, scoring, content and format, costs, and technical qualities. (JD)",

This critical analysis clarifies how the ways people communicate both influence and are influenced by the structures and forces of social institutions, e.g., schools, universities, unions, and school boards. How the ideology of professionalism operates is illustrated by examining two realms of authority related to schooling: (1) organization-management authority over schools (characteristically, political and social); and (2) educational authority within the schools (substance matters, such as curriculum content, pedagogy, etc.). The analysis concurs with findings  of other researchers that even relatively neutral statements reflect acts of valuation. It is concluded that the interests served in the process of professionalizing teaching may not include the interests of the teachers themselves. To further these interests, teachers will have to regain control over the curriculum as well as school organization issues and develop a much stronger voice in the production of knowledge about teaching.

        "description":"Concern for coherence in European teacher education is fueled by changes in political organization and teacher mobility. \"Coherence\" is a value-laden concept, yet its meaning is unclear. In the United States, advocates of coherence assume that a tightly connected set of experiences is needed to give teacher education programs sufficient power. Both \"coherence\" and \"program\" have positive associations with harmony and wholeness. The difficulties with \"program\" and \"coherence\" in the U.S. context are suggested by the term's historical associations with behaviorism and the pursuit of efficiency. Single-minded planning for particular program effects may crowd out other goals and compromise the idea of educational progress. Rather than adopting the metaphors of force historically  associated with program coherence, teacher educators should consider metaphors of light, especially the metaphor of a sparkling diamond. This metaphor implies that education has many facets, which provide light when seen from a variety of perspectives. Teacher education, as this metaphor suggests, can benefit from the incorporation of variegated ideas and practices, among which different patterns of connection may be drawn. Program coherence can be valuable if it helps students build interconnections while also inviting a reweaving of beliefs and ties to what is as yet unknown. (Author)",

The analysis challenges two common assumptions about becoming a secondary school mathematics teacher: (1) that people who major in mathematics without emphasis on education are more capable and know more than their mathematics education peers; and (2) that professional knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge are best acquired through practical experience as a teacher, university-based teacher education being unable to make practical or significant contributions to what teachers need to know or be able to do. Yet, despite structural and philosophical  differences between university and alternate route programs, the novice teachers across the two groups were much the same. Neither the teacher education students nor the teacher trainees in the sample were well prepared to unpack meanings of mathematical ideas on the basis of their studies. Neither program had any consistently strong impact on novice teachers' ideas about the teacher's role or about desirable practices in teaching mathematics. Many in both groups were unable to represent basic content in meaningful ways at the end of their programs. The supposed advantage of teaching experience in the case of the alternate route teachers did not emerge as a significant factor in this study. (Author/JD)",

Two inservice programs that aim to effect radical change in teachers' practices are examined, one focusing on the teaching of mathematics and the other on the teaching of writing. Drawing on data from interviews and questionnaires, as well as on observations of program staff members' work with teachers, the study analyzes how each program construed its subject matter and the role that subject matter knowledge was assigned relative to other kinds of knowledge and skills in helping participating teachers learn to teach mathematics or writing differently. The analysis shows that, for the most part, developing teachers' subject matter knowledge was not  a top priority for either program. There seem to be two reasons for this situation. First, although both programs were centered on teaching a particular subject, the goals of the program staff encompassed fundamental changes in the roles of teachers and students and in teachers' views of learning and of learners. That participating teachers' knowledge of mathematics or writing tended to be thin underlies a second reason why staff members in both programs chose to emphasize other kinds of knowledge. The paper concludes with questions about choices faced by those who aim to change elementary teachers' practices in teaching mathematics or writing and the role of subject matter knowledge in learning to teach.

Hypermedia combines elements of multimedia environments for learning and teaching with a recent development in computer software called \"hypertext,\" a representation of multiple and flexible links between discrete pieces of data that allows users to navigate along multiple paths through a network of chunks of information and to build and store their own links. A hypermedia tool can make it possible to access and link video representations of a year's worth of teaching and learning in two mathematics classrooms from teachers' and students' perspectives. It  will include video and textual representations of teachers' thinking about both the mathematical content and the pedagogical decisions involved in their work, graphic and textual representations produced by students of their mathematical reasoning processes, and video and textual annotations which analyze lessons from the perspective of relevant academic disciplines. Hypermedia can give teacher education students an experience that is close to observing good mathematics lessons in real classrooms and then give them the opportunity to analyze those lessons with the teacher who taught them.

Two models were developed and tested. One model included student expectations and attributions of responsibility as mediators between social class and achievement. This model was compared to one using teacher expectations and attributions of responsibility as mediators between social class and achievement. The population contained 5,829 third-grade students from 76 Louisiana public schools from all parts of the state and 250 teachers. Results of LISREL analysis on the student model suggest that there was a significant negative relationship  between SES and student expectations. Student SES significantly affected student attribution of responsibility, and the path between SES and student achievement was significant. Student attribution of responsibility was a significant predictor of achievement. The relationship between SES and teacher expectations was positive and highly significant. However, teacher expectations were not a significant predictor of teacher attributions of responsibility, and teacher attributions of responsibility were not a significant predictor of achievement. Results indicate the need for more information about how teachers' attributions of responsibility can be affected and how this relates to instruction and student achievement.

L-scaling is introduced as a technique for determining the weights. The technique is so named because of its resemblance to the Leontief matrix of mathematical economics. L-scaling is compared to two widely-used procedures for data reduction, but no attempt is made to survey the voluminous literature on scaling methods. These methods are the first principal component method and the best weight function method. A robust L-scaling technique is described for use when the data matrix is contaminated by outliers. The discussion proceeds in terms of descriptive statistics since the various techniques have sampling properties that are either unknown or intractable.  The technique is illustrated with a hypothetical example of 100 observations on three variables drawn from a pseudorandom-number generator. L-scaling is one method a researcher may apply when a sensitivity analysis, which compares the outcomes of several scaling methods, is desired. Four tables illustrate the study. (SLD)",

        "description":"The results of classifying test items on the basis of their Mantel-Haenszel (MH) alpha estimates were compared to the results of classifying these items using an item response theory (IRT) based procedure involving the comparison of item difficulties in the interest of identifying the alpha value that maximized the decision concordance between the two methods. The data consisted of candidates' responses to 299 scored items on an examination for professional licensure. A total of 68,458 candidates took this examination in 1988. The candidates' ethnicity was determined by their self-classifications into one of seven categories. A total of 47,573 candidates classified themselves in Ethnic Group 1; 6,486 in Ethnic Group 2; 5,466 in Ethnic Group 3; 2,004 in Ethnic Group 4; 1,014 in  Ethnic Group 5; 486 in Ethnic Group 6; 307 in Ethnic Group 7; 726 as &quot;other&quot;; and the remaining 4,396 candidates did not specify their ethnicity. All candidates except the 4,396 who did not classify themselves were used for the MH analyses; for the IRT analyses, random samples of candidates were drawn from the four largest ethnic groups, while all candidates from the smaller groups were used. Candidates were divided into score groups. In both analyses, the majority ethnic group became the reference group and the other ethnic groups were designated focal. The MH estimate of alpha indicated that no differential item functioning was detected. Statistics resulting from IRT methods correlated highly with MH alpha values. Using the MH method in conjunction with IRT methods resulted in cutscores  with a high level of decision concordance with advantages over traditional methods of using a significance level to establish an alpha criterion. Eight tables and eight figures provide study data. (SLD)",

The LSP yields independent scores on 24 discrete elements of learning style. Its purpose is to provide educators with a well-validated and easy to use instrument for diagnosing cognitive styles, perceptual response tendencies, and study and instructional preferences of middle level and senior high school students. The LSP offers school practitioners a way to personalize the instructional process, identify the dominant stylistic characteristics of students, and plan instruction accordingly. This practical guide presents exercises to enhance the cognitive skills diagnosed by the LSP. The exercises, which draw on sample items from  the LSP, are designed to augment each of the following areas: (1) analytic skill; (2) spatial skill; (3) discrimination skill; (4) categorization skill; (5) sequential processing skill; (5) simultaneous processing skill; (6) memory skill; and (7) verbal-spatial preference. Grade-level designations are listed for each activity. Appendix A provides a key to complicated performance activities, and Appendix B presents a LSP interpretation form. (SLD)",

The decision validity of the STRST was also examined. Subjects were 125 fifth-grade and 125 sixth-grade students who were administered the STRST in a test and retest. The STRST contains 13 items on scientific skills domain and 13 items within the logical thinking domain. Applying generalizability theory to the data resulted in the observed score variance being partitioned in two ways, identifying different sources of error and their relative magnitudes. Test domain was one of the large variance components of the total score variance, a finding suggesting that test scores  should be interpreted from the separate domain scores rather than from the total score. The interaction effect for persons and items within test domains suggests the possibility of biased item sampling. Findings from the generalizability study further imply that the number of test items should be increased to more than 20 in each domain to attain satisfactory generalization of the STRST into its universe. Recommendations for improvement of the STRST are presented. Nine tables present study data, and two figures illustrate the research designs. (SLD)",

Two forms of an instrument consisting of 25 teaching problem situations were developed: one required self-referenced responses, while the other required norm-referenced responses. The two forms were randomly distributed to 65 classroom teachers enrolled in graduate classes at the University of Florida (Gainesville). In addition, two items measuring teacher efficacy from a Rand Corporation study and the Marlowe-Crowne Scale of Social Desirability were administered. Efficacy appears to be a norm-referenced, rather than a self-referenced, construct. Teachers appear to evaluate their effectiveness in terms of  their performance in comparison to the performance of other teachers.

Passing scores produced by individual judges using a modified version of the procedure of W. H. Angoff (1971) were compared with the same judges' passing scores as revised after considering information on the number of examinees who would pass and fail at various cut-score levels in several testing situations. The 7 instruments, each with a corresponding committee of experts, included: (1) 4 basic skills examinations in reading and mathematics for students in grades 6 and 8; (2) 2 tests in reading and mathematics for college underclassmen; and (3) a 51-item observation checklist that is used to assess the classroom performance of beginning public school  teachers. In all, 161 judges participated. Knowledge of examinee pass/fail rates did not have a consistent effect on the average level of passing scores set by the groups of expert judges. The observed reduction in the variability of the experts' passing scores, together with the high negative correlations between initial cut scores and the magnitudes of subsequent revisions, suggested that judges with more extreme Angoff passing scores tended to shift toward more typical/moderate positions. Information about examinee pass/fail rates may serve as a reality check in the evaluation process. Five data tables are included. (SLD)",

Using simulation methodology, four parameters were manipulated for the two-group design: (1) ratio of population variances; (2) distribution form; (3) sample size; and (4) population mean difference. As a general solution to the group variance inequality problem, the results of this study do not provide sufficient evidence to recommend any single analysis approach. While the rank transform approach was less sensitive to variance inequality than was the parametric ANOVA F-ratio, unacceptably high Type I error rates were obtained when cell frequencies and group variances were inversely related. With equal cell frequencies or when cell frequencies were directly  related to group variances, appropriate Type I error rates were obtained. Under these conditions, the Brown-Forsythe procedure for comparing group means provided greater power except when the sampled distribution was leptokurtic. It is contended that before computing hypothesis tests, researchers should first obtain descriptive summary statistics to determine the sample distribution characteristics and to use this information to guide their choice of analysis procedures.

The major support for this suggestion rests on asymptotic theory. An empirical analysis of the RNST performed under the F and Chi-square distributions is reported. A descriptive exploratory design was used. Monte Carlo methods were used to generate the data and to describe their characteristics. Two sample sizes were investigated. For the smaller sample size of 2 observations per cell, 42 treatment combinations of main effects and interactions were investigated. For the larger sample size of 20 observations per cell, 26 treatment combinations were studied. Results were charted  in 390 tables; 7 of these tables are included as a representative sample. The RNST was shown to be non-robust and not a powerful alternative to the ANOVA test in the balanced 2x2x2 layout for various population distributions, sample sizes, and nominal alpha levels selected. A suitable alternative to ANOVA under conditions of non-normal distributions is still required. (SLD)",

Study participants included 40 teacher interns and their respective second-, third-, and fifth-grade classes from a school district served by the University of South Florida (Tampa). Class size ranged from 20 to 30 students. Two measures of teacher behavior and a measure of student task engagement were obtained during lessons from 2-week instructional units designed specifically for the study. Achievement was defined as the class mean residualized gain score, residualizing student posttest scores on both content pretest performance and scores on the relevant subtests of the  Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills. Results suggest different causal paths from teacher behavior to achievement in the two contexts. In social studies classes, task engagement emerged as a mediating variable as hypothesized, while in mathematics classes, task engagement played no causal role in achievement.

        "description":"This study addresses attrition in the teaching profession, a major problem in Florida's schools. The study's target population was a random sample of 10% of the teachers from a Florida metropolitan school district employing 5,500 teachers. Data were gathered through a mailed questionnaire--the Survey of Teacher Characteristics and Activities. The survey assessed their long-range teaching plans, demographic characteristics, current work conditions, professional activities, and educational views. The return rate was 53%; of the 310 respondents, 127 were elementary school teachers, 70 were middle school teachers, 86 were high school teachers, and 27 were adult vocational-technical/other school teachers. The responses of teachers who planned to quit teaching (31%) were compared with  those of teachers who planned to continue teaching. Fifty-eight respondents, who were over 50 years old, were excluded from the study based on the assumption that their responses were largely related to plans to retire. Results from the 242 teachers under the age of 50 years, who responded to a question concerning their long-range teaching plans, indicate that, as compared to teachers who were planning to remain in teaching, teachers who were contemplating changing careers were less comfortable with their working condition, more negative about teaching and education, and more involved in professional associations. Interest in administrative/supervisory positions and years of teaching experience did not appear to significantly influence decisions regarding continuation of a teaching  career. Fourteen data tables are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"This exploratory study evaluated the effects of using word processors to aid fourth- and fifth-graders in developing writing skills. The study focused on the Developmental Writing Program of the Hillsborough County (Florida) School District. A pre-study assessment indicated that, although students wrote well, they were reluctant to revise and edit their compositions. Word processing technology was used as a means of motivating and easing revision. Three fifth-grade and three fourth-grade teachers and their classes were included in the treatment group; the treatment group was matched with a control group who did not use word processors in association with writing instruction. A total of 204 students in 12 classes and 12 teachers constituted the study sample. Both teachers and  students received training in the use of word processors. Formative evaluation results suggest that the compositions of students in the treatment group improved more than those in the control group. An analysis of students' composition revision characteristics indicates that students who used word processors made more revisions and that their revisions were more meaningful than those of students who did not use word processors. Teachers were also strongly influenced by the innovative program. One data table is included. (TJH)",

The results and analyses of reading and mathematics assessments are presented. Important trends are described based on the analysis of data from 1985, 1987, and 1989. The 1989 information provides the first comprehensive look at student achievement in the Essential Learning Skills (ELS) strategies and basic skills that are a vital part of the new effort toward a common curriculum core in Oregon schools. Overall, Oregon eighth graders had slightly lower mathematics achievement than in 1987, with a decrease in computation scores, an increase in higher level math skills, and a more heterogeneous mixture of achievement levels. While Oregon  students generally performed near the international median in the Second International Mathematics Study, they were slightly above United States levels and lower than Japanese scores. Reading test results were equivalent to 1987 scores, with gains in some areas. Significant gains were made from 1987 to 1989 in literal understanding, locating information, and implied understanding. The use of a &quot;complete story&quot; passage on the 1989 test was found effective. Seven figures and three tables are included. An Appendix contains one form of the reading test. (SLD)",

Twelve students attending the Teachers College at Columbia University (New York) participated in the first of two experiments; and 10 students attending the same Teachers College participated in the second experiment and were randomly assigned to five dyads. The first experiment used a quantified protocol in which spontaneous hand movements were considered evidence of modeling; dramatic reductions in reaction time were evidence of rule induction. The second experiment organized subjects into problem-solving dyads. The inductive movement between analog models and number-based rules was documented  for problems about gear movement. It was found that subjects rely initially upon an analog model until a satisfactory rule is induced. However, when a problem was introduced that led to failure of the rule, subjects returned to a model. Exophoric references were used as evidence that subjects were reasoning about models. Numeric expressions were taken as evidence of rule induction under the logic that the rule operates over numbers rather than gears. The strengths of each type of reasoning are discussed. Models are conceptualized as a quasi-empirical base from which to draw the basic patterns and relevant parameters for rule induction. Three figures are included. (TJH)",

More specifically, the study: compared the academic (achievement and educational attainment) and affective (educational aspirations) outcomes of retained and non-retained students, compared the academic and affective (including self-efficacy) outcomes of early and late retained students; assessed potential factors influencing the success stories in retention; examined the contribution of sex and socioeconomic status (SE); and identified areas for more detailed inquiry. The cohort of high school sophomores was assessed in 1980 and reassessed in 1982, 1984, and 1986. A total of 1,015 schools were selected for the  sample, and 36 seniors and 36 sophomores were randomly selected in each school. In those schools with fewer than 36 seniors and/or sophomores, all eligible students were included in the sample. Participants in all 4 waves of the survey included 13,425 students, of which 1,469 had been retained at some point in their scholastic careers. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSSX) was used to conduct descriptive and inferential statistical procedures used to analyze the data. Variables were either items drawn directly from the HSB data or composite variables. Results indicate that there are some success stories for retained students. Slightly fewer than half of the higher SES students who were retained scored above the median on the sophomore achievement measure, whereas fewer  than 20% of the lower SES retained students scored above the median on the achievement composite. Gender also played a part in retention decisions and outcomes. Five data tables are included. (TJH)",

Specifically, the study focused on: (1) determining an initial first-order structure of the BDI based on Group 1 (n=196); (2) postulating and testing alternative first-order structures using CFA procedures based on Group 2 (n=284), on the basis of EFA findings; (3) testing for the validity of a hierarchical structure that includes a single second-order factor of general depression; and (4) cross-validating plausible first-order and second-order structures across  Group 3 (n=205) using double cross-validation procedures to identify models having the highest degree of predictive validity. Based on these three increasingly stringent tests of the BDI, the findings suggest that, for non-clinical adolescents, the most appropriate factorial structure comprises a higher-order general factor of depression, with three first-order factors--negative attitudes, performance, and somatic elements.

Males generally performed better at the upper percentile  levels in vocabulary and mathematics problem solving, and females performed better at lower percentile levels in all content areas, as well as at all percentile levels of the score distribution and across all grades for the language usage area. Developmental patterns of differences between male and female performance appeared when different ability levels were examined. Seven tables and five graphs present study data. (SLD)",

This paper focuses on an evaluation model that can be used when there is no comparison group and when there is no pretest. The method--Model A--used by the Chapter 1 compensatory education program is described. Model A, which uses a pretest-posttest approach, is currently applied in most of the local educational agencies in the country. The one group posttest only design is advocated, which requires content specialists to identify which objectives on the posttest were included in the compensatory curriculum versus those included only in the regular curriculum. The compensatory students should perform better on compensatory objectives to which they were exposed in both the regular  and compensatory programs than on regular curriculum objectives to which they were exposed only in the regular curriculum. Data from 2 successive years of an evaluation of a Chapter 1 program in Dallas (Texas) were analyzed. Data on 20 items were obtained from over 2,000 students each year at each grade level. The results were mixed, with third-graders performing significantly better on the district's criterion-referenced test items included in the compensatory curriculum, and second-graders performing better on items not included in the curriculum. When data for the two grades were combined, the results were in the expected direction. Results for the second year suggest that either the grade 2 compensatory curriculum or the implementation of that curriculum should be reviewed. Four  analytical methods are outlined. Two data tables and eight figures are included. (TJH)",

Three developmental projects are described that represent the indicator systems that promise to provide an explanatory framework for education. An indicator system should be perceived as an integrated whole in which the various aspects function as a system. Multiple indicators are needed to reflect the complexities of education. Any indicator system should be based on the goals, priorities, and expectations of its originating group, whether local, provincial, national, or international. The three examples that illustrate a broad perspective on indicator systems that attempt to embed student outcomes in the context of the educational system are: (1) the  International Educational Indicators Project focusing on Australia, the United States, France, Austria, the Netherlands, and Canada; (2) the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada School Achievement Indicators Project; and (3) the Educational Quality Indicators Project of Alberta (Canada).

        "description":"The major objectives and benefits of the Advanced Placement Program (APP) are summarized, and data specific to Delaware are compared to national statistics about advanced placement (AP) courses in high schools. School participation in the APP is considered an indicator of academic success by educators and policy makers. The extent to which Delaware students participated in the May 1988 AP examinations and their success rates by subject area are provided. AP course offerings in Delaware public high schools and their 1988-89 enrollments by subject area are presented. Data are provided for 463 public and 526 non-public school students taking a total of 1,397 examinations. Delaware has a very high non-public involvement in AP examinations, with over half of those sitting for AP  examinations representing non-public schools. Public school participation is increasing at about five times the rate of non-public participation. The state mean for all candidates exceeded the national mean by about 0.2 point. About 60% of Delaware's full-time public high schools provide AP courses. Twenty-seven percent of the examinations taken by public school students were in mathematics and science, 59% in English and social sciences, 12% in computer science, and 2% in foreign languages. Thirty-five percent of the examinations taken by non-public school students were in mathematics and science, 44% in English and social sciences, 8% in computer science, 11% in foreign languages, and 2% in art and music. Seven data tables are included. (SLD)",

The program, established by legislation in 1977 and amended in 1983 and 1987, provided for the administration of examinations of proficiency and achievement in reading, writing, and mathematics before the completion of grades 3, 6, 9, and 12. It also permitted the adoption of different standards of proficiency for students with diagnosed learning disabilities. The first of two major assessment efforts under the program involves the administration of a nationally normed standardized test of academic achievement in reading and mathematics in the third, sixth, and ninth grades; in language in the third and sixth grades; and in writing in the ninth grade. These tests are intended to  identify those students who might require additional assistance in order to maintain the typical pattern of promotion through the grades. The second major assessment effort involves testing of all 11th-graders in reading, mathematics, and writing, using state-developed minimum competency examinations. Eleventh-graders must pass all three examinations to graduate with a diploma; students have a total of four opportunities to pass the 11th-grade examinations. Texts of statute mandating the testing program, scoring guides for the writing assessment, and common test score scales used in education are appended. Three bar graphs and six data tables are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"In 1989-90, 73,793 surveys were administered to students, teachers, other campus professionals, campus administrators, and parents in the Austin (Texas) Independent School District (AISD). This report addresses findings related to key topics associated with school strengths, problems, and quality as well as school climate and effectiveness. Survey items were submitted by AISD central office personnel and Office of Research and Evaluation program staff. Cabinet members make final decisions on item selection for student, parent, and professional staff surveys. Overall, 93 items were distributed in November of 1989 to 14,973 students, with 87% (13,076) of all surveys being returned. The 1989-90 professional employee survey was organized into two distinct sections, with a total of  326 survey items. Surveys were sent to 4,110 teachers, 533 administrators, and 436 other school professionals, with 3,985, 485, and 390 surveys returned, respectively. The 15-item elementary school survey was administered to 27,602 parents, and 14,668 surveys were returned. The 21-item secondary school survey was administered to 27,409 parents, and 2,044 surveys were returned. Generally, the findings indicate that: (1) high school students, professionals (including teachers and campus administrators), and parents have positive views about the quality and effectiveness of AISD schools; (2) AISD students and parents identified problems associated with drug use, school facilities, and class size as requiring attention; and (3) 2-year comparisons of responses by professionals to items on  school climate and effectiveness revealed continued positive opinions among elementary and middle school professionals, but a more negative outlook among high school professionals. Thirty-eight figures are included. (TJH)",

Chapter 2 Formula provides federal funds to the states through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 as amended in 1988. Chapter 2 funds can support programs that meet the educational needs of students with special needs; acquire curricular materials; improve schools through innovative programs; train staff; enhance student achievement through instruction and community service; or provide early childhood education, gifted and talented education, technology education, community education, and/or youth suicide prevention programs. AISD received $531,021 and in addition, $106,208 was rolled forward from 1988-89 for a grand total  of $637,229. Funds have been allocated to the following programs and services: (1) the Academic Decathlon; (2) Blanton Wicat Computer Lab; (3) Bridge Computer Lab at Webb; (4) Comprehensive Competencies Program at Johnston; (5) extracurricular transportation; (6) library resources (dictionaries); (7) middle schools training; (8) pre-kindergaretn supplements; (9) private school programs; (10) Project ASSIST; (11) Rainbow Kits; (12) school-community liaison augmentation; (13) secondary remediation support; (14) administration and management activities; and (15) evaluation services. This report provides descriptions, discussions of implementation, salient characteristics, and evaluation methods and results of the various programs and services, as appropriate. Based largely on AISD  districtwide staff surveys administered in January and February of 1990, 100% of the respondents rated the private school programs as effective, 29% rated Project ASSIST as effective, and between 41% and 89% of the respondents rating the remaining programs as effective.

        "description":"The progress of sixth-graders in elementary and middle schools was compared in terms of achievement test scores, attendance, discipline, and grade point average. Three groups of sixth-graders from the Austin schools were examined: (1) 1987-88 sixth-graders for 3 years (grades 6, 7, and 8); (2) 1988-89 sixth-graders for 2 years (grades 6 and 7); and (3) 1989-90 sixth-graders for 1 year. When achievement, as measured by the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, was examined, the middle school transition (grade 5 to grade 6) seemed to be smoother than the junior high school transition (grade 6 to grade 7). In 1987-88, elementary school sixth-graders (ESSGs) generally performed better on achievement tests than did middle school sixth-graders (MSSGs); after 1987-88, there has been no difference  between the performance of ESSGs and MSSGs on achievement tests. When ESSGs reach the seventh grade, they do not perform as well on achievement tests as do seventh-graders who attended the sixth grade in middle schools. By grade 8, there was no difference between achievement gains of students in middle schools and junior high schools. Middle schools disciplined students at higher rates and had slightly lower attendance rates than did elementary schools. During the period from grade 6 to grade 8, the achievement gap between high and low achievers became wider in both junior high and middle schools. These findings indicate the need for vigilance in assisting students to make the necessary social and cognitive transitions from elementary to middle schools. Ten figures present study data.  (SLD)",

To assure the quality of education in these schools, a 5-year plan was developed. This report summarizes results in each of these 16 priority schools. A summary of the second year of implementation is included that focuses on outcome variables. Priority school students were achieving at higher levels than before the implementation of the plan, as demonstrated by scores on the Texas Educational Assessment of Minimum Skills, the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test--Revised. Other indicators of success in these schools  were: (1) improved attendance rates; (2) improved teacher attendance; (3) favorable parent opinion as indicated via administration of a survey; (4) favorable staff opinion; (5) a decline in the rates of teachers requesting transfers from priority schools; (6) improved gifted and talented programs; and (7) enhanced activities for multicultural education. In the third year of the plan, implementation included: full-day kindergarten at all schools; a lowered student to teacher ratio; extra support staff; and extra support and directives from the central office, including the Language Arts Mastery Program. Fifty-two tables in the text contain data about educational outcomes; and 11 attachments supplement the report. (SLD)",

        "description":"The single greatest issue facing American education today is how to improve the education of low achievers and other students at risk of school failure. Currently, elementary school students who have fallen behind academically are placed into special classes designed to eliminate those deficiencies. Students meet in a small group with either a resource specialist or an instructional aide for about half an hour each day. This half-hour is the result of a redistribution of instructional time and adds nothing to the total amount of instructional time the student receives. Most of the programs require that students be pulled out of the regular classroom to meet with a resource specialist. Those schools that use instructional aides for in-class instead of pull out programs usually do  so for the pragmatic reason that a half-day aide is cheaper to support than a full-time credentialed teacher. However, research indicates that the instructional program, not its setting, is the key to program effectiveness. The following critical strategies for improving the education of at-risk students are discussed: (1) make at-risk students a priority in the school; (2) take a comprehensive approach; (3) invest in staff development; (4) raise expectations for at-risk students; (5) provide more quality time for learning; (6) coordinate instruction for each student; and (7) intervene as early as possible.

        "description":"This study uses a multinomial logic model to examine the impact of price, quality, family income, and family characteristics on the choice of child care. Price is measured in terms of predicted expenditures on care. Quality is measured by the ratio of children to staff. The following modes of care are examined: (1) day care center or nursery school; (2) care by sitter; (3) care by relative; and (4) care by husband/partner. Statistical data on employed women (i.e., women who were either working, in training, or in school) were drawn from the 1985 wave of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth for analysis. The following summary findings are reported: (1) price is the most important factor affecting the choice of care; (2) quality of care is a significant factor in the choice of  center care; (3) family income affects how much is spent for center care, but does not affect which mode of care is chosen; and (4) the mother's earnings do not affect how much is spent on care, but do affect the mode of care chosen. The following policy implications are outlined: (1) policies that raise family income allow families who use center care to pay more for it, but are not likely to affect the mode of care chosen; (2) policies that increase the mother's income will not affect how much is spent on care, but should encourage the choice of center care over other modes; (3) policies that reduce the price of care should encourage the choice of centers and sitters; and (4) policies that raise the quality of center care are likely to encourage the choice of centers. Statistical data  are included on seven tables. A list of 33 references is appended. (FMW)",

It is intended to help those who establish training requirements, identify training problems, diagnose student learning needs, develop training programs, and evaluate program effectiveness. The development process described is considered replicable in other vocational knowledge domains. The first chapter introduces the research project that produced the document and discusses the significance of developing the design model. Chapter 2 outlines the research underlying knowledge domain development. Chapter 3 describes domain structure and development, including: identification of a goal action structure; development of a task  environment structure; and identification of domain-relevant thinking processes. Chapter 4 reports the development and validation of appropriate instructional materials. Among the eight appendices are a list of: the main goals for a goal action structure on supporting children's social development; the subgoals associated with each main goal; recommended actions for each goal and subgoal; a list contrasting actions that foster control of students with those that support students; and rules for establishing priorities among competing goals.

It proposes that several assessment approaches show promise in identifying vocational education administrator leadership attributes. Strengths and limitations associated with various leadership assessment strategies are examined. Several strategies are discussed that focus on the more subtle aspects of vocational education leadership. Use of one such strategy, the Behavioral Event Interview, is discussed in relation to an ongoing project that seeks better ways to prepare vocational education administrators. Examples of information gathered via personal interviews with practicing administrators are used  to highlight the Behavioral Event Interview's utility in applied settings.

        "description":"Changes in the economy and the workplace are changing job skill requirements and the process of skill acquisition. A study analyzed occupational trends and projections, performed case studies of four industry sectors (apparel and textile, accounting, management consulting, and software development), and reviewed research on changing skill demands and educational responses. Conflicting views of job skills emerged--whether jobs would increasingly become &quot;deskilled&quot; or require increasingly higher order skills. Intensified competition, changing demand for goods and services, and an accelerated rate of change necessitate economic restructuring. Coping with these conditions requires changes in the organization of companies and industries and in relationships between suppliers and  customers. There are implications for education and training in the changes in the relative numbers of high- and low-skilled positions, a more uncertain and less well-defined environment, and more complex interactions among people. Whether and how much of the preparation of the work force should take place in schools or the workplace is at question. One conclusion is that rather than deskilling, technological advances demand more conceptual and problem-solving abilities at all levels of the employment hierarchy. The traditional distinctions between academic and vocational education are being challenged, and learning must now be viewed as a continuous, lifelong process.

Thirty responded, for a response rate of 83.3 percent. For each theatre, the instrument sought information on the kind of theatre, the number of staff, number of paid hours worked by staff, the number of main stage and other productions performed each year, staff titles, the kinds of staff training offered, the criteria used to select productions, and activities. Those activities that were reported by more than half the respondents included developing brochures (93.3 percent), posters (86.7 percent), newspaper advertising (70 percent), radio commercials (60 percent), program notes on  performers and staff (93.3 percent), program notes on subject matter (83.3 percent), program notes on authors (76.7 percent), newspaper critiques (80 percent), public speaking by staff (76.7 percent), and postperformance receptions (66.7). Various conclusions were inferred from the data, among them that: (1) more audience education is necessary in view of the criteria for play selection, which include &quot;challenge to audience&quot;; (2) more training of volunteers is needed; (3) although theatres purport to be educational, most of their activities concern marketing or audience development; (4) there are very few education directors and volunteer coordinators in the theatres surveyed; and (5) fewer than half those surveyed do any outreach for special constituencies, including providing  Artists-in-the-schools programs.

        "description":"A model of technological training has two dimensions: level of cultural stability and employee's level of cognitive ability. Each dimension has two variables. The variables of cultural stability are (1) technological adoption and organizational adaptation and (2) structure of work and work processes. For cognitive ability, the variables are training and skills. This model suggests that successful technology adoption and organizational adaptation require a fit between culture and cognitive ability by the employees. Such a fit will enable the organization to offer the necessary training where it is needed most, thereby allowing employees to acquire the necessary skills to perform well with the new technology. The legal environment will affect the interrelationship between  technology adoption and organizational adaptation profoundly. Culture may be an important factor since labor laws may differ across provinces and most certainly between countries. Thus, action strategies employed by a company must differ due to local labor laws. In less-developed countries, firms may introduce technology and automatically lay off redundant workers in large numbers. In Canada, if technology adoption results in more than 50 layoffs within any 4-week period, the group termination falls under the Canada Labour Code and a joint committee consisting of displaced workers and management must be established to determine severance pay, retraining support, and any other compensation. The practical implication for managers is the need for an integrated training strategy considering  cultural factors. A firm must provide three types of training: job-specific training; training in company cultural habits and action strategies; and training for understanding and using the organizational culture to everyone's advantage.

The review also obtained U.S. and foreign officials' views on the program's benefits and the desirability and feasibility of expanding nation-building training in the program in such fields, for example, as medicine, engineering, and logistics. The review found that the IMET program generally complies with government policies  and procedures. However, the lack of (1) procedures for reviewing new training requirements that are added after programs are approved; (2) a system for evaluating the success of the program; and (3) guidelines for monitoring the use of IMET graduates contributes to the departments' inability to ensure that IMET funds are efficiently and effectively used. Recommendations are made for a coordinated effort between the two departments to develop procedures to remedy these defects. (KC)",

        "description":"In 1989, the New York City Division of High Schools developed three summer programs designed to meet the needs of disadvantaged students: the Institute for Career Exploration (ICE), the Basic Skills Academy/Comprehensive Competency Program (BSA/CCP), and the Career Employment Center (CEP) Summer School Program. The ICE program had three components: ICE J (Jobs), ICE-C (Cultural), and ICE C-Cultural-English as a Second Language. During the summer, 6,159 students attended ICE classes at 52 sites. Seventy-eight percent of students improved in writing, thus meeting program goals. Just under 60 percent of the students completed an occupations course for credit, just missing program objectives. The third objective--that 70 percent of the students would meet attendance requirements--was  not met. The BSA/CCP was designed to provide individualized instruction in reading, mathematics, and/or English as a second language for 100 students at 3 high schools. The program did not meet its primary objective that 70 percent of students would show a 0.4 grade level increase in these subjects; however, the program's objective of providing academic remediation was considered highly successful by staff. The CEC program provided academic remediation and enrolled homeless students in school; the program met and surpassed both of its objectives. (KC)",

Programs were implemented at schools with a student attendance rate at or below the citywide median of 87 percent. During the 1988-89 school year, 17 community-based organizations provided job-readiness training, counseling, and job placements to students in 24 targeted high schools. Overall, 6,907 students were served by the program. Eighty-four percent (5,786) received job readiness training; of the students who attended at least one readiness session, 51 percent (2,970) obtained jobs. Students worked an average of 19 weeks, had a  mean 84 percent school attendance, and passed 68 percent of courses, comparable to the previous year of the program and on a par with the general school population. However, in several schools, student program participants fared better than the rest of the students in both categories. The program was found to be effective in increasing students' job readiness and self-confidence. The quality of the program varied greatly from site to site. Recommendations were made to improve the program by expanding the job preparation/career awareness component, providing teacher/coordinators with more time to administer the program, developing a uniform monitoring plan, and creating an internship component for younger students.

It reviews the relationship of child labor to education, the relationship of child labor to social development, child labor and workplace safety, and the role of young workers in the economy. It concludes that simply relaxing child labor laws, as some states have done, to meet the needs of employers for entry-level, part-time workers in a tight job market ignores the fact that the best place children can develop those skills is in school. The report recommends placing the highest priority on protecting children and ensuring that their work experiences enhance rather than detract from their educational experience. Guaranteeing children an education will result in a  labor force of workers with the flexibility to keep up with changes in technology. At the same time, the report recommends making some changes in allowable working hours for child workers and making laws more flexible to benefit both young workers and employers. (KC)",

        "description":"A survey was distributed to 27,832 employees of 33 Portland-area businesses in 1987 to determine how many employees had responsibilities to care for elderly persons and what those responsibilities were. A total of 9,573 survey forms were returned and analyzed. The results of the survey showed that nearly one in four employees reported caring for at least one person who is 60 years of age or older. More than one-third of the caregivers also care for children under age 18 living in their homes. Compared with employees with no elder care responsibilities, caregiving employees are, on average, 5 years older, more likely to be women, and more likely to have worked longer for their present employer. Caregiving employees are not very different from employees with no elder care  responsibilities with respect to the types of positions held, whether they work full or part time, the shift they work, and their ethnicity. Caregiving tasks ranged from checking with persons on the telephone, visits, providing meals, shopping, or transportation, to complete care. Forty-two percent of the caregivers report that they are the only or main caregiver. Employees who are caregivers to the elderly generally miss more days of work, are interrupted more often at work to deal with family-related matters, and find it more difficult to combine work and family than employees with no elder care responsibilities. The findings document the potentially serious deleterious effects of elder care responsibilities for employees and as a result, their employers, and the need for employer  support in this area.

        "description":"A review of the literature on the use of the workplace as a learning site in vocational education identified alternative models used to combine workplace learning with school-based programs and identified a framework and criteria for evaluating programs using the workplace as part of their instructional process. Although there is some evidence that the use of cooperative education and internships is increasing in postsecondary schools and colleges, the basis for increased use is probably more a function of perceptions than empirical data. One of the assumptions is that work experience is a powerful motivator. Few studies have explored the contribution of experientially based work programs to the social development, educational advancement, or psychological maturity of  participants. Little research has specifically examined the link between participation in the many unique forms of work-based experiential learning and later success in the labor market. The methodology most often used to study experiential learning is self-report of participants. Little attention has been focused on postsecondary schools' use of experiential learning. There is a need to examine more closely what interns, faculty, and field supervisors do to ensure that students learn and that host organizations are appropriately served.

        "description":"This study applied previously identified cognitive theory and research to the development of an instructional design model for teaching mental aspects underlying work and family activities in a context of rapid change and high technology. The model was tested by developing a prototype, materials required by the prototype were developed, and the design was tested for effectiveness in facilitating development of the mental aspects underlying activities within the selected domain. In the development of the model, four factors were identified as particularly significant in supporting learners' knowledge construction: fidelity of the learning situation to the real world, visualization, range and depth of learners' experiences, and mediation of learners' interpretations of their  experiences. Knowledge constructed by learners was intended to: (1) integrate goals, intentions, and actions with features of the external world and domain-knowledge concepts and principles; (2) focus attention on deep-level features; (3) facilitate interpretations in terms of powerful, superordinate-level concepts and principles; and (4) support sensitivity to subtle but important variations among cases. A computer-based videodisc learning environment was developed as a prototype, and its intermediate level of instruction was tested. Findings supported the effectiveness of the learning environment in elaborating, modifying, and reorganizing knowledge structures in ways that enhance capacities to detect deep-level features and to apply knowledge in making judgments regarding actions that  fit a situation.

A modified three-phase Delphi design was used to answer two questions: (1) Is the program technology teacher education (i.e., has the change progressed to the point where the program, taken as a whole, meets the criteria for inclusion in the category of technology teacher education, rather than industrial arts, vocational, or technical teacher education)? and (2) To what degree has the program moved effectively to accomplish the change to technology teacher education in terms of the criteria established by the accrediting agencies and by the consensus of experts consulted for this research?  Initially, a panel of 22 technology education leaders was selected and asked to suggest criteria that could serve to indicate that the change to technology education had been accomplished effectively. The panel also proposed assessment procedures that could be used in the evaluation process. In the second phase, the criteria and procedures were compiled and submitted to the panel members for their rankings of the importance of the items and for their suggestions. From these responses, the assessment instrument, the Technology Teacher Education Checklist (TTEC), was developed, compared to guidelines of the International Technology Education Association, and revised. The TTEC should be useful to the faculty of a technology teacher education program or to an external evaluator in conducting  assessment of the change to technology education.

        "description":"Educational reform efforts have thus far excluded vocational education. Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in reevaluating vocational education's role in facilitating academic excellence and economic competitiveness. Inadequate basic skills remain a significant and growing problem. There is a direct relationship between basic skills and the economic well-being of individuals, families, and businesses as well as the country. A better understanding of what basic skills employers want appears necessary to identifying which skills students should be learning in school. The following benefits of integrating academic and vocational education have been observed: increased quality of vocational instruction; increased quality of academic instruction; upgraded curriculum;  improved \"coherence\" in sequencing of 4-year programs of study; improved integration and increased understanding between academic and vocational teachers; decreased segregation of academic and vocational students; and increased enthusiasm of teachers for teaching and students for learning. There is no one model for integrating academic and vocational course work that can or should be considered the best approach for all students or all schools. Care must be taken so that large groups of students, especially those most at risk of academic and economic failure, are not excluded from such efforts. (15 references) (CML)",

        "description":"The principal roles for publicly sponsored retraining programs are twofold: (1) to reduce the private and social costs associated with unnecessary delays in the reemployment process; and (2) to assist in the replacement of specific human capital lost when a permanent layoff takes place. Nine different demonstration projects and operating programs were examined through available research reports to determine how well public retraining programs for displaced workers fulfilled these roles. Programs examined included federally funded projects and programs, state retraining programs in California and Minnesota, Canadian training programs, and Australian training programs. One unambiguous finding was that job search assistance strongly affected a variety of labor market outcomes,  including earnings, placement and employment rates, and level of unemployment insurance benefits. Given its cost effectiveness, job search assistance should be the core of any adjustment assistance services offered to displaced workers. There was no clear evidence that either classroom or on-the-job training had a significant net impact on employment or earnings. (Contains 51 references, 29 tables, and an index). (CML)",

In a 2-year effort to examine the coordination of vocational education and Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs, little evidence of duplication was found. Some isolated instances of destructive competition, primarily caused by local interest group politics, were found, but evidence of substantial destructive competition in the job training system was not found. Coordination can improve program effectiveness by ensuring that contracts are awarded to the most competent providers; that resources are allocated to the most appropriate education,  training, and other job-related services; or by making possible a related set of services that are more effective than their individual components. It was found that collaborative service delivery, rather than collaborative planning, was emphasized, and that collaborative planning does not necessarily lead to the development of more effective programs through the coordination of resources. The emerging role of welfare-to-work programs in the education and training system is discussed and alternatives for federal policy and emerging issues in the &quot;system&quot; of work-related education and training are presented.

The study found that many researchers were concerned with the relationship of schooling to social inequality and suggested, explicitly or implicitly, ways of changing education toward a situation of greater equality. It also found that community education locates domination and power in the decision-making processes  that affect curriculum and instruction. Curriculum and instruction, in turn, produce in the majority of working class pupils a sense of failure and incompetence. Advocates of community education thus view the school in ways that promote combining learning with social action. However, there are theoretical objections and practical problems with community education, such as parental attitudes, power, examinations, pupil resistance, and lack of resources. These problems may stem from limitations in the implicit theory of power used by advocates of community education. (An extensive, 302-item reference list is provided in this paper.) (KC)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to describe the recent extent and distribution of work experience of young people in Scotland, using data from the Scottish Young People's Survey (SYPS). SYPS, based on a 10 percent sample of all schools in Scotland, is conducted biennially in spring by mail and achieves a response rate of around 80 percent. In the 1987 survey, 20 percent of the respondents reported that they had had a work experience placement. Analysis of earlier surveys indicated that this was the highest percentage over the past decade. The range across local education authorities for work experience was from 12 percent to 32 percent. More girls, 22 percent, went on work experience than boys, 18 percent. The 5 Technical and Vocational Education Initiative (TVEI) pilot projects  had 70 percent of their students in work experience placement. The extent of part-time work during the school term was 45 percent, compared to the 20 percent of work experience placement. A greater proportion of girls than boys had a part-time job. It is suggested that the use of students' own part-time jobs could help to achieve work experience for all students. Integrating the part-time work of some pupils into work experience provision would enable schools to concentrate on finding additional placements for the 44 percent of students who have neither part-time jobs in term-time nor go out on work experience.

Greater percentages of the labor force will be comprised of those groups that have traditionally faced the greatest barriers to full participation in the labor force. Rapid technological change is increasing the complexity of the workplace. The United States is part of an increasingly global marketplace. The U.S. Department of Labor launched the Apprenticeship 2000 initiative in December 1987 to determine what role the apprenticeship concept might play in raising the skill levels of workers. The initiative included public dialogue, a research program, and an analysis of relevant studies. Key findings included the following: (1) work-based  learning is the most effective method of skill acquisition; (2) the current apprenticeship program can be strengthened and improved, but the system should be preserved; and (3) new training program models should be developed. Recommendations included the following: credentialing structured work-based training programs; strengthening the basic apprenticeship model; and supporting and expanding structured work-based training programs, including apprenticeship.

The U.S. Department of Labor funded an exploration of the feasibility of increasing the use of JSEP as a workplace literacy tool for employers. It was found that JSEP can work in civilian environments under pilot or test site conditions; however, there were significant barriers to immediate and widespread application of JSEP in the civilian sector. The barriers included (1) incompatibility of JSEP computer systems with the most commonly used commercially available computer system; (2) high cost of work stations and other special equipment necessary to operate JSEP; (3) lack of resources to  provide sufficient technical support for both courseware and software; (4) a requirement that the programs be customized to the needs-specific occupations and employers at cost to the user; (5) an unresolved issue of control of the copyright for JSEP courseware; and (6) continued use of many Army-specific examples in the JSEP graphics and exercises that may inhibit civilian use. Further, it was found that JSEP is not a stand alone system but needs to be implemented as part of an overall workplace basic skills training system involving literacy task analysis, onsite customization, and supplemental instruction.

        "description":"Although there is little literature on the topic, there seems to be no reason why quality circles (QCs) could not be implemented in an educational organization. The most important obstacles are the seeming lack of tangible results in education, the lack of a tradition of group decision making and participative management, and the confusion over formal lines of responsibilities. QCs can be a tool for the whole organization to improve its effectiveness. QCs can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of organizational processes through effects on interpersonal and interdepartmental relationships, such as improved communication, understanding of others, and decreased absenteeism and frustrations. The inherent weakness of QCs is that they need to operate within the social effects  they are claimed to produce themselves. More and better research is needed to find the effects QCs can yield under what conditions. Theory-building is needed. Management in training and education should reconsider the QC concept and seriously balance potential benefits and caveats. (Includes 8 pages of references and 11 pages of documents reviewed.)

A process and product evaluation was carried out on the project. The process evaluation was an ongoing monitoring activity that took place while the project was being conducted; it attempted to determine if the project was being implemented as planned, whereas the product evaluation attempted to determine if the four project objectives were met. The process evaluation showed that 24 ABE students and their preschool and elementary school children participated; and it uncovered problems in  central site location, development of instruments for measuring project goals, and recordkeeping procedures. The product evaluation showed questionable success. Of the five objectives, one was met (75 percent of the preschoolers attained 75 percent of school readiness skills), one was partially met (an incentive program to promote attendance was developed), and three were not met (delivery of reading and mathematics instruction to ABE students, use of tutors to assist ABE students, and development of parenting skills). Recommendations were made to solve the transportation, day care, and other needs that participants in such programs typically have. (KC)",

A specification of a manufacturing physical modeling system was drawn up. Physical modeling provides a flexibility and configurability that encourages and demands continuous adaptation to change over time and permits demonstration of different manufacturing strategies and their appropriateness for different circumstances. Such adaptation required the involvement, cooperation, and participation among peers and staff of all relevant teaching schools, divisions, and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) head office. The adoption of the philosophies of total quality  management and world class manufacturing encourages the adoption of integrated manufacturing. Emphasis is placed on maintenance with practice in diagnosis, anticipation, prevention, and planning as well as the dynamics of human participation and cooperation in technical systems.

It represents an ongoing and participatory initiative to define current and future needs and recommend how the adult education system can meet those needs. The proposals put forth in the plan are intended to ensure that adult education will be a self-renewing institution that continually readjusts to meet the needs of a changing society. The plan proposes that education and training providers work with business, other stakeholders, and each other to make the education of adults a priority. Fourteen proposals are presented that together provide an interlinked system for delivery of education and training to adults. These proposals have been developed with the intent of achieving multiple payoffs concerning  the four goals of improving access to users, accountability, program quality and responsiveness, and planning and coordination. The report is organized in seven parts that cover the following: (1) planning for the future; (2) long-term needs for adult education; (3) today's programs and their performance; (4) focusing goals for the 21st century; (5) an image of tomorrow's adult education; (6) steps to the future; and (7) looking toward tomorrow.

EduCard, the Adult Education Access Card, is a means of giving learners access to information about educational opportunities and providing administrators with machine-readable information on learners' prior education and traiing. Three models are: (1) magnetic strip cards; (2) integrated circuit chips or &quot;smart cards&quot;; and (3) optical memory cards. An existing example, the Michigan Opportunity Card, is used by participants for skills assessment, job placement assistance, storage and retrieval of resumes, and information on training and educational services. Use of EduCard could develop into an integrated adult education data system that provides interagency information on  demographics and learning outcomes and performance. Issues and recommendations regarding EduCard use are: (1) establishment of EduCard as a multiagency statewide program; (2) protection of learner privacy; (3) selection of one type of technology (integrated circuit cards are preferred for their low cost and security); (4) voluntary rather than mandatory use by participants; (5) involvement of all stakeholders in determining liability and financial policies and procedures; and (6) adoption of a uniform, comparable career assessment model for evaluating learner data in the system.

        "description":"A survey of study behaviors was mailed to 300 adult students enrolled in two distance learning programs of The American College. The sample included three groups: high passers, low passers, and failers. The survey instrument was a 50-item rating scale measuring study practices in six areas: elaborative processing, information processing, attitude management, executive monitoring, effortfulness, and strategic test-taking. The overall return rate for the questionnaire was 66 percent. A discriminant analysis indicated that both high and low passing groups differed from the failing group on all six study dimensions, but that the executive monitoring and strategic test-taking scales were the strongest predictors of group membership. Specific study practices most frequently used by all  three groups included using practice tests for review, intensive studying the night before the exam, underlining important material, and relating reading material to one's own experience. Fewer than 20 percent of each group reported using charts or outlines to summarize material, writing out a study schedule prior to beginning a course, and overlearning course material. Specific skills used by only the high-achieving group included skimming the text, reading all of the assigned study material, mental rehearsal, and overlearning. (23 references, 5 tables) (CML)",

        "description":"The Criminal Justice Initiative (CJI) was conducted in Washington, D.C. from fiscal year 1984 through fiscal year 1986 to relieve overcrowded prison conditions by reducing the recidivism rate. Objectives of the project included hiring additional prison staff to provide security and increase prisoner processing, expanding the education program, and developing classroom and vocational facilities to provide prisoners with basic life skills and a trade that they could use upon release. The project was evaluated by the General Accounting Office (GAO) through interviews with officials involved in the beginning of CJI and examination of files and documents of the program. The study showed that implementation of the CJI program was complicated and delayed because Congress appropriated  more than $22 million for the project leaving little time for planning and organizing, whereas the District had originally planned for only $750,000 to develop a basic literacy program for prisoners. The study also found that the CJI spent increasing portions of its operating funds on education during the 3 years of the project. However, significant data accuracy problems restricted GAO's ability to analyze and draw conclusions about the impact of CJI, or to determine whether the program was successful in placing program participants in training-related jobs after release. Recommendations were made for developing and implementing a better reporting system so that program effectiveness could be determined. (KC)",

Prior studies were reviewed, the current system was described, problems were identified, promising elements were identified, the Delphi technique was used to identify and prioritize alternative strategies, findings were analyzed, and recommendations were developed. The recommendations dealt with issues of governance, administration, leadership, research, planning, evaluation, professional development, program development, and curriculum. Among the recommendations were the following: (1) Pennsylvania's vocational education should have a regional  governance, administrative, and taxing structure; (2) the State Department of Education should develop a statewide public information campaign to point out the relationship between effective vocational education and the state's economic development; (3) the State Department of Education should establish a research center on vocational education and employment and three new high technology centers; and (4) an interdisciplinary curriculum should be implemented that encourages the integration of academic and vocational education. (Includes 33 references.

        "description":"In this discussion of managing continuing education credit programming units, three themes emerge. The first theme is that unit administrators must rely upon leverage, or influence, to coordinate programs effectively and to gain the institution's acceptance of policies and procedures that support the credit programming unit and the adult learners it serves. The second theme is the comprehensive nature of organizing and administering credit courses and programs. Administrators must simultaneously juggle needs assessment, budgeting, marketing, student recruitment and retention, program development, program coordination, faculty participation and development, budgeting and financing, various modes of course and program delivery, student support services, and course and program  evaluation, while also attending to the demands and constraints imposed by external agencies and by the parent institution. The third theme is opportunity. Continuing education credit programming has reached a stage of maturity during the past decade. The potential for stimulation and personal and professional growth through such opportunities is boundless. Unit administrators must be willing to participate fully and proficiently in leading higher education into a new era of educational service to adults. (34 references) (CML)",

        "description":"A study of the terminees from Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs in Tennessee was conducted. Terminees were JTPA participants who either completed a program or left the program for some other reason. First-class mail survey forms were sent to 2,462 persons. Two follow-up mailings were sent. A return rate of 29.4 percent was obtained. Among the findings were the following: (1) 58.1 percent of the respondents completed their JTPA training; (2) 67 percent received their training in an area vocational technical school, 21.6 percent in a state community college, and 11.4 percent in a state technical institute; (3) 71.1 percent of the respondents were working when they filled out the questionnaire; (4) of those working, 81.5 percent stated that they earned more after training  than before they entered JTPA; (5) 68.8 percent of the respondents were women; (6) 71 percent of the respondents were white; (7) the mean age of respondents was 28.7, with a range from 17-60 years; and (8) 58.7 percent were from rural Tennessee. Program completers were more likely than noncompleters to attend an area vocational technical school, to be working when the survey was made, to have spent more time on the job, to work more hours per week, to take less time to find a job after JTPA training, to have a higher income per week after finishing training, to earn more when completing the survey, and to use skills learned in JTPA on the job. Gender, race, location, handicapped status, veteran status, employment before JTPA, and educational level did not influence whether or not the  trainee completed the training program. The text contains 7 tables, and the appendixes provide detailed results in four extensive tables. (CML)",

The first section focuses on information and myths about adult daughter-older mother relationships, including popular images and assumptions, misunderstandings, taboos, and mother-bashing. The second section describes initial research into the nature of the adult daughter-older mother relationship and its effects on the daughters' psychological health. It is based on extensive interviews with roughly 70 women that consisted of open-ended questions about the rewarding and problematic aspects of each of the women's major social roles, and specifically their role as daughters. The third section describes more recent research based on early findings, which studied daughters' relationships  with both their mothers and fathers as part of a larger study of 400 women, 25 to 55, who were employed as social workers and licensed practical nurses, and who varied in family pattern, as well as in race and social class. Based on findings from this research, both rewarding aspects and problematic concerns in the adult daughter-older mother relationship are identified and discussed. (TE)",

Canadians had a generally high level of knowledge about the transmission of HIV infection, about the distinction between HIV infection and AIDS, and about the efficacy of different methods to prevent the transmission of HIV. Most information about HIV infection and AIDS came through the mass media. Canadians were strongly accepting of the wide involvement of a broad range of health, governmental, and voluntary organizations in promoting AIDS education. Concern about AIDS had led to significant changes in  the sexual practices of respondents which in turn have reduced the likelihood of HIV transmission. Respondents were strongly supportive of the rights of HIV-infected persons to freedom from discrimination, and believed these rights should be protected by law. Only a small minority expressed opinions suggesting they fear that casual contact would lead to HIV infection. (Results are reported in chapters 2 through 5 of this report; the first chapter describes study objectives and survey procedures and the sixth and last chapter provides conclusions and recommendations; 39 data tables are included.)

Also included in the sample were youth who had recently dropped out of full-time attendance at school and those who spent most of their time on the streets of large cities. The first of this report's eight chapters provides an introduction to the study. Chapter II describes the young people's characteristics. Chapter III focuses on what respondents know about AIDS and other STDs and the accuracy of their knowledge. Chapter IV reviews from whom and  where young people have learned about sex, birth control, STDs, and AIDS. Chapter V examines young people's attitudes toward people with AIDS or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and homosexuals and homosexuality, and the influence of self-esteem, mental health, and relationships with friends and parents on their attitudes. Chapter VI documents the sexual behaviors of young people and considers factors that influence these behaviors. A description of what was learned through face-to-face interviews with street youth across Canada is included in chapter VII. The final chapter identifies the young people at greatest risk and explores the implications of the main findings. Educational initiatives and social interventions are suggested.

The types of orientation included: (1) traditional orientation with fall term pre-registration orientation program; (2) fall and summer orientation program; (3) fall and summer orientation and first term of an extended course taught by underclassmen; and (4) fall and summer orientation, first term of the extended course and a one-credit hour university seminar course. Results indicated that freshmen who participated in each of the four types of orientation programming did not differ significantly  on the 19 subcategories of the Student Reaction to College Survey. However, individual analysis of the items showed that students who participated in all four orientation programs were significantly more involved with faculty, were more informed about their progress in courses, reacted more favorably to registration, and were less likely to drop classes than were students in other orientation groups. However, students with full exposure to orientation programming expressed greater dissatisfaction with the quality of student/faculty interaction and were significantly more critical of the supportive aspects of the college and faculty.

        "description":"Length of stay in psychiatric inpatient units has received increasing attention with the external pressures for treatment cost-effectiveness and evidence that longer hospital stays do not appear to have significant advantages over shorter hospital stays. This study examined the relationship between length of psychiatric hospital stay and demographic, family, diagnosis and presenting problems, cognitive functioning, current treatment, and previous mental health treatment variables. Subjects included 200 children and adolescents recently discharged from a state psychiatric hospital. Regression analyses indicated the best groups of predictor variables of length of inpatient psychiatric hospital stay in children and adolescents were the demographic variables and the diagnostic and  presenting problem variables. The poorest groups of predictors were the family variables and the cognitive functioning variables. Awareness of factors contributing to the length of hospital stay may assist clinicians in formulating better treatment goals. The findings of the present study suggest many youth would benefit from treatment focused on attention-deficit problems. (ABL)",

        "description":"Low-income, single mothers and their children constitute a rapidly growing population at risk for adverse health outcomes. The mental health of these women is particularly at risk. This study investigated the prevalence of maternal depressive symptoms in low-income, single mothers of 1- to 4-year-old children; identified psychosocial predictors of depressive symptoms among the women; and investigated effects of maternal psychosocial factors, depressive symptoms, and parenting attitudes on children's behavior. The sample consisted of 225 mothers recruited from health department clinics. In-home interviews were conducted to obtain data on the mothers' everyday stressors, coping strategies, social resources, depressive symptoms, and parenting attitudes, as well as the mothers'  reports of the index children's behavior. The prevalence of high depressive symptoms among the women was 59.6 percent. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with greater everyday stressors, fewer social resources, and greater use of avoidance coping. Neither social resources nor coping strategies buffered the relationship between everyday stressors and depressive symptoms. Maternal depressive symptoms predicted parenting attitudes. Parenting attitudes, in turn, predicted child behavior. The results suggest that depressive symptoms are indirectly associated with mothers' reports of child behavior through their influence on parenting attitudes. (Author/ABL)",

The changing influences, emphases, and structures from then until now are described and discussed in detail and the recent emergence of developmental comprehensive guidance programs is highlighted. Chapter 2 focuses on the issues and concerns in planning and organizing guidance program improvement. Chapter 3 presents a model guidance program based on the concept of life career development. Chapter 4 discusses in detail the steps involved in finding out how well a current program  is working and where improvement is needed. Chapter 5 begins the designing phase of the program improvement process, focusing on designing the program of choice. Chapter 6 describes the steps necessary to make the transition to a comprehensive school guidance program. The steps in actually making the transition to a comprehensive school guidance program are described in chapter 7. Chapter 8 focuses on how to ensure that school counselors have the necessary competence to develop and manage a comprehensive school guidance program. Counselor supervision procedures are highlighted. Comprehensive school guidance program evaluation is discussed in chapter 9 which features program evaluation, student outcome evaluation, and professional personnel evaluation. (NB)",

        "description":"A careful analysis by Zelnik and Kanter of the Department of Population Dynamics at Johns Hopkins disclosed that abortions, unwed teenage pregnancies, venereal diseases, and sexual promiscuity have all increased dramatically in spite of a massive public and private program of contraceptive indoctrination and dissemination. This increase is attributed, in part, to the adoption by schools and planned parenthood clinics of a relativistic \"values clarification\" approach to values, which avoids indoctrination or \"taking sides.\" This approach deprives parents, school, and society of the right to provide standards for sexual behavior, and leaves young people vulnerable to peer pressure alone. Accordingly, the concept of mandatory parental notification for abortion and other consequences  of teenage sexuality is endorsed, and legal issues surrounding adolescents' right to privacy and parents' right to notification are reviewed and discussed. Contraceptive counselors seldom make any effort to involve parents, yet parental pressure can be an effective counterpoint to the overwhelming influence of peer pressure in reducing adolescent unwed pregnancy. There are no hard data to support the dire predictions of undesirable consequences flowing from mandatory parental notification. Given the present crisis, this approach therefore deserves implementation and evaluation. (TE)",

Bullying was defined as &quot;long standing violence, mental or physical, conducted by an individual or a group against an individual who is not able to defend himself or herself in that actual situation.&quot; Questionnaires were distributed to 942 students from 10 secondary schools, ranging from the inner city to the agricultural periphery. The data showed that 50 percent of the students had been bullied at school at least once or twice; 44 percent admitted that they had bullied someone else; and 32 percent  said they had never been involved, either as bully or victim. Other reported findings include a breakdown of the recent bullies and victims by age and sex; demographic and family characteristics of bullies; incidence of forms of bullying ranging from ostracism to violence or extortion; school location of bullying incidents; and the data on taboo against telling authority figures about bullying incidents. Three prerequisites for a successful anti-bullying policy are discussed: recognition by the school that the problem exits; openness in discussing it; and ownership, i.e., giving parents, teachers, and pupils a vested interest in making the anti-bullying policy succeed.

In addition, there was a note of pessimism throughout many of the responses, suggesting that little could ultimately be done about racial prejudice and discrimination. The problem, then, was to attempt to develop a learning program adaptable in the college classroom that could address issues of diversity and pluralism phrased in the \"language of possibility.\" A three-step learning cycle is described that used recent research and writing in  narrative and critical thinking processes. The steps involved: (1) narrative development of students' personal \"dilemmas;\" (2) facilitating structural connections between individual experience, structures of knowledge, and the structure of society; and (3) intergroup relations and cooperative learning, linking individual identity and the social structures of culture to cooperative learning and conflict resolution.

Adolescent subjects (N=100) currently receiving treatment for chemical dependency were given a 20-situation questionnaire, the Adolescent Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES). Students were requested to review the 20 situations and respond on a scale of 1 to 10 whether they would feel most or least confident in their ability to resist drug use or abuse. A factor analysis was employed to identify and summarize possible interrelationships among the individual variables; this yielded three factors: (1) emotional/interpersonal; (2) social/recreational; and (3) grief/loss. In Factors 1 and 3, the participants viewed their drug use as a  response to the stress of conflict and loss resolution. Factor 2 seemed to reflect a need to enhance pleasure and enjoyment of events through the use of drugs. These findings suggest that substance abuse among adolescent populations often results from situational stressors. Implications for future study and application of self-efficacy concepts to treatment are considered, and references are included. (TE)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to develop an improved program of teacher education in diagnosis of reading difficulties in a graduate reading practicum. Fifteen teachers in the pilot study worked with one or two students daily for 6 weeks. The pilot study offered some indication that teachers' preservice and inservice experiences may have emphasized mechanical procedures and failed to prepare them adequately for the roles of problem solver and educational decision maker. The program objectives remained the same for the second year, but efforts increased to prepare the new cohort of eight teacher-participants for ethnographic data collection. Results of the second year study indicated the following results: (1) teachers needed and requested guidance in observing, recording, and  interpreting children's reading behaviors; (2) prior teaching and learning experiences had greater transfer and impact on teacher's observations than textbooks or lectures; (3) affective components of reading dominated teachers' observations; (4) concept of problem solving by trial teaching was unfamiliar to the subjects; (5) video taped lessons may be more useful to teachers when the instructor first demonstrates observation and problem-solving techniques in a non-threatening situation; (6) courses for preservice teachers should provide specific instruction and carefully sequenced opportunities for practical experience in observation skills and collaborative problem solving; and (7) teachers must be given opportunities for problem solving and decision making, not only in undergraduate  and graduate education, but in their daily work in the schools.

Data were collected in three middle-class school systems in the suburbs of a large, Midwestern city. Participants were 55 fourth-grade students ranking stanine 4 or above on the district assessment tests. The basic task in which the students were observed was the completion of a dictionary assignment common to fourth-grade reading instruction, using the dictionary to locate an entry for a targeted word which was presented in sentence context. Though the primary concern was the analysis of student comments and questions and teacher observations, a performance score was determined to analyze  the comparability of the group performance. Results indicated two insights for instruction and several directions for further classroom research. The first insight was the recognition that dictionaries could be much more &quot;user-friendly&quot; for middle-school students. Students had some basic suggestions for dictionary designers that were interesting and relevant to the task. The second insight, the most dramatic one for the teachers, concerned the relative ineffectiveness of the dictionary task. For most of the teachers, this led to a resolution to reconsider the use of the task and to experiment with different types of instruction.

Results indicated that the subjects read the rehearsed passages more fluently than the unrehearsed passages.

The subjects consisted of 11 freshmen and sophomore students participating in a two-week workshop on learning strategies which included a study project and instruction in prereading, during-reading, and postreading strategies to enhance independent learning and retention of written material. Subjects also responded to pre- and post-workshop strategy and progress questionnaires to determine their awareness and use of reading-to-learn strategies as well as the value they placed on such strategies. Results revealed that four of the students were using more study strategies than they had  been before the workshop, four were using the same number or fewer, and three resisted all efforts at communicating information. Responses also revealed that all students attributed any success to either ability or effort and any failure to task characteristics or lack of effort. Findings suggest that students who do not actually improve their grades demonstrate increased strategy use in a continuing effort to do so, while those students who do increase their grades attribute their success to their efforts, not to increased strategy use.

The knowledge component includes self-knowledge, which is awareness of personal strengths and weaknesses, and task-knowledge, which is awareness of the characteristics of the task and appropriate strategies for dealing with them. The regulation component refers to the functions of planning, monitoring, and revising. Recent interest in this area has spurred many investigations which use introspection or behavioral changes when text or purpose are controlled as indicators of knowledge or control of cognitive processes. There appears to be some confusion in recent literature as to whether metacognition is a new or old issue in reading education. A review of the literature  supports the contention that the knowledge and skills referred to as metacognition have a rich history. These concepts have been investigated and advocated as necessary for effective comprehension throughout this century. Current researchers may gain insight into this area by looking into the past.

        "description":"A study demonstrated that young children who have difficulty with phonics can be taught to read through other methods, that phonics is only one of the many useful strategies that a child can employ, and that many contextual strategies are easier to learn and more reliable than phonics. A case study was conducted during an intervention with a young child who was identified as being at-risk of reading failure. The approach used was a series of successive steps. Stage 1 was word-collection; i.e., broadening the little girl's repertoire of known words by focusing her attention on print in the environment. Stage 2 involved generating sentences with words that she recognized. Stage 3 involved the creation of homemade books using sentences which she had already successfully read. Stage  4 was called &quot;real reading for a reason,&quot; with books divided into three groups: books the child knew by heart; books she was familiar with but had not memorized; and books that were completely new to her. As a result of the study, certain truths seem evident: (1) print awareness should precede phonics instruction; (2) phonics should be implemented on a need-to-know basis; and (3) when phonics is used, other strategies should be equally emphasized. It is too often the practice that the child is remediated to fit the method, whereas it is the conclusion of this study that the method should be adapted to fit the child.

The program focused on the enjoyment of reading, required minimal involvement from the classroom teacher, and encouraged parents to become involved in any way they wanted. Twenty-eight children, enrolled in two classes, each received a storybook to take home (and to keep) approximately every 2 weeks for 14 weeks. Emergent literacy was assessed from several perspectives: parental observation, classroom teacher observation, classroom behavior observed during book distribution, and emergent reading ability using E. Sulzby's Emergent Reading Ability Judgments Scale (ERAJ) and B. Otto's categories of assisted reading. Text complexity was varied  between classes: one class received traditional storybooks/tradebooks, and the other received commercially developed books for beginning readers. The Read-at-Home program received positive evaluations from parents (88% reported their children used the books every day or several times a week) and the classroom teacher (who reported children's increasing interest, with children asking repeatedly when they would get their new books). Analysis of pre- and post-ERAJ scores indicated that 75% of the children read at a higher level at the end of the project. No children focused on the print during the preassessment; 10 of the 28 children were attempting to track print at postassessment. Text complexity appeared to influence the emergent reading ability levels of some children. (Two tables of  data are included, and 22 references are attached.

        "description":"A reasonably accurate knowledge of the location of certain learning functions has been achieved through the steady accumulation of data concerning hemispheric specialization. One learning disabilities teacher (van den Honert, 1977) applied hemisphere specialization techniques to eliminate processing conflicts between the hemispheres by sending word information to the left hemisphere while occupying the right hemisphere with noncompeting information. The Loveless-Blau technique is another example of an effort to employ neuropsychological concepts to learning. Concentrating on spelling, these researchers cut off the visual modality altogether. The purpose of the technique was to stimulate the right hemisphere, linked specifically to &quot;manual pattern&quot; recognition, by using the  tactile modality of left hand to right hemisphere. Further investigations using matched groups of learning disabled students are needed to determine which multisensory techniques are most effective: those using the right hand alone or those using the left hand alone. More research needs to be done on the absence of the visual input while learning spelling from raised letters. Also to be explored is a procedure for learning words utilizing the concomitant use of visual stimulation either in the form of picture or configuration cues. While successful reading and writing requires the interaction of both hemispheres for normal learners, the activation of right hemisphere processing alone may hold more promise for the severely word-disabled.

        "description":"A study examined the opinions of high school principals and advisers regarding a free student press and adviser role to determine whether opinions and practices had changed since the Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier decision. A survey was sent to both the newspaper adviser and the principal at 531 schools throughout the United States during the spring semester of 1989, just one year after the court's decision. Responses were received from 220 principals and 360 advisers. Respondents were asked to indicate on a seven-point scale the intensity of their agreement or disagreement for statements regarding role of the student newspaper, control by the administration, responsibility of the adviser, controversial issues, First Amendment rights, and the Hazelwood decision. Results revealed  significant shifts in intensity in all seven points from the 1985 J. W. Click and L. L. Kopenhaver survey and indicated a more alarming extent of censorship than had been hypothesized. Findings suggest that advisers clearly see their role as requiring review of student copy and correction of factual inaccuracies and misspellings, even if the student cannot be told about them before publication. More research into the increased censorship conditions appears to be called for. (Five tables containing the complete results of replies and intensity measures are included.) (KEH)",

The paper focuses on six interpretive problems from the mass of primary data in an attempt to clarify issues and block off false interpretive trails. The paper discusses: (1) the departures from purely random selection in forming the research groups; (2) the cross-sectional design of the study, with no control of possible cohort effects; (3) the validity of impromptu writing samples; (4) the openness of the writing prompt; (5) the high ratio of variables to subjects, with identification of 14 factors which account for 77 percent of total variance; and (6) the investigation of writing products only, while rhetorical  intentions and compositional processes remain inferential. The paper concludes with a discussion of the dangers and benefits associated with empirical, multifactorial, exploratory, and developmental interpretation of writing. (39 references are attached.)

The 33-minute mock press conference, in which students/reporters asked researched questions over a wide array of topics, was followed by an 18-minute evaluation. Comments solicited from  students and instructors in three different classes who viewed the videotaped program during the spring 1990 semester indicated that, overall, the production was a useful educational experience.

Data were gathered by means of a mail survey to a national sample of journalism faculty. Questionnaires were mailed to 490 journalism and mass communication educators with 407 responding. Every third name was selected from a directory of AEJMC-affiliated institutions. Respondents were asked to rate the importance of recruiting concepts on a five-point scale ranging from \"very important\" to \"very unimportant.\" They were then asked to rate each concept a second time, indicating how they perceived the concept was being practiced. Results revealed that most journalism educators think that ethical considerations that are important to the faculty  recruiting process are practiced poorly. Strong concerns identified by respondents include: misrepresentation of facts, tenure and promotion policies; deceptive job advertising; and unfair practices during the interview process. Findings suggest that many educators see problems with the recruiting process even if they are part of the problem. (One table of data is included; 20 references are attached.) (KEH)",

        "description":"An ethnographic study used M. M. Bakhtin's language theory of socially rooted multiple voices to compare the group-writing processes of two corporate documents. Data were collected during a 5-month participant observation of the production processes of a 504-word executive letter, which took 55 days from first draft to approval, and a 1,851-word corporate annual plan which, although recounting largely the same story of the letter, required only 15 days from first draft to approval. Observation of the groups and Bakhtin's discussion of utterance as the process of articulation yielded three views of collaborative writing: (1) group writing as cacophony; (2) group writing as monotone; and (3) group writing as symphony. Examination of the differences (in purpose, audience, message,  and process) revealed that the chief reason that the letter took over three times as long to write as the longer report was because of the gradual consolidation of power occurring in the corporate culture, fostering first a cacophonous and finally a monovocal writing process. Furthermore, neither process was particularly successful because important information was ignored or suppressed as people talked past each other or became mouthpieces of the most powerful member of the hierarchy.

        "description":"Reader-response journals were successfully employed in a &quot;Reading Shakespeare&quot; course for non-majors, making literary tradition accessible to students untrained in classical rhetoric. Students were encouraged to employ any combination of four approaches. First, students were invited to ask questions about the language, sequence of events, characters' actions, and theatrical conventions of the time. As the course progressed, inquiry evolved into the questioning of values held by characters and societies in the plays as well as the society of which Shakespeare was a part. The second approach involved observation of the text to discern patterns of imagery, behavior, and relationships. The third approach encouraged students to make connections between what they read and their own  experiences as twentieth-century readers. Finally, students were asked to evaluate the plays and to explore whether or not the characters and events were meaningful to them. Overall, the response journals empowered students by giving authority to their opinions, by allowing them to choose what they wished to discuss about each play, and by permitting the class to explore a variety of approaches and responses to the plays. Essentially, the students became a community of learners, listening to each other, engaging in dialog, feeling more secure in speaking out, and becoming richer for the shared experiences. (KEH)",

Yet students often see revision not as an opportunity to develop and improve a piece of writing but as an indication that they have failed to do it right the first time. Revision, whether done with computers or with pen and paper, will go beyond correction only if teachers emphasize the whole text over its parts. When this happens, students discover the power of writing as a means of shaping ideas and clarifying meanings rather than as a way of correcting errors or fulfilling a class requirement. Publishing student writings can be a powerful means of motivating revision, as can providing students with in-class time for revision and allowing flexible due dates for  writing.

The literature written in these distinctive varieties of English is often called contact literature. Writers of contact literature deny that a non-English culture is inexpressible in English and argue that the cultural material in contact literature will stretch or reshape the expressive qualities of English. The rise of contact literature in English provides an opportunity to study the literary effort of international writers and to observe the  vital process of language change. This change is of special interest to English teachers and students, since it is their language they are observing, and since the development it undergoes will make it a more sensitive and authentic vehicle for creative expression of consciousness in Western and non-Western cultures.

        "description":"Instructors of professional courses such as advertising copywriting need to exercise caution in assigning grades to their students' creative work. Some alternative assessment methods can equally emphasize process and product. One successful technique is &quot;praiseworthy grading,&quot; which shifts the focus from fault-finding to appreciation of positive features. In this approach, the more praiseworthy the student's work, the higher the grade that is awarded. The instructor could also develop multiple criteria, for use with &quot;prescriptions,&quot; in which numerical scoring quantifies and objectifies the evaluation of creative work. A second technique is peer evaluation in which students criticize the performance of other students. This format focuses on the learning process and is tailor-made  for creative work. The burden on the student to please only the instructor is lifted. Perhaps the optimal opportunity to estimate student progress is the self-assessment method. A contractual self-assessment involves letting students set their own goals, with the instructor facilitating both the learning to which the student aspired and the assessment by students of their learning. The instructor can also create an individualistic sequential criterion format, based on course objectives and outcome expectations. This provides the student with regular feedback on having acquired specific skills or content.

The book is based on a five-year study of computers for writing in actual school settings and presents what skilled teachers know about using computers to enhance the teaching of writing in the less than perfect conditions of ordinary classrooms. The book describes classroom environments called \"Writing Lands\" where computers enhance a process approach to teaching writing and makes the point that what students do with any writing tool depends less on the power of the technology than on the power of  the teacher. The book also shows how teachers in the vanguard are using computers to foster collaborative writing and teacher-student dialogue, and explains how these teachers cope with the knotty practical questions computers pose in the average school. The book concludes by discussing how to design computer-equipped schools for quality writing instruction, how to choose appropriate hardware and software, and how schoolwide team leadership can support the teaching of writing. The book is organized in five major sections: (1) Portraits of Student Writers; (2) The Key Variable--Good Teaching; (3) Designing WritingLands; (4) Who Rules a WritingLand? and (5) Explorations. An appendix noting contributors to the action research and a bibliography of 113 titles conclude the book.  (SR)",

Recent advances in computer technology have liberated the individual provider, making it possible for more and diverse people to deliver professionally packaged media products. The communications curricula and pedagogy should be revamped to develop the thinking,  writing, and design skills that such an individual should have.

Examination of 41 Diversified Cooperative Training (DCT) students' cumulative records revealed that 15, or 37%, performed below their ability as proven by comparing the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of the Test of Cognitive Skills, Stanine scores on the Total Language portion of latest Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, and the first semester grade in their English class. Pretest results of self-esteem inventories showed more than half of this group  was below average. The problem was addressed by involving the parents of these students and implementing a 12-week program of Cooperative Consultation with the DCT students' English teacher and their parents. A teacher-made, self-enhancement program was also implemented. Although the objective of having all 15 of the students increase their academic attainment level was not achieved, 80% raised their English grade by one level. The desired level of increased self-esteem was not achieved. Parents showed an increase in positive responses and interest in the consultation program, and it was concluded that the program could be used to increase academic achievement. Sufficient time should be allowed for strategies in self-esteem to be effective. (Seven tables of data are included, and 28  references are attached.

        "description":"A study investigated high school social science teachers' opinions on including media studies in the curriculum. A 53-question survey instrument was constructed and sent to 302 southern California social science teachers, of whom 159 responded, for a return rate of about 53%. Results indicated that all of the teachers thought it was important to help students develop critical thinking skills. About 94% of the teachers said mass media studies should be included in high school social science classes. About 86% of the teachers said they felt qualified to teach about the mass media, although only 34% indicated that their college training had helped them to develop such expertise. Television was ranked as the most important mass medium to include in the study of mass media in high  school social science classes. Respondents rated the potential effects of mass media messages on people as the most important element to include in the media curriculum. Results indicated that even though most of the teachers recognized that the social science curriculum was already crowded with critical areas that needed to be taught, almost all of them indicated that room should be found for including meaningful instruction about how the mass media operate, how they should operate, what power they have and how they influence lives every day.

        "description":"&quot;Channel One&quot; is a 12-minute daily TV news program designed specifically to be broadcast to high schools. A study examined critically the content of &quot;Channel One&quot; commercials to determine the values, themes, formats, and appeals used to pitch products to students, with special emphasis placed on the values used and promoted in the commercials. A coding schema was developed to conduct a content analysis. Results indicated, not surprisingly, that most of the commercials on &quot;Channel One&quot; were aimed at teenagers, emphasized positive aspects about products that teenagers use or focused on issues that teenagers are concerned about, featured young people having fun and enjoying advertised products, included rock music, and lasted 30 seconds. More interesting findings concern what the  commercial messages collectively convey. Public service announcements comprised about 15% of the messages, a significantly higher percentage than that on most television stations in the United States. Well over 75% of the characters in the commercials were Caucasian; African-American, Hispanic, or Asian-dominant characters were almost non-existent. Product values seemed to tell students that products are worthy of purchase because they are effective and technologically advanced, rather than unique or ornamental. Personal values expressed focused primarily on leisure/pleasure, appearance/sexuality, and belonging. (Three tables of data are included; 54 references and 4 appendixes are attached.) (SR)",

The paper begins with an explanation of factors that contribute to reluctance to teaching new material with anything but a time-honored method. The paper then argues that the way an individual learns affects what is learned. It concludes that the interactive, seminar process offers the greatest potential for helping students and faculty co-construct their knowledge of complex, multifaceted material. The paper also concludes that this, in turn, should lead to a generation  of mangers who will reject any asymmetrical practice that does not value the diversity, the equity, the cooperation and the responsibility that have characterized their education.

Public relations faculty report forming the groups themselves in one (or a combination) of three ways: basing the choice on class assignments and prior knowledge of the students; leaving the decision up to the students; or leaving it up to the luck of the draw. This paper describes an alternative method for forming students into groups that provides optimum performance potential, alleviates the stress on the professor, and allows students some creative input. It is also far more professional. This method begins early in the semester. Students submit an anonymous resume labeled only with an identification number. The instructor chooses group leaders  from the resumes and then the leaders choose their group members from the remaining anonymous resumes. Two years of experience in using this methods has demonstrated that this approach yields more equitable groups and a superior end result. (RS)",

        "description":"Values can and should be a part of small group communication instruction. Discourse is value laden and to understand the communication process, the role of values must be understood. Many students come to the classroom not understanding values, and not being aware of the role of values in decision-making. Their lack of understanding requires that teachers first teach about values, what a value is, the nature of value hierarchies, and how values operate in small group discourse. K. R. Wallace's four habits associated with the democratic ethic have been identified as important values to teach. They are: (1) the habit of search (finding information that both confirms and questions an individual's own premise); (2) the habit of justice (presenting all the information openly and  fairly); (3) the habit of preferring public to private motivation; and (4) the habit of respect for dissent. The habit of dissent is particularly important for the small group participant. Walter Fisher's five questions for rhetorical communication have been identified as helpful in identifying value issues in decisions. Other approaches will be equally useful in teaching students to consider values in group communication; most important is the willingness to teach that which has been so long neglected. Without significantly altering the nature of the course, one can use a variety of strategies to enhance the understanding of values, both public and private, in small group communication.

        "description":"This paper examines the nature of student engagement in the instructional activities of eighth- and ninth-grade English classes and draws general conclusions applicable to instruction at all levels. It focuses on the teacher's pivotal role, showing that certain discourse practices elicit substantive (rather than procedural) student engagement, with teachers taking students seriously, and acknowledging and building on what they say. These practices involve: (1) asking authentic questions (which open the floor to what students have to say); (2) engaging in uptake (building on what students have said); and (3) high-level evaluation (which certifies new turns in the discussion occasioned by student answers). By contrast, the teacher-student interaction called &quot;recitation&quot; (in which  the teacher asks a series of preplanned questions, initiates all the topics, and rarely interacts with the substance of students' answers except to evaluate them) is rarely more than procedurally engaging. Using examples from a study of eighth- and ninth-grade English, the paper examines substantively engaging instruction, showing how students become most profitably engaged and learn most in classrooms characterized by extensive interaction between students and teacher. The paper is divided into the following sections: &quot;Procedural versus Substantive Engagement&quot;; &quot;Quality of Instructional Discourse as an Indicator of Student Engagement&quot; (an examination and discussion of three samples of classroom talk); &quot;Implications for Writing&quot;; &quot;Student Engagement and Literature Achievement&quot;; and a  conclusion.

        "description":"A study questions recent findings that adolescents spend more time viewing television than listening to music. It is argued that questions about what constitutes music listening and music media, about adequate scales to measure time spent with television and music media, and the age range from which recent samples have been drawn, have led researchers to overestimate adolescent television viewing and underestimate music listening. Data were drawn from a pilot study conducted with 314 ninth and 351 eleventh graders from three high schools. The survey differed from previous assessments of music by (1) measuring amounts of listening in smaller increments; (2) differentiating between music listening via radio and other media; and (3) sensitizing respondents to music listening as a  background activity. Results indicated that adolescents were found to spend significantly more time listening to music than viewing television. Results concerned with: (1) the relationship between adolescent sociability and time spent with television and music media; and (2) gender, age or racial/ethnic differences in amount of, and reasons for using, television and music media are also presented. Taken together, these results point to the centrality of music media in adolescence. Future research needs to consider differences within audio media as well as between audio media and audio-only media. (Eight tables of data are included and 28 references are attached.) (Author/MG)",

The study also explored the difference between principals' actual and desired role in budgeting. Two studies were conducted, one in 1978 and one in 1988, and were compared to determine differences in principals' involvement and perceptions of their budgeting role and the relationships to job satisfaction. The study created a questionnaire to measure involvement factors and used another instrument, the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire, to measure dimensions of general job satisfaction. The 1978 study had a response rate of 72 percent, and the 1988 study's response rate was 55 percent. In both  studies, the principals were asked four questions to determine their budgetary involvement and influence with supervisors. In the 1978 study, principals who felt they could easily get their ideas across for items affecting their schools showed significantly higher scores in the general satisfaction dimension than did their less influential counterparts. In the 1988 study, there was no significant difference in the job satisfaction of those involved and those not involved. This difference may be attributable to changes in the principal's role; perhaps participation in budgeting is not viewed by central office administrators as the instructional leader's job. Also, the newer principals would not be less satisfied if participation was never offered to them. (MLH)",

        "description":"It is a common public perception that schools are failing to perform their fundamental mission; in the public eye, the responsibility for this failure lies with the administrators leading the schools. Consequently, there has been a litany of criticisms of the programs that prepare administrators, particularly programs located in major research universities. This document presents a detailed analysis of: (1) the specific criticisms directed at administrators; (2) the attitudes, knowledge, and skills required to meet these criticisms; and (3) the instructional strategies, principles, and structures most likely to produce them. Problem-Centered Instruction (PCI) provides an alternative approach to administrator selection and training that focuses on the collaborative solution to  practical field problems. Key concepts of this instructional method include recruiting students in a cohort group that will proceed though training as a unit; focusing instruction in each subject area on the implications of that content for the thematic problem; and using computer conferencing for continuing collaborative problem-solving, for class discussions of substantive issues, and for written class assignments. In April 1989, the University of Michigan field tested an educational administrator training program based on the PCI approach; currently, a cohort group of 19 has been admitted into the experimental program.

Analysis of state computer files of population data from 1978 to 1988 indicates that the number of females certified and employed as secondary and assistant principals has increased since 1978, and that fewer minorities, especially black males, are entering educational leadership positions. Recommendations are made for the development and implementation of financial incentive recruitment policies, and for collaborative efforts between education and the private sector to identify and support minorities and women in school administrative positions. However, a fundamental change must first be made in the perception of  education as a popular political issue. The findings call for the development and implementation of a master plan for educational improvement, with a focus on increasing administrator and teacher rewards to attract highly qualified women and minority teachers and administrators.

School level incentive policies as elements of the entrepreneurial context of educational restructuring and an organizational model for an incentive-based merit system are also discussed. The study examines the effect of SPI on school outcome measures upon which monetary rewards were contingent and on school personnel behavior. Test performance data from 2,584 schools and dropout rates of 1,132 schools that qualified and did not qualify for rewards were analyzed by year. Personal and telephone interviews with teachers, principals, and superintendents in 13 elementary and secondary schools were also conducted. Analysis of performance data found no evidence of an  incentive effect on school performance measures and/or on personnel behavior. Interviews indicated that SPI outcomes may be due in part to insufficient information dissemination and communication and to attitudes of disinterest and hostility. It is concluded that two of the three state program goals have been achieved: annual cash rewards for significant educational improvement; and improved collegial participation, but that the third goal, further school performance improvement, has not been achieved. Comprehensive research, organization, and favorable political attitudes are needed for successful reform initiation. An attached article describes an incentive-based merit system model.

The program challenges the expectation that students in these groups are destined to academic failure. Based on the problem-posing education process and experiential learning approach, a program goal is the incremental development of skills for systemic change from an initial knowledge base. Workshops address the dominant themes of parental concerns, which include student development, family interaction, school-home accountability, and school culture. Strengths of the program include  its core of facilitators, commitment to parents, and respect for parents. Weaknesses are financial pressures, organizational structure, and lack of resources. Initial assessment demonstrates that low income parents are interested, willing, and socially responsible, and that a vision exists for making education a democratic, empowering institution.

The argument is made that not only is there no systematic relationship between increased spending on education and academic performance, but also that increased spending is likely to cause economic decline. Spending more on obsolete, inefficient schools and colleges will waste resources and weaken the U.S. economy. Recommendations are made for the financing of restructuring, which include changes in resource allocation and investment in new technologies. To double educational productivity of U.S. investments in education and training by the year 2001, the suggestion is made that a minimum of 1 percent of  educational institutional gross budgets be devoted to technological innovation (e.g., research, development, and technology).

One central dimension of school restructuring is the empowerment of teachers within a school culture that is both shared and technical. Little is known about how such cultures develop and whether or how school administrators can facilitate that process. This report describes results of a study examining administrator practices in 12 Ontario (Canada) schools that had developed highly collaborative professional relationships over a 3-year period in the context of school improvement initiatives. The study specifically examined the extent to which these schools had achieved collaborative cultures, the significance of improvement processes, and the  strategies used by administrators to develop more collaborative school cultures. Data were collected by two interviewers during a 2-day visit to each school. A causal network was developed for each school and analyzed to form various matrices (event by time, role by time, etc.). Results showed that school cultures demonstrated relatively extensive collaboration. The relationship between strategies initiated by administrators is neither simple nor direct. Administrators used six broad strategies to influence school cultures, including: strengthening the school culture; employing various bureaucratic mechanisms to stimulate and reinforce cultural change; fostering staff development; communicating directly about cultural norms, values, and beliefs; sharing power and responsibility with  others; and using symbols to express cultural values.

The LASC model, based on symbolic interactionist and functionalist paradigms, attempts to explain the process by which leaders reduce conflicts between individual and organizational expectations through communication of Organizational expectations to followers. The model is composed of nine leadership dimensions, which are combinations of three leadership orientations and three motivation styles. A pilot survey of 114 Washington State public high school principals to test the instrument for reliability and validity indicates that principals generally prefer to use positive power styles based on reward combines with a  direct personal orientation in communicating with teachers.

As the crisis over the potential presence of people with AIDS in the schools abated and with the growing recognition that the disease was not confined to particular risk groups, educators turned toward their pedagogical function. To create classrooms in which children can feel safe to explore and learn about AIDS, drugs, poverty, and homelessness, educators must accept that children live in a world where these issues are encountered at an earlier age than most of us would prefer. Providing this type of environment for children requires the  support of teachers as curriculum makers capable of responding to their students' immediate concerns regarding AIDS and related topics while cognizant of the broader bodies of knowledge with which they may be connected. This approach will not work through the imposition of lesson plans from above; instead, administrators must allow adequate time for staff development in which teachers can express their fears. Ultimately, the AIDS curriculum will be more about life than death, more about health than illness, and more about the body politic than the body physical. (24 references) (KM)",

Earlier, a study committee appointed by the Superintendent during the 1988-89 school year identified issues related to Personnel Department operations and made recommendations for improvement, including computerization of the applicant process. Findings show that a computerized applicant file has been developed and the programming completed to allow principals to select from qualified candidates the ones they want to review and hire. Online access by principals will be worked out during 1990-91. Many personnel operations are already automated, including payroll/personnel, budget  location, job titles, budget status, tracer letters, career ladder information, administrative applicants, personnel transfers, elementary personnel, position codes, Texas Teacher Appraisal System, employee leave, and student and staff directories. Some personnel operations yet to be automated are employees' reasons for leaving, job descriptions, microfilming records, elementary teacher schedules, and employee applications. Personnel administrators see in automation the potential for more efficient staffing, with certain constraints. The size of the mainframe computer seems to be the biggest obstacle to automation, but that problem will be remedied soon. Personnel need to review and revise current procedures to keep pace with changes associated with the district's movement to site-based  management. (MLH)",

The sample of 26 novice elementary teachers included one male. Fourteen participated in the structured team approach and 12 participated in the buddy system. Findings from interviews, observation, and an attitude questionnaire indicate that structured induction programs with clearly designed goals and expectations, formal observation, and feedback are viewed by teachers as more successful in meeting their needs. Participants in the formal model were generally more satisfied with various dimensions of their job. Both groups expressed negative attitude  toward salary and resource adequacy and demonstrated less effective postinduction teaching performances.

Following a literature review, this paper explores the implementation of shared decision-making in the Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) Public Schools. The conceptual framework, assumptions, and operational characteristics of the instructional cabinet are presented. The principal and the instructional teacher leader's roles are reviewed, along with the training methods employed. Since 1981, Pittsburgh has invested heavily in staff development to achieve school improvement and cost effective management. Pittsburgh desired to create a climate where faculty participation resulted in shared  responsibility for improved decision-making, increased professional satisfaction, and greater commitment to the total school community. The instructional cabinet was designed to: (1) improve collegiality among professionals; (2) create a dynamic community of learners; and (3) promote continued school renewal. The administrator assists staff development personnel in providing necessary training for teachers to acquire, practice, and evaluate the skills of cabinet members as the group engages in shared decision-making. Two proposed studies involving instructional cabinet group interactions and the instructional teacher leader are described. If shared decision-making is to lead to greater professionalism, researchers must carefully document the process and studies must relate processes to  outcomes. (17 references) (MLH)",

        "description":"The Federal Government provides substantial funding for education well beyond programs operated by the Department of Education (ED). Total federal support for education in fiscal year 1989 is estimated at $57.9 billion, an increase of $18.8 billion, or 48 percent, since 1980. After adjustment for inflation, federal education funds decreased 0.7 percent between FY 80 and FY 89. Of the estimated $330.5 billion spent on education in FY 89, federal funding amounted to $35.1 billion (11 percent) and funding from other sources amounted to $295.4 billion. For FY 89, estimated on-budget federal funds for education program support were $46.7 billion, an increase of 36 percent for current dollars, but a decrease of 9 percent since 1980 after adjusting for inflation. Funds for off-budget  support (mostly postsecondary education loans) were estimated at $11.2 billion, a rise of 56 percent between FY 80 and FY 89 in constant dollars, and 133 percent in current dollars. Between FY 80 and FY 89, after adjusting for inflation, Federal program funds for education for elementary and secondary education declined 17 percent; postsecondary funds declined 27 percent; other education funds increased 38 percent; and funds for academic research at higher education institutions increased 36 percent. Federal funding for education rose dramatically between FY 65 and FY 75, reflecting sharp increases in programs at all education levels. In FY 89, ED outlays totalled $20.6 billion, an increase of 5 percent from FY 80. The estimated federal share of education institution expenditures declined  from 14 percent in FY 80 to 11 percent in FY 89. About 61 percent of total federal education support went to education institutions in FY 89. Nine tables and two charts are included and six tables are appended. (MLH)",

Successful mentoring occurs when top-level executives teach selected junior persons the rules of the game; provide opportunities for them to demonstrate their skill; challenge them; give them critical performance feedback; and sponsor them into higher level positions. This book, which grew out of a field-based research project (Project Mentor) funded by the Women's Educational Equity Act, was written to guide executives assuming the mentor role. The project explored the nature of mentoring from the mentor's perspective. Corporation heads, university presidents, and top-ranking regional government administrators recognized for their ability to identify and promote talent were assembled to discuss the  mentoring process and its role in career advancement. One-on-one interviews, formal reports, and anecdotal records helped executives examine and describe their mentoring techniques. Proteges' also shared their insights. Each chapter of the book isolates an important aspect of mentoring. Chapter 1 examines mentoring benefits for both organization and mentor. Chapters 2 through 4 tackle the issues of selecting proteges, beginning and ending the relationship, structuring a workable mentorship, and mentoring women and minorities. Chapter 6 explains myths, issues and strategies involved in establishing an organizational mentorship program. (MLH)",

The focus on the individual, a narrow view of learning, and the hierarchical school structure is attributed to the technological mindset of American education. Section 2 applies the philosophy of John Dewey to create an alternative understanding of schooling as a collective, humanistic process of creating knowledge through practice and reflection. The third section shows how a process of inquiry based on the Deweyan values of participation, communication, reflection, and  experimentation can transform school meanings and beliefs. The implementation of the inquiry process in two pilot schools is described in section 4.

Children's conditions and their implications for educational administrative policy are examined in this paper. The current educational system, based on inadequate single policy solutions that result in underservice and fragmentation, requires a fundamental rethinking. Short-term efforts of various states that have reconceptualized the purpose of children's services are briefly described. A crucial long-term goal incorporates a changed perspective that recognizes the child within the context of the larger social system and views the school as the  nexus of institutional networks. From this perspective, the school role changes from deliverer of educational resources to that of broker of multiple resources. (15 references) (LMI)",

The state records analysis included data from 27 large suburban school districts, which employed 1,866 administrators. Multiple regression analysis was used to test the relationship between administrators' salaries and several independent personal and organizational variables across 11 administrative positions. A conclusion was that salary differentials are not directly a function of administrator experience and advanced degrees. Nonwhites and females were found to  receive lower salaries than white males for a majority of the positions. Recommendations were made for salary research that focuses on organizational variables and internal decision-making processes. Three statistical tables and an extensive bibliography are included.

A recommendation is that rather than establishing an absolute class size policy, class sizes should be lowered in those subjects which require more teacher/pupil interaction and which have high workloads. Overall findings do not support the cost associated with universal class size reduction and indicate that smaller investments in other educational strategies  may yield similar or greater achievement gains.

While the public school dropout rate is over four times the dropout rate in Catholic schools, the percentages of transfer students reveal a different scenario. With transfer rates nearly three times their drop out rates, the Catholic schools' reported success with holding at-risk students in school may not be as complete as previously believed. To determine whether transfer behavior is an alternative or a precursor to dropping out of school, data were obtained from the High School and Beyond longitudinal study (initiated in 1980 by the Center of Educational Statistics) regarding the first followup in 1982 of the sophomore cohort. The results for both the private and the Catholic sector  indicate that females are less likely to drop out or to transfer, blacks are the most prevalent among the transfers, and Hispanics are the most likely to drop out. Among the public school students, just under 47 percent of the in-school students display above average at-riskness, but 60 percent of the transfer students--and over 82 percent of the dropouts--display students above average at-riskness. A similar scenario exists in the Catholic sector. Transfer students (from either sector) are poised between the extremes of remaining in school and dropping out altogether. (48 references) (KM)",

        "description":"Improving educational quality at the primary level is a major goal of Thailand's sixth 5-year Education Development Plan (1987-91). There is a special commitment to improve quality in rural areas and among economically disadvantaged groups, handicapped children, and linguistic minorities. Inservice education is one vehicle for training teachers to meet changing demands wrought by national development goals, technological advancements, and new societal values. This paper focuses on two exemplary inservice programs since 1980. Specifically, the paper discusses: types of inservice activity since 1980, their effects on closing the gap between urban and rural student performance, the influence of U.S. inservice programs, and the applicability of Thailand's experience to other  developing countries. Three criteria frame the discussion: locus of control, instructional delivery mode, and use of a research base. The Improvement of Teaching Efficiency of the Primary School Teachers and The Principals' Inservice Program represent major attempts to upgrade teacher and principal competency since 1980. Several conditions influenced program success, including: the use of self-instructional materials, a school-based locus of control, and a collaborative, collegial ambience. Thailand's inservice experience provides lessons for other developing countries regarding the program's reliance on self-instruction, research, and pre-implementation training and its emphasis on the principal's central role in influencing learning climate. An effective inservice program can minimize  disparities in teacher competency. (27 references) (MLH)",

Findings indicate that the quality of research design is constrained by negative feedback from evaluation stakeholders. This finding is applied to an evaluation of the Here's Looking at You, 2000 drug education program currently underway in California. A conclusion is that the evaluation enterprise, particularly when it concerns the method of subject assignment, is influenced by various mutually antagonistic social and political factors that result in methodological compromise. Seemingly contradictory recommendations for researchers are to adhere to more rigorous evaluation methods and to maintain realistic expectations. A goal is the development of a randomization  process that is robust against indifference, incompetence, and corruption. Four statistical tables are included. (12 references) (LMI)",

Findings suggest that a school faculty with a significant proportion of teachers who share a particular personality type (X, Y, or Z) will affect the school's organizational climate. A school with a predominantly type X faculty reflects frustration; type Y, constraint; and type Z, alienation.

        "description":"Indiana public policy has frozen local property tax levies for public education funding since the early 1970s, which has resulted in an educational system largely supported by state fiscal aid. A statistical analysis of the fiscal equity of Indiana's school operating expenditures for the latest school year preceding the freeze (1972-73) and the latest available school year (1985-86) is presented in this paper. School operating expenditures for 303 public school districts are analyzed according to two variables: horizontal equity and fiscal neutrality. A conclusion is that despite increased state support, costs paid by local taxing districts have contributed to inequitable school operating expenditures. A relationship exists between taxing district operating expenditures per  student and tax rate, between school operating expenditures per pupil and assessed valuation, and between taxing district tax rate and assessed valuation. The recommendation is made for study of public policy on a state-by-state basis. Nine statistical tables are included. (LMI)",

Constraints imposed during the reform design stage and two political &quot;tar pits&quot;--household/business proportion of local taxes, and commuter taxes--interacted to forestall successful adoption. Factors that contributed to the defeat of the reform efforts include inadequate public education; fear of increased personal income taxes; lack of governor support; inaccurate and disorganized drafting; and the development of partisan political and business factions. Most significant was the inadequacy of a short-term state commission and a special legislative session for  large-scale, structural tax reform.

        "description":"Like the rest of the country, Indiana faces the challenge of preparing an increasingly disadvantaged youth population for life in the 21st century. Due to a determination to keep property taxes low, the economic downturn of the early 1980s, and a lack of interest in education among politicians and the general public, Indiana has fallen below the national education averages over the past two decades. In an effort to improve Indiana's educational quality, the governor and the General Assembly have made education reform a primary concern since the mid-1980s; however, it is still too early to judge the impact of their effort. To provide policy makers with a summary of relevant information on Indiana education and to establish a foundation for subsequent analyses of education in the  state, this document sketches a profile of trends in education over the past decade, provides current conditions of education, and details projections in selected areas. Specifically, the eight sections of this report include: (1) schools and school corporations; (2) student enrollment and performance; (3) special programs; (4) the education work force; and (5) fiscal resources. It is concluded that on many indicators of educational investment and performance--overall funding, per-pupil expenditures, teacher salaries, pupil-teacher ratio, graduation standards, test scores, postsecondary participation rates--Indiana has improved over the past decade. However, despite its improvements, Indiana has gained little or no ground in comparison with other states. While Indiana is making progress,  on most indicators other states are making more progress. With some exceptions such as pupil/teacher ratio, Indiana seems to be losing ground in comparison with national means. In order to surpass the national averages, the study concludes that the state will have to redouble its commitment to education during the next decade. (47 references) (KM)",

The narratives are categorized according to three themes--unexpected openings, widening horizons, and chance remarks. The stories suggest that women's opportunities can be expanded through the modification of existing structures.

Questionnaires mailed to two random samples of 61 AEFA members and 181 elementary/secondary principals respectively, yielded 35 returns, a 57 percent response rate, and 113 returns, a 62 percent response rate. Responses were used to generate a list of 13 topics in educational finance that principals and AEFA members believed to be vital to the school program. Both sets of respondents perceived school budget administration as the most important topic for educational administration. A significant difference of opinion, however, existed between the two groups in three areas: legal issues, accounting principles, and resource  allocation ethics. Despite a common perception of a split between teachers and practitioners of educational administration, no major difference of opinion in the area of educational finance was found. Five tables and two figures are included. (15 references) (LMI)",

Findings included, among others: older trainees were more likely to accept rules/authority than younger workers; males were better than females in work tolerance; less supervision was required for trainees who had fewer handicapping conditions, were taller, were not overweight, and had more years of school experience; job training was more important to subjects who had fewer handicapping conditions than to those who had more; special class experiences in either elementary or junior high school were a positive factor in work adjustment; present income  seemed to correlate closely with work adjustment; the lower the educational level of the trainee's father, the less supervision was required; individuals having more parent support may exhibit better teamwork and be more likely to accept rules; and the lower the family economic status, the more realistic were the individuals in their job goals. The best set of predictors for work adjustment was determined to be years of school, present income, and nature of present work environment. (Author/JDD)",

Adjustment areas examined included: living arrangements, leisure activities, mechanisms used to cope with personal problems, difficulties with law enforcement agencies, percent employed, location of employment, hours worked, wages, status of job, and fringe benefits. Employed versus unemployed individuals are compared in terms of gender, type of vocational training received in high school, paid employment during high school and individuals' ratings of the usefulness of their high school experiences. Results are reported separately for  graduates and dropouts and for students in resource teacher programs versus the more restrictive program models of special class with integration, special class with little integration, and self-contained special class. Among findings was that only about one-third of the graduates and one-quarter of the dropouts were judged to have made a satisfactory adjustment. About one-quarter of the graduates and one-half of the dropouts were neither employed nor a homemaker nor in a training program. Far fewer females than males were employed. Contains 18 references.

The work groups synthesized current research and practice; identified priorities for research in community integration, priorities for technical assistance and training, and priorities for information dissemination; and determined key ideas to guide thinking about community integration in the future. Four themes emerged: major progress has been made in community integration; attention should be directed to achieve full  integration and participation; a tremendous gap exists between the best practices and practices found in most communities; and an insufficient policy and economic base exists to support community integration efforts.

The study also examined the job supports at work settings, to understand the relationship between formal, job coach support services and natural job supports. Seven employees were studied in supported employment settings, using participant observation and interviews. Settings included a nursing home, a department store, a transportation company, two restaurants, a hospital, and a school. Findings are organized around seven common themes, including the low-status context of supported employment, the atypical design of supported job positions which were structured into an unvarying sequence of tasks,  the importance of social interaction, the restricted social participation of supported employees, the importance of natural supports, the hidden messages of job coaches, and discrepant perceptions of supported employees. It was found that job coaching interfered with mentoring for supported employees, and job coaches did not teach participation in social customs. As a result, supported employees received less natural support than their co-workers. Despite these problems, supported employees had become accepted members of the work setting.

The boys, aged 3.5-9 years, were observed in natural settings and while practicing their talent specialty, and interviews were conducted with the boys, their parents, and their teachers. The study concludes that prodigies focus on a single specialized talent, while otherwise possessing high, but not extreme, general intellectual ability. An enormous amount of work, practice, and study are needed to develop the prodigious talent, and prodigies need a great deal of assistance from parents and teachers. Only certain bodies of knowledge seem conducive to early prodigious mastery. The prodigy's arrival must come at a time when the culture values and supports  development and recognition in the domain in which the prodigy is talented. It is concluded that: (1) by expressing such a specialized talent, the prodigy reflects a very specialized way of thinking and understanding, an evolutionary strategy that is an exception to the prevailing rule of human general adaptability; and (2) in several important ways, the process of mastery of a domain is the same for anyone seeking to learn it, whether or not they are exceptionally talented.

Federal legislation related to the gifted commenced with the National Defense Education Act, followed by the 1969 amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. These and other federal measures stimulated initiatives within the states to develop educational opportunities for the talented and gifted, and 25 states and Guam mandated educational services. Disputes concerning educational services can be settled in three ways: mediation, due process, and litigation. Many states have due process provisions for the gifted that are similar to those for the handicapped. Ten  recommendations are offered for due process in Indiana, including establishing statewide standards, training hearing officers, reporting decisions, and supplying technical assistance to school corporations. Litigation concerning gifted education is discussed in the areas of early admission to school, admission to special programs, racial discrimination, curriculum modification, transportation, teacher competence and certification, accidents, and child custody. Several suggestions for preventive law in Indiana are offered. Includes four references, a table of 14 court cases, and citations for seven federal laws. (JDD)",

        "description":"The paper considers pressures on bright children and the relationship of such pressures to underachievement. It gives specific suggestions on the prevention of underachievement to both parents and teachers. Pressures often felt by gifted children include pressures to be brilliant, to be creative, to do something spectacular, to find oneself, to be popular, to be good, to be the best sibling. Noted is a relationship between underachievement and a lack of personal locus of control in which students do not internalize the relationship between effort and outcome. A quadrant diagram illustrates relationships between effort and outcomes resulting in either achievement or underachievement. Six recommendations for parents include consistency in setting effort and outcome goals for  children, modeling effort and satisfaction of accomplishment, and emphasis on the positive. Seven recommendations for teachers include challenging gifted children in basic skill areas, teaching divergent thinking processes, and maintaining a positive classroom environment. (DB)",

This second stage of the study used for its sample 23 children with intellectual disabilities, 18 with physical disabilities, 7 with multiple disabilities, 5 with learning disabilities, 16 with sensory disabilities, 3 with Down Syndrome, 6 with miscellaneous disabilities, and 20 who were in support classes for physical or intellectual disabilities and 20 who were in support classes for physical or intellectual disabilities within a regular school. Most students were found to be effectively mainstreamed, a condition which was found to be  closely associated with: (1) structured teaching methods including clear objectives, regular monitoring, and a teacher-directed approach to basic skills; (2) appropriate support; and (3) positive school ethos. The nature of the child's disability did not appear to affect the success of the placement. Integration was facilitated when parents or caregivers were committed to mainstream placement and willing to cooperate with the school's program. Appendices report exemplary case studies.

The reliability study was broken into studies of inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability. Based upon 68 ratings made by rater pairs, the total score inter-rater reliability was estimated to be .82. In a second sample in which 18 different rater pairs scored the instrument, the total  score was estimated to be .80. Based upon the comparison of ratings by the same rater separated by a period of time, the total score test-retest reliability was estimated to be .88. The validity of the instrument was supported by a face validity study in which only one item was considered appropriate to include by less than 80% of raters, and the instrument overall was considered an appropriate measure by 90% of the raters.

Project activities included establishment and utilization of a national advisory panel; an indepth review of the literature on family supports, systems change, and consumer empowerment; and a national survey of parents. The literature review found that respite literature is focused on establishing and maintaining respite services, with few evaluation studies or resource guides. Respite literature is primarily directed at providers. The national survey was shrink-wrapped with the October 1988 issue of &quot;Exceptional Parent Magazine,&quot; which was distributed to some 22,943 subscribers; of these, 2,847 sent  back completed and usable forms for a return rate of 12.41 percent. The survey covered: description of the family member with a disability; description of the household and caregiver; availability and use of respite; satisfaction with respite; problems with respite; desirable information and most preferred form for information; and desirable forms of family support services. The study concludes that respite is a valuable resource for families who are able to utilize it; however, families seem to have substantial problems working out the details of obtaining necessary support. Implications of the study for developing training materials are outlined. The report concludes with 11 references, a list of 6 resources on respite care, a list of members of the project advisory panel, and a copy of  the survey questionnaire. (JDD)",

        "description":"This study investigated the ability of high-functioning verbal individuals with autism or Down syndrome (DS) to respond appropriately to conversational &quot;social scripts&quot; involving reactions to another person's distress. Subjects were 13 persons with autism and 13 with DS, aged 5-27, matched on verbal mental age. During a &quot;tea party&quot; situation, subjects were each told about an examiner's unhappy personal experience (e.g., a stolen wallet, a sick pet). If the subject did not produce an acceptable response after several probes, the other examiner modeled a sympathetic response and more probes were administered. Subjects with Down syndrome gave a significantly greater percentage of relevant suggestions and sympathetic comments, whereas subjects with autism gave a significantly greater  percentage of responses relating only to the tea party. More subjects with autism than DS required modeling. Although a smaller percentage of subjects in the autism group than the DS group exhibited improvement after modeling, some subjects with autism were able to improve, suggesting that they understood some aspects of the social situation but needed help formulating an appropriate response.

        "description":"This communicative intent curriculum attempts to demonstrate expressive communication skill acquisition training for students with severe/profound mental impairments at a developmental level of birth to 10 months, and outlines an expressive communication sequence for people who have a \"no understandable speech\" prognosis. The curriculum establishes a base for eventual sophisticated communication interchange; establishes a communication pattern individual to each student; trains others to listen to, respond to, and respect the communication system of that student; shares the information with caregivers and other staff agencies; and begins skill training to bring the student's means of communication further along the communication continuum. The techniques most frequently used to  achieve the goals are nurturing, play, positioning, and massage. The appendix contains a collection of overlays portraying the most frequent communication initiations, and five article reprints on the following topics: (1) communication control and choice; (2) comparison of adult-initiated versus child-initiated interaction styles; (3) prelanguage communication; (4) fostering communicative competence; and (5) choice making and autonomy among persons with severe disabilities.

It is intended to help special education teachers take a more objective look at what they do and identify strategies and techniques to alleviate some job-related stress and tension. Symptoms of burnout are reviewed, and a questionnaire is provided to help special educators examine behavioral patterns to determine the degree of burnout they are experiencing. The impact of stress on the physical, emotional, and psychological well-being of teachers is examined, and the manner in which job stress affects professional performance is addressed. Several studies that look at job stress and the special educator  from a generic, nonspecific perspective are described, and then job stress of teachers of students with learning disabilities, behavioral/emotional problems, and mental deficiencies is discussed. Individual initiatives and organizational strategies for developing coalitions among school staff are offered. Ten stress management strategies are analyzed: diet and exercise, relaxation techniques, social support systems, goal setting, creative problem solving, time management, networking, self-talk, stroking, and self-given gifts.

For birth families, the initial diagnosis was a time of crisis, with high depression scores, while scores at follow-up (an average of 5.3 years later) indicated no significant depression. Adoptive families showed no significant depression at initial placement of the child or at follow-up. Birth mothers reported more limits on family opportunities, more family disharmony, more concern with the lifespan nature of the commitment to the target child, more financial stress, and more acknowledgement of the personal burden of caring for the target child than adoptive mothers. No differences were found on  the lack of personal reward, terminal illness stress, or the preference for institutional care. Adoptive mothers scored higher on measures of family pride, family accord, and marital happiness and consensuality. It is concluded that: (1) adoption is a successful intervention for children with disabilities as measured by parent and family functioning; and (2) birth parents recover from their depression at the time of diagnosis and become better adjusted.

According to symbolic interaction theory, experiencing the label and role of specific learning disability would reflect the influence of significant others in the environment (peers, teachers/administrators, and sometimes parents) as they socially interact with the LD adolescent and signify an identity as a member of the LD group. A qualitative-ethnographic research design was used to study 15 specific learning-disabled adolescents in the natural setting of their public school environment. Data formats included a self-report, nonstructured interviews, and participant and  nonparticipant observation. The research demonstrated that many LD youth have been devalued and belittled by significant others, producing perceptions of &quot;I am&quot; which are clearly negative and indicative of low self-esteem.

Three distinct groups are considered: (1) children who are experiencing developmental delays; (2) children who have a diagnosed physical or mental condition that has a high probability  of resulting in developmental delay; and (3) children who are at risk of having substantial developmental delays if early intervention services are not provided. The report provides numerical projections of the size of the target population through the year 2000, and examines the geographic, ethnic, and socioeconomic distribution of the target population across Arizona.

It documents the needs of Arizona's families as identified by a statewide, representative sample of 536 parents and caregivers who were interviewed concerning their involvement in meeting their child's needs, the nature and type of services they were receiving, their satisfaction with the services, their need for other services, financial needs, information needs, and emotional support needs. Services evaluated include medical, rehabilitative, educational, family programs,  and low-income family services. The report offers a profile of the sample, summarizes interview responses, and identifies unique needs of different ethnic groups and of rural versus urban residents. An executive summary discusses four conclusions specific to financially stable families, families with low incomes who are not Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCS) recipients, minority families, and AHCCS recipient families, and offers one conclusion concerning all families.

It discusses characteristics of successful cognitive approaches and the role of media and materials in facilitating this form of instruction. An introductory chapter looks at possible reasons for United States students' difficulties with mathematics and proposes that cognitive-based approaches be used to stress conceptual as well as procedural knowledge. The second chapter looks at mathematical learning among students with disabilities. Cognitive-based principles for teaching mathematics are presented in  chapter 3, including findings from research on children's mathematical thinking and a taxonomy of word problem types. The fourth chapter considers instructional components of cognitive-based mathematics teaching, grouped into those relating to the content for instruction and those relating to the methods for teaching the content. In the concluding chapter, publishers are encouraged to develop cognitive-based textbooks and instructional materials. Appended are a list of the forum participants, sample records from the instructional materials database of the Information Center for Special Education Media and Materials, and a bibliography of approximately 170 items.

        "description":"The paper reports on a survey of 800 members of parent, teacher, and administrator organizations to identify present practices regarding the integration of exceptional students in Ontario public schools. Responses were received from 415 individuals. The questionnaire seeks data about the effects of the Education Amendment Act, 1980, which mandated that all exceptional students have access to free and appropriate special education programs. The trend toward increased integration is examined and principles of successful integration, such as class size small enough to allow for individualized programs, are identified. Analysis of survey results indicated a range of integration practices currently being used in Ontario. Seventy-two percent of elementary teachers and 67% of secondary  teachers reported having between one and four identified exceptional students in their classrooms. Most administrators indicated that a full spectrum of facilitative services are in place, including consultants and resource personnel, special material and equipment, non-teaching assistants, and inservice programs for teachers. Teachers and parents were less confident about the availability of these services or of the careful selection of students for regular class placement and preparation of the regular class teacher. Teachers and administrators also differed on the availability of inservice programs. All respondent groups agreed that class size remains a problem. The questionnaire is attached.

Among project activities were implementation of a needs assessment; development of the curriculum which included assessment, intervention, parent techniques, developmental disabilities, case coordination, and interdisciplinary team development; presentation of the  curriculum through a variety of delivery methods (e.g., brief local courses, telecommunications courses, and independent learning packets); and evaluation using both formative and summative techniques. A special feature of the program was the collaboration of experts from the fields of special education, nursing, and continuing education. The training model is recommended for replication in other states. Appendixes include brochures describing inservice offerings, a listing of dissemination activities, and dissemination brochures.

The goals of Project BEACON are to facilitate acquisition of English proficiency, develop native language literacy skills, and provide instruction in bilingual and English content area/vocational classes. The project served 753 students of limited-English-proficiency at 5 high schools in Queens (New York). Participants were native speakers of Spanish, Chinese, and Korean. The program met its objectives for staff development and parental involvement activities. Students made significant gains in English language skills, and the project met its objective for career education. The native language skill development objective could not be assessed because of a lack of  pertinent data. The project developed several curriculum materials, although this was not a specific objective. Evaluation recommendations include: (1) securing the services of a full-time, Spanish-speaking resource specialist for two of the high schools, if funds permit; and (2) acquisition and use of Spanish materials for content area courses.

        "description":"An examination of family literacy programs was made in this newsletter issue to reveal the trends and practices of these programs and their contribution to the development of children of refugee parents. The examination found that most effective and innovative programs recognize that literacy instruction is more effective when it is content based and begins, as much as possible, within a culturally familiar context; takes into account what the students say they want and need to learn, as well as what the schools say is needed; and recognizes that while home can be a place of stress for language-minority children, it can also be a source of tremendous strength and support. Further discussions focus on how the program Preparing Refugees for Elementary Programs encourages parent  involvement, and on observations concerning parental silence about their children's instruction and what it could mean.

        "description":"The English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) Teacher Institute, created in 1980, is a staff development program for preparing instructors to use ESL techniques and materials. The Institute is for beginning and inexperienced ESL teachers. An evaluation of the 1986-87 institute was undertaken to determine the institute's impact on instructors' abilities to use ESL techniques, sequential steps, and competency-based adult education (CBAE) classroom management methods, and instructors' and trainers' perceptions about the acquisition of instructional skills through systematic training and reinforcement. Two types of data were collected including classroom observations of the use of CBAE methods by participants, and survey responses concerning the institute's design and content. Analysis of  the results indicates that the institute has met its objectives of increasing participants' abilities to use the techniques, sequential steps, and CBAE strategies, and that the coaching process implemented during the year was useful to teachers. In addition, instructors found that the institute was well-designed and well-paced, but felt the quantity of techniques taught could be reduced and the material treated in greater depth. Trainers felt the opportunities for skill refinement and enhancement were valuable. Several areas for improvement of the institute were identified. Appendixes contain the various feedback and evaluation forms used in the study. (MSE)",

Four ESL teachers were trained, and lessons and accompanying pre- and post-tests were developed based on captioned episodes from three public television series for children (&quot;Sesame Street,&quot;&quot;3-2-1 Contact,&quot; and &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot;). The lesson plans and tests were implemented by the four teachers in four pull-out classes that drew an initial cohort of 29 students from fourth through sixth grade classrooms. Researchers observed selected classes and met with school district staff to discuss, develop, and refine the lessons and tests. Informal observation  notes and observation protocols, a linguistic coding instrument, a language learning strategy questionnaire, pre- and post-tests based on the lessons, and teacher and student interviews were used to collect data relating to the possible relationship between the lessons and language learning attitudes, language acquisition, and the use and development of language learning strategies, to clarify expectations about closed-captioned television, and to guide a follow-up study.

With common instructional practices of iterativeness, contextualization, and cognition delineated between the two fields, four levels of literacy for ESL students are specified. Four levels of ability are distinguished, including: basic, intermediate, academic, and disciplinary. It is argued that establishing levels of literacy sets the construct validity of programs and clarifies their development. In addition, it is suggested that teachers of writing can best be used at the academic and disciplinary levels of literacy, where too often the task of writing instruction is left to disciplinary specialists and the focus is on principles of inquiry and rhetoric. The  use of writing teachers at only the lowest levels of ESL instruction is seen as too limited a view of their role. (MSE)",

Data were drawn from interviews and think-aloud protocols collected from the undergraduates taking real essay exams. Results are presented in case-study style, with discussion addressing the differential learning and writing strategies used by each student. The findings cast doubt on some common assumptions about the essay exam strategies of culturally and linguistically diverse students, and suggest that while the essay test has value for some  forms of assessment, the student's test preparation practice, understanding, and feelings of membership may contribute to making essay tests as inequitable a form of assessment as any other test type.

Subjects were 43 introductory psychology students who had completed grade 12 French instruction at least 1 year prior to the study who had not had any formal French instruction since then. The subjects were told they would do a number of oral French tests but before beginning, completed a questionnaire indicating how anxious they felt at the time. In the first part of the task, the subjects were asked to name and record in French items belonging in certain categories. In the second part, they recorded their attempts at completing specific communicative tasks in French. After completion, subjects completed a battery of tests  assessing various types of anxiety. After this, the subjects were told they would do more French tests, but again, were first administered the state anxiety measure. Subjects were then given an alternate form of the French test. Language test responses were scored for word production for categories and for grammatical accuracy in continuous speech. Results suggest that context-relevant anxiety, as distinct from general or situationally-aroused anxiety, plays a significant role in second language learning. A brief bibliography is appended.

In the course of talking about her social world, the subject articulates two distinct discourses of adolescent femininity. As an observable conversational strategy, she speaks sometimes as a quiet, intellectual, academically ambitious schoolgirl, the version of femininity validated by the school she attends. At other times, she comes across as the teenage girl who just wants to have fun, the version of femininity validated by the dance clubs she attends. While talking, the girl takes up subject positions within these contradictory discourses, valuing and discrediting both at different  times. Some aspects of her speech suggest that she is seeking a validating voice outside herself, indicating a wish to hear an alternative discourse of femininity in which the brains/beauty dichotomy does not dominate the social reality of adolescent girls.

In so doing, he uses a structured combination of symbols, both verbal and non-verbal, to foster the mutual understanding of messages. However, self-concept and the sum of life experiences mitigate against an objective handling of the communication process. The inferences attached to messages are often rooted in an uncompromising response and give rise to dissonance. As a result, connotation represents a subtle barrier to rapport in communication because the message does not exist independently of the communicator who observes and derives subjective meaning from it. Various factors contributing to dissonance in communication are  discussed. (Author/MSE)",

Three aspects of the program of instruction are examined. The first is the distinction between required and elective languages. English is required of all students, and Hebrew of all foreign students. Elective languages include German, French, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, and Yiddish. The second aspect is the differential goals of instruction in the various languages. Most English and some German, Russian, and French courses aim at developing the reading comprehension of scientific and technical texts for both undergraduate and graduate students, whereas other languages include active  communication and general literature reading among their objectives. The third area of discussion involves learner problems related to the structural differences between languages (e.g., Arabic diglossia). It is concluded that learner problems arise from both language-external (i.e., institutional or administrative) factors and language interference, and that this situation exists to some extent in many Israeli institutions.

        "description":"A review of the literature on strategies used by students to learn a second language suggests that the research can offer important insights into teaching learners who do not naturally arrive at successful learning strategies. Raising students' consciousness to the options for language learning is seen as crucial. It is also proposed that learner training involves a shift from the view that the teacher and the method are responsible for learner success to a perspective that focuses on the learner's ultimate responsibility for a successful learning experience. Examples of strategies used successfully for attending, speaking, vocabulary learning, reading, and writing are cited as evidence that research has just begun to identify what learners actually do during the learning  process. It is concluded that it is not yet clear how generalizable such strategies are in the face of individual student differences, nor how learners should be trained to learn. (MSE)",

        "description":"This paper is concerned with the different ways that gender is represented in the English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) classroom, and how this representation may contribute to the socialization of female language learners. Attention is focused primarily on the language teacher's understanding and awareness of gender representations, not to specific teacher actions. The analysis looks at: (1) the context of ESL instruction, often in places where little or no other English is heard; (2) the fact that most language teachers are female; (3) the materials used for instruction; and (4) instructional processes, including teacher behavior and interaction methodology (pair and group work). It is concluded that the ways that western textbooks represent gender, the ambivalence of some  pedagogical grammars over new, progressive language items, the messages conveyed by instructional materials and classrooms to female learners about language use, and the opportunities they seem to distribute unfairly, do not maximally facilitate language learning for women and girls.

        "description":"The components of motivation in foreign language (FL) learning are examined as well as the effect of those components on certain language learning behaviors. Two basic assumptions are derived from the results of the study. These include the following: (1) Motivation in FL learning contexts (e.g., learning English in Hungary) is different in some ways from motivation in second language acquisition contexts (e.g., learning English in the United States); and (2) language learning is a series of diverse learning behaviors rather than a uniform process. In the first part of the research a motivation questionnaire was designed and administered to 134 young adult language learners. Based on the results of the questionnaire, a motivation construct was postulated that is believed to be  valid for FL learning contexts in general. In the second part of the survey, the effects of motivation on four criterion measures, course achievement, course attendance, extracurricular language use, and further enrollment, were investigated. Finally, the results obtained from beginner and intermediate students were compared to determine whether there were any significant differences in terms of their motivation. Based on the results of this survey, a theoretical construct of motivation in FL learning was postulated, consisting of: (1) an instrumental motivational subsystem; (2) a multi-faceted integrative motivational subsystem; (3) need for achievement; and (4) attributions about past failures.

The experiment conducted two types of English language lessons based on antithetical pedagogical strategies. The first aimed at the activation of monitor use, constructed around formal learning tasks and the second aimed at the avoidance of monitor activation, constructed around formal label tasks labeled, for the purposes of this experiment, &quot;with monitor&quot; and &quot;without monitor.&quot; The lessons were taught to two classes of each of the following age levels: 8-9 years (3rd grade), 11-12 years (7th grade), and 18-19 years (last year of high school). To one class of each age level, the target structure was presented using the strategies of the without monitor lesson. The same structure was presented to the other class using the with monitor lesson. After two days, the same test was administered to both groups. Results indicated that the older students were superior in level of foreign language attainment. It is suggested that the older students fare better when taught with strategies that exploit the activation of monitor use. The type of teaching strategy does not seem to influence language attainment in younger students. (JL)",

Lesson plans cover job types, want ads, maps and schedules, application forms, interviews, time sheets, and paychecks. Intermediate level content builds on this material, and topics include personal identification and communication, job search, job application, forms, and workplace behavior. Lessons cover telephone skills, applications, education/training information, making appointments, writing a resume, workplace layouts, and interpersonal relationships on the job.

The progress of Black women is seen in their survival, the greater numbers of Black women in nontraditional roles, and the competence and qualities with which they perform in those roles. Four predicaments are seen in the current situation for Black women: (1) Black female-headed households live in poverty not because they are headed by females, but because Black women and children often live in poverty with or without a male present; the issue is not household arrangements, but inequality based on gender, race and class; (2) integration has failed Black women; (3) the women's movement has been relatively silent on Black women's  empowerment; and (4) affirmative action in higher education has not worked for Black women and the assumption that Black women are readily marketable because they are both black and female is a myth. Possibilities are seen in the motivation to overcome social class boundaries, the cultural experiences that allow for greater role flexibility and sharing of responsibilities among men and women, and the affinity of Black women with other people of color in the Third World as well as in the United States. Amid correct demands that society fulfill the promise of the Constitution, Black women must advocate for their own empowerment. Contains 42 references. (KM)",

The question posed is, if Division I college sports have become a large commercial enterprise, what then is the condition of these programs as measured by standards of business practice? It is found that university varsity programs, instead of being net revenue producers, were net revenue users and not self-supporting. Traditional revenue sources (ticket sales, television, donations) are chronically short in generating enough income to support costly intercollegiate programs. During periods of rising costs,  Division I athletic directors want to increase these revenues instead of decreasing costs; since revenues are already difficult to increase appreciably, there is quickly created a revenue/cost gap. These same problems found in Division I-AA are also growing in Division I-A programs. The most popular method of closing the revenue/cost gap is to increase donor solicitation. A need for universities to rethink the incorporated &quot;athletic associations&quot; within their institutions is due. (GLR)",

The study found four different types of programs: (1) sponsorship programs in which one individual or organization provides intensive academic help, mentoring, and other services to a small, broad-based group of students; (2) &quot;last-dollar&quot; programs which guarantee students the remaining assistance needed to attend postsecondary school after all other sources of assistance have been exhausted; (3) university-based programs which guarantee admission and tuition at a particular institution and also offer services while students complete high school; (4) &quot;pay-for-grades&quot; programs in which a donor provides few services but puts modest funds,  based on students' grades, into accounts for use later in paying higher education expenses. The study showed that in 1988-89 at least 42,496 students were involved in tuition guarantee programs with 2,884 students now receiving postsecondary education tuition benefits. The report found a lack of data concerning program effectiveness. Appended are suggestions for evaluation data collection and design. (DB)",

Advisees were 95 black females and 40 black males in two freshmen classes. Advisors met with each subject at least once every 2 weeks and kept a record of issues discussed. Students completed a &quot;Student Satisfaction Questionnaire&quot; during both fall and spring semesters. Findings indicated that some social issues were not talked about due to student reluctance to initiate these discussions, especially when related to race. Financial aid was also rarely discussed. Topics discussed were grouped into the following categories: registration/scheduling, selection of major and major area advising, course  advisement, on/off campus employment, referral to other services on campus, issues surrounding enrollment at TSU, living conditions/personal issues, extracurricular activities, financial questions, retention program issues, and questionnaires and standardized tests. Topics most frequently discussed were course advisement, referral to other services, and registration and scheduling. (DB)",

How do we get started? Will standardized exams assess what we teach? Will local exams be any good? Will students cooperate in assessment? Will my work be recognized? How much time will this take? and What good will assessment do? The paper streses the importance of: viewing  assessment as a priority for everyone within the institution; building assessment into established procedures (such as curriculum review, strategic planning, and peer review); and rewarding faculty and students for their involvement in assessment.

Emphasis is on guidelines contained within a 5-year performance funding program implemented in 1983. Standards were developed for five performance funding areas, including accreditation, program field evaluation, outcomes of the general education curriculum, referent group surveys, and planning for instructional improvement. A survey of 23 Tennessee institutions during the last year of the first funding cycle identified strengths and weaknesses associated with each of the funding areas, such as  percentage of programs accredited, use of peer review, and use of a comprehensive field exam in major fields. Ninety-five percent of the institutions considered the impact of performance funding to be beneficial. The most favorable reactions were related to availability of improved institution-specific information from surveys, faculty involvement in test development, and the impetus to use the data in planning for improvement. The most negative reactions were related to the weight given to exam performance and the use of accreditation as an indicator of program quality. Includes 6 references. (DB)",

Considered also are college admission and enrollment policies, academic support services, and budgets. The study analyzed results of questionnaires and interviews with 37 HEOP program directors, as well as data from annual reports of the State Education Department and participating colleges. Positive findings included HEOP's clarity of mission and well-defined student population; the heightened awareness achieved by compensatory programs and availability of financial aid; and more efficient and imaginative coordination of federal, state, and institutional  funding sources. Eight recommendations address the need for continued funding of opportunity programs, replicating programs and services that improve achievement, more systematic efforts in working with public schools to improve college preparation, utilization of the literature on instructionally effective schools, and development of studies to obtain follow-up data on HEOP alumni.

A model was developed to assess the effectiveness of seminary curricula in light of the realities of ministry among practicing clergy. Development of the model involved a survey to identify the tasks and time utilization of practicing clergy. Steps in the model included: develop cross-discipline agreement on outcomes to be sought; seek feedback from alumni, pastors, and denominational leaders; meet with pastors for integration focus group interaction; revise outcomes statements and develop a recommendation for faculty review; develop objectives,  instructional strategies, and testing procedures to support the achievement of outcomes; implement the revised curriculum, test its effectiveness, and use evaluation data to refine the effectiveness of the core curriculum. The survey of 807 pastors, with 86% responding, gathered data on attitudes toward ministry and the functions of ministry. Factor analysis was used to determine the relative importance of categories of ministerial effectiveness, such as personal spiritual faith and integrity, outreach, counseling, and Christian compassion. Ministers also rated their level of involvement in counseling, preaching, evangelism, worship, education, administration, information, and personal development activities. (JDD)",

A description of Empire State College as the setting precedes an analysis of the characteristics of mentors and examination of their daily activities. Emerging roles are explored in relation to advisement, intellectual development, evaluation, professional development, and college development. Problem areas are also discussed, focusing on mentors' concerns about their role in decisionmaking and concerns  about workload. A theory is proposed which suggests that mentors progress in five stages of development: anti-traditional; estrangement; personal confrontation; turnaround; and commitment. An appendix contains a copy of the mentor questionnaire, and a bibliography of approximately 75 items concludes the report. (JDD)",

Several possible roles emerge as a result of the assessment implementation process: Implementation Team Coordinator; Institutional Planner; Departmental Activity Facilitator; and Assessment Data Gatherer. Each role varies in its attractiveness in assisting professional development and what is usually expected from individuals within these roles. Of particular interest are the two most common roles the institutional researcher will be asked to play in terms of institutional effectiveness and  outcomes assessment: the Assessment Data-Gatherer Role and the Institutional Planner Role.

Part I offers a brief overview of the context in which the issues were raised, focusing on current trends, information gaps, fragmentation of services, the low quality of out-of-home provisions, and the stability of effects. Part II gives particular attention to three interrelated questions: (1) Where are the children? (2) What is the quality of their experience? and (3) What impact does early out-of-home experience have? Question 1 is discussed in terms of identifying a sample of target children. Discussion of question 2 probes contrasts between  home and out-of-home settings, indices of quality, perspectives from &quot;above&quot; and &quot;below&quot; and indices of quality, parameters of environments and indices of quality, structural characteristics of the setting, characteristics of adults and adult-child relationships, stability of relationships, issues in the continuity of experience, and language and linguistic usage. Question 3 is explored with regard to cultural appropriateness and continuity, staffing, and parent-school relations. Part III briefly summarizes the outcomes of the synthesis and makes recommendations for further research on four hypotheses included in the discussion. (RH)",

Questions posed in part 2 concern essential aspects of classroom practices, the Montessori position statement, and general questions about Montessori theory to promote open discussion. Part 3, noting that a few decades ago the  incorporation of pretend play activities into the Montessori classroom was the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of Montessori practices, asks such questions as &quot;How would Maria Montessori respond to contempory educators' emphasis on project work and current advances in knowledge about teaching strategies that facilitate language development?&quot; In conclusion, suggestions are offered on the substantial assets of the Montessori method, with a view toward future developments.

        "description":"Tennessee's Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio project (Project STAR) was designed to study the effects of class size on pupils in primary (K-3) grades. Responses of Project STAR teachers (N=1,003) to the annual Teacher Exit Interview are summarily reported for 1986 through 1989. Generally, the perceptions of teachers in small classes, in regular size classes of about 25 pupils, and in regular size classes with an aide were highly consistent from grade level to grade level. Teachers of small classes explained how their teaching had differed in relation to having only 13 to 17 children, whereas teachers of regular size classes with an aide explained how having a full-time teacher's aide accounted for the differences they experienced. After background and methodological information,  contents concern: (1) time and instruction; (2) individualizing instruction; (3) the learning environment in small and regular size classes with aides; (4) conclusions from Project STAR teacher interviews; (5) grouping practices of Project STAR teachers; (6) interaction of teachers with parents and volunteers; (7) teachers' perceptions of work-related problems; and (8) effects of class size reduction and use of full time teacher aides on classroom processes and teacher behaviors.

Subjects were 119 children in kindergarten and second and fourth grades who lived with nondivorced parents, single divorced mothers, or remarried mothers. In reference to a story line illustrated with paper dolls, children were asked open- and close-ended questions on five themes: (1) marriage; (2) divorce of a couple without children; (3) divorce of a couple with two young children; (4) remarriage; and (5) stepparents. While most subjects expected to marry and believed that marriage is a positive experience, the children were surprisingly accepting of divorce as a solution to an unhappy marriage, even in cases involving young children.  However, children with divorced parents were more likely than children with still-married parents to view divorce as a possibility for themselves. Kindergarteners were more likely than older subjects to hold negative attitudes toward divorce. (RH)",

        "description":"The hypothesis was investigated that, in a structured interview, older children and children from divorced families would express more complex, abstract, and integrated reasoning about marriage and divorce than younger children and children in intact families. It was further hypothesized that children with divorced parents would reach a more complex understanding of family relationships than children whose parents have not separated. Subjects were 119 children between the ages of 5 and 10 in kindergarten and the second and fourth grades. Children were asked both open- and close-ended questions about five main themes in reference to a story line that was illustrated with paper dolls. Themes were: (1) marriage; (2) divorce of a couple without children; (3) divorce of a couple with  young children; (4) remarriage; and (5) stepparents. Children were asked questions on marriage and divorce as social institutions and as personal possibilities and on the benefits, problems, and reasons for these marital situations. Findings indicated that the age of the child, not parents' marital status, predicts children's understanding of marriage and divorce. Older children were more likely to express more concrete and practical, and complex and psychological reasoning, than younger children. Younger children were more likely to focus on obvious, superficial behaviors and appearances of spouses, stepparents, and stepchildren. (RH)",

With data collected through March 1990, this document reports progress made toward realizing objectives articulated in the NCPCA's 5-year plan. After an overview in Section I, Section II delineates levels of violence toward children in terms of child abuse reports and fatalities, the role of substance abuse as a risk factor in violence toward children, and areas in which improvement has been made. Section III addresses issues in documenting the well-being of children and society, giving particular attention to describing selected measures in the areas of indicators of child well-being and broader trends  impacting upon children. Section IV presents a profile of prevention services compiled from hospital service data, school district service data, and community service data. Section V describes changes in public opinion regarding child abuse, focusing on impacts of physical punishment and yelling and swearing, the public's involvement in prevention, and public support for prevention services. Section VI formulates a preliminary assessment providing reasons for optimism, reasons for concern, and implications for future planning. A total of 18 tables supplements the text. (RH)",

Representatives of all 50 states and the District of Columbia were contacted by telephone to obtain the above data. Of those interviewed, 49 respondents knew or were able to project their child abuse reporting statistics for 1989 and 41 states had 1989 statistics with respect to child abuse fatalities. All state representatives responded to general questions on their state's reporting procedures and child welfare practices.

In addition to defining each concept, the section suggests practical steps that caregivers can take to improve certain features of the environment. Section 2 considers those aspects of the environment that make each setting unique and  suggests how to work with that uniqueness in environmental planning. The section provides a framework for looking at particular caregiving environments. Rich in illustrations and devoted to practical concerns, Section 3 explores specific areas in the child care environment, including the entrance and parent communication area, learning and development centers, peer play areas, multilevel areas, rest and sleeping areas, toileting, washing up, feeding, and food preparation areas, storage and shelves, and outdoor space.

The SEAs selected for the study were located in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Policies developed before January, 1989 were studied. These included policies mandated by the seven SEAs or their state legislatures, and related rules, guidelines, and requirements. The study documented the processes by which the selected states developed their policies and legislation. Sections of the summary concern: (1) factors that support public investment in preschool programs; (2) development of the states' policies and legislation; (3) a comparative analysis of the  states' early intervention policies, mandates, rules, guidelines, and requirements regarding components of effective early childhood programs as set out by the High/Scope Educational Research Foundation and the National Association for the Education of Young Children; and (4) policy implications for educational quality, delivery and coordination of services, and accountability.

        "description":"The effectiveness of specfic dimensions of adult mediation on preschoolers' self-regulation of a model-consultation strategy was evaluated in a microcomputer-based problem-solving task. Two trained tutors taught 61 children who were pretested and randomly assigned to one of four treatments devised to test two factors of mediation: access and analysis of a picture-puzzle model prior to or during problem solving. Tutorial interchanges were designed on the basis of the Vygotskian tenet that effective instruction includes a concern for children's actual and potential developmental levels and occurs through participation with others during problem solving. Measures of self-regulated piece placements, children with self-regulated look-backs, children retrieving pieces after  self-regulated look-backs, trials and test time were calculated from three videotaped sessions and used to assess children's self-regulation during treatment and in immediate and delayed posttests. Analyses revealed significant differences for the access and analysis effects in posttests, but only in the delayed posttest for the latter. Significant differences were found for the planned contrast. Children who received the &quot;during access/analysis&quot; treatment were more likely to have self-regulated look-backs and retrieve more pieces from self-regulated look-backs than children receiving the other three treatments, but only in the delayed posttest. Children in the &quot;during access/analysis&quot; treatment also had fewer trials and took longer to complete the puzzle. (RH)",

        "description":"This study investigated the effect of family structure and grandmother's residence on familial and adult-child interaction and patterns of conversation during evening meals. A total of 50 black families participated in four videotaped sessions. The unit of analysis was a randomly selected 2-minute interval during which speakers were identified. A contingency table analysis that controlled for family structure was computed to compare the likelihood of adult-adult, adult-child, child-adult, and child-child speakerships. In all family situations, mothers were the center of conversations. Findings indicated that children tended to interact more often with mothers than with anyone else, and less often with each other. Mothers interacted more often with children, except in  single-parent-with-grandmother families, in which adult-adult patterns were more frequent. The dyadic asymmetric interaction patterns in which two family members completely dominated conversations were evident in the single-parent-with-grandmother families. The focal asymmetric interaction pattern in which a single family member was the focus of attention was found in single-mother-alone families. It is concluded that additional research on the content of interaction patterns should be conducted. Communication styles can be used in the process of determining the quality of family relations in different family types. Cited are 42 references. (Author/RH)",

Primary goals of the practicum were to develop a nurturing affective environment, enhance character development, decrease behavioral problems, and enhance home and school relations. A literature review provided: (1) evidence of the importance of an affective environment for the enhancement of character development; and (2) suggestions for establishment of such an environment. The effort to establish a positive, nurturing affective environment involved getting support from school administration and the Parent Teacher Association, writing a proposal for an  education grant to purchase education materials, arranging teacher in-service and peer-teacher support activities, and providing teachers with suggestions, activities, and support. Practicum evaluation data indicated effectiveness in improving character development and decreasing behavior problems. An emphasis on story writing and story telling resulted in over 600 works by students. Questionnaires and other measures, instructional materials, and additional materials used in the practicum are appended. (RH)",

It was expected that the kindergarten through sixth-grade students would use practices acquired from their studies of law, government, and citizenship to direct their personal behaviors and group interactions. A series of workshops for student leaders was conducted. Workshop activities were designed to teach pupils: (1) the use of modified rules of order for class meetings; (2) the foundations of the United States government through study of the Constitution; and (3) the use of the tools of citizenship for the purpose of gaining access to official governmental channels in order to bring about  action on matters of concern to the students and their community. Practicum evaluation data suggested that the intervention was successful. Notable among the outcomes were a marked decline in reported incidents of misbehavior and students' increasingly strong belief that improvements in the atmosphere of the school could be augmented through the use of principles of good citizenship.

        "description":"The purpose of this two-phase study, guided by the theory and method of interpretive interactionism, is to describe how family day care providers perceive and implement their caregiving intentions and practices. In phase 1 of the study, data were obtained from interviews with 31 providers and in phase 2, observations of 6 providers over a 10-month period were carried out in the providers' homes. The paper focuses on providers' responses to questions concerning their responsibilities to children in their care, the kinds of experiences they want children to have while in their care, and a typical day in their home care environment. Findings revealed that what family day care providers intended to provide for children, namely, a loving, attentive, play-filled environment, was rarely  realized in practice. Incidents reflecting a non-nurturing environment were repeatedly observed. Play in the day care homes primarily amounted to allowing children to run around and do what they pleased under the provider's supervision. It is suggested that these discrepancies may be due to the differences in interpretations that providers and researchers place on various words, phrases, and behaviors. Discrepancies may also be due to aspects of group composition, such as group size, consistency of the group, and relationship of children to provider. Recommendations for training and research are offered, and implications for children's development and family day care licensing are discussed. (RH)",

ACRES members, primarily rural special-education teachers, parents, and collateral service workers, were surveyed about the dropout problem and what research they considered necessary for an effective intervention program. Four sets of variables affecting students' decisions to drop out of school are specified, based on a literature review. They are: family, school, peer groups, and intrapersonal influences. These four variables were used to generate a scale of dropout causes used in the study. A total of 305 ACRES members responded to the mail survey in fall 1989. Respondents rated causes (e.g.,&quot;frustrations&quot;) in terms of national importance and as to whether or not enough research had been done. Factor analysis and Chi-square analysis of the data provide no clear direction as to which needs should be addressed immediately. Survey responses were further correlated with years of respondents' teaching experience, but no significant links were found. The authors advise readers not to accept any of the alleged causes of dropping and not to expand existing programs without first: (1) establishing sufficient research evidence that the proposed treatment will be effective; or (2) developing public awareness that the existing research is substantial.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate and identify traits describing gifted American Indian elementary school students. A large sample of characteristics was acquired from past or existing programs for gifted American Indian students, an investigative Q study, and relevant literature. The items were narrowed down to create a validation instrument of 60 descriptors representing 7 general categories of giftedness, as grouped by American Indian adults from several Plains tribes. The instrument was applied and completed by teachers of 812 gifted and non-gifted American Indian children in Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, and Washington. Of these, 251 instruments were analyzed for this study. The results identify 30 items that significantly differentiate gifted  American Indians from other students. The items appear to describe goal-directed and highly creative skills involving problem-solving and working in groups. A checklist of 28 positively worded and scored \"tribal cultural characteristics\" is suggested as an aid in identifying gifted American Indian students. Tables include a t-test of means between gifted and non-gifted groups for each of the 60 descriptors. (TES)",

        "author":["Ruppert, James"],
        "description":"This research paper examines hidden cultural patterns establishing the expression of historical thought in Native Alaskan narratives which describe first contact with Russians. Historical consciousness in oral contact stories is always mythic in form, as well as in content. Native American oral cultures understood new events by &quot;troping,&quot; or placing them into cosmologies and &quot;domains of experience&quot; built from native culture. The point is illustrated using a Tlingit story of first contact with Russian explorers. Ship sails are identified as the returning &quot;Raven,&quot; who created the world. Unfamiliar sugar and rice are &quot;sand&quot; and &quot;maggots.&quot; In the narrative, the mythical merges with the historical to become legendary Tlingit history. Oral historical discourse, then, is best understood  by identifying mythological icons and determining their influence upon actions and discourse during perceptually charged historical events. Narratives from the Ahtna people are used to suggest that troping may occur at the deepest levels of precritical thought. The stories, involving hostilities between the Ahtna and the Russians, are similar to other Ahtna stories involving different hostilities which, in turn, contain their own elements of history and mythology. Myth may be laid upon an event like window blinds, allowing only the historical outline and mythic pattern. It is concluded that first-contact experiences present gaps between the familiar and unfamiliar, between the seen world and spiritual world. During confrontation with the unfamiliar, deep mythical thought serves to call up  familiar structures for understanding. (TES)",

        "description":"In March 1989 this working group explored how the federal government might better address rural America's problems. The WGRD consisted of key officials from relevant federal departments and agencies, who came together to explore the following areas of rural development programming: (1) rural education and training; (2) rural economic development; (3) rural infrastructure; (4) rural housing; and (5) rural health care. The report is divided into three sections, rural development perspectives, objectives and strategies, and an action plan. The first section defines the demographic problems faced by rural America, suggesting that federal development efforts be tightly coordinated and look beyond agriculture for answers. Local community leadership is the key to successful rural  development programs. The second section outlines recommendations for change which include: improved coordination of federal, state, and local development efforts; improved support and training of local community leaders; improved rural education and job training; and improved infrastructure for expanding local businesses. The action plan in the final section includes announcements of the presidential Initiative on Rural America and a Rural Development Demonstration Program. Also suggested is the establishment of structures to coordinate and target government rural development efforts, and the establishment of a rural development technical assistance center and hotline.

        "description":"In 1988, the Alaska State Board of Education adopted regulations requiring the selection and annual administration of a basic skills achievement test in reading, mathematics and language arts in grades 4, 6, and 8 for at least 6 consecutive years. During October, 1989. 95%, or 23,372 students in grades 4, 6, and 8 in Alaska's 54 school districts and Centralized Correspondence Study took the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, Form G (ITBS). Results indicate that, on average, Alaska's students in all grades scored at or above the national 50th percentile in reading, mathematics, and language arts. Results show varying performance across districts. Lower district scores are associated with (1) high rates of students who live in homes where English is a second language; (2) cultural  differences between the community and the school; and (3) high concentrations of poor families. In addition to the test, a brief questionnaire was completed by students and building principals. Responses were compared to student performance levels with the following significant relationships to higher student scores: (1) attending kindergarten; (2) reading almost every day outside of school; (3) watching only 1-2 hours of television each day; (4) planning to attend college or obtain an advanced degree; and (5) lower teacher and principal turnover. Sections of the report include Program Description; Report Format; Statewide Questionnaire Results; Alaska State Profile; and Individual District Profiles. The separately bound Technical Appendix is a compilation of student questionnaire  responses. (ALL)",

The purpose of this study was to identify, describe, and analyze federally funded migrant services. This study, based on interviews with program officials and available literature, offers information on the following subjects, relating to federal migrant programs: (1) definitions and eligibility; (2) geographical locations and seasonal variations; (3) migrant services provided, funding levels, and numbers served; (4) identification, recruiting, and tracking; (5) coordination and duplication of services; and (6) data, databases, and evaluation methods. The study identified 16 migrant or  migrant-related programs, each designed to provide a specific set of services. These included educational, health, nutritional, legal, and social services. Most federal programs awarded grants to state and local service agencies. The Department of Education funded three educational and one vocational rehabilitation program. Problems occur because official definitions of migrants vary. Also, data concerning size, location, and seasonal mobility of the population are subject to inconsistencies. A great deal of variation was found in the collected data. The most common method of outreach was staff visits to labor and housing camps. Federal officials recognize the need to coordinate their programs. The analysis indicates that duplication of federal migrant services is limited. Most of the  programs are evaluated on the basis of numbers served and cost-effectiveness. Only education programs used improvement gains as effectiveness measures. (TES)",

        "description":"This study describes and analyzes the Section 143 Migrant Education Interstate and Intrastate Coordination discretionary grants program from 1981-86. The program's funding mechanism changed fully from grants to contracts in fiscal year 1987. The study was designed to address the following broad research topics: (1) determination of inter- and intrastate coordination needs; (2) continuing inter- and intrastate coordination needs; (3) funding data and patterns; (4) the role of &quot;cooperating states&quot;; (5) types of projects funded; (6) the nature and utility of project outcomes; and (7) dissemination strategies. Twenty-one states were awarded a total of $13,849,206 in Section 143 grants between 1981-86. The study found a need for improved coordination among states and their local  personnel in such areas as student credit transfer. Improved secondary school services and dropout prevention were also needed. New York and Pennsylvania together received 47% of the funding and 45% of the total awards. Most grants involved one or more states in a cooperative program. Only West Virginia had never participated as a cooperating state. Types of projects funded included career education, special education, resource centers, staff development, and health. A third of all projects focused on secondary school services. Principal activities conducted by the projects were technical assistance, curriculum development, and training. Most projects produced information, experiences, or other products that could be shared. There was, however, no central repository for products  associated with the grants program. Local education agencies exhibited little awareness of Section 143 projects, except those with which their state agencies were heavily involved. (TES)",

        "description":"This literature survey examines rural problems and potential improvement strategies that have emerged on the agendas of rural educators and policymakers. The report discusses diverse rural conditions, demographic shifts, economic changes, technological improvements in education, increased demand for reform in curriculum and classroom management, teacher shortages, low educational attainment, financial support, and current federal and state rural education policies. Historically, states have taken responsibility for education, with the Federal Government acting to insure equal opportunity and to disseminate new approaches. Rural people are culturally diverse, but generally hold a relationship with the land and natural resources. Population growth and composition affect the wealth  of the economy, career opportunities, tax collection and allocation, teacher availability, and accessibility of potential partnerships. New demands on rural teachers are high, and their retention poses a problem. Rural schools' curriculum and classroom management have also been subject to change due to public pressures for reform. The sparsity of rural population means education is more expensive than it is elsewhere. Financial support for rural schools remains a problem, and rural America continues to have a disproportionate share of educational deprivation. Rural youth generally enter school later, they progress more slowly, and leave earlier. Positive changes will not be possible unless governments and private foundations address the fundamental problems and causes underlying these  deficiencies. The document concludes that rural educators must build on the strengths of diversity, learn to use technology effectively, use community resources, and build effective partnership programs. The document includes a bibliography with approximately 60 entries. (TES)",

        "description":"This position paper presents arguments countering the proposed closing of select small schools--particularly one geographically isolated school--in Randolph County, West Virginia. The first section briefly summarizes the county board of education's plan and rationale for school consolidation and the concerns of residents opposed to the school closings. The second section draws on a representative sampling of the literature on the effectiveness of small and rural schools to rebut the county's argument that academic achievement will improve as a result of consolidation. The third section outlines conditions imposed on the school district by the state: (1) increased educational standards in response to the mandates of the Recht decision; (2) a state aid formula that increasingly  reduces staff positions, but does not contain weighting factors that address ruralness or population sparsity; and (3) large amounts of incentive aid for new educational facilities to districts that enact higher educational standards and qualify under the staffing ratio. The effect of these conditions is to force consolidation as a local choice where, in fact, no choice exists. The fourth section discusses the right of children to a quality education and the responsibility of the state to deliver educational services to children without worsening their present condition. This report concludes that the opponents to the school closings are appropriately seeking to dissuade school authorities from proceeding with consolidation, and recommends legislative, legal, and educational options.

        "description":"Controversy between two opposing factions have confused rural development policy formulation. Infrastructure advocates believe that the improvement of highways and sewer systems, as well as the provision of industrial park sites and industrial recruitment, are the keys to successful rural economic growth. Human resource development advocates promote structural change in rural areas through increased investments in education and effective leadership in rural communities. It cannot be deduced from research that infrastructure investment leads directly to regional development, yet state and local governments continue to pursue industrial recruitment via physical infrastructure development. Lack of research on the impact of human resource investment on local or regional economic  growth causes communities not to value education as a means of creating economic opportunities. If the effects of increased investment in human resources could be assessed adequately, community-devised employment strategies could become a key factor in solving the problem of under-utilized labor supplies. In a survey of the literature on leadership program evaluation, obstacles that are likely to be encountered are presented in this study. This paper contains 63 references. (ALL)",

        "author":["Stickel, Sue A."],
        "description":"This paper describes a study examining differences between rural counselors and principals. The study used the Counselor Role Inventory (CRI) to look at 105 Western schools which had a single counselor-principal pair. Sixteen survey questions were consolidated into four role functions: prevention, remediation, commitment, and sub-professional duties. Principals were asked to respond twice to each question, once as a consideration of the school counselor's &quot;ideal role,&quot; and again as they considered typical practice in their schools. Counselors responded three times, the third response seeking the counselor's perception of how the principal viewed the counselor's role. Data were analyzed to identify patterns and magnitude of congruence between the two groups. Congruent patterns  were evidenced in only 11 of 35 possible congruences. The data indicates, however, that the differences causing the divergent patterns were very small, suggesting substantial agreement between counselors and principals concerning the counselor's role. Both groups saw a similar, relatively small gap between the ideal set of activities and what was typically being done. Counselors viewed their principals as favoring less prevention, remediation, and commitment functions, and more sub-professional duties than was actually noted by principals. The paper suggests that counselors and principals should recognize areas of agreement concerning the school counselor's role and act constructively on that agreement. It calls for clear communication and support for the development of efficient,  effective, and professional definitions of the counselor's role. (TES)",

This hypothetical student possessed an undergraduate degree from a large university and had decided to major in HRD to increase her opportunities for employment, advancement, or financial reward. HRD majors differed significantly from business administration, educational administration, public administration, and counseling majors with  respect to sex, race, important mentors, and size of undergraduate institution. Most graduates: (1) held positions in which at least half of their time was engaged in HRD activities; (2) were satisfied with their decisions to major in HRD and with their current jobs; and (3) claimed their HRD degree helped them to get a job or promotion.

        "description":"The Migrant Education Region 1 of the Santa Clara County Office of Education organized a project to examine the conditions of 1454 migrant students in a sample of northern California schools. The project had two primary components: (1) the collection and analysis of information about migrant students, their family and school situations, and their schools' migrant education programs in order to identify the primary factors contributing to high dropout rates; and (2) the examination of the identified factors in order to suggest strategies to ameliorate the problems faced by migrant students. A causal model of the dropout process that identified the interrelationships existing among the characteristics of dropouts was developed. The underlying assumption of this model is that  student performance on measures such as test scores, grade point average, absence rate, and discipline problems is strongly related to whether or not a student will drop out of school. The findings of the project strongly suggest that the number of migrant students graduating from high school is positively associated with the following factors: student participation in extracurricular activities; affective student measures (such as positive student attitudes toward education and locus of control); bilingual instruction; Hispanic staff; and parental support for education and home-school relations. The educational prospects for migrant students could be improved by undertaking such strategies as increasing parental involvement, improving staff training, setting up a student monitoring  system, providing counseling, tutoring, and homework assistance, and encouraging extracurricular activities.

        "description":"This paper examines the claim that instruction specially adapted to the &quot;visual learning styles&quot; of Native American students results in improved learning. Substantial cross-cultural research suggests that Native American children have special strengths in spatial abilities and visual memory and that observational learning is an important cultural orientation. However, an extensive computerized literature search yielded only three studies that empirically tested the proposition that the instruction adapted to Native Americans' learning styles increases achievement, and it was found after a careful review which this paper reports that virtually none of the results substantially demonstrates the educational benefits of adapted instruction. Nonetheless, the concept of &quot;Native  American learning styles&quot; continues to enjoy considerable popularity. It is speculated that the idea persists for the following reasons: (1) educators prefer to avoid &quot;deficit&quot; language; (2) the concept is useful for obtaining funding for culturally oriented programs; and (3) the concept is useful for summarizing a variety of instructional adaptations necessary in a cross-cultural context. The paper concludes that future research might demonstrate some educational benefits from visually-oriented instruction but the lack of progress in the broader area of aptitude-treatment interactions offers no basis for optimism. It is suggested that researchers interested in improving Native American education might better direct their investigations elsewhere. This document includes a 26-item  bibliography. (TES)",

Three chapters on the Ottawa, Potawatomi, and Ojibway (or Chippewa) peoples follow an introduction on the prehistoric roots of Michigan Indians. Each chapter reflects the integration of cultural and historical information about the Indians. The chapter on the Potawatomi stresses the political activities and economic forces affecting the tribe in southwestern Michigan. It includes biographical information on 19th century Potawatomi leaders. The second chapter focuses on the subsistence patterns and indigenous environmental relations of the Ojibway, while touching on the  spiritual connotations of their existence. It is a generic treatment of Ojibway life, customs, beliefs, and the subsequent federal policies affecting them. The chapter on the Ottawa provides an extended discussion of their contact with European powers and explores the Indians' responses and adaptations to changing environmental and sociopolitical circumstances. This book contains many historical photographs and a five-page bibliography. (TES)",

This two-section report is based on the 1980 census sample (approximately 19% of housing units), and contains 27 extensive data tables describing demographic and economic characteristics of U.S. American Indian tribes. Tables estimate 1980 census population totals for each tribe for the nation, regions, divisions, states, and selected counties. All tribes, clans, bands, or groups with at least 30 persons are included. Characteristics presented at the national and state levels include age, sex, household and family type, fertility rate, language, educational attainment, school enrollment, labor force participation, occupation, income, and poverty status. Some information is offered  for American Indians living on reservations, tribal trust lands (off reservations), and the historic areas of Oklahoma (excluding urbanized areas), and for American Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts living in Alaska Native villages. Census data are based on self-identification and thus may differ from data of other sources, such as tribal governments or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. An introduction describes data sources and related materials and the organization of this report. Appendices explain: (1) area classifications; (2) subject characteristics and comparability of 1980 data with 1970 census data; (3) general enumeration and processing procedures; (4) sample design, estimation procedures, and data accuracy; and (5) the census publications and computer tape program.

        "description":"During the 1980s Alaska's state and local governments spent two to three times more per capita than governments in other states but taxed individuals and businesses only about half as much. They were able to do this because high petroleum revenues paid most government expenses. Petroleum revenues began declining in the 1980s, and by the year 2000, will leave an estimated $1 billion gap in the state budget. If state and local governments taxed individuals and businesses at national average rates, they could cut this gap in half. This paper analyzes potential revenues for Alaska governments. It examines how much tax Alaska's state and local governments currently collect and estimates how much different tax collections would be if tax rates were at national averages. Taxes paid by  individuals and businesses and by resource industries are separately examined. Income tax, property taxes, federal transfers to the state, state transfers to local governments, interest, general sales tax, resource taxes, and resource ownership revenues are discussed with a consideration of the effects of world oil prices and potential economic development. Five arguments against raising taxes are examined. This report contains 11 graphs. (SV)",

This ERIC digest is a summary of the latest available demographic and socioeconomic trends on Mexican-Americans. It discusses the broad implications for education that follow from these trends. In 1990, the Census Bureau estimated that 12,565,000 Mexican-Americans were living in this country, and that Mexican Americans represented the most rapid growing ethic group in the U.S. due to its high immigration and fertility rates. Mexican Americans are becoming increasingly an urban population, concentrated in California and Texas. Mexican-American population characteristics include younger age,  larger family size, marital stability, the least educational attainment, and low-status occupations. In 1988 about 25% of all Mexican American families lived below the official poverty line; many of these families include working adults, but their wages are generally so low that they remain part of the &quot;working poor.&quot; The final section of the digest considers the implications of these demographic and socioeconomic characteristics in terms of the following: (1) young-adult school dropouts; (2) young parents; (3) cultural and language considerations for schools; (4) the need for expanded preschool opportunities; and (5) Mexican-American students' need for guidance, encouragement, and counseling.

First, it articulates the ongoing debate about which language to use for instruction. Second, it examines myths about the negative effects of bilingualism. And finally, it presents supporting evidence and suggestions for creating a responsive educational environment for bilingual Mexican-American students. The bilingualism debate pits those who believe that two-language instruction helps develop general language and thinking skills against those who believe early and intensive English instruction is the most effective and appropriate way for learning in an English-dominant environment. Early research identified bilingualism as a handicap, finding that  bilingualism caused language confusion among children. More recent studies show that young children who live in nurturing bilingual environments do not develop linguistic handicaps and even demonstrate cognitive advantages over monolinguistic children. Current studies support the idea that bilingual language instruction should match the natural social context of the student, showing that the better a child masters language in general, the better that child performs academics in English. The digest concludes with five recommendations for teachers who wish to give rewarding instruction to bilingual and Spanish monolingual students. This digest includes 10 references. (TES)",

        "author":["Lutz, Frank W."],
        "description":"This ERIC digest examines the slowed pace of school district reorganization since 1970 and the expanded role of state education agencies (SEAs). It also reports trends that influence consideration of various reorganization forms and considers the framework in which future policy options may take shape. The decades from 1940 to 1970 show the largest declines in the number of U.S. school districts, largely attributable to the reorganization of small and rural districts. Still, in 1987-88, approximately 53% of all schools were located in nonmetropolitan areas. The slowed pace of school-district reorganization since 1970 seems not to be caused by any reduction in the power of the various SEAs. Several trends, in fact, suggest that the influence of SEAs may be increasing in rural  areas. Other trends that influence school-district reorganization include: (1) litigation over fiscal equality; (2) problems in reaching consensus on what adequate support for education might be; and (3) research findings that indicate possible negative effects of large scale organizational units on learning, especially for at-risk students. Education reform in the 1980s has reflected a national, often urban-based consensus. Rural and small schools, especially in impoverished areas, are more likely to be judged &quot;inefficient&quot; than large urban ones. Research suggests, however, that what happens in the classroom is still the ultimate measure of the effectiveness of school-reform. Small-scale reorganization has shown potential for positive educational results. Policymakers continue to face  the task of balancing small schools' higher costs with the advantages they offer, especially for at-risk students. (TES)",

        "author":["Kleinfeld, Judith"],
        "description":"This ERIC digest discusses the theoretical basis of case teaching and examines its strengths and limitations as a tool for teacher education. Case teaching presents authentic, concrete teaching problems for students to analyze. The study of a classroom fight, for example, might draw discussion of racial, ethical, political, and other community issues, as students consider questions faced by teachers and administrators in such situations. The case method has long been used in professional training for business, law, and medicine, but has only recently been explored in the preparation of teachers. Case method teaching provides vicarious experience of a variety of concrete cases, sharpening students' understanding of the profession. It offers models of how to think professionally  about problems, and enhances teachers' ability to learn from their own experiences. The case method also illuminates human exchanges that are often the core of teaching problems, increases students' repertoire of educational strategies, and helps students learn to spot issues early. Case method teaching is, however, not a systematic means of teaching, nor do cases give students actual practice in pedagogical skills. Some faculty find it hard to locate good case-teaching materials or fear that classes can degenerate into pointless exchanges of personal opinions. The document lists sources for cases and provides pointers on instruction. It encourages teacher educators to develop their own cases that fit into a particular educational context such as an ethnic community or a rural small  school. The document also includes sources of Alaska cases developed by rural educators. (TES)",

It includes several definitions of literacy applied by effective rural literacy programs. It also examines the conditions that support or limit widespread influence of effective programs in rural areas. The level of concern about adult literacy in rural areas varies with economic, social, and political differences. Literacy programs vary with the definitions of literacy those areas adopt. Goals for adult literacy programs may include promoting economic productivity, increasing social equity, or stimulating political change. Competency-based programs generally define literacy as the minimum skill required for a high school diploma. Volunteer programs  serve adults whose reading achievement is below the fourth-grade level. Community-oriented programs help adults determine their own reading needs. Some U.S. rural literacy projects offer a single service while others offer more, such as tutors, learning centers, and independent-study projects. A scarcity of available funding often limits rural literacy programs. Moreover, the goal of many programs, that of improving the rural economy, can pose a potential threat to program effectiveness. If the expected economic benefits fail to develop, programs can lose the support of external funding sources. Nevertheless, rural literacy programs manage to persist and to succeed for many reasons, among them the involvement of the community in program development, promotion, and evaluation.  (TES)",

        "description":"This ERIC digest examines recent research about the use of manipulatives to teach mathematics. &quot;Manipulatives&quot; refers to objects that can be touched and moved by students to introduce or reinforce a mathematical concept. The digest also speculates on some of the challenges affecting future use of manipulatives. Since the 19th century, educators have advocated the active involvement of children in learning. Research suggests that manipulatives are particularly useful in helping children move from the concrete to the abstract level. Building the bridge between these levels, however, requires careful structuring of manipulatives by the teacher. Studies indicate that manipulatives can be effective when used properly. Issues relating to the implementation and success of manipulatives  include the availability of manipulatives, the period of students' exposure to manipulatives, and teachers' experience and training. Two influences will probably affect the use of manipulatives in the future: schools' efforts to conform to the &quot;Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics&quot; and the commitment of state resources to transform theory into practice. Some state and local initiatives have mandated the implementation of manipulatives through policy, law, or curriculum documents. Among the states that mandate or encourage manipulative use are California, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. The document concludes that further research is needed to shed more light on the effectiveness of manipulatives in both elementary and secondary schools. The document includes 10  references. (TES)",

        "description":"This ERIC digest gives elementary school teachers realistic information about American Indians and Alaska Natives and identifies some of the common myths based on ethnic bias. Bias against Indians is often the result of inaccurate information. Stylized classroom accounts of Indian life reinforce &quot;buckskin-and- feather&quot; or &quot;Eskimo and igloo&quot; stereotypes. Indians who defended their homelands from invaders have been portrayed as enemies of progress, barriers to frontier settlement, and, more recently, a &quot;social problem&quot; draining national resources. Teachers can be victims of the instructional materials they count on, and so they should become consciously aware of the processes by which they choose such materials. In recent years, American Indians have recognized their right to  insist upon accurate and unbiased accounts of their own history and culture and more and more educators are realizing that this right extends to all students. Myths about native peoples are commonplace, occurring in history, law, sociology and economics. Many people believe, for example, that American Indians share a common language and culture, when there are actually more than 300 officially recognized tribes, distinct in many ways including language. Other examples of myths about Indians include the &quot;first Thanksgiving&quot; stories that were created in the 1890s to promote the &quot;melting pot&quot; theory of American social progress. Instead of repeating such myths, teaches should encourage classroom discussion of real and current Indian issues (such as land and fishing rights) as a means of  teaching American Indian history and establishing Native Americans as a people.

Evidence indicates that many current calculus courses are not serving students well. In addition, computers and advanced calculators can now do many of the manipulations that students learn in calculus. Discussed in this digest are: the status of calculus in high school mathematics; enrollment and success patterns in college calculus; the calculus needs of various college majors; calculus teaching methods in colleges and universities; and curriculum development support from the National Science Foundation.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of an eclectic thinking processes model on the logical reasoning abilities of students in grades six through twelve. The experimental school consisted of 159 students whereas the control school had 111 students. The Group Assessment of Logical Thinking (GALT) was administered to the sample as a post-test. The thinking processes model incorporated logical, critical, and creative thinking skills. Teachers in the experimental school were presented with the model during workshops during the summers of 1986 and 1987. These teachers were encouraged to infuse the thinking processes into the mandated curricula during the 1986-1987 school term and were expected to do so in the fall of 1987. The control district neither participated  in the two summer workshops nor were expected to infuse thinking processes into the mandated curricula. For both the experimental and the control school, correlational reasoning followed by probabilistic reasoning was the most difficult. The experimental school performed significantly higher than the control in controlling variables, correlational reasoning, and the total GALT score. Classification of the students according to reasoning levels revealed that only 3% of the total sample performed at the formal operational reasoning level. The significant differences favoring the experimental school seemed to indicate that the eclectic thinking processes model was effective. (CW)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to understand the conceptual frameworks that sixth-grade students use to explain the nature and structure of matter and molecules; and (2) to assess the effectiveness of two alternate instructional units in helping students change those conceptions. The study involved 15 sixth-grade classes taught by 12 teachers in each of 2 successive years. Student misconceptions were investigated during the first year. Clinical interviews administered to 24 students and tests administered to 365 students revealed that their thinking about the nature of matter and about physical changes in matter differed from canonical scientific thinking in a number of ways. The main purpose of the second year of the study was to compare the effectiveness of the  original commercial teaching unit with revised curriculum materials in promoting student understanding of matter and molecules. Posttest scores for both years were compared. The differences in posttest scores concerning aspects of matter and molecules were statistically significant for 9 of the 10 conceptual categories studied. Implications for science teaching and curriculum development are discussed. Conceptual frameworks, charts of student conceptions and tasks, a copy of the pre/posttest, and the interview protocol and analysis system are appended. (CW/Author)",

John Marshall's presidential address describes how educational psychological research can contribute to strategies of discipline in the classroom. John Logan reports on a study to determine pupils' participation in schooling in Ireland during the last century. Sean Griffin provides a vivid case study of the Glasnevin Village Industrial Model School 1847-1877. Sean Farren illuminates Catholic-Nationalist attitudes to education in Northern Ireland against the background of the establishment of the new and independent Free State. John Turpin sketches a portrait of teaching painting at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art and some of the educational politics of that particular institution during a  period of transition. A contemporary history of multi-denominational schooling is given by Aine Hyland. Margaret Libreri continues the theme of religious education with an analysis of rights and denominational schooling. Dennis Hainsworth discusses the notion of aesthetic education in the Soviet Union, and Patrick Costello argues the case of philosophy for primary school pupils. Desmond Swan provides a case study of the European Schools. Tom Power discusses the economics of educational planning, and John D'Arcy reports on an inquiry with probationer teachers. Connie McKernan and Ian Wells look at the integration of children with special needs in Northern Ireland, and David McEwen and others discuss a model for training adults with a wide range of mental handicaps.

Scope refers to the ways in which the content of various units taught in the social studies curriculum are fashioned. Sequence refers to the order in which these units are taught. An examination of the following guidelines is suggested to determine the scope of social studies units: a focus on each of the six major social science disciplines (geography, history, political science, economics, anthropology, and sociology) major activities of human beings; and the interests and needs of students. There are a number of approaches teachers and administrators may take when deciding the sequence in which social studies units are taught. These approaches include the  expanding environment of the student; decisions made soley by teachers, principals, and supervisors; teacher-pupil planning; current affairs; and the &quot;schools without walls&quot; concept, which involves immersing students in the community beyond the school.

The study's primary objective was to provide data to be used for the development of materials and methods in the training and education of museum registrars. Designed to encourage museum registrars to express how they view themselves in relation to their work was mailed to 434 museum registrars in the United States and Canada. In addition, 100 museum directors were surveyed on how they perceive the role of the registrar. Other components of the research design of the project included the production of color videotapes based on study topics selected by the  registrars. An annotated bibliography also was compiled by members of the advisement group for the project. Based on the findings of the research, the following five recommendations were made: (1) more research should be undertaken on museum training; (2) a larger quantity of training materials more relevant to the needs of museums should be created; (3) study centers for museum professionals should be established; (4) more technical assistance should be obtained by museums; and (5) the use of color videotape for operational purposes in museums should be explored. Appendices include: (1) the survey instrument; (2) a computerized profile of a museum registrar; (3) data on functions performed by museum registrars; (4) interview questions; and (5) the script of a videotape on the job-related  tasks of a museum registrar entitled &quot;When the Show Moves On.&quot; Tables, figures, and a partially annotated bibliography of general reference books, books on automation, computerization, conservation, and museum registration, and periodicals are included.

The fundamental themes for geographic education are: (1) Location: position on the Earth's surface; (2) Place: physical and human characteristics; (3) Relationships within places: humans and environments; (4) Movement: humans interacting on the Earth; and (5) Regions: how they form and change. The cognitive skills that are  developed in these courses are grouped as follows: asking geographic questions; acquiring geographic information; presenting geographic data; interpreting and analyzing geographic information; developing and testing hypotheses and geographic generalizations.

        "description":"Research on restructuring domain-specific knowledge suggests that inferences made by a learner are based more on what and how concepts are structured and organized in particular domains than on the age of the learner. In this view, it is possible for children to operate more expertly in a particular area than could be explained by global stage or the \"expanding environment\" theories. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how domains are structured and organized in classrooms, and the ways in which children respond to those structures. This paper discusses the nature of history instruction in a nontraditional first grade classroom and is based primarily on classroom observation. The class operates from what the teacher identifies as a \"whole language\" perspective in which  cross-disciplinary thematic units are the focus of instruction. The teacher teaches from what is labeled a \"perspective of care.\" Historical content is specifically structured to emphasize personal response, ways of \"finding out,\" and the development of ethical/moral sensibilities. Among the conclusions drawn are that history, can be shaped to particular forms and structures in the classroom based on the teacher's conception of history, and that even very young children can begin to develop the interest and understanding that lead to mature historical thinking.

This model is a means by which students' natural affinity for socialization and inclination to attend to their own personal agendas may be used to increase learning motivation and effectiveness. The model may be used to enhance collaboration skills related to the processing of information and the construction of knowledge. Although this strategy has been specifically developed to augment information processing skills related to artistic creation and critique, it was designed with full recognition that these functions are subsumed under the rubric of general cognitive construction. Additional (albeit incidental) advantages of the model  include development of socialization skills and cross-cultural awareness and appreciation. A suggested outline for teaching from this model is included, as is a 16-item bibliography. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Americans traditionally have looked to the public schools to play a role in transmitting society's values to students, and on various occasions the U.S. Supreme Court has emphasized the role of the nation's schools in inculcating basic values. For many years Maine has had a statute mandating the teaching of virtue and morality and another that mandates teaching about the nation's flag. The task of identifying what values are to be taught and their role in the curriculum, however, is entrusted for the most part to local school boards. Despite the broad discretion given to local boards in determining curriculum and managing the schools, some specific legal constraints apply to the teaching of values. This paper is a survey of some of the major legal issues implicated in efforts to  teach or instill values in the public schools. The major doctrinal areas of legal constraints on values instruction discussed in the paper are: (1) religion; (2) political orthodoxy; (3) teacher versus personal affirmation; (4) parental rights; and (5) teachers' academic freedom. A legal case in Maine (Solmitz v. M.S.A.D. No. 59) involving an effort to inculcate values in the schools is presented as a case study. (DB)",

However, after the Indo-Aryan invasion of India, women were reduced to images of insignificance when compared to the power given to the Indo-Aryan male deities.

Teachers of social studies may feel especially unprepared to deal with the needs of the disabled reader. This digest provides teachers with information and resources for differentiating social studies instruction for students with reading difficulties.

The ways that geography education has contributed to citizenship education as the two have developed during this century are examined. It is argued that students who study geography should develop competencies in three areas: (1) literacy in the subject matter of geography; (2) the ability to apply geography, its fundamental themes, skills, and perspectives to a wide range of political, economic, social, and environmental issues; and (3) knowledge to help students actively participate as citizens in their local communities, the nation, and the world.

This paper contends that the paradigm for art in the elementary schools must include the interplay of this context with a commitment to &quot;re-viewing&quot; the foundations for and contemporary developments in the four constituent disciplines of art making, art history, art criticism, and aesthetics. These four components of discipline-based art education (DBAE) will lead to more effective elementary-classroom teaching if students learn how to study and create art forms to be valued, in much the same way they should have value themselves for their independent form, for their membership in one of many histories of  similar forms, and for their contribution to the multicultural intellectual history of a given period. Elementary teachers should enable students to establish the behavior and to develop the perceptual skills for learning to see visually and culturally. A 38-item bibliography is included.

        "description":"This paper offers a synopsis of the findings of a full-length ethnographic study which dealt with the phenomenon of the strong, veteran teacher who has succeeded in remaining enthusiastic over the course of a 30-year career. Subjects were five secondary school teachers of varied ethnic backgrounds representing a range of disciplines and teaching in widely divergent settings. Through open-ended interviews and participant observations, the study explored those factors in the home lives, career histories, and personalities of these teachers that have contributed to their resiliency and success over time. The study also explored the extent to which the beliefs and attitudes of these five subjects corresponded to the ones attributed to veteran experts in other literature in the area.  Although the teachers varied widely in their teaching styles and personalities, key similarities were found among them. These included: retention of the novice perspective on teaching and an urgency and vitality in their approach to teaching; their emphasis on teacher control and consistent pursuit of self-actualization, with much less emphasis on student enablement; and low esteem for their own teacher preparation. These five teachers applauded recent attempts to reduce required classroom hours in education and refocus attention on academic coursework. What they described as lacking in their own education comes close to what has been called pedagogical content knowledge, i.e., subject knowledge presented ass it might be taught, with sensitivity to the structure of specific disciplines  and the way learners assimilate those structures.

The vast majority of mathematics graduates in the USSR are females, primarily because most mathematics graduates will become teachers and most males do not want to teach because of low salaries and lack of respect for teachers. This problem is shared by the U.S. In the USSR, mathematics majors will take approximately 146 U.S. credit hours of mathematics during their 5-year program as compared to 45-50 credits at U.S. institutions. General education receives a great deal of emphasis in U.S. schools, whereas in Soviet schools very little, if any, emphasis is placed on general education since so much is done at earlier levels. It is apparent that Soviet  educators in grades 1-10 are better prepared in mathematics than their American counterparts. This lack of preparation of U.S. teachers could be one of the factors which leads to the discouraging comparisons as between the achievement of American students and students of other nationalities.

        "description":"Educators have recently become more willing to realign the educational system. One approach is restructuring, which can take many forms. This study looks at three districts that restructured teaching, two with career ladders and one with shared governance. The reforms took two directions--professional and bureaucratic--which had important consequences for the process and outcomes of the restructuring. Many factors were encompassed in the direction taken, including how districts addressed certain dimensions of job and organizational design; i.e., authority and autonomy. Political factors that shaped the direction of development include the shape of the state program; the support of the board; the vision of the superintendent; and the interactions of board, superintendent, teachers  and teachers' associations. Where the direction was bureaucratic--imposed from the top down with little or no teacher influence--there was significant teacher resistance, standardization of curriculum and instruction, and negative impacts on teacher motivation. Where the direction was professional--developed locally with significant teacher influence--there was widespread teacher acceptance, significant differentiation in curriculum and instruction, and positive impacts on teacher motivation. Where the direction was mixed--both top down and teacher-influenced design and implementation--results were mixed and difficult to assess. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"Studies have addressed the substantive knowledge of teachers and the content that is actually taught in classrooms. Some research has indicated that teachers have difficulty teaching certain areas because they themselves lack sufficient understanding about those areas. In considering the kind or amount of subject matter knowledge teachers need, discussion centers around the content of the subject itself, the organization and structure of that content, and methods of inquiry used within the subject. These three aspects are construed as the core aspects of subject matter knowledge. Consideration of subject-specific pedagogy provides the example of a science teacher who wants students to understand the scientific method. Three different pedagogies are described, each teaching  something different about the scientific method. An analysis of the kind of policies that address subject matter knowledge focuses on: research pertaining to the generally accepted concept of teachers and their functions, current methods of evaluating teachers' subject matter knowledge, and the difficulty of attaining the high standards considered desirable. A 48-item bibliography is included. (JD)",

The mentors provide a variety of support services for the inductees at the building level, focusing on the pedagogical, emotional, and social adjustment needs of the inductees. The mentors receive a total of 12 hours of training during the school year. The teacher scholars provide demonstration lessons, coteaching sessions, and a variety of support services for inductees. With their extensive teaching backgrounds and familiarity with the various content areas, the scholars also represent a critical alternative source of instructional support for the inductees. The scholars act as the liaisons between inductees and mentors, especially in  dysfunctional situations where personalities or instructional philosophies differ. This report describes: (1) the program as implemented in the 1988-89 school year; (2) the effectiveness of the program implementation; and (3) the effectiveness of the program in achieving the program goals.

Students (N=904) responded to a 28-item questionnaire designed to assess their attitudes about teacher status. The questions were developed to reveal significant differences in attitudes of students at different grade levels and of different genders. Student responses indicated significant gender and grade differences in attitudes. More responses favoring teaching were selected by female than by male students. Third-grade students had the highest percentage of positive responses regarding teacher status, followed by twelfth-, sixth-, and ninth-grade students, in that order.  While the majority of students indicated positive feelings about the performance of their own teachers and viewed teaching as a job to be proud of, they did not perceive teaching as a viable career option for themselves. An analysis of student responses is presented and suggestions are made for the direction of future research studies. (JD)",

The CST graduate degree model, begun in the 1970s and continued into the present, emphasizes learners working together in a cohort in a common sequence of courses. In the cohort model, CST is able to identify student needs in terms of course selection and focus for professional development. The administrators and faculty of CST are able to talk about the needs they can meet through established degree, certificate, or licensure programs. Because CST has a group of people committed for the duration of the program, it is possible to maintain a guaranteed cost of tuition and  other fees. The program is designed so that students can maintain their current employment except during their term of student teaching and preclinical experiences. The CST model has been successfully implemented in California, Tennessee, and Virginia, as well as in its home state of Minnesota. (JD)",

Articular cartilage is the smooth covering over the surface of bone at joints, and is comprised of up to 80 percent water. This smooth covering serves to decrease the friction between the surfaces in synovial joints, and it serves as a cushioning and shock absorbing surface in the joints of the lower limb. Overuse activities and the aging process will cause damage to articular cartilage, producing pain, loss of joint mobility, and eventual damage to bone. Tendons and ligaments are similar in structure, being comprised primarily of collagen fibers arranged in parallel bundles. These collagen fibers are embedded in a  fluid matrix, along with chonrocytes and proteoglycan molecules. Overuse activities and the aging process will cause inflammation and weakness of the collagen bundles, resulting in strain injuries or chronic inflammation. Strenuous training programs which include eccentric exercise and deceleration activities may strengthen ligaments and tendons and prevent injuries. (Author/JD)",

It was found that most novice teachers perceived their mentoring experiences to be helpful; however, they rated other professionals in their school districts as being more helpful in aiding their transition into teaching than their formally assigned mentor teachers. The novice elementary teachers rated their building principals as being more helpful, and the novice secondary teachers rated other teacher colleagues as being more helpful than the mentor teachers. The areas of mentoring assistance found to be most valued by the neophyte teachers were in meeting school requirements and procedures, handling pupil  discipline, and dealing with other professionals. Most of the first-year teachers reported spending considerable amounts of time with their teacher mentors (15 or more hours). The less well-prepared novice teachers spent less time with their mentor teachers and rated their principals as being more helpful in facilitating their transition into the profession than did the better prepared first-year teachers.

        "description":"This study examined differences between public and Catholic schools concerning teachers' pupil control ideology, teachers' pupil control behavior, and students' perceptions of their classroom environments. The concepts of humanistic and custodial pupil control ideologies were used to contrast types of individual orientations and the types of school organizations that they seek to rationalize and justify. Custodial orientation depicts a classroom atmosphere with a rigid and highly controlled setting concerned primarily with the maintenance of order. Humanistic orientation conceives of the school and classroom as an educational community in which students learn through cooperative interaction and experience. The subjects of the study were secondary teachers and students in two  public school districts and in the Catholic schools in a large city in the Midwest. Teachers in the Catholic schools were found to be more humanistic in pupil control ideology than teachers in public schools; however, no statistically significant differences were found in either pupil control behavior or students' perceptions of their teachers' control patterns. The finding that teacher humanism in pupil control ideology and behavior is associated with students' perceptions of classroom life as more interesting, challenging, and action-packed, supports earlier research; it shows that teachers do make a difference in what school is like for students.

Eleven preservice secondary teachers were followed through their student teaching program. The subjects were required to keep a journal daily and to complete six topical papers during the course of the program. Classroom observations were conducted weekly. It was found that initially the student teachers focused on the teaching situation (content, lesson preparation, learning outcomes) and on their performance of these teaching tasks.  As they assumed more responsibility and tested their cognitive construct against the realities they perceived, they discarded the cognitive construct, focusing rather on survival concerns--classroom control and coping with the demands of students. The change in constructs was reflected in changes in observed classroom behavior. Questions are raised for further research. (JD)",

Specifically, the study examined the relationship between the emotional aspect of burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and: (1) background variables (age, marital status, teaching experience, level of education, and grade level teaching); (2) job conditions (number of students, time pressures, instructional complexity, and assessment responsibility); and (3) perceived degree of stress associated with job tasks. From the target population, 215 female LD teachers in resource service delivery models in Missouri responded to a survey containing the MBI, a resource LD teacher's job  conditions questionnaire, and a work task stressor scale. The findings on each of the variables and combinations of variables are presented and discussed. Among the conclusions reached were that teachers who experience more demands on themselves experience more emotional exhaustion; LD teachers do not sense support from parents and administrators; and teachers who share assessment duties with other professionals experience less intense feelings of exhaustion.

        "description":"The philosophical and educational significance of the present study lies in its attempt to clarify the value and importance of the Socratic legacy for education, in addition to underscoring the difficulty of understanding that legacy. Perspectives on Socrates and his legacy, from Friedrich Nietzsche to contemporary critics, such as Bruce Kimball and Sophie Haroutunian-Gordon, provide insight into the ways the Socratic philosophical tradition has influenced contemporary liberal education. Examples from several key Socratic dialogues demonstrate that a misunderstanding of the nature and mission of Socratic teaching is easy to come by. An examination of some current manifestations of Socratic pedagogy leads to the conclusion that there is a widespread use of the term &quot;Socratic&quot; in  descriptions of certain types of teaching from kindergarten through law school and that some of these uses derive from a misunderstanding of Socrates. Although many critics have provided enough textual evidence to arouse suspicion about the value of Socratic method in education, there is also evidence that an enduring core of the Socratic tradition is valuable for teaching. This core is found in the larger issues raised in the dialogues: the project of moral inquiry and a searching that cuts across social class. These Socratic issues should be of foremost use, and ultimate worth in present-day teaching. (JD)",

The research took place in four secondary schools in Scotland. A random sample of students (aged 12-16 years) in each of the schools were asked to write the names of the three teachers in the school who were best at getting the class to work well and to write what it was that each of the three teachers did that made the class work well. The 16 selected teachers were observed for 2 weeks. Brief interviews with each teacher sought to elicit the teacher's own constructs of what he or she did to get the class to work well. From the analysis of the teachers' descriptions and explanations of what they do to maintain effective discipline and keep the class running  smoothly, a framework was derived for understanding effective classroom discipline. The framework, grounded in teachers' actual practice, not in what they think they ought to do or what they would do in ideal circumstances, has three main elements: actions, goals, and conditions. The framework could be used in three ways: (1) helping beginning teachers to analyze classroom practice; (2) helping beginning teachers to reflect upon their practice; and (3) helping beginning teachers to develop their lesson planning.

Observation in Israeli elementary schools has indicated that interactive behavior of students in their learning sequence holds potential for quality cooperation and help among children, but that teachers lack the skills to structure learning tasks that will enhance a high level of cooperation. Based on prior research an integrative model of the classroom was developed, and a detailed developmental stage taxonomy was suggested to describe, explain, guide, and predict students' cooperative interaction in all types of classroom structures. The model is based on six related dimensions: (1) the physical organization of the classroom; (2) the nature of the learning task; (3) the instructional  mode of the teacher; (4) the communication pattern of the teacher; (5) student social-learning behaviors; and (6) students' academic-cognitive behavior. This model and the research that followed indicate that variation in learning task structures and teacher behavior are the main factors in shaping students' behaviors. The inclusion of cooperative learning as part of the daily experience in the classroom is proposed. (JD)",

        "description":"Social feminists insist on the relevance of personal experience and believe that, for changes to occur, it is essential to understand the dynamics of how and why gender roles are perpetuated. Social feminists view the career course of second-career teachers as vulnerable to the covert structures and curriculum of the schools. The social feminist position is documented throughout this paper. A case study discusses the biography of a 37-year-old woman, Sally, and provides data demonstrating the presence of gender socialization as a factor in her career course. Sally expressed the motivation for her career change in terms of traditional gender traits, such as nurturing and gentleness, and of the continuity between women's work as mothers in a family and as teachers in schools. At  the same time, her decision to teach is rooted in her opposition to the system in which she was educated. Her career change can, therefore, be viewed as motivated by a commitment to the possibility of social change. The data emerging from this study indicate that biography affects career motivation and performance and that gender socialization is an important component in biography, having a significant influence on who teachers and, ultimately, on what is taught and how. Implications for teacher education and the conduct of teacher education programs are indicated. (JD)",

The techniques are based on the idea of reframing, i.e., looking at experiences from a new perspective. From a cognitive psychological point of view, this means that the person's cognitions about a situation or phenomenon are restructured. Analysis of the characteristics of the process of restructuring cognitions leads to the conclusion that restructuring is promoted by student teachers' reflections on the relationships in their cognitions about teaching. The researchers worked out techniques to promote reflection on the relationships between: (1) educational goals and values; (2) educational goals and actual teaching behavior; (3) teacher behavior  and pupil characteristics as perceived by student teachers; and (4) goals, pupil characteristics, and teaching strategies. The techniques are described and results of their use in a group of student teachers and a group of teacher educators are discussed. (JD)",

        "description":"The School of Education at the University of Pittsburgh is discontinuing its undergraduate program in 1990 and will prepare only postbaccalaureate students as teachers beginning in 1990-91. The Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program had been developed as a one-year program for liberal arts graduates who want to become teachers. In this context, two fundamental assumptions made by those proposing a fifth-year teacher certification program were investigated: (1) the assumption that undergraduates in Arts and Sciences bring more content area knowledge and expertise to teaching than undergraduate education majors; and (2) that one year of practical experience (such as an internship) will prepare students to become teachers as well as or better than four years of practical  experience during the undergraduate years, which include one semester of student teaching. In this study, the relative academic skills of these two groups at the university were compared in reading, writing, math, general knowledge, and professional knowledge. The knowledge and skills of a sample of undergraduate elementary preservice teachers in teaching reading comprehension were also investigated. Results did not indicate meaningful differences in knowledge or ability between undergraduates and fifth year students; MAT students, however scored significantly higher than undergraduate students in professional knowledge. Although background experiences, educational experience, and field experiences of interns and student teachers differed, there appeared to be no great difference between  the teaching knowledge possessed and applied by the student teachers and that of the interns.

        "description":"Four studies were conducted on how well teachers at various stages of development can decode a student's nonverbal behavior, particularly that which communicates a lack of comprehension. Participants in the studies were novice (n=9), advanced beginner (n=10), and expert (n=10) elementary school teachers. In the first study, the teachers viewed a tape, without sound, showing fourth-grade students responding to a test. The teachers were informed that the test items were designed to elicit problem-solving behavior, that the students had the ability to accurately assess what they did and did not know, and that the students were chosen because they might emit accurate nonverbal clues as to whether or not they had comprehended the question being asked. Study 2 focused on assessment of  students' past performance as well as on nonverbal clues; study 3 repeated the test using as interpreters only the children who appeared in the tapes; study 4 used two preservice classes of teachers and sought information on how experience with children in social situations and self-ratings of social intelligence might affect performance. The major findings were that accuracy in decoding student comprehension from nonverbal clues is trainable and that classroom experience and knowledge of the child's personality, typical behavior, and past performance increase the accuracy of a teacher's assessment of a child's nonverbal behavior.

        "description":"This study describes a proactive approach to teacher empowerment that attended not only to public outside perspectives, but also to private internal ones. This approach is based on the concept that the power and authority which teachers exercise in the classroom can transform the teaching profession from the inside out. A committee of teachers was formed with the purpose of empowering teachers to make a public contribution. The committee exists within a loose national federation of 19 independent, college-preparatory elementary and high schools called here the \"Network.\" The committee grew out of a grassroots request by teachers for a structural forum where they could exercise their voice and authority in the public consideration of education issues both in the Network and beyond  it. The description and analysis of this committee is based on a model of the early stages of organizational development which proposes that every new group or organization involves the development of both ideas and relationships. The new group develops from ideas held by the founders which become embodied both in a design for the group and in the implementation of its specific details. In addition to describing the genesis of the committee and assessing its initial impacts, the paper discusses the model which guided the committee leaders and summarizes the activities of the committee during its first year.

The subjects were 150 students of both sexes in a typical Nigeria secondary school. Findings indicated that the acquisition of psycho-motor skills was enhanced by all the instructional methods used and that no one strategy was exclusively the most effective in teaching and learning the four psych-motor skills tested. However, the combination method recorded the highest score in effectiveness for two skills, while all the five methods tested were equally  effective for the learning of the other two skills. The finding that sex and instructional strategies had interacting influence on the learning of the skill led to the conclusion that both sexes require different instructional strategies to achieve maximum performance results in psycho-motor skills learning.

          "And Others"],
        "description":"This paper reports a comparative analysis of beginning and experienced teachers' thinking about teaching subtraction with regrouping commonly called \"borrowing\"), and the role that textbooks play in their deliberations. Twelve beginning and nine experienced teachers appraised and compared two contrasing textbook selections dealing with this topic and described how they would teach it with or without either of the textbooks. The analysis revealed both differences and similarities between the experienced and beginning teachers. Not surprisingly, experienced teachers had more elaborated lenses for looking at the textbooks and thinking about how to teach the topic. While both experienced and beginning teachers seemed to assume that manipulative materials were inherently worthwhile,  neither beginning nor experienced teachers discriminated among particular concrete materials and all seemed to think that seeing or touching such materials automatically produced understanding. Nor did the two groups differ significantly in their understandings of multidigit subtraction. This finding challenges the common belief that teachers learn about their subjects by teaching them. Rather, subject-specific knowledge of children's learning seems a more likely outcome of teaching experience. An important role for textbooks appears to lie in developing teachers' understandings of the appropriate use of concrete materials. (Author/JD)",

This paper explores that question by means of four cases drawn from a large data set about two different first-year teacher programs, an induction program sponsored by a university and a local school district, and an alternate certification program for secondary teachers sponsored by a school district and employing mentor teachers. Conversations between experienced and beginning teachers are discussed in relation to four aspects of learning to teach academic content: (1) deepening one's own understanding of subject matter; (2) learning to think about academic content from the students' perspective; (3) learning to  represent subject matter in appropriate and engaging ways; and (4) learning to organize students for the purposes of teaching and learning academic content.

        "author":["McCarthey, Sarah J."],
        "description":"Changes in the teacher's authority structure as well as changes in the content of student talk during peer response sessions occur over the course of a school year in a first-grade classroom. In the beginning of the year, the teacher, a beginner in the Teachers College Writing Project, dominated the talk during share sessions, while the students' talk consisted of generic praise and focused on logistical issues about texts. The authority structure changed over the course of the year to allow for students taking more control of the dialogue and focusing on ideas and content within student texts. The change in authority structure seemed to be reflected through a change in the nature of the content of what students say and what they attend to in the texts they hear. The teacher  still expressed her control in various ways, however, such as designating who should speak, moving the dialogue along, and offering her own interpretations which tended to constrain alternative interpretations. Even at the end of the year, it was not evident that students built upon one another's ideas in any traceable pattern. These limitations point to the need to change classroom norms and the fact that these are difficult to change, particularly teachers' need for classroom control. (Author/JB)",

The data gathered make it possible to establish national, regional, and local per capita income levels; develop national average pricing structures for parks and recreation agencies; and determine a mathematical model of pricing. A per capita pricing worksheet is  presented with a formula that can be applied on a national or regional basis, or be used for state comparisons. A specific zoning approach may be used to reflect the differences of income for a poverty versus an affluent area within the same community, each requiring different pricing strategies. (JD)",

        "description":"Teachers are viewed as important agents of change in the reform effort currently underway in education and thus are expected to play a key role in changing schools and classrooms. Paradoxically, however, teachers are also viewed as major obstacles to change because of their adherence to outmoded forms of instruction that emphasize factual and procedural knowledge at the expense of deeper levels of understanding. New constructivist approaches to teaching and learning, which many reformers advocate, are inconsistent with much of what teachers believe--a problem that may be overcome if teachers are willing to rethink their views on a number of issues. Four important aspects of current thinking that may get in the way of teachers adopting a constructivist approach to teaching and  learning are: (1) the tendency to think of both child and content as relatively fixed entities; (2) the tendency to equate activity with learning; (3) making a distinction between comprehension and application, learning and problem solving; and (4) viewing the curriculum as a fixed agenda. Identifying these views may advance the cause of constructivist reform. (Author/JD)",

Two factors contributing to these results have been the type of setting and the nontraining of the cooperating teacher. Recent studies have also shown through objective data that the effectiveness of the student teacher could be changed through various supervisory techniques. Thus, by incorporating the use of objective data, a trained supervisor could alter the experience of a student teacher towards effectiveness. Research in physical education teacher education has also supported the use of qualitative methods to enhance a student teaching experience. Therefore, a field study was conducted in which a trained  public school cooperating teacher recorded the overall experience of supervising a student teacher, incorporated various observation methods, and used the data collected to positively change teacher effectiveness. Through the use of both quantitative and ethnographic techniques, the final result of this study could contribute to the current research on the supervision of student teachers and effective teaching.

The approaches vary along two dimensions: how tasks are assigned and divided among students, and what counts toward team scores and rewards. Certain approaches have all students working on the same task, while others divide tasks among team members. Some give group rewards based on the total of individual team members' achievement, while others either do not give group rewards, or they reward groups as a whole based on something other than individual performance. A description is given of the different ways these models structure student tasks, accountability, and rewards. As an aid to determining which approaches are best  suited to particular instructional purposes, four cooperative learning goals are described: (1) to improve relations among groups; (2) to help the academically handicapped; (3) to increase self-esteem; and (4) to foster positive feelings about learning and school. Practical suggestions on using cooperative learning are offered as well as resources for further study. (JD)",

        "description":"This monograph identifies for researchers and teacher educators important questions about the ways in which race, ethnicity, and culture influence teachers' motivations and intentions for teaching, as well as their expectations of their students and of their own professional lives. Chapter 1, \"The Culture of Teachers: The Culture of Teaching,\" presents a general overview of common knowledge regarding the nature or culture of the profession and its participants, the generally accepted notions regarding teaching as an occupation, and the attitudes or needs that may prompt an individual to pursue this career. Chapter 2, \"Studying Teachers' Racial/Ethnic Cultures,\" suggests that for various reasons, educational researchers have generally overlooked this line of inquiry, which holds  promise for recruiting minority teachers, as well as explaining their performance and the achievement of children from these groups. Chapter 3, \"The Teaching Population: Present and Future,\" provides a general description of the current and prospective teaching population and leads into chapter 4, a discussion of racial and ethnic differences in \"Teacher Motivation, Rewards, and Incentives.\" Chapter 5, \"Racial /Ethnic Cultures,\" provides a brief descriptive profile of the major minority groups in the United States, and is a reference for much of the discussion. A 7-page bibliography concludes the volume. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the relationship of the content of nationally standardized and normed achievement tests and that of local school curricula and the effect that relationship has on the meanings and uses of the test scores. The following questions are considered: (1) whether tests have to match what is taught to be useful; (2) whether it is fair to teachers and students to use tests that include material not taught; (3) whether it is fair to use tests that do not include material that is taught; (4) whether local tests should be used instead of national tests; (5) whether national norms are needed; (6) whether some testing problems can be solved by the use of an item bank; and (7) whether or not it is possible to create a test that is tailor-made (customized) for local  curricula and still obtain national norms by embedding nationally calibrated items. Five general issues are considered: inferences that can be made from standardized test scores; the basis upon which standardized achievement tests are considered valid; whether standardized achievement tests measure curricula; what the new technologies can do; and what schools can do. The respective answers to the seven questions are as follows: (1) no; (2) yes, provided the material is part of the target domain; (3) yes; (4) only for purposes where norms are not needed or where local norms (internal comparisons) are sufficient; (5) for most uses of test scores, national norms are the most easily understood and most informative type of norms--however, for some uses such as checking on just what the  teachers are teaching, criterion reference scores may suffice; and (6) and (7) yes, in that more than one test can be blended together and put in one booklet--and no, in that unless the local curriculum very closely represents the domain sampled by a nationally normed test, two different tests are needed. Unless a very long test is acceptable, losses in reliability, domain coverage, and validity will ensue. (RLC)",

        "description":"This study was designed to find: a suitable effect size (ES) measure or common metric (CM) for comparing the results of a set of single subject research (SSR) studies; and an easy way to convert the published graphs back into raw data from which ESs could be calculated. To meet the first objective, three possible formulas for measuring treatment effect were evaluated and then compared using identical data sets. To meet the second objective, a computer method was developed. Data for the study were taken from two previously published meta-analyses of SSR studies. The larger of the two (n=23 articles) which used piece-wise regression (PR) to calculate an ES, was the Skiba, Casey, and Center (1985-86) study concerning the use of non-aversive procedures in the treatment of classroom  behavior problems. The smaller study (n=13 articles) which used the percent of non-overlapping data (PND) as a CM, was conducted by Scruggs, Mastropieri, Cook, and Escobar (1986) and concerned early intervention for children with conduct disorders. The CM study included a total of 195 graphed experiments. A simple comparison of the baseline and treatment phases from each graph was used; and a third possible CM was developed from an adaptation of Glass' formula (AGF) for group studies. The computerized method study used a scanner and a &quot;mouse&quot; device with a microcomputer. Data points were estimated by finding the screen coordinates of each point and using the scale on the ordinate. The PR model calculated an ES based on the combined effect of a change in level and slope between the two  phases; the PND model grossly measured the differences in level between the two phases; and the AGF ES measured a standardized difference between the means of the phases. In meta-analyses for SSR, when different ESs (based on different sets of assumptions) are calculated yielding similar results, the validity of the conclusions increases. Three graphs are included.

Focus was on the impact of differential course-taking patterns on the ACT scores according to gender and racial/ethnic group membership. Data for 5,655 seniors and 5,624 juniors from 28 states were analyzed. Regression models were developed for the five ACT scores using the expanded course transcript information from the Course Grade Information Section of the ACT Assessment as well as selected background variables. Separate analyses by racial/ethnic subgroup and gender were also  conducted to determine the relative contribution of each independent variable to the model. An additional analysis determined the reduction in the differences in ACT scores for sex and racial/ethnic groups when high school curricula, performance, and background characteristics were held constant. Results indicate that increased course-taking, particularly in mathematics and science, is related to improved ACT test performance. Course grades were highly related to ACT test scores. Significant sex and racial/ethnic group differences were also identified. The ACT Assessment Registration Form and 10 data tables are appended. (TJH)",

One central prediction model, referred to as pooled least squares with adjusted intercepts, assumes that slopes and residual variances are homogeneous across selected colleges. The second model, referred to as Bayesian m-group regression, allows estimates of slopes and variances to vary across colleges without ignoring the available collateral information. These models were compared with the more usual procedure of deriving regression equations within each college considered in isolation from other colleges. Data were obtained from colleges that participated in the American College Testing predictive research services program during the 1983 and 1984  years, and that had fewer than 100 records in 1983. Two groups of colleges were used: (1) 9 four-year colleges with &quot;liberal&quot;, or &quot;open,&quot; enrollment; and (2) 10 two-year colleges with more than 20 freshmen over the age of 25 years. It was found that both models using collateral information resulted in more accurate predictions, on cross validation, than did the within-college model, and that the Bayesian approach slightly outperformed the pooled least squares approach. It is noted that the Bayesian simultaneous regression model is highly adaptive to different regression structures and therefore can be expected to perform as well as the other two models across most situations.

These methods use collateral information across potentially diverse institutions to obtain refined within-group parameter estimates. One method, referred to as pooled least squares with adjusted intercepts, assumes that slopes and residual variances are homogeneous across selected colleges. The second method, referred to as Bayesian m-group regression, allows estimates of slopes and residual variances to vary across colleges, without ignoring available collateral information. These central prediction models were compared with the more usual procedure of deriving regression equations within each college considered in isolation. Data were obtained from colleges  participating in the American College Testing standard research services program during the 1983-84 academic year and during at least one of 1984-85, 1985-86, or 1986-87 academic years. Six analysis groups were used, ranging in size from 11 to 17 colleges, each with at least 20 and less than 100 observations. It was found that for both models using collateral information, a sample size of 20 resulted in a level of cross-validated prediction accuracy comparable to that obtained using the within-college least squares procedure at colleges with 50 or more observations. The Bayesian approach outperformed the pooled least squares approach. It is noted that the Bayesian approach is highly adaptive to different structures and can thus be expected to outperform the other two procedures across  most situations.

A utility-based approach to quantifying the effectiveness of placement rules is described; and its relationship to traditional predictive validity statistics, such as the multiple correlation and standard error of estimate, is explained. An example that is based on the ACT scores, self-reported high school grades, and freshmen English course grades of 5,609 students is presented. Results indicate that a sound argument for the validity of a placement rule defined in terms of  ACT Assessment scores can be based on the fit between the skills measured by the test battery and the skills required for success in a course. Demonstrating statistical relationships between test scores and performance in the course does not by itself provide a logical justification for the placement system, although it lends credibility to an argument based on content fit. Statistical decision theory provides a means by which an institution can evaluate the benefits and costs of a placement system. Utility-based statistics, developed in the context of a decision model, provide more appropriate information on the practical effectiveness of a placement test than do traditional validity statistics. Seven data tables and three graphs are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"This study is an analysis of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) School Questionnaire administered across three grade levels (grades 4, 8, and 12) during the 1987-88 school year. The data obtained from the school questionnaire represent one level of NAEP's data collection activities, in addition to the teacher questionnaires and the various student assessments. The analysis was based on an investigation of the relationships between policy changes and school climate, measured both by a composite scaled score and by individual questionnaire items, and individual grouping variables defining school poverty, school size, community type, and ethnicity. The results show a fairly consistent pattern of relationships among policy changes and school climate both in terms  of both how schools ranked on the various grouping dimensions and the results of analysis of variance and chi-square statistical tests. In terms of policy change, reported changes occurred more frequently in large, urban disadvantaged schools with predominantly non-white populations. Similarly, the reporting of school-related problems (such as absenteeism and tardiness) comprising the school climate score tended to be more prevalent in bigger city schools containing large minority and less advantaged populations. The results suggest that reform is occurring in those schools where it is needed most. Four data tables are included. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"This study investigated the construct validity of the revised Special Education-Mental Handicaps Georgia Teacher Certification Test (MH-TCT) using hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis and LISREL VI. The primary objective was to determine whether first-order and second-order factors correspond to item/objective/test relationships defined by judgments/consensual content validation studies. Data from four administrations of the MH-TCT were used in the analyses. Subjects included 287 candidates for certification in the mental handicaps subarea of special education. Since the sample size was small, findings were tentative. LISREL was used to examine the factor structure of the entire test as well as to identify test items that were not psychometrically sound. Although six  subdimensions were identified that correspond to the six test objectives, first-order factors corresponding to these were so highly correlated that a hierarchical model was rejected in favor of a unidimensional model. A unidimensional model was invariant across samples and time. Results suggest that the LISREL confirmatory maximum likelihood factor model provided a powerful tool for item analysis and test validation. A major drawback was the amount of computer run time needed to do maximum likelihood factor analysis. Four data tables and one flowchart are provided. (Author/TJH)",

The model focuses on the identification and narrowing of discrepancies between teachers' perceptions of their testing practices and actual practice. All 19 math and 16 science teachers at a 4-year high school in a mixed suburban/rural school district participated in the project. Subjects' involvement consisted of completing a brief survey instrument and supplying their most recently administered unit or quarter test. Data from 35 questionnaires and 34 tests containing more than 1,400 items were analyzed. Results cover the nature of classroom assessment, characteristics of teacher-made tests, item formats, cognitive levels treated,  quality of items, and teachers' confidence in testing skills. Topics identified as important for inclusion in in-service activities for teacher test construction are the use of tables of specifications, development of higher order items, item formatting, and the empirical analysis of test results.

Students should recognize that there is nothing wrong with questioning research. Among the myths that must be challenged are that if something is published, it must be true, and that scientists are objective and uninfluenced by societal attitudes and their own prejudices. For example, there is evidence that many boys and girls have different mathematics experiences, but there is no evidence that sex differences in mathematics are natural or inherent. Myths go unchallenged because: people are more comfortable with the status quo; those who believe stereotypes probably will not accept research that challenges such beliefs; and many people accept or reject research without  evaluating its quality. To evaluate research, a student should begin by asking whether: (1) the researchers' opinions can be told by reading the study; (2) conclusions are based on study results or the researcher's expectations; (3) the research tells precisely who was studied; and (4) the study makes sense. Students can evaluate and use research better by: checking the \"facts\" for themselves; not quoting facts without checking their accuracy; reading an entire study and not just the summary; being equally skeptical of research that does and research that does not seem right; finding out how to question authority in ways that provide information and not irritation; and looking at their own biases critically.

Much research, past and present, is biased. It is necessary to understand that race and sex bias can affect research, to understand how to determine whether bias is present, and to know how to minimize its effects. To demystify research, people need to gain familiarity with research terms and methods and its strengths and weaknesses, and they need to use their understanding to examine many of the myths that exist about research. The myth that research and researchers are always objective is the most difficult one to refute, but examples of bias are not hard to find. It is not difficult to find bias in historical educational research,  but the bias of today tends to be more subtle. Two areas in which bias has strongly influenced research are student interracial interaction and sex differences in mathematics ability. Guidelines are provided for determining bias in research, reducing the negative effects of bias, and making research more valuable to policymakers and practitioners. Suggestions are also offered for improving research by viewing it more critically. An appendix, \"A Beginner's Guide to Educational Research,\" introduces the basics.

Following the contrasting examples, a working definition of C-P items is developed, practical considerations related to their development and use in testing programs are presented, and a categorization of the content of such items is proposed. The experiences of Florida and Georgia with regard to the development of  subject-area certification tests for teachers are considered. The distinguishing features of C-P items are described. The following working definition of C-P items is proposed: &quot;The class of C-P items includes those items for which the examinee's determination of the correct response depends upon knowledge of the treatment of content in educational situations.&quot; This definition excludes those items that solely address content, without an educational context, and those items that address general pedagogical principles in the absence of content-specific implications. Four major categories of items include: error diagnosis, communicating with the learner, organization of instruction, and learner characteristics. Two figures are included. (RLC)",

In using three tasks--two designed to measure cognitive dimensions (e.g., categorizing countries and categorizing action verbs) and one developed to tap personality differences (e.g., traits associated with assertiveness)--the study sought to understand how individuals group and structure stimuli. Specifically, the F-sort categorization technique and latent partition analysis (LPA) were used to evaluate the data collected. Fifty undergraduate preservice teachers performed the first two sorting tasks, and 45 education students performed the  personality task. The first task consisted of sorting a random sample of 30 nations, the second sorting task consisted of a set of statements/items from a self-reporting questionnaire designed to measure the attributes needed to achieve personal success, and the last task consisted of a set of verbs. A deck of cards was constructed for each of the tasks: 100 decks for the 30-country sort, and 50 decks for sorting the 50 verbs and the 30 statements. The reliability indices provided insight as to how the stimuli, for each task, were clearly related to the corresponding latent partition. The use of theta reliability procedures in LPA appears to be justified given the nature of the tasks usually involved in this methodology. A 49-item list of references, 12 data tables, a list of stimuli  description names for sorting tasks, instruction forms for the sorting tasks, and sample data sets for generating joint proportion matrices are provided.

Presently, bias and its impact on research may be more subtle than in the past, but biases about people of color and women still exist and influence researchers. The following myths  concerning research and counseling are examined: (1) if research is published it must be accurate; (2) research and researchers are objective; (3) standardized tests are accurate objective measures providing information about students' interests, aptitudes, and achievement; and (4) counselors cannot understand research. In evaluating research, one must ask if: the authors' opinions or bias are obvious; authors use different terms depending on the race or sex of the subjects; the study describes who is being studied; the tests are fair; the study results apply only to people who are similar to those studied or are overgeneralized to include others; similarities and differences are reported about females and males and people from different races; and conclusions have more to do with the  authors' expectations than with the research results. Suggestions are provided for reducing bias in research. (RLC)",

        "description":"The objective of this study was to investigate differential tendencies to avoid guessing as a function of three variables: (1) lingual-cultural-group; (2) gender; and (3) examination year. The Psychometric Entrance Test (PET) for universities in Israel was used, which is administered in Hebrew, Arabic, English, French, Spanish, and Russian. The PET is a battery of five subtests, and encompasses about 200 test items. Three of the five subtests were used in this study: figural reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and English. Data for 12,440 male and 10,532 female examinees were analyzed. The tendency to avoid guessing was measured by the proportion of two types of unanswered items: unreached items, and omitted items. A factor analysis using VARIMAX rotation indicated a strong  two-factor structure, in which all indices based on omitted items loaded on the first factor and all indices based on unreached items loaded on he second factor. An analysis of covariance with the corrected-for-guessing scores as a covariate indicated that all three effects and paired interactions were significant. The examination year appeared to have the strongest effect on the proportion of omitted items, while the language-version seemed to affect the proportion of unreached items most strongly. The gender effect was not found to be as strong as were the other two main effects. Three data tables are included. (RLC)",

The paper is based on the experiences of the TAFE National Center for Research and Development Ltd in Leabrook (Australia). Focus is on describing how to apply for grants and how to manage CER projects. Topics include: steps involved in making a submission or proposal to conduct CER, the research methodology, budgeting and scheduling the research project, establishment of project committees, the politics of research, and outcomes of research. CER is client-oriented and has hefty constraints placed upon it, whereas academic educational research is researcher-oriented and methodology-driven and has fewer  constraints. Determining what CER is available can be a time-consuming activity, especially for persons just starting to conduct this kind of research. Therefore, guidelines for writing submissions that show the prospective client that the researcher is knowledgeable, experienced, and competent are provided. CER is intensely political. Commercial researchers, who are usually under pressure to complete their work quickly, are cautioned to not neglect good research and business practices. Accurate budgeting and scheduling, and a properly balanced project committee are essential for the successful implementation of CER. Committees should give advice and help in conducting the research, and committee members have an important political role. Good communication can help overcome some problems  that arise in the area of politics of research. A model submission is provided. (RLC)",

The program was implemented during the fall semester of the 1986-87 school year. The DMP adopted the instructional model implemented by the Chapter 1 program as its design. The DMP includes four major components: (1) a kindergarten program; (2) a first- through 12th-grade reading/writing and mathematics laboratory program; (3) alternative curriculum within the DMP structure; and (4) in-service training. Students in the laboratory programs are provided with small group instruction (in addition to that provided in the classrooms), which uses alternative strategies and materials to encourage  success for all students. The Kindergarten Enrichment Program provides half-day enrichment classes in addition to the regular kindergarten program. The K-1 Transition Program provides reinforcement for students not yet ready for the first grade in the form of an additional year of instruction. A total of 5,979 students from 68 schools were served by the DMP programs as of April 30, 1990 for the 1989-90 school year. Specific needs, budgeting information, and staffing data are discussed. The responsibilities of each program's administrators are outlined; current year goals and objectives for the programs are discussed; and the process, product, and future plans are summarized.

        "description":"After an extensive review of relevant research, this paper describes a study concerning the relationship between the American College Test (ACT) and the Pre-Professional Skills Test (PPST). Specifically, the study assessed the extent to which ACT scores predict PPST scores. Subjects included 169 Harding University students (42 males and 127 females) who took the PPST for the first time between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 1989; and who also took the ACT prior to admission to the University. Moderately to substantially high correlations between the ACT and PPST were found. All 15 correlations between the five ACT scores (natural science, English, mathematics, social science, and composite) and the three PPST scores (reading, writing, and mathematics) were statistically  significant. The ACT composite accounted for 44% to 64% of the variance in PPST scores. All students failing to meet the state cutoff scores on any portion of the PPST (reading, 170; writing, 171; and mathematics, 169) scored less than 22 on the ACT composite. Six regression equations were presented for predicting PPST scores from ACT scores. Data support the ACT as a reliable predictor of PPST scores, and policies could be considered that would exempt students from the PPST based upon their ACT scores. Seven data tables are included.

        "description":"An empirical investigation of methodological issues associated with evaluating treatment effect in single-subject research (SSR) designs is presented. This investigation: (1) conducted a generalizability (G) study to identify the sources of systematic and random measurement error (SRME); (2) used an analytic approach based on G theory to integrate measurement errors into subject sampling errors during statistical analyses of data from a multiple-baseline design; (3) compared this new approach with a conventional t-test to determine the extent to which conventional inferential statistics were inflated, increasing the probability of Type I errors in SSR; and (4) examined discrepancies among the dependability coefficients and the statistical tests of significance. The behavior of  three preschool children with handicaps and six non-handicapped peer confederates, enrolled in an integrated preschool classroom in Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), was observed during consecutive school days over the course of 5 months. A continuous observational recording procedure was used to code interactions among each of the three target children, their peer confederates, and the teacher. Examination of the grand means revealed that 10 behavior sequences did not occur. There were more interactions between the target children and peers, fewer interactions between the children and teachers, and fewer non-social utterances. Overall, 63% of the behavior sequences occurred less than 10% of the time during which reliability observations were made. Although the comparison between statistical  procedures did not confirm that the G analytic approach would identify a significant number of Type I errors, the results confirm the direction of the effect proposed by H. K. Suen et al. (1990). SSR practitioners should: adopt a G approach to study the combined influence of SRME; report variance components and minimize the emphases on reliability coefficients; and investigate further applications of the G analytic approach. A 39-item list of references and six data tables are included. (RLC)",

Statistical techniques for analyzing agreement data are described to address questions such as how many opinions are required to make a medical diagnosis with necessary accuracy. Kappa and other agreement indices, variance components approaches, and latent structure models are considered. Focus is on two related techniques, which differ in assumptions about disease subtypes and associated differences among cases in their ability to be correctly diagnosed: (1) latent class agreement analysis; and (2) latent trait agreement analysis. Specifically, these methods make it possible to determine from the opinion of panels of  diagnosticians in an agreement study the following: the probable accuracy of an individual diagnosis; the probability of disease presence or absence given unanimous or conflicting opinions by several diagnosticians; and how many opinions should be required to make the diagnosis. It is concluded that because the estimation procedures and software are better developed for the latent class agreement model, investigators should pursue this approach first.

The variables/educational indicators reported in this study included: school district size in terms of average daily attendance, number of teachers with master's degrees, various fiscal characteristics, outside aid amounts, number of personnel, minimum foundation program aid, expense per student, eighth-grade MPT passing rates as percentages, and average personnel salaries. The correlation analysis addressed the question of whether any of the variables steadily increased or decreased as school district size increased. Analysis using multiple regression and Pearson correlation  techniques indicated that none of the factors accounted for more than slight contributions to the variance in the percentage of students passing the MPT by district. These findings are consistent with numerous researchers, particularly those who investigated the relationship between school district size and achievement. It appears that calls for school district consolidation to effect enhanced academic achievement, solely on the basis of district size, are unfounded. (Author/RLC)",

Subjects included 119 undergraduate students randomly divided into three groups. Members of the rule knowledge group were told the underlying pattern in the braille alphabet, and their worksheets reflected this pattern. Members of the discovery group were not told the underlying pattern, although their worksheets allowed discovery of the rule. Members of  the control group were not told about the pattern, and their worksheets were arranged to make discovery extremely unlikely. Subjects were asked to store and retrieve 26 specific dot pattern-inkprint letter pairs. The results indicate that the rule knowledge group outperformed the other two groups, but there was no difference between the recall and recognition performance. Results are discussed in relation to current models of rule learning and differences between recognition and recall procedures.

About 37% (2,752) of the sample returned the surveys. Results show that the skills contained in the task force  profile were widely viewed as essential for all persons entering the work force. Personal management and teamwork skills were rated more important than were academic skills. However, when asked to consider skills needed to adapt to changes in the future, respondents rated academic skills as more critical than the other skills.

        "description":"A method was developed for identifying students who may be at high risk for failing the State Board Licensing Examination (SBE) for registered nurses. The subjects used in developing prediction equations included 50 students who graduated from the nursing program at Saint Joseph's College (SJC) in North Windham (Maine) during the years 1983-84. The validation group included 105 students who graduated from the nursing program at SJC during the years 1985-88. Subjects were predominately single, white, females in their early twenties. The SBE score was the outcome variable. Predictor variables included subjects' Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores and college course grades in the areas of science, statistics, and nursing theory. Grade point averages were also used. Two  standardized tests of nursing content--the National League for Nursing (NLN) test on Nursing of Children and the Mosby Assess Test (MAT)--were administered to the subjects. Prediction equations were developed from a step-wise regression analysis for each of the following periods: pre-admission; end of the freshman, sophomore, and junior years; and the end of the fall semester of the senior year. The verbal SAT score was the best predictor of failure in the freshman year, but it was replaced as the best predictor at the end of the sophomore year by the cumulative average of nursing and science course grades. The MAT was the best predictor in the senior year. The results support the predictive value of comprehensive tests that are similar in style and format to the SBE. Relationships exist  between various test scores and SBE performance. It is concluded that pre-admission test scores, such as the verbal SAT, are valuable predictors early in a program. NLN examinations in the content area of maternal-child health are consistent predictors of SBE. (RLC)",

After a short introduction on IRMs on the subject level, a comprehensive treatment is given of the following estimation methods for subject-level parameters: joint maximum likelihood, conditional maximum likelihood, marginal maximum likelihood, logit based parameter estimation, the Bayesian  approach, and other estimation procedures. A group-level IRM describes the probability of a correct response from an examinee selected at random from a specific group. The following group-level models are described: the group fixed-effects model, the two-parameter and three-parameter normal-normal model, the normal-logistic model, and the California Assessment Program model. Analogies and differences between group-level and subject-level IRMs are discussed. Group-level IRMs may be justified as aggregate descriptions of IRMs on subject-level, and they may be interpreted analogously. Group-level IRMs are implied by subject-level IRMs only when within-group ability distributions are identical except for location. For the subject-level, the addition of an examinee increases the number of  incidental (ability) parameters; however, for the group-level, the number of ability parameters does not increase. (RLC)",

It is shown that item/subtest regression results in empirical Bayes estimates only if the Rasch model holds. Additionally, it is shown that a newly-derived exploratory goodness-of-fit test for the Rasch model, which does not need item and person parameter estimates, can be seen as an empirical Bayes test. This test compares the observed proportions of correct answers to one specific item, given any pattern that leads to a number-right score. These proportions should be about equal. (RLC)",

        "description":"Valid interpretation of test scores is the shared responsibility of the test designer and the test user. Test publishers must provide evidence of the validity of the decisions their tests are intended to support, while test users are responsible for analyzing this evidence and subsequently using the test in the manner indicated by the publisher. Publishers of achievement batteries provide a variety of types of data to support the technical adequacy of their tests; however, the utility of this information as evidence of construct validity has not been explored. This study analyzed data provided by achievement test publishers to investigate the existence of a network of evidence to support various inferences about the meaning of scores obtained from these measures. Focus was on  examining various aspects of the construct validity of published norm-referenced achievement test batteries. Nine group and four individually administered achievement tests were reviewed. The materials examined for each test included student response booklets, scoring protocols, administration manuals, objectives lists, test coordinators' handbooks, and technical manuals. Results show that achievement test batteries are adequate measures of general achievement in the broadly defined constructs of reading, mathematics, and language expression; however, inferences about student performance in skill areas represented by the various subtests included in most achievement batteries seem not to be supported. It is concluded that test publishers are ill-advised to demarcate many subskills in the  categories of reading, language, and mathematics. Reliability and validity data indicate that the fewer the number of facets into which constructs are divided, the better. The published achievement test batteries studied seem to have convergent validity but no discriminant validity and mono-operation bias, severely limiting the kinds of inferences that can be made. These tests fail to represent the wide range of classroom-relevant behaviors that are components of each construct. Four tables are included. (RLC)",

        "description":"To attempt to incorporate the perceptions of consumers of alcohol education programs about topic relevance and importance, a modified version of a methodology that extracts, evaluates, and combines information from novices and experts to determine commonly held scripts and schema was used. In the first of two studies, 37 students at Texas Christian University (TCU) generated and evaluated major categories and subcategories they believed to be important in a drug and alcohol education program for high school seniors (HSSs). In the second study, 24 students at TCU were presented with categories and subcategories mentioned by 50% of participants in the first study, and had to rate: (1) how important knowledge of each item is for HSSs; (2) the degree to which the average HSS is  misinformed about each item; and (3) the amount of knowledge the average HSS has about each item. Results from both studies indicate that the extraction methodology has potential for developing alcohol education programs tailored to the prior knowledge and perceived needs of consumers. Categories elicited were consistent and easily ranked and compared statistically, providing an indication of the perceived importance, degree of relative misinformation, and levels of existing knowledge of the subjects. The methodology was also sensitive enough to uncover, in the second study, gender subgroup differences on some major categories and subcategories. Four tables contain study data. (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"The psychometric properties of the Autonomy and Relatedness Inventory (ARI)--a measure of the quality of primary intimate relationships--was assessed. This 30-item instrument was designed to assess both positive and negative dimensions of any type of dyadic relationship. Cross-sectional data from in-home interviews with 213 mothers with 5- and 6-year-old children were analyzed. Data derived from a separate scale on the quality of marital relationships for a subsample of 40 married mothers also were used to assess the ARI's validity. The ARI demonstrated strong internal consistency. Maternal characteristics of age, education, income, and number of children were not correlated with ARI scores. There also were no differences in ARI scores by marital status, race, or employment  status of the mother. A principal components analysis with varimax rotation reduced the items to two orthogonal dimensions: (1) support/positive regard; and (2) dominance/control. Both dimensions of the ARI were discriminable from measures of depressive and psychosomatic symptoms of the mothers. Convergent validity was supported by significant correlations between ARI subscales and subscales of Spanier's Dyadic Adjustment Scale for a subsample of 40 married mothers. This preliminary evidence suggests that the ARI holds potential for use in future studies as a measure of the quality of primary intimate relationships.

Existing taxonomies are reviewed, and their shortcomings are described. A taxonomy is then proposed based on a synthesis of current thought consisting of four dimensions: the forms of knowledge; the types of learning activities; the importance of the domain; and the effects of the learner's style. The taxonomy is applied to the analysis of three computerized systems in an attempt to answer: what learning skills the systems currently exercise; what skills the systems test; and what other skills might fruitfully be tested. The three instructional systems are: (1) the Basic Instruction Program developed at Stanford University, one of  the first operational intelligent tutoring systems; (2) the intelligent tutoring system for the computer programming language LISP developed by J. R. Anderson and others (1985); and (3) Smithtown, a system for enhancing students' problem-solving and inductive learning skills in the context of microeconomics. How the taxonomy might guide research that attempts to validate new aptitude tests against performance in complex learning systems is discussed. Seven tables and three figures illustrate the text.

In so doing, validity indices for different purposes of testing and those that are tailored for a specific population of examinees are considered.

Topics include: rationalism, associationism, constructivism, the cognitive information processing model, metacognition, and student-oriented approaches to understanding learning. Criticisms of each of these theories are provided. Section 3 reviews empirical work on teaching. The three strands identified in this area include: (1) attempts to reconcile the  nature of the teaching process with the requirements of particular theories of learning; (2) attempts to impose descriptive categories on the process; and (3) examinations of teachers' own thinking about the teaching process. Section 4 offers an analysis of the norm-referenced and criterion-referenced traditions in assessment. Section 5 examines the ways teaching, learning, and assessment are treated in the literature concerning Scotland's Action Plan and the criterion-referenced National Certificate program.

The testing programs vary widely by objective and approach. One of the major needs assessment activities is the examination of student performance data related to designated learning goals for each jurisdiction. From the diverse types of data, analysis has yielded individual state performance trends and regional performance trends. Scores were converted to a standard score metric to enable meaningful comparisons of gross student performance trends. Major conclusions include the following: (1) reading achievement scores fluctuated from 1984 to 1989, with improvement for  elementary and secondary grades and stability or decline for intermediate grades; (2) for the whole period, there was overall improvement in mathematics, with some declines in 1988 and 1989; (3) overall results for 1989, while generally positive, were not as strong as those for previous years; (4) students in the region generally performed above national norms on standardized tests, and scores were particularly high for the elementary school level; (5) most students met minimum proficiency scores established by the states; and (6) scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) tended to be below the national average, but regional SAT scores improved from 1988 to 1989. Each state is in the process of reviewing testing programs to ensure that accurate indicators of achievement are available.  Twelve tables provide study data. (SLD)",

        "description":"Results of new research into the anomalous results of the 1986 reading portion of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) are reported. The original analysis of the 1986 data indicated that the estimated performance level of 9- and 17-year-old students had dropped dramatically since 1984, whereas the performance of 13-year-olds had increased very slightly. Since it was unlikely that such large changes could have taken place in such a short time, the results were not presented to the general public and publication of the results was suspended until further research into their accuracy could be completed or until other corroborating evidence for the declines could be found. To this end, the design of the 1988 NAEP was modified, and new data were collected and  analyzed. The main finding from the 1988 data analyses is that the changes in assessment booklets and procedures that were introduced in 1986 had a substantial and unpredictable effect on the estimates of performance. Although many of the same items were used in both the 1984 and 1986 assessments, student performance on these items differed substantially when the items were administered in different contexts. Discovered differences between the 1986 and 1988 assessments were used in a design to estimate the reading performance of students in the 1986 sample. The new estimates show that reading performance declined slightly in 1986 at all age levels as compared to 1984. The declines, however, are not statistically significant. The new data also indicate a rebound in 1988 from the 1986  levels to about the same level of performance exhibited in 1984. The report contains 8 chapters by Beaton, Zwick, Yamamoto and Mislevy detailing the research and analysing the data. Appendices include various types of statistical and methodological information. Twenty-five graphs and 33 data tables are included. (TJH)",

This report is based on the Public School Survey, 1985 (PSS-85), in which teachers were asked to provide information about themselves and to specify the subject-matter classes they taught. The PSS-85 obtained responses from 8,568 teachers and 2,301 administrators from an initial sample of 2,801 schools selected from the Common Core of Data universe. Key findings showed that: (1) the percentage of females was similar for vocational and non-vocational teachers at 45% and 49%, respectively; (2) the percentages of minority vocational and non-vocational teachers were similar, at about 10%; (3) non-vocational teachers were  more likely to have master's degrees than were vocational teachers; (4) overall, non-vocational teachers had about 1 year more full-time teaching experience than did vocational teachers; and (5) non-vocational and vocational teachers had taught an average of about 1 year part time, or less. Within group comparisons showed that: large schools had a higher percentage of minority non-vocational teachers than did small or medium schools; the percentage of females did not vary significantly by size of school; vocational teachers were about as likely to have bachelor's degrees as they were to have master's degrees; non-vocational teachers were more likely to have master's degrees than bachelor's degrees only; teaching experience of vocational and non-vocational teachers was greatest in large  schools; there were three levels of teaching concentration among vocational teachers; about two-thirds of business teachers were female; and most business teachers held at least master's degrees. Overall, vocational and non-vocational teachers were more alike than different. Eight bar graphs and 10 tables summarize findings. The PSS-85 Teacher Questionnaire is included. (SLD)",

        "description":"The assumptions and consequences of applying conventional and newer statistical methods to meta-analytic data sets are reviewed. The application of the two approaches to a meta-analytic data set described by L. V. Hedges (1984) illustrates the differences. Hedges analyzed six studies of the effects of open education on student cooperation. The conventional way to test the hypothesis that treatment fidelity significantly influenced results is through a t-test for independent results. Hedges' more modern approach was to use a chi-square analog of the analysis of variance (ANOVA), a method that, in contrast to conventional statistics, found strong support for the hypothesized effect. Conventional ANOVA and newer techniques were also applied to a data set in which all studies were of  the same size, with each assumed to have experimental and control groups containing 25 students each. The cell means and variances for Hedges' meta-analytic data set were reconstructed to determine the source of the difference in results between conventional and newer tests. It is concluded that conventional ANOVA is appropriate for use with meta-analytic data sets because conventional ANOVA uses the correct error term for testing the significance of effects of group factors. Newer meta-analytic methods are not recommended because of their use of an inappropriate error term. (SLD)",

        "description":"A new method for estimating the parameters of the normal ogive three-parameter model for multiple-choice test items--the normalized direct (NDIR) procedure--is examined. The procedure is compared to a more commonly used estimation procedure, Lord's LOGIST, using computer simulations. The NDIR procedure uses the normalized (mid-percentile) &quot;z&quot; score as the ability score as opposed to the conventional raw score (linear &quot;z&quot; score), maximum likelihood, or Bayesian modal ability score. Thus, it is not necessary to use an iterative procedure for estimating the person parameter (ability); corrections for scale errors can be made before the item function fitting is complete. The item function fitting is accomplished using a minimum chi square procedure. Input to the chi square procedure  includes biserial correlations corrected for guessing and attenuation. The attenuation correction uses a reliability index based on the item set information index. Normalized &quot;z&quot; scores corrected for attenuation using the KR20 index are also inputted to the chi square procedure. The normalized direct procedure was more accurate and required considerably less computer processing time than did LOGIST. One figure and six data tables are included. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"Descriptive statistics and associated analysis on American eighth graders are presented based on data from the 1988 National Education Longitudinal Study. The study will be repeated with the same cohort at 2-year intervals. Study variables cover attitudes, school performance, and activities of the eighth-grade students. In addition to direct student data, the study design incorporates data from students' school principals, parents, and teachers to identify additional factors that affect student achievement. In addition to a general statistical profile of the target population, statistics and accompanying analyses cover mathematics and reading performance, at-risk issues, school safety and climate, and high school and college plans. Focus is on circumstances under which children  flourish and succeed. The study included a clustered, stratified national probability sample of about 800 public and 200 private schools. Almost 25,000 students participated in the base-year study. The sample represents the nation's eighth-grade population, totalling about 3 million eighth-graders in over 38,000 school in the spring of 1988. Results reveal that the American eighth-grade population is very diverse. One out of every five students is unable to perform basic arithmetic tasks, and 14% of the students are unable to perform basic reading comprehension tasks. The NELS:88 provides some indicators of &quot;at risk&quot; status and has identified six primary risk factors. Pertinent methodological discussions and associated data are appended.

The findings represent an essential firt step in ascertaining why Hispanic students stay in or drop out of school. The survey sample comprised 706 ninth grade Hispanic students randomly selected from 7 high schools in 5 cities to form a stratified sample representing the following 4 largest Hispanic groups in the United States: (1) Mexican Americans; (2) Puerto Ricans; (3) Cubans; and (4) Central Americans. A questionnaire, administered in 1986, gathered data on more than 300 specific variables. Responses to each survey  question are reported in the form of a chart of statistical data accompanied by comments on trends and are grouped by the following major topics: (1) student characteristics; (2) parent characteristics; (3) language usage; (4) school environment; (5) school issues; (6) homework and studying; (7) academic concerns; (8) working; and (9) future plans. A summary of the most frequently given responses is included for each topic. Common characteristics and differences among the four groups are summarized. The following recommendations for future research are suggested: (1) the similarities and differences among groups provide the framework to inform policy making and guide future research; (2) a one-day invitational seminar should be convened to explore policy implications of the findings; and  (3) a future research agenda should be identified linking student retention status at the close of 1988-89 with the data compiled during 1986-87. Explanations of the sampling design and the questionnaire design are appended. (FMW)",

The study was designed as a longitudinal multi-method study based on information from school records, a student survey, and one-year follow-up sources. Data collection began in the 1986-87 school year and ended in the 1987-88 school year. The 597-student sample in Year 2 of the study represented all those students who participated in Year 1 for whom there existed complete information, and comprised the following groups: (1) 309 (51.8 percent) Mexican Americans;  (2) 161 (27 percent) Puerto Rican; (3) 63 (10.6 percent) Cubans; and (4) 64 (10.7 percent) Central Americans. Correlation analyses showed that the following characteristics were the best predictors of dropping out or remaining in school: (1) age: older students are less likely to remain in school than younger students because they perceive few economic benefits from a high school diploma; (2) academic achievement: good grades boost self-concept and make future learning easier or less costly for good student than for less successful students; (3) paternal presence: single-parent families may provide less adult supervision and cannot financially afford to keep children in school on a steady basis; and (4) absences: truancy indicates a lack of institutional commitment to and alienation from  school precipitating the decision to drop out. Policy implications of the following factors are discussed: (1) over-age students; (2) grades; (3) grade repetition; (4) absenteeism; (5) paternal presence; and (6) college aspirations. A 32-item bibliography, a chart illustrating the distribution of the student sample by race/ethnicity, and four tables of statistical data illustrating definitions of the variables are appended.

The first section, \"Institutional Climate and Minority Achievement,\" presents an overview of the problems facing colleges and universities with respect to recruiting and retaining minority students. In the second section, \"Interventions: the Visible Evidence of Organizational Culture,\" three stages of intervention strategies for increasing diversity are discussed. The following types of interventions characterize stage 1: (1) student recruitment; (2) financial aid; and (3) admissions and scheduling. The following types of interventions characterize stage 2: (1) outreach programs; (2) transition programs; (3) mentoring and advising; (4)  environment; and (5) residence halls. The following types of interventions characterize stage 3: (1) student assessment; (2) learning assistance; and (3) curriculum content. In the third section, \"Managing Organizational Culture,\" the following topics are discussed: (1) strategic planning; (2) coordination and control; (3) increasing staff diversity; and (4) faculty incentives and support. The fourth section, \"Assessing Outcomes as Indicators of Organizational Culture,\" analyzes minority participation and achievement data for 20 institutions. The patterns exhibited by these institutions are discussed, and it is suggested that the following distinct organizational culture structures exist: (1) adaptive; (2) strategic/adaptive; (3) reactive/strategic; and (4) reactive.

        "description":"Relations between schools and the adults within their surrounding communities are often problematic in inner city, low socioeconomic status neighborhoods. This paper analyzes features of the intersubjective structure of a group of working-class residents who took over and illegally ran their secondary school in Liverpool (England) for the 1982/83 school year. The school, Croxteth Comprehensive School, was occupied as part of a community movement to protest its closure. The paper analyzes the common sense assumptions held by the community about knowledge, pedagogy, classroom authority, school certificates, and other features of schooling. It finds evidence of a structure through which residents' views mutually implicate each other, though this is not apparent to the residents  themselves. This intersubjective structure consists of two forms of implication: paradigm and homology. These forms of implication are related to two different forms in which systems of routine behavior are integrated. Social integration (the coordination of routines through face-to-face interactions) is associated with paradigmatic intersubjective structures, while system integration (the relationships between routines separated in time and space) is associated with homologous intersubjective structures. The study's results expand understanding of school-community relations, and of human rationality in relationship to routine social practices. (AF)",

        "author":["Domanico, Raymond J."],
        "description":"This report presents the conceptual framework for a public school choice plan for New York City and discusses why school choice represents the best hope for meaningful reform. Public school choice is defined as giving school professionals the freedom to design innovative and distinctive school programs; and giving parents the right to choose, in pursuit of those innovations, the public school for their child. Despite marginal improvement in student achievement and high school completion rates, only 54 percent of the city's students earn high school diplomas. Therefore, New York's school system must be reformed, because changes in the city's economy now demand high school graduation as a prerequisite for entry into the work force. Recent attempts at reform based on increased  financing and improved leadership have failed. The choice plan is based on the following propositions: (1) the current organization has failed to attain basic goals; (2) school improvement is attainable and all children can learn; (3) the concept of equal opportunity is a strong reason to give parents the right to choose the school that best suits their childrens' needs; and (4) the best available evidence indicates that parental choice improves the education of all children, especially low-income and minority students, and that school autonomy is the key to meaningful school reform. A choice plan would include the following components: (1) a parent would apply for a child's admission to any public school in the city; (2) school policy would be set by each school; and (3) fluctuations in  attendance would indicate parents' preferences, dictate school closings, and indicate the need for more space and programs that could be replicated at other sites. An agenda for implementation is suggested. Statistical data are included on 11 graphs. (FMW)",

The publication identifies four well-respected programs in diverse settings that are using innovative approaches to improve the health and academic achievement of individual students, and reports on an encounter at each program site with a young person who has been helped by the program. A common theme among these narratives is the experience of growing up in an America far different from that of previous adolescent generations. Each account discusses situations and problems modern youth must confront, and describes how access to a network of  professionals and helping adults can provide what these young people need for their passage through adolescence. The following programs are described: (1) the school-based Youth Services Program, New Brunswick (New Jersey); (2) Communities in Schools, San Antonio (Texas); (3) STAR (Student Taught Awareness and Resistance) Program, Kansas City (Missouri); and (4) Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center, Jackson (Mississippi).

It examines the process by which at-risk students are separated from academic excellence, and attempts to understand the factors behind academic excellence and student achievement within the context of findings relating to at-risk students and dropouts. The following subjects are addressed in the literature review: (1) the characteristics of at-risk students; (2) the causes of the dropout rate, both internal and external to school; (3) effective methods of dropout prevention and support programs for at-risk students; and (4) academic excellence based on findings about  at-risk students. The results from each section of the review are discussed. The complete review indicates that programs designed to support at-risk students and programs that effectively encourage academic excellence are strikingly similar in most respects. In addition, the process through which at-risk students drop out corresponds to the process through which students move towards academic excellence. Further research, particularly with ethnographic methodology, on the parallels and differences between dropouts and high achievers is recommended.

In December 1988, the Committee on Education and Labor issued a report on the civil rights enforcement activities of regional offices of the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Its findings indicated that there was a deliberate and effective system by which OCR failed to enforce the civil rights laws according to its mandate. In general, the report found that the agency has not vigorously enforced laws protecting the rights of women and minorities since 1981. This hearing is based on evidence collected subsequently to determine the state of laws providing for equal opportunity in education as of November 1989. Acting Assistant Secretary, Office for Civil  Rights William Smith and Acting Civil Rights Assistant Attorney General James P. Turner both make statements concerning the enforcement of civil rights laws. In addition, experts on civil rights issues and education who have monitored the Bush Administration and its predecessors provide testimony regarding the following issues: (1) the resegregation of public schools; (2) racial tensions on college campuses; (3) parental choice of schools; (4) the Bush Administration's educational policies; (5) budget concerns; and (6) government enforcement of the civil rights laws.

        "description":"This report discusses the results of a 1989 poll conducted by the Gallup Organization in which a representative sample of Americans were asked where they would set the poverty line. The poverty line in current use by the Federal Government was created in the mid-1960s, using data from the 1950s. Setting the poverty line involves a basic decision about the minimum standard of living a society considers acceptable, and below which a family should be considered poor. Adults were asked what amount of weekly income they would use as a poverty line for a family of four (husband, wife, and two children) in their community. The following findings are reported: (1) the average figure reported was $15,017 per year, which is $3,000, or 24 percent, higher than the Federal Government's  poverty line; (2) responses varied according to whether respondents lived in a metropolitan area or outside of one, and according to the region in which they lived, but the respondents in every area set the poverty line higher than the Federal Government; (3) even if non-cash benefits were counted as income, the number of people considered poor according to the respondent's poverty line would be substantially higher than under the government's poverty measure, which does not count non-cash benefits. This discrepancy between the government's poverty measure and that recommended by the American public indicates the need for a re-examination of where to set the poverty line and what to count as income. Statistical data are included on eight tables and one graph. A list of 38 references is  appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"Income disparities between wealthy and other Americans widened significantly in the 1980s. The most affluent Americans reaped exceptionally large income gains during that decade, while middle-income Americans gained little, and low-income Americans fell further behind. The richest one percent of all Americans now receive as much income after taxes as the bottom 40 percent of Americans combined. The share of national income going to middle-income Americans is now lower than at any time since the end of World War II. One factor behind these widening income disparities is a striking increase in the amount of capital gains income received by the wealthiest Americans. In 1990, households in the top 1 percent of the population are projected to receive an average of $175,000 in capital  gains income. This is $92,000 more than they received in 1980, after adjusting for inflation. By contrast, those in the bottom 90 percent of the population are projected to receive average capital gains income of $300 this year, just $12 more than in 1980. A reduction in capital gains taxes would widen these already large income disparities still further. A shift in Federal tax burdens has also contributed to the growing disparities. Wealthy households now pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes than they did in 1980; lower income households now pay a larger proportion. The trend toward income disparities is a relatively recent phenomenon. Between 1950 and 1970, income disparities narrowed. This pattern reversed itself in the 1970s, as disparities began to grow modestly.  Disparities then grew more sharply in the 1980s. Statistical data are included on three tables and two graphs. A comparison of changes in income distribution between 1980 and 1990 and two tables of statistical data are appended. (EMW)",

        "author":["Ascher, Carol"],
        "description":"Standardized achievement and aptitude tests may be of very limited value in making placement or instructional decisions about bilingual students. The practice of categorizing standardized test scores by ethnic groups obscures the difficulties of administering and interpreting tests taken by bilinguals. Individuals who are bilingual have two language systems that overlap and are distinct; both are relied upon in a variety of ways, depending on the linguistic and communicative demands of everyday settings. It is not yet known how to measure the extent to which one of the languages of a bilingual student influences the other, or even how to describe bilingual competence. In test-taking situations, the switching and other linguistic adaptations of bilinguals create notable  differences from the way that monolingual students perform. Because standardized tests in any language are biased in favor of native speakers, low test scores received by bilinguals are often interpreted as evidence of deficits or even disorders. The following commonly used options for administering standardized tests to limited English speakers are reviewed: (1) nonverbal tests; (2) translated tests; (3) use of interpreters; (4) tests that are norm-referenced in the primary language; and (5) true bilingual assessment. The educational opportunities of bilingual students would be improved by expanding diagnostic protocols to include information beyond standardized test scores and by creating assessment that is more directly based on curriculum. A list of nine references is appended.  (FMW)",

        "author":["Mitchell, Vernay"],
        "description":"Multicultural education, anti-racist education, and conflict resolution are curriculum-based approaches to reducing racial conflict. Since the 1930s, attempts have been made to develop curricula to change negative racial attitudes and encourage appreciation for people of all races. In the 1980s, multicultural education has focused on the unique qualities and the mutual interdependence of minority and majority groups within a society and of various communitites within the world system. However, some critics have suggested that education labelled &quot;multicultural&quot; evades the issue of racism by diverting attention to milder topics. Some studies demonstrate the limited effectiveness of multicultural programs and the fact that some school districts without minority group students do not  promote the discussion of racial or ethnic differences. Anti-racist education and conflict resolution address racism by allowing teachers and students to analyze the inequalities in power and economic status that determine race relations. The following recommendations for evaluating and reforming curricula and school policy are suggested: (1) issue policy statements that cover broad school district philosophy, hiring practices, and the handling of bias-motivated incidents; (2) maintain racial and cultural diversity among school personnel; (3) provide services for victims of bias-motivated violence; (4) report and monitor trends in racial attitudes; (5) establish school-wide committees on human relations; (6) use the arts to encourage critical thinking about social issues; (7) check  textbooks and other resources for bias; (8) reflect the cultural diversity of the school in teaching strategies; and (9) affirm racial and cultural differences with regular and special activities.

        "description":"Existing choice plans, which allow parents and students to choose among a variety of schools, vary dramatically in size, shape, and purpose. Different types of choice programs have different impacts, especially on low-income and minority group students; and it is not yet clear how school choice programs should be structured to assure that those students with the fewest resources will not be shut out of the best schools. Reasons for the political appeal of choice plans include the following: (1) low-income and minority families can avoid poorly run and overcrowded urban schools; (2) free market, competitive principles are infused into a sluggish public education system; (3) individual families have more control over which schools their children attend and what services are  provided; (4) a low-cost solution to problems in public education is provided; (5) pupil needs are better matched to school offerings; and (6) parent involvement may be increased. However, critics argue that many programs discriminate against poor and minority parents who are less informed about how the educational system works or are too overwhelmed with day-to-day survival to research the various educational options. There is a dearth of well-documented research on how school choice programs affect either academic achievement or educational opportunities. The following variations in choice programs are outlined: (1) controlled choice; (2) magnet schools; and (3) interdistrict and open enrollment. Recommendations for more equitable programs consist of the following suggestions: (1) a  clear goal statement; (2) outreach to, and information and counseling for parents; (3) a fair, unrestrictive, noncompetitive, and equitable admissions procedure; and (4) provision of adequate transportation for students.

It found that teaching strategies within each of the models were surprisingly similar. The following models were examined: (1) Model A, providing a supplementary reading/writing lab class for up to 20 Chapter 1 or PCEN students in conjunction with a course on the same subject; (2) Model B, infusing remediation into the regular curriculum of PCEN students; and (3) Model D, providing remediation for up to 17 Chapter 1 students with one teacher, or up to 34 students with a two-teacher team approach. Teachers of Math Skills and  English Instructional Services (EIS) both used testing to identify areas of need, supplementary materials, preparation drills for the Regents Competency Tests (RCT), and computers for skill building. Most English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) teachers used small-group learning, peer tutoring, and homework helpers to teach a mixture of students who all needed help in English but only some of whom needed remediation in basic skills. Teachers perceived that the programs were effective by giving students attention that they could not receive in the regular classroom. Teaching strategies within models were similar: 68 percent of the sample classes, based on Models B or D, infused remediation into the regular curriculum. (FMW)",

The IDP comprised the Urban Academy, a laboratory school serving high-risk students, and an on-site staff development program in seven high schools. The overall goal was to promote the use of the inquiry method in the classroom. The inquiry method is a student-centered process in which students question, analyze, and evaluate a body of material. Through increased use of the inquiry method, the program sought to develop students' critical thinking skills and to encourage high risk students to stay in school. Evaluation objectives were that 70 percent of the Urban Academy students would increase their attendance rates and be enrolled in a high school program as of  spring 1989. The Academy students achieved an 87 percent attendance rate and a 93 percent retention rate. Interviews with students and teachers indicated satisfaction with the Academy and the on-site programs, but the Academy did not appear to serve as a training site to the extent that it had in previous years. The on-site programs appeared to serve as an antidote to burnout and as a focus of teacher creativity and innovations. Recommendations for improvement include encouraging on-site program teachers to remain in the program longer, redevelopment of the Academy as a training site, and a future evaluation of the success of the inquiry method in promoting critical thinking.

Students at the Health Academy have been identified as at risk of dropping out but are judged to have the potential to succeed. Students at the Media Academy are exclusively selected from feeder junior high schools. The curricula of the academies  focus on different academic areas, but share an emphasis on postsecondary preparation. Business and community involvement is an important component of both programs, with links to local institutions of higher learning, public hospitals, newspapers, and television stations. However, support from the local school district has been unsystematic.

The State Plan for Migrant Education received $804,149 in 1987/88 to provide supplemental basic skills instruction to  approximately 800 elementary and secondary students during the regular school year and 550 students during summer programs. In addition, an interagency program provided a Head Start program. Highly cost effective interagency programs also served 3,856 handicapped students statewide. Supplemental reading and mathematics services were provided to 267 incarcerated students at a cost of $155,228.

        "description":"This report compares income trends among Hispanic Americans and non-Hispanic Americans over the 1980s and assesses the effect on Hispanics of recent tax proposals that would primarily benefit wealthy Americans. Since the early 1970s, the income gaps between rich and poor families, and between rich and middle-income families, have widened significantly. These large and growing income gaps between the wealthy and other Americans have a major impact on Hispanic Americans because Hispanics account for a disproportionately large share of low-income households and a disproportionately small share of those with high incomes. The typical Hispanic family income has stagnated during the past decade due to a decline in wage levels, shrinking federal assistance to low-income groups, an  increase in the number of female-headed Hispanic households, and continuing immigration from Latin America. The effect of proposed policies such as the capital gains tax cut, the restoration of the tax deductibility of contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts, and the creation of &quot;Family Savings Accounts&quot; would have a negative impact on Hispanics because they would benefit affluent taxpayers and require further reduction in government programs or increases in other taxes to offset their costs. Statistical data on seven tables and three graphs are included. (FMW)",

        "description":"Although hundreds of state and local organizations provide homelessness prevention assistance, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could not determine the effectiveness of this assistance because few assistance providers have the resources available to collect the client follow-up data needed for evaluation. Homelessness prevention programs, included in amendments to the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, provide short-term financial assistance or counseling to people threatened with eviction or mortgage foreclosure. Prevention assistance usually takes the form of one-time rent, mortgage, or utility payments. At least six federal programs provide funds in support of these efforts, but state and local service providers report that the demand for such help is  so great that programs run out of funds or need to limit their assistance to individuals. Assistance providers also report that they believe prevention aid has kept people from becoming homeless, but few have evaluated what types of assistance are most effective and most are not collecting the type of information needed to make this determination. GAO believes that client follow-up data should be collected so that limited resources can be devoted to programs that prove most effective. Statistical data are included on two tables and two graphs. Descriptions of federal programs providing homelessness prevention assistance and a list of programs reviewed are appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"This review of the literature on testing urban students indicates that standardized tests may not reflect accurately the ability and achievement of poor minority children. Further, new research in cognition makes clear that both teaching and testing could be structured to better prepare students for the complex thinking required by life. Since current political trends make it unlikely that the power of testing will decline nationally, or that testing will cease to drive instruction, it is crucial to reformulate assessments so that they can help alter schooling in ways that will better educate individual students to meet both their personal needs and those of society. Because short answer tests have been so important in driving learning in urban schools, and because the size of  urban school systems encourages bureaucratic forms of accountability, it will be difficult to create forms of change that demand greater flexibility. However, new performance-based assessment practices offer particular hope to urban students whose gifts and needs are diverse, and who have suffered the most under traditional teaching and testing methods. Portfolios, work station assessments, certain computer-based assessments, and the variety of reciprocal teaching methods that rely on dynamic assessment all offer directions for improving urban education.

        "description":"This document provides research-based information to help school district personnel select appropriate mathematics education programs for their limited English proficient (LEP) elementary school students. A review of the mathematics education literature is discussed in the context of the reform movement in school mathematics. Two instructional programs for effectively teaching mathematics to LEP students, Active Mathematics Teaching (AMT) and Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), are discussed in detail. Examples, using addition and subtraction problems, illustrate each program. Since teaching math in a student's native language may be more effective than limiting instruction to English, Spanish translations of examples are also included to demonstrate how simple presentation of  problems can facilitate their solving. Recommendations are woven throughout the text and each section ends with a list of additional recommendations for teaching mathematics to LEP students. The following final recommendations are suggested: (1) choose and use manipulatives carefully; (2) manipulatives should support discussion about mathematics, not replace it; (3) activities should emphasize the mathematics content; (4) the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' document, &quot;Curriculum and Evaluation Standards,&quot; provides specific recommendations for content that should be emphasized as well as deemphasized; (5) AMT has been proven effective for conveying large amounts of basic information that is well organized; (6) CGI shows promise for developing problem solving skills, higher  order thinking, and enhancing student confidence; and (7) mathematics is too important for students' futures to be reduced to computations or omitted entirely.

        "description":"This literature review examines patterns of parent-child involvement that foster high academic achievement and describes effective parent involvement programs. Parents affect their children's academic achievement through cognitive socialization, the development of basic intelligence; and academic socialization, the development of attitudes and motives essential for school learning. Cognitive socialization is developed through the following parent practices: (1) encouraging active learning; (2) developing psychological distancing; (3) creating a context for new learning; and (4) structuring information to provide a \"scaffold\" for problem solving. Academic socialization is associated with the following parent practices: (1) attributing success to ability; (2) implementing  supportive strategies; (3) communicating high expectations for academic success; and (4) expecting high career aspirations. While cognitive and academic socialization are facilitated by middle-class status, parent education programs can provide lower-class parents with the skills needed to enhance their children's achievement while improving their own job skils. Teacher attitudes and support are crucial to effective parent involvement programs, which include the following strategies: (1) developing frequent contact between parent and teacher; (2) helping parents create home environments conducive to learning; (3) using parents as resources in schools; and (4) involving parents in school governance.

        "description":"A review of workplace literacy tests and testing found that the definitions of literacy and, in particular, workplace literacy have changed and are continuing to change. There is no single, widely accepted definition. Descriptions of workplace literacy demands in terms of reading grade levels are inappropriate. Most tests currently in use are inappropriate for the work environment because they: (1) do not contain job-related vocabulary or tasks; (2) are not indicative of the actual demands placed on workers; (3) are of the paper-and-pencil type rather than performance-based; (4) do not contain an oral component; and (5) do not require the examinee to interpret and analyze. An appropriate workplace test should simulate job tasks. A needs analysis of the literacy requirements for  each job or job cluster should be undertaken before a workplace literacy test is designed. New technology should be incorporated into any workplace test. Computers and interactive videodiscs permit more flexibility, greater tracking, and better curriculum planning than does any standardized test. Interactive videodiscs allow a wide variety of question types that more closely simulate the workplace. To be more valid, workplace tests should have the following sections: (1) one part, for all occupations, that should address general concerns such as reading indexes, filling out forms, and writing business correspondence; and (2) another part that varies according to occupational cluster and focuses on particular skills required for its cluster.

The 15-month project was a joint effort of an educational agency, a community-based organization, and three manufacturers. The curriculum covered English-as-a-second-language (ESL) life skills, work skills, and job skills. In order to provide the training, the project conducted a literacy audit and needs assessment, developed or selected literacy assessment instruments for each business, developed pre- and posttests, identified workplace competencies, developed curriculum, selected training instructors, recruited students, scheduled classes, pretested students, and measured student achievement on ongoing key competency checklists and on posttests at the  completion of the courses. Ninety percent of the employees who completed a course satisfactorily demonstrated the competencies. (The document includes samples of the competency checklists and posttests, a profile of participants by site, and a project evaluation report.) (CML)",

Data were collected from mailed questionnaires, telephone interviews, 10 site visits to field locations (6 in Indiana, 2 in New York, and 2 in Texas) of 2 national building management companies, and the analysis of workers' on-the-job reading  materials. The following results were cited: (1) maintenance workers need a diverse range of reading, writing, computation, and visualization skills; (2) differences in geographic locations appear to have little effect on the literacy demands on these workers, although geographic areas where hirees are likely to have limited proficiency with English are a special situation; (3) the age of the buildings being maintained has a great effect on literacy demands; (4) policies and procedures used by the building management companies produce different literacy demands; (5) low basic skills tend to reduce job productivity and increase safety risks and resident dissatisfaction; and (6) the NAEP taxonomy appears to be relevant for analyzing workplace literacy tasks but the scales will require a  great deal more work.

Of the 150 participants in the program, 137 were Asian. Workplace literacy training was generally advertised as a voluntary program available to employees who were interested in developing their English skills. Supervisors of participants tended to note improvement in the areas of basic skills, interpersonal communication with co-workers and supervisors, willingness to ask questions and accept criticism, test-taking skills, and job-specific vocabulary. Gains in grammar, reading, and writing skills were not as great as in some of the other areas and were affected by the need for  more than 40 hours of training. Of the 106 participants interviewed, all indicated that the training was beneficial.

Reviewers were participants in Colorado State University's 1989-90 Colorado Career Guidance Video Review Project training sessions and videotapes were rated on: (1) instructional quality, including content, instructional design, effectiveness, social orientation, and market value; and (2) technical quality, including audio, visual, and production. Additionally, reviewers indicated whether the video would contribute positively to the intended viewer's achievement of specific career development competencies in self-knowledge, educational and occupational exploration, and career planning. Recommended uses of the videos,  for example, as an introduction to a teaching unit, a stand-alone instructional tool, or a motivational activity, were also identified. Specific comments are provided for each of the 13 videotapes. Among the topics covered in the videos are the following: career options for teenage parents; interviewing and job survival skills; entrepreneurship; decision making; sex role stereotypes; and self-esteem. In addition, workshop participants individually reviewed a diverse selection of other tapes and wrote narrative summaries of their reactions; 19 of these reviews are included in this document.

        "description":"U.S. industry and the U.S workplace are changing. More highly skilled jobs are replacing unskilled and semiskilled jobs, and more jobs require higher-order thinking skills. At the same time, the education system is failing to educate young people to fill those jobs in the future. Although a higher percentage of students graduate than ever before, the skills many of these students learn in school do not prepare them for higher-level thinking and problem solving. Added to the problem is that more students today, and increasingly in the future, come from single-parent homes, from minority groups, and from poverty-level settings. Vocational education could be helpful for some of these students, because vocational programs teach problem-solving and analytical skills and reinforce  basic communication and interpersonal skills. Public education has historically responded to the needs of a changing U.S. economy and society. Tomorrow, the challenge will be very different. The very nature of work and the workplace will require a new set of skills and the schools must prepare all students to be successful in the new work environment. The new worker is really two people: (1) a worker with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to function as a member of a team with ever-changing technology in a flexible production environment; and (2) a student who functions in a flexible learning environment. The nation's corporations are learning this; the nation's schools must learn it too. (48 references) (KC)",

Following an explanation of the strategy for approaching the subject matter and an analysis of conversations about foundations, synthesized versions of three presentations made to the study group by three resource persons are provided. The presentations are: \"Vocational Education Enterprise\" (Gene Bottoms); \"Vocational Development and Vocational Education\" (Ed Herr); and \"Educational Reforms and Vocational Education\" (Harry Silberman).  The next two sections are called, respectively, \"Outsiders' Perspectives on Foundations of Vocational Education\" and \"Insiders' Perspectives on Foundations of Vocational Education\" and these consist of the comments of study group members who are either outside or inside the field of vocational education. \"Outsiders\" represented are Darrell Lewis, Roger Stuewer, Caroline Turner, David Noble and Robert Beck; \"insiders\" are Jerry McClelland, David Bjorkquist, George Wardlow, and George Copa. The final chapter presents the synthesis across all sessions of the study group and outlines the major questions and suggested line of response for pursuing the description and organization of the subject matter of vocational education from a foundational perspective.

Subjects were 2 groups of 10 cosmetology instructors each and 1 group of 10 employers of cosmetologists. Three instrument packages were used: the first was used by all members of the three groups to generate individual lists of affective behaviors necessary to perform the functions of a cosmetologist; the second was used by one coordinator from each group to develop a combined list that included all contributions of each member of the group and eliminated repetitions; the third used the combined list to generate ratings of each behavior from each of the subjects in terms of importance to success on the job. A 6-point  Likert scale was used to generate the ratings. Analyses indicated that the extent of disagreement on the exact job-related affective behaviors important to success as a cosmetologist between groups was large. The overall conclusion was that the Performance-Based Affective Behavior Identification (PBABI) process is an effective one for identifying role-related affective behaviors. The procedure can be implemented through the mail and produces lists of affective behaviors stated in a behavioral format that represents group consensus.

        "description":"The Working Smart workplace literacy project was sponsored by a public school district and several profit and nonprofit companies and conducted for the hotel and food industry in the Los Angeles area. Literacy instruction was merged with job requirements of the customer service job classifications. Videodisc courseware was developed, as were student workbooks that included 9 performance modules, 13 computational modules, and 27 communications modules. Each module taught problem-solving skills, critical thinking strategies, work attitudes, and safety skills. State-certified teachers delivered the instruction. Participants were a diverse group of employees recruited through the companies' communication channels and through referrals from community adult schools; many had limited  English skills. Workers were retained in the program by means of paid release time, cash bonuses, formal recognition, promotional opportunities, and a tailored assessment system. Of 92 students surveyed, 65% were very satisfied and 35% satisfied with the project. Problems encountered included: (1) sustaining corporate commitment; (2) scheduling; (3) lack of test instruments; and (4) underestimation of resource needs. Positive outcomes included an enduring relationship with employers and the development of interactive videodisc technology. An external evaluation found that students received too little interactive video instruction for conclusions about its effectiveness to be made. (The document includes project documents such as news releases, sample participant intake forms, a consultant  report, and an external evaluation.) (CML)",

Section 1 explains the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Competency System. The four competency areas--career decision making, life and work management, getting a job, and work maturity--and specific competencies are charted. Career decision making includes self-assessment, career awareness, labor market information, and career choice. Life and work management includes managing personal responsibility, solving problems, and coping. Getting a job includes job seeking, contact skills, resumes and applications, and interviewing. Work maturity includes dependability and reliability,  communication skills, personal relations, initiative and productivity, and worker rights. Section 2 outlines specific examples of how an agency can design and implement a system. Section 3 explains each competency area in detail, provides suggested methods of assessment and minimum certifications, and includes specific activity plans to use with students. Section 4 lists 16 resources and local JTPA contacts in Alaska. A 62-item objective test, covering the four areas of the preemployment competencies program, is included, with a sample answer sheet and an answer key. (CML)",

A review of literature found that more than half of all college undergraduates are women, one of six is a member of a minority group, two of five are over the age of 25, and fewer than three in five are full-time students. A study at Empire State College showed that their adult learners are drawn from professional, semiprofessional, and supervisory jobs; the majority are between 25 and 45 years old; about two-thirds are married; 60 percent are women; and they come from widely diverse backgrounds. More than three-quarters have 1-3 years of prior college learning, and more than one-third prefer business as an area of study. Empire State College has started with adult students and attempted to meet their needs  by identifying them, defining their goals, and designing nontraditional programs to meet their needs. These programs include a cooperative program with Bristol Laboratories in Syracuse, a program with a senior citizens center, a studio semester program in New York City, a center for distance learning, a public affairs program in the capital, labor union apprentice programs, and others. Empire State College has attracted and seeks to serve one of the most diverse student populations of any college, and after 15 years of operation, more than 12,000 adult students have graduated. This program can serve as a model for the future. (25 references) (KC)",

Data were collected from 4,543 entering students at ESC between fall 1974 and January 1977 on a Student Biographical Inventory (SBI). The SBI included items on the students' background, sources of financial support, reasons for selecting ESC, and a series of questions about how the students view themselves, personal goals, and self-ratings on various intellectual and developmental areas. Male students perceived their leadership ability as higher than female students across the age range from 23 to over 58. Males perceived their ability to handle stress as higher than females until the age of 51 when both sexes were at the  same level. Female students perceived their academic ability to be higher than males from the age of 30 onward. Both men and women have significantly higher graduation rates at midlife (ages 37-43) than at younger or older ages. It may be that the midlife transition period represents a second chance or a last chance opportunity for many adults who have decided they intend to complete a degree. (27 references) (CML)",

A literacy task analysis could be used by employers, union delegates, human resource personnel, trainers, and adult educators to understand better the specific workplace training needs of employees, as well as to provide a method for developing the actual training or retraining curriculum. The interim report contains three chapters, each with a different purpose and focus. Chapter 1 examines the role of education and training as a solution to adult reskilling and upgrading, defines workplace literacy, and describes a number of successful programs in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Chapter 2 highlights the  definitions, purposes, and methods of job and task analysis as a foundation for understanding the dimensions of a literacy task analysis. Chapter 3 describes, in case study format, three examples of how to conduct a literacy task analysis and points out directions for developing some of the training material related to improving such a job. Occupations profiled in the case studies include motor vehicle repairer, grocery store receiver, and pre-cast repair and cleaning laborer. Future research will continue on literacy task analysis and will include production of a manual. The report includes 29 references. (KC)",

        "description":"Religion pervades all aspects of Saudi Arabia, the conservative home of Islam, where the constitution is the Quran and law is interpreted by religious scholars. A formal adult basic education program was initiated in 1960. As part of the country's modernization since the early 1970s, the Saudi government has begun an enormous nation-building plan that includes universal education and adult literacy education programs. The Quran remains the primary reading material for literacy training. The government offers financial incentives to program completers and pays the entire cost of the programs for all students. Literacy rates have increased tenfold during the last 25 years. Other training programs are also an integral part of the adult education process, but not to the extent  literacy programs are. Although as recently as 30 years ago, women were not permitted to become literate in formal programs and 99 percent were illiterate, women now total over one-third of all adult education students. Religious leaders are primarily responsible for women's education, but only blind imams are allowed to teach women the Quran. (The document includes a chronology of events in the development of Saudi Arabian education, a table showing government expenditures for education in selected years from 1945-1983, and a 30-item bibliography.)

The BWEC is a partnership among Roxbury Community College, the Boston Private Industry Council, and the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) of Massachusetts to provide workplace literacy educational opportunities to adult workers. Methods used in the evaluation included personal interviews with a sampling of staff, students, union, and employer representatives; a comprehensive review of key documents; and observation of meetings of the project's advisory committee. Among the findings were the following: (1) BWEC was highly successful in developing and delivering educational services in an efficient, timely, and effective manner; (2) a high level  of demand for classes and very consistent attendance were found; (3) employers were satisfied with the effect on employee performance and especially self-esteem; and (4) there was a high level of student satisfaction with instructors, class locations, the hours of the classes, and what they are learning. Areas identified for improvement were provision of more English-as-a-Second-Language classes; more relationship between the curriculum and the jobs of the students; smaller classes; ability grouping for classes; lengthening the classes from 15 weeks to at least 1 year; provision of counseling for students; and more feedback to employers about the progress of their employees.

        "description":"Although more than 1 million people in the United States are employed in the apparel manufacturing industry, the industry has been increasingly threatened by international competition, changes in consumer tastes, and demands that many domestic firms are ill-prepared to meet. The traditional apparel production system emphasized cutting costs, especially the cost of direct labor, by breaking down the production process into many separate components. In response to the increase in international competition in the late 1960s and early 1970s, apparel makers intensified this traditional strategy. However, this approach was not successful, both because of technological barriers to automation and because of changes in consumer demand for apparel that weakened some previously successful  markets. As a result, some apparel makers are now trying to move to production systems that involve greater flexibility, faster production times, greater interaction with customers and suppliers, and more attention to both product and process innovation. This strategy requires a more sophisticated use of advanced microelectronic technology as well as profound changes in human resource philosophy and practice, including much more attention to the educational preparation and continuing training of the work force and a change in the orientation of management. Postsecondary textile and apparel schools are well connected to the industry and have access to information about industry needs, but community colleges are not. The industry must press for better secondary education and provide more  postsecondary education, especially in technical skills. (42 references) (KC)",

A special focus was on the skills needed by adult/community educators to a greater extent than K-12 educators. Based on the literature of job analysis techniques, the research combined the strengths of several methods: in-depth interviews and observation of incumbents, group brainstorming, development of a list of major areas of responsibility and skills and knowledge needed for each, and comparison of the Florida Principal Competencies with the results of these steps. Two supervisors and seven other adult education experts were  interviewed, and 23 attendees at the Florida Administrators of Adult Education meeting in June 1988 were interviewed. The study found many areas of congruence with the K-12 competencies, but also found that adult education administrators put much greater emphasis on needs assessment, designing programs to meet individual needs, changing course offerings to retain attendance, marketing and public relations, recruitment and management of volunteers, and adult education principles. (The job analysis and description of needed competencies for adult education administrators and 40 references are included in this report.) (KC)",

        "description":"This study examined the manner in which people who differed in degree of stereotyping of women organized sets of gender-relevant information. The Gender Expectancies (GE) measure was used to assess degree of stereotyping. Cognitive organization was assessed in two ways. First, principal component factor analyses using a varimax rotation were done on the item likelihood ratio scores from the GE. Second, cluster analyses were performed on the Evaluation, Potency, and Activity scores derived from a semantic differential based on 15 scales. Subjects in the factor analytic study were 471 students from a university and a community college: 101 high stereotypy males, 101 low stereotypy males, 134 high stereotypy females, and 135 low stereotypy females. A subset of 32 males and 53  females participated in a cluster analytic study. The data strongly suggest that individual differences in stereotyping of women are not simply a matter of degree of endorsement of a particular perception of women as a group. There appear to be important differences in how information regarding gender of persons and roles is organized by persons high and low in degree of differentiation of women from the population. The findings suggest that individual differences in stereotyping can be understood as qualitative differences in the cognitive organization of information about the sexes as well as quantitative differences in attribution of a particular quality to women.

Analysis of subjects' attitudes toward the sexes and of the evaluative content of their beliefs established that they evaluated women more favorably than men. In addition, analysis of subjects' emotional reactions toward women and men did not yield evidence of negativity toward women at the emotional level. Nor did it appear that subjects' very  positive evaluation of women masked ambivalence toward them.

In conjunction with the university's Success Adult Degree Program, the \"Perspectives on the  Individual\" course was offered as a homogeneous section for the nontraditional adult learner. In order to assess student interest in the course format, content, achievement, and utilization of experiential learning as compared to other sections of the course offered simultaneously where the population was heterogeneous by age, an investigator-made survey was distributed to all evening sections of the course. Final course grades, scores on midterms and final examinations, papers, class participation, and journal grades were analyzed for differences by course sections. The findings revealed no significant difference between heterogeneous and homogeneous-by-age groups. (Author/NB)",

MHLOC internal and chance scales were significantly correlated with retrospective views of the cardiac event on over one-half of the  opportunities. The composite scales combining MHLOC internal and chance and combining MHLOC powerful others and chance successfully predicted retrospective views of the cardiac event in one-half of the cases. Causal attributions and the composite &quot;Your Behavior&quot; predicted almost one-half of the retrospective views. The MHLOC scales, and especially the composites, showed enough relationships to encourage this pursuit.

Data were obtained from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, and included a subset of female youth (N=338) who had been teenage mothers and on their children. Adolescent mothers were interviewed in 1979 and then yearly until 1986; all mothers had a child who was either 6 or 7 years old in 1986 when the children were assessed with a developmental battery. The results indicated that black teenage mothers lived longer with their  parents while white adolescent mothers married earlier. Mother's age was related to the availability of support persons; younger mothers remained at home with their mothers and/or remained single while older mothers were more likely to live with a partner. There were several differences between black and white families in the role of the grandmother and partner in the child's development.

The history of the relationship between psychology and Christianity is reviewed. An organization of the psychology-Christianity literature is proposed. Three distinctive approaches to the dialogue between psychology and Christianity are outlined: (1) the development of a Christian psychology; (2) the psychological study of religious sentiment; and (3) the use of psychological principles and methods in religious contexts. These approaches are discussed both in terms of their impact upon Christianity and in  terms of their impact upon the discipline of psychology. The effects of the frequently-dominant mind set of psychology upon Christian thought are discussed within the context of schema theory. Finally it is argued that a more veritable relationship between psychology and Christianity might be achieved if the apparent obsession with the integration of these disciplines were forsaken, and instead, the singular contributions offered by each toward a greater understanding of the human condition were acknowledged.
