        "title":"The Teacher Expectation Effect: An Attempt at Clarification.",
        "author":["Hoge, Robert D."],
        "description":"Several beliefs about the teacher expectancy effect are false or half-truths. Current interest in the teacher expectation effect began with the publication in 1968 of Rosenthal and Jacobson's book, \"Pygmalion in the Classroom\". That book stated that a teacher's expectations for a pupil's achievement function as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Rosenthal and Jacobson also implied that this expectancy effect could be used to explain much of the variability among pupils in achievement, but they had no basis for that assertion. Their conclusion led to much research which produced very inconsistent results. Inconsistency came from two sources: serious methodological problems and a simplistic model of the expectancy effect. A more adequate model makes it clear that there is nothing  inevitable about the teacher expectation effect. While I believe the formation of expectations is inevitable, sources and accuracy of teacher expectations should be investigated. Recent research indicates that teachers tend to base their expectations on aspects of the pupil's classroom behavior and generally are good judges of the potential and performance of their pupils. As teachers, though, we should be better educated in the use of information about pupils and should be continually critical of our judgments and be willing to change opinions and beliefs about school children.

Techniques are presented for three components of the storytelling process: (1) finding a story to tell, (2) learning the story, and (3) telling the story. Variations in these techniques are described for stories taken from different sources including written or filmed stories, stories taken from personal experiences, and stories contrived solely from the imagination of the storyteller.

        "description":"Qualitative methods were used to evaluate the impact of a parent education package, \"Ways to Discipline Children\" on 31 low income multi-ethnic mothers at four sites in Austin, Texas. Methods included one-hour pre- and post-interviews using open-ended questions about parenting models and discipline techniques, home observation schedules and participation-observation during the four sessions lasting 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The parenting models focused on three variables; (1) How does the parent direct and control learning? (+/-control); (2) How does the child learn? (+/- others) and (3) Is mediation or control of the environment by the parent important for learning to take place? (+/- environment). The study found that the parents could be categorized in terms of seven parenting models.  The parenting models helped explain certain kinds of impact: Parents who had been abused as children had similar parenting models and reported similar kinds of changes; the use of positive discipline techniques is correlated with the self-other development variable and not with the control variables; changes in the parenting model were toward being less controlling and the dissonance between normative beliefs and parenting experience helped explain some of the changes the parents experienced in the workshop.

The teenagers were interviewed individually, generally in their own homes, once during pregnancy and once following birth. Results are discussed in connection with the following questions: What are teenagers' expectations about how babies develop? How observant are they of infants and parent-infant relationships? What do they define as their information needs regarding infant  development? Why do they say they want to have children? How do they see their lives as changing after they become parents? How confident are they about their ability to be parents? How important are families as sources of financial, child care and emotional support? What are teenagers' experiences with medical and health services, with school-age parent programs, and with other supportive services? How can teenagers' interaction styles with their babies be characterized? How does their knowledge of infant development, their expectations and attitudes about the role of parenthood, their family support systems, and non-familial support systems influence their interactions with their babies?

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to test several hypotheses from self-efficacy theory in the area of children's arithmetic achievement. Fifty-six elementary school children showing low arithmetic achievement were assigned to one of four treatment groups of 12 subjects each (modeling-attribution, modeling-no attribution, didactic-attribution, didactic-no attribution) or to a nontreated control group of 8 subjects. In the cognitive-modeling treatment, children observed as an adult verbalized aloud the solution strategies to division problems contained in the explanatory pages of their packet. In the didactic treatment, children studied the same explanatory pages on their own, after which they worked the practice problems. For children assigned to the modeling-attribution and  didactic-attribution conditions, the trainer attributed their successes to high effort and their difficulties to low effort on the average of once every 5 minutes during the practice phase of each of the training sessions. Results showed that both instructional treatments enhanced division persistence, accuracy, and perceived efficacy, but cognitive modeling was more effective in promoting skill development. In the context of competency development, effort attribution had no significant effect either on perceived efficacy or on arithmetic performance. Perceived efficacy was an accurate predictor of arithmetic performance across levels of task difficulty and modes of treatment. The treatment combining modeling with effort attribution produced the highest agreement between efficacy judgment  and performance. (Author/JMB)",

Each section includes an introduction which conveys some general knowledge of the period and its significance. Entries are numbered and, in most cases, annotated; volumes available in paperback form are identified by the symbol (p). Topics include myths, missions, settlements, life and law, Indian policy, politics, government, the War of 1836 in Texas, manifest destiny, Anglo-American colonization, economics, immigration and labor, depression and deportation, educational conditions and needs, civil rights, attitudes, trends of and reactions to immigration, self-images, and mental health.

Many cultural differences exist between the Indian and Eskimo students, coming from villages without high schools, and the boarding home families they will live with while obtaining a secondary education. Many puzzling and upsetting situations can be avoided if boarding home parents are sensitive to cultural differences, e.g., attitudes toward time, rules, and food, and to the student's style of communication, which is apt to be subtle, indirect, and nonverbal--especially in expressions of gratitude. A student's lateness for dinner may be interpreted as an act of rudeness  unless the boarding home parents realize that in the home village people rarely do things by the clock and that teenagers usually fix their own meals whenever they are hungry. Rules are necessary for the students' well being, but Native adolescents are treated as adults in their home villages and are used to independence. Unnecessary conflict can be avoided by limiting rules to major issues and by explaining the reasons behind the rules. With understanding and acceptance of cultural and individual differences, the boarding home program can benefit both the student and the boarding home family. (JH)",

However, the different types of migrants have different concepts of what constitutes serious community problems and where financial resources should be spent. When the individuals in various community roles change due  to migration, the community's socioeconomic structure may also change. This may alter the manner in which community needs are addressed.

The assumption that teaching/administrative staff in bilingual programs are themselves reflective of bilingual goals and orientations in their behavior was seriously questioned by this study. The model focused on a comparison of 35 parents and 37 educators regarding certain variables: their demographic background (ethnicity, native language, and place of birth), self-reported proficiency in Spanish and English  (understanding, speaking, reading and writing capabilities in each language), and actual vs preferred language usage by societal domain (media, home, social services, and school). The research site was a rural bilingual community in north central Colorado. Data was obtained from questionnaire responses to 53 items showing language preference patterns in selected social situations. Despite a high level of loyalty to Spanish, the community's adult population reported a greater usage of English than Spanish.

        "description":"This first volume in a bicultural educational series designed and produced especially for use in the Aberdeen (South Dakota) area schools has educational import for children and teachers everywhere who have an interest in the art and culture of the Western Sioux Tribe. This visual and verbal approach to art appreciation emphasizes the function of lines. Lines can be used to share thoughts with others: lines make letters, letters make words, words represent thoughts, and lines make images and pictographic symbols of thoughts. More than 250 pictographic symbols used by the Lakota Indians are illustrated and accompanied by historic accounts of how they were used as hide paintings for robes, tipi liners, shields, and warrior's shirts. The adoption of various media as their  civilization changed as a result of its contact with white society is described. Today many kinds of art can be produced through the use of many kinds of materials, but the purpose of the art remains the same as it was for the ancient Lakota: to make our homes and our lives beautiful.

The concepts of space and mass are illustrated. The result of combining masses and spaces into various forms of sculpture (bas relief, monolithic, mobile, stabile, assemblage) through the techniques of carving, modeling, or constructing is described. Although the Lakota did not make sculptures as we know them today, they did construct and carve three dimensional forms used for everyday living and beautified them with color, feathers, shells, porcupine quills, beads, or hair. The construction, significance, and evolution of the tipi, warbonnet, head roach, dance bustle, pipe, horn spoon, and  wooden bowl are described and illustrated. (NEC)",

        "description":"Significant 1970's federal legislation regarding American Indian education includes the Tribally Controlled Community Colleges Act; the Gifted and Talented Children's Act (Title IX Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA) which focuses in part on economically disadvantaged children; the Bilingual Education Act (Title VII ESEA); and the Indian Basic Education Act (IBEA) of 1978 (Title XI ESEA). The IBEA, the result of several years of Congressional work, mandates Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) reform in ten areas: academic standards, boarding situations, school construction, educational functions, funding, parental participation, education personnel, information management, technical assistance, and recruitment. The IBEA addresses student rights within BIA schools and  Indian control of Indian educational affairs. The law also gives the Director of the Office of Indian Education Programs line authority over all education personnel. Teachers are removed from civil service and placed under local control. Possibly the greatest impact on Indian education would result not from these new laws, but from the transferral of Indian education to the newly created Department of Education. For Indian education to remain under the authority of the BIA the IBEA must be successful. (SB)",

The lessons progress from elementary notions of least likely to more complex considerations of the probability of occurrence of one or more possible outcomes. Probability is introduced in an empirical sense through experimentation and investigation. In the later experiments, the students are shown how mathematical probability differs from empirical probability. The last three experiments of the module demand some fairly mature thinking on the part of the students. The teacher may prefer to use a classroom setting if these three experiments are used.

This paper suggests that social studies educators will make the pursuit of social studies knowledge more interesting if they tailor curriculum content to students' developing cognition. A three stage model of ideal cognitive development during the school years is described. The first stage, mythic, occurs during elementary school. It is characterized by pupil preoccupation with imaginary realms described in myths and fairy tales. Curriculum content at this stage should be arranged in story form, provide a precise affective orientation, have absolute meaning, and involve emotional and moral confrontations between good and evil. The  second stage, romantic, occurs in the lower secondary school grades when students begin to develop abstract thinking capabilities. Students employ romantic association techniques to explore the limits of reality with emphasis on fantastic and spectacular events. At this stage, a crude mass of knowledge about a wide variety of things seems important for further educational development. The third stage, philosophic, is characterized by laws of nature, human psychology, social life, and historical development as well as by their own romantic choices. By focusing on general principles, educators can help students reduce the chaotic particular knowledge about the world to manageable proportions. (DB)",

        "description":"This paper examines the origins of the two educational terms--class and curriculum. The authors believe that an understanding of the origins of key words in education may contribute not only to the history of education but also to the wider development of educational theory. The paper argues that the emergence of classes (in the modern sense) arose not so much from an increase in school size as from shifts in patterns of school attendance. Currently, the earliest known use of class occurs in a description of the University of Paris written by Robert Goulet and printed in 1517. From the 16th century to the Industrial Revolution, the term class developed three distinct meanings. First, it was used in universities and large schools to refer to a cohort of students (e.g., the class  of 76). Second, it referred to a teaching room (Goulet's original use). Third, it came to mean a relatively small group of students, usually engaged upon a common task. The paper associates the emergence of curriculum with the rise of Calvinism. The earliest source of the term curriculum in the Oxford English Dictionary is a mention in the records of Glasgow University for 1633. During the Reformation, Glasgow University underwent a series of reorganizations intended to turn the University to more \"definitely Protestant ends.\" In this reorganization process the term curriculum was used.

It is presented in four chapters. Chapter I states the rationale as the need to develop a global perspective in order to understand and function effectively in the world today. Schools have the primary responsibility for this development. Chapter II offers six lessons, which are designed for junior high school students but can be adapted for elementary or secondary students. Topics cover the relationship between human society and the natural environment, communication, benefits and problems of industrialization, energy, differing cultural lifestyles, and human rights. Each lesson  requires one to two or more class periods and includes an introduction, objectives, suggested procedures, and student materials. Techniques include reading, discussion, role play, research, simulation, debate, and gaming. Chapter III discusses program evaluation and provides a checklist. It also discusses student evaluation, offering suggestions for establishing objectives in four areas: knowledge, abilities, valuing, and social participation. The final chapter lists selected resources for global studies, citing general publications, organizations, catalogs, guides, and directories. It provides checklists for helping teachers to identify possible resources in their own community and to evaluate materials for classroom use. (JH/CK)",

        "description":"This paper reports on the educational status of women and ethnic minorities. The first part of the paper presents a literature review containing overviews of the past and present status of women and minorities in education and briefly discusses the concept of equality of educational opportunity. The second part of the paper, which comprises the bulk of the document, examines factors that directly or indirectly influence the status of women and minorities in education including educational aspirations, enrollment, retention, educational resources and school environments, educational achievement, subject matter, teachers, and administrators. Inequality of education between the sexes has been most severe at the postsecondary level. The impetus for higher education for women came  from two sources. First, contemporaneous with the abolition movement, the ideological conviction that women were entitled to the same educational opportunities as men gained support. Second, the latter half of the 19th century was a time of dire economic need for many colleges because of shrinking enrollments. Women were considered as potential sources of tuition revenues. Today, 43% of bachelor's degrees, 46% of master's degrees, and 23% of doctoral degrees are awarded to women. Large inequalities appear in the content and quality of the educational experiences of whites and Blacks. More Black students have low grade point averages in school than white students, and they are suspended more often and for longer periods than whites. (Author/RM)",

The program comprises an international visitor program and a two-way exchange of research scholars, lecturers, teachers, and graduate students. The major objective of the program is to increase mutual understanding between people of the United States and other countries. The document is presented in eight chapters. Chapter I introduces the program, explains administrative procedures and objectives, and defines the scope of the report. Chapter II summarizes findings and conclusions of the report including that the decentralized nature of the program renders most generalizations meaningless, most segments of the program are suffering from financial cutbacks, and decisions regarding  practices in the field should be made whenever possible by people most familiar with circumstances in a particular country. Chapter III outlines selection processes. Chapter IV explains participant orientation and assistance procedures. Chapter V comments on adequacy of allowances to various groups of grantees. Chapter VI focuses on methods of evaluating various program functions. Chapter VII presents comments by the International Communication Agency on administering the teacher exchange program. The final chapter explains the international visitor aspect of the program. (DB)",

        "description":"Five interpretations of equity are examined as they relate to the distribution of public goods and services. The first principle, utilitarianism, maintains that individuals are free to pursue their own interests and are rewarded according to contributions. The second principle, needs, is the basis of communist societies in which each gives according to ability and receives according to needs. Egalitarianism, the third principle, suggests that social inequality will be eliminated if each person receives an equal share of goods and services. The fourth principle, contentment, is based on the extent to which people are satisfied or dissatisfied with goods and services they receive. The final principle, the maximum criterion, suggests that the objective of public policy is to improve  the share of the least advantaged members of society. Throughout the paper, emphasis is placed on the philosophical underpinnings of each principle, strengths and weaknesses when used as a guide to designing public policy, and social and economic inequalities which result from policies based on each principle. The conclusion is that policy makers apply these equity conceptions in a deliberately fuzzy manner because to do so enables them to hold down costs and to reverse distributive measures when costs are perceived as excessive.

        "description":"Behavioral development among adults is viewed from a life-span perspective. Derived from sociological literature, a life-span perspective is interpreted as a conceptualization of achievement associated with success and failure in school and in the world of work. Remarks are organized around the question of whether achievement in adults' world of work can be foretold in the scholastic achievement of childhood and adolescence. Data are taken from research on social inequality and mobility. The most pertinent concerns in that literature are to describe and explain the processes that allocate people to hierarchically ranked social positions throughout their lives. Patterns of continuity and discontinuity from one generation to another, one individual to another, and with regard to  one individual across the life span are indicated by many factors including IQ tests, peer recognition, earnings, occupational status, and social standing. Findings from a review of recent literature by sociologists including O.D. Duncan, G.H. Elder, D.L. Featherman, R.A. Van Dusen, and H. Winsborough indicate that there is an overall trend toward greater continuity between the scholastic achievement of youth and the occupational and economic attainments of adults. Additional research is suggested on the sequence of institutional contexts--the home, school, and work/economy--in which achievement behavior takes place across the life cycle. (DB)",

The RCA, also known as Public Law 95-192, was passed by Congress in 1977 for the purpose of allowing the Department of Agriculture to appraise the nation's nonfederal soil, water, and related resources; evaluate the effectiveness of ongoing conservation programs; and develop a comprehensive program or strategy to guide future conservation efforts. Major activities undertaken to date to fulfill the requirements of the Act include development and publication of four RCA documents relating to RCA background and operations, encouragement of public participation, evaluation of public attitudes about the RCA  process, and recommendation to the Congress by the President of a soil and water conservation program. Ways in which geography educators can incorporate information about RCA in their conservation courses include directing students to analyze RCA reference materials; predicting the impact of various conservation programs on society based on RCA data; participating in conservation processes on state, local, and national levels; and modelling classroom activities on RCA activities and objectives.

        "description":"The paper explores how continuously expanding world demand for food, feed, and fuel is generating pressure to restructure agricultural land use. In addition, problems related to transfer of agricultural crop land to energy crops are discussed. The technology of energy crops has developed to the point where large-scale commercial production of alcohol from high-yielding energy crops appears to be favorable. As gasoline prices reach $2.00 per gallon, gasahol becomes not only feasible but profitable, particularly when factors such as subsidies and by-product credit are considered. National plans to produce energy crops have been formulated in the United States, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. Brazil has already implemented a large scale alcohol fuel program based  principally on sugar cane. On the negative side, however, Brazil has already felt the impact of rapidly increasing food prices. The millions who are at the bottom of the economic ladder in Brazil and elsewhere, will be increasingly squeezed as the more affluent increase their claims to cropland. The conclusion is that decision makers in developing and developed nations should carefully assess the impact of energy crop iniatives on food prices and availability before encouraging widespread conversion of cropland into energy crops.

More than 150 data sets from the 39 participating schools, representing over 19 fields of study, were analyzed. The data confirmed earlier studies which supported the correlational validity for GRE Aptitude and Advanced tests and undergraduate grade point average (GPA) with the grade point averages of first-time, full-time graduate students. Findings indicated recurring problems which must be solved in graduate-level validity studies: small samples, unstable weighting, range restriction, and criterion selection. However, it was determined that basic validity studies can be  conducted, despite these problems. Limited evidence was also provided for the validity of GRE tests for females, minorities, and foreign students. It was concluded that recurring participation in these kinds of studies is more important in graduate programs with small departmental samples as units of analysis than in programs with large entering classes.

Merit may be defined as an entity's inherent, intrinsic, context-free value, while an entity's worth is defined as its contextually determined, place-bound value. Determining an entity's merit may take place whenever a number of experts are assembled. Worth can only be determined by viewing the entity in operation or on site. Thus, while merit may be determined in any number of ways, worth can be determined only by intensive field studies on site. And field studies often call for naturalistic, not scientific, approaches. Although it would seem that merit and worth are identical to formative and summative dimensions, they are orthogonal. It is therefore possible to create a 2 X  2 table and generate four distinct types of evaluation: formative merit evaluation, formative worth evaluation, summative merit evaluation, and summative worth evaluation. Each of the four types of evaluation serves distinctly different purposes and is addressed to different audiences and stakeholders. (Author/BW)",

The advocate team concluded that: the program is working effectively; teachers, principals, and parents support the program; lack of higher test scores than those obtained in self-contained classes is attributable to deficiencies in the tests; some assistance should be given to less effective teaching teams; criterion-referenced tests should be used; and organizational structure is effective in meeting students' needs. The adversary team concluded that: students in the program do not show greater achievement gains in reading, mathematics or in attitudes,  based on achievement and attitude test results; parents and teachers did not notice discernible differences between the students in 3 on 2 classes and in self-contained classes; the program was not put through experimental stages; the objectives are ambiguous: individualization can be carried out as effectively in self-contained classes as in 3 on 2 classes; and the program costs cannot be justified.

The 3 on 2 program is an organizational concept for the primary grades in which three teachers are involved with two classrooms in a team teaching approach. The four major objectives are: to acquire basic learnings, to develop self direction in learning, to improve self-concepts, and to establish satisfying interpersonal relationships. The summative evaluation is based on an advocate-adversary approach, in which one team focuses on the program's merits and a second team identifies the program's weaknesses. The types of information gathered by the evaluators included achievement gains; attitudes of students towards school, learning, and themselves;  opinions of professional personnel and parents; teacher absenteeism; program costs; individualization; and legal and departmental mandates. In comparing the 3 on 2 program to self-contained classes, major findings, based on evaluation reports, included: no significant differences in academic achievement or student attitudes; opinions of teachers and administrators varied; teacher absenteeism showed no differences; costs were higher for 3 on 2; and individualization was not clearly understood.

The three principles include: (1) respect for persons, involving treating individuals as autonomous agents or providing protection for those with diminished capabilities; (2) beneficence, meaning obligatory attention to complementary actions of not harming individuals and of  increasing benefits while minimizing possible harm; and (3) justice, implying the equitable distribution of derived benefits and the selection of subjects so that a particular class of persons is not systematically chosen because of easy availability, compromised position or manipulability (rather than for reasons directly related to research needs). The following requirements are also discussed: informed consent; sufficient sharing of information with subjects, including research procedures and purpose, risks and benefits, alternative procedures, and the option of withdrawing; and comprehension by the subject of this information.

        "description":"Observation statements are characterized as being: (1) dependent upon the human senses or other sensory apparatus; (2) specific descriptions' (3) made by speakers who offer as the primary support for their statements the events or things which stimulated their making the statements; (4) used as the foundations for knowledge; and (5) easily believed by experts in the field in question. Thirty criteria or principles for critically judging the reliability of such statements are presented. First, observation statements are more reliable than the inferences based upon them. Second, certain observer characteristics affect reliability: emotionality; alertness; conflict of interest; skill with thing observed; theoretical understanding; normal senses; reputation; precision; skill with  observation technique; and bias. Third, characteristics of the observation condition affect reliability: the instrument precision; quality; condition; range of application; and ease of understanding. Finally, reliability of the observation statement depends upon characteristics of the statement itself: commitment of speaker; corroboration or documentation; precision; fit into body of knowledge; and basis upon record. The statement should be made and believed by the observer, close to the time of observation. These criteria provide theoretical support for a test or curriculum on judging the reliability of observation statements. (CP)",

        "description":"Current research and though regarding the relationship of individual difference (ID) factors to achievement in the basic skills is reviewed. Four major categories and nine subcategories of ID factors are defined and serve as the framework for the review: status factors (age, sex, and race, ethnic group, and socioeconomic status); intelligence factors (IQ and specific intellective factors, and perceptual factors); affective factors (attitudes and personality factors); and process factors (cognitive styles and cognitive strategies). Within each section of the paper, an attempt is made to examine research on IDs from the perspective of identifying strategies of instructional intervention that might be employed to accomodate or reduce achievement-related learner differences. The  review emphasizes that factors which describe variations in student performance on learning tasks are more useful for the design of adaptive instructional practices than are factors that describe psychometric traits of learners. Accordingly, the promises inherent in continued research on process factors are emphasized. (A bibliography is appended.) (Author/GDC)",

Both experimental and control groups were divided into high- and low-ability groups.

Test scores of the treatment group increased over the sequence, especially between Units 1 and 2 and Units 1 and 3. Scores of the control group decreased. High-ability students scored higher in both groups, but the difference between the three units was not influenced by ability or by a combination of treatment and ability; the treatment was equally effective for both levels of ability. There was no difference in time spent learning Unit 1 by treatment vs. control  groups. The treatment group spent significantly longer learning Units 2 and 3, but review time decreased from Unit 2 to Unit 3. The control group required more time to learn Unit 3 to mastery than the treatment group. Treatment aided the learning efficiency of the low-ability students, as well as retention of the materials ten days later. (GDC)",

This study examined the utility of the Bannatyne recategorization system in discriminating among three groups of fourth through sixth grade handicapped students, using a stepwise discriminant functions analysis on the subtest scaled scores from the WISC-R for 294 learning disabled (LD), 36 educable mentally retarded (EMR), and 71 emotionally disturbed (ED) students.  The results revealed that 100% of the EMR and ED students were predicted to be labeled LD on the basis of this recategorization, while 99.7% of the LD students were predicted to be LD.

The size of the unit is related to the student's cognitive processing capacity (CPC)--the amount of material recalled after a brief exposure. Subjects were undergraduate students categorized as high, medium, or low in CPC. The students were taught the chunking method and then used it to study a textbook chapter. Subjects were offered an end-of-chapter mastery test which might help to improve their final grades; they also had the option of repeating this test if their initial scores were unsatisfactory. Three months later, a test was adminsitered which contained items taken from the end-of-unit test,  items from the retest, and new items. Mastery tests and unit retests led to improved scores by 32% and 67%, respectively. Most who retook the tests were low CPC students, and 73% of them improved their letter grades. Long-term beneficial effects were evident; the initial difference between those who repeated the test and those who did not was eliminated on a three-month delayed test. (Author/GDC)",

It was jointly developed by the members of the program evaluation group of the Urban Institute between 1968 and 1978. The approach begins by obtaining management's description of the program. The description is then analyzed to determine whether it is: complete, acceptable to the policymakers, and a valid representation of the program as it actually exists. Three types of models are used: logic models, function models, and measurement models. The evaluator determines whether management's expectations are plausible, whether its evidence is reliable, and whether the program is feasible to develop. Perhaps  the most common problem affecting federal programs is unrealistic expectations, most likely resulting from a management decision which is invalid, implausible, or unacceptable to policymakers. A task for the evaluator is to construct alternatives wherever possible. The final step is to implement evaluability assessment findings. (Author/CTM)",

It has not been widely applied for testing applications because the assumption of an equal probability of a correct response was made to facilitate the derivation of the operating characteristic (OC) and average sample number (ASN) functions. The results of the application of the SPRT with a simulated procedure are described. The second decision procedure, the Bayesian procedure, includes a prior distribution of student achievement, a loss function for incorrect decisions, and the cost of observations in the  development of the decision rule. The basic philosophy of this procedure is to administer items until the expected loss incurred in making a decision is less than the expected loss after the next item is administered plus the cost of administration. This procedure is not yet operational for making decisions under tailored testing because appropriate loss functions for educational decisions have not been determined. (Author/BW)",

School personnel are also given suggestions on activities to undertake if tests are not sex fair: communicate test limitations to students; provide a full range of career choices; support counseling and career education programs; use a different test; inform the publisher of needed revisions; reduce harmful test effects through in-service programs or  additional interpretive materials; and assist teachers in constructing sex-fair locally produced tests.

The author examines ways in which humanistic and mechanistic psychological perspectives differ on fundamental assumptions about behavior and discusses how the humanistic trend in psychology can be advantageously used in examining the situation of Afro Americans. A review of the psychological literature on Afro American self concept and the family provides further examples of how the humanistic point of view might contribute to an understanding of Afro Americans. The author concludes that a humanistic psychological approach, by recognizing the human potential of blacks for growth, will foster the improvement of social scientists' attitudes  toward blacks and will make intervention efforts more empathic, creative, and effective.

Political, economic and social factors act as catalysts for neighborhood change by developing symbols by which an area is identified. Neighborhoods are formed by expounding on the new image most sought out by the exponents of the more powerful political, economic and social factions of the city. In part, efforts can be made to sell the new image by developing organizations that reflect the basic values with which the community will identify. This paper explores the process of neighborhood change and revitalization in Chelsea Park, an Atlanta neighborhood, as viewed by long term and short term residents of the community, real estate personnel, city representatives, and  members of voluntary associations associated with this neighborhood. A model to account for change in neighborhoods undergoing social change is developed that may prove useful to urban planners and others interested in this kind of research. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"Although the failure of open education experiments are often attributed to declining reading and mathematics scores, overwheming class sizes, and practical difficulties in implementing theory, the examination of a particular open education program in a suburban New York school district points to other possible reasons for the program's failure. First, while it may have been wise to examine other schools for worthwhile ideas, it was probably unwise to have tried to adopt a program from another community without taking considerable time to adapt it to their own. Second, whenever teachers feel that specific conditions of an experimental program are untenable from the outset, as they did in the project reported here, it is unlikely that they will be able to concentrate their efforts  on the important curricular changes to be tested. Third, the inservice course offered this particular group should have been tailored to the needs of the staff. Fourth, it was never clear if all the teachers wanted to be involved. If the project outlined in this paper can serve as an example, it is quite possible that many so-called open education projects have been truncated for reasons quite apart from the problems involved in implementing open education practices.

        "description":"Differentials in the use of preventive health care were investigated for a sample of 123 rural white, urban white, and urban black infants from data reported by their mothers. The data were compared on two measures of preventive care: immunization records and frequency of well checkups. Immunization scores were highest for urban white children, followed by rural white children, and lowest for urban black children. However, urban black children had better scores for preventive checkups than rural white children. Multiple Classification Analysis was used to identify specific demographic, economic, and accessibility variables that explain much of the race/residence differential in both measures. On the basis of the data, it can be concluded that as demographic and economic  differentials are narrowed among residence and race groups, the utilization differentials should also narrow. However, in order to improve accessibility to preventive care for infants, it is important to continue efforts to encourage mothers of newborns to establish ties with a place for regular preventive care.

The use of paper and pencil tests as standards for hiring and promotion is focused on as an example of this type of employment practice. An historical account of the passage of Title VII and a description of Federal court interpretations of the law are presented. The author states that although Title VII does not explicitly forbid employment practices which are discriminatory in effect if they are not discriminatory in intent, the courts have generally ruled that tests used as standards for hiring and promotion have a discriminatory impact and that firms must be able to prove that their tests  bear a &quot;manifest relationship to the employment in question.&quot; It is found that, in the majority of cases, courts have rejected respondents' attempts to prove the validity of their testing programs, although lower courts may be expected to increasingly find that tests are valid in the future. It is concluded that it is difficult to get Federal courts to make decisions on technical questions on which a professional consensus has not developed. (Author/BE)",

        "description":"It is widely believed that neighborhoods that are substantially racially integrated will resegregate, becoming overwhelmingly black over a few years. This belief follows from the assumption that few white families will move into a racially mixed neighborhood. Using data from the Neighborhood Characteristics File of the 1970 Census, Mid-Atlantic geographic division, this study shows that while families not of Spanish heritage (Anglos) are continuing to move into neighborhoods with substantial proportions of black or Hispanic residents, and that any rapid racial turnover is due to high Anglo out-migration and not an absence of Anglo in-migrants. The paper compares Anglo households who moved into integrated neighborhoods in the Mid-Atlantic division with households who selected  all-white neighborhoods. Variables measured for this comparison include owner/renter status, family income, presence of children in the household, percentage of families enrolling children in public versus private schools, and background characteristics of the head of household. Implications of these results with regard to future housing conditions, when the black demand for housing in neighborhoods adjacent to black ghettos may decline, are discussed.

This study is a secondary analysis of one of these studies, conducted to discover for whom the effects of cooperative learning are the greatest. The sample was 402 seventh and eighth grade students in twelve inner-city English classrooms. Classes were randomly assigned to team learning or control classes for a ten week period. The team learning classes used Student Teams-Achievement Divisions, a cooperative learning technique described by R.E. Slavin. Results indicated that the treatment increased cross-race friendships equally for students of different sexes, races and achievement levels.  Further analyses revealed that new cross-race friends tended to be mutual instead of unreciprocated friends and to be among the first six friends named on the sociometric questionnaire rather than more distant choices.

The sponsor-protege process (the informal promotion process of large urban school districts) and socialization (the psychological dimension of promotion) are discussed. Ethnography was the research methodology used. Results of the study generated information in three areas: (1) a descriptive model of the sponsor-protege process used in promotion; (2) an explanation of the socialization outcome, replication of the protege in the image of the sponsor; and (3) the postulation of hypotheses and corollaries which explain the exclusion of minorities and women from advancement into public school  administrative roles. The report supports the premise that equal opportunity of promotion has been replaced with restrictive access to opportunity favoring white males. The proposition was set forth that institutional practices exclude culturally different people from professional advancement, thus rejecting the popularly held misbelief that women and minorities are inadequate in number, ability, and aspiration when seeking promotion.

The author examines justice as a concept in the literature of three contemporary American authors, the Italian American Pietro Di Donato, Nelson Algren (whose descendents were Swedes and German Jews), and the Greek American Harry Mark Petrakis. Two categories of justice are discussed: (1) divine justice, the exercise of authority by God which implies a constant and universal moral law; (2) human justice which is either formal (codified in law) or informal (meted out by families, neighbors, and groups). It is found that these writers' views of justice are different from those of the  larger American society in the following ways: (1) self-definition is attained through relationships with others rather than through lonely self-assertion; (2) informal justice, by emphasizing relationships with others and responsibilities to them, is possible and desirable; (3) formal justice fails as a means of attaining equity and fairness; (4) divine justice is often inscrutable but there is a constant moral law by which one tries to live.

Data gathered through a mail survey were analyzed to: (1) determine how enrollees and non-enrollees differ on the measures of black history, racial attitudes, student comparisons, and general behavior; (2) determine how they differ with regard to specific classroom behaviors; (3) elicit enrollees' reactions to the course and their motives for  enrolling. The study found statistically significant differences between school employees who had participated in the course in only one area, knowledge of black history and culture. Those who did and did not enroll did not differ from each other on the measures of racial attitudes. The majority of black employees felt that the course should be manditory, while the majority of white employees felt the course should be voluntary.

The (male) students, who attended eighteen high schools in nine Massachusetts cities and towns, were interviewed first while seniors and then after graduation (in spring 1972) in three followup interviews over an eighteen-month period. Interviews with students prior to graduation elicited information concerning employment experiences during high school (labor force participation, weeks of employment, unemployment experiences, occupations and  industries of jobs held, wages, and on-the-job training) and post-high school plans. In subsequent interviews students were questioned as to their first post-high school job, labor force participation, employment experience, unemployment experiences, and wages. In general, the successes of graduates from cooperative vocational programs were not significantly greater than those of graduates from other programs. Irrespective of the high school program, the amount of work experience during the high school years was a significant factor leading to success in the transition from school to the labor market.

Program activities involved establishing career education resource centers in the libraries, providing professional materials for teacher use, developing a teacher advisor system for career guidance, and implementing a mini experience-based career education program. A draft set of career education activity handbooks was also developed for each grade or subject area. A longitudinal evaluation used these materials: Program of Exploration in Career  Education Knowledge Test (PECE). Self Observation Scales (SOS), Senior High Assessment of Reading Performance (SHARP), Criterion Reference Testing on Career Development (CRT), and teacher questionnaire. PECE and CRT scores showed gradual improvement. SOS results were difficult to interpret since an alternate form was administered in the second year. Scores generally increased except for those for school affiliation. SHARP was administered only in 1979 and only interschool comparisons were made. Responses on the teacher survey which were similar to previous responses showed positive teacher attitudes toward career education. (YLB)",

        "author":["Mott, Frank L."],
        "description":"A study of the socioeconomic status of households headed by women was conducted based upon data obtained from the National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS) of Labor Market Experience. (Since the mid-1960s NLS has been following labor market experiences of four cohorts of persons including male and female youth and mature men and women.) This study used data from both the younger cohort of women (aged 14-24 when first interviewed) and the older cohort of women (ages 30-44 when first interviewed). Each of the cohorts included about 5,000 individuals, with an overrepresentation of blacks in each. The findings indicated that marital disruption is an economic disaster to many women. On average, family income is cut in half during te transition year when divorce, separation, or death of  husband occurs. Also pointed out was that black female heads of households are more severely disadvantaged in the labor market than are whites. Black women heading households are less likely to be employed. The transition from marriage to head of household usually results in an increase in employment for mature white women, but a decline for blacks. Moreover, black women who are working hold lower status jobs than their white counterparts. Overall, the economic differences between mature black and white women heads of households reflected that black women were less likely to have completed high school and more likely to have a health problem limiting the amount or kind of work they could do.

        "description":"To assist states in developing political/educational linkages that are basic to the implementation of career education, a national project was designed with three objectives: (1) to determine the nature and extent of the participation of business, industry, and labor in career education policy development and program implementation in each state, (2) to identify, classify, and report federal and state policies, laws, and regulations that have implications for planning, financing, and implementing career education at state and local levels, and (3) to develop, recommend, and facilitate alternative approaches to strengthening state education policies and legislation through the collaborative efforts of the constituency of the project. Information was collected through interviews  with representatives of business, industry, labor, government, and education through a mail survey of agencies, individuals, and organizations. A twelve-member task force of nationally recognized experts and leaders of business, labor, industry, education, and government monitored all project activities, made recommendations based on collected data, and encouraged their use by individual constituencies. Reports of survey findings and the model legislative and policy alternatives developed from their synthesis were published in a series of task force reports and recommendations (see note). Dissemination included direct mailing; consultative assistance; presentation at state, regional, and national meetings; and national media publicity. (The process evaluation report is included.)

Special attention is given to the use of medical assistants and auxiliaries to provide primary health care in rural areas where it is difficult to attract or maintain full-time physicians. Chapter 1 gives an overview of considerations in health manpower. Chapters 2-3 discuss the organization and use of the assessment model, including  input data and indicators and assessment instruments (data collection). The analysis component, the core of the model, and outputs are considered in chapter 4. Appendixes in chapter 5, amounting to almost one-half of the manual, include (1) information on data and indicators needed for the assessment model, (2) methodology for determining health personnel needs, (3) sampling procedures and training institution survey, and (4) an extensive bibliography.

Following a brief introduction (chapter 1), chapter 2 describes medical belief systems (definitions of health and illness) in Central and South America, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. The first part of chapter 3 then discribes the principles operating behind the factors and how the factors function. In the second half hanging behavior is addressed. Chapter 4 outlines the  fundamental concepts and concerns of an assessment. Chapter 5 offers practical information on methods of collecting sociocultural, psychological, and behavioral data: how to conduct research, possible problems, and solutions to them.

Roemer, addresses the issues of income and health spending. To improve the general health of the population, he suggests increased public sector spending for health services. In A Systems Perspective on Health and Development, Paul O. Wooley, Jr. (1) summarizes the issues  associated with the definition and measurement of health and (2) describes the uses and limitations of various methods, particularly as related to less developed countries (LDCs). Theodore D. Woolsey's paper, Needed Development Research for Measuring the Health of Populations in the LDCs, first sets out eight principles clarifying the meaning and importance of &quot;health.&quot; He then summarizes key issues in the health and development dilemma before discussing the effects of improved health upon socioeconomic development. To bring the needed clarity to this matter of health and development, he recommends systems analysis. (YLB)",

        "description":"Both teacher and student materials are included in this guide for a postsecondary course intended to provide training in the psychological aspects of confrontation, disturbance, or disorder. One of a number of military-developed curriculum packages selected for adaptation to vocational instruction and curriculum development in a civilian setting, the course consists of six lessons covering thirty-five hours of instruction. Subject matter for the course focuses on social science concepts, the psychology of crowds and mobs, the personal recognition of discrimination and prejudice, minority groups and their contributions to the United States, and analyzing reports. The plan of instruction, which suggests number of class hours to be devoted to each objective, is based on the  following outline: Personal Perception (2 hours), Social Science Concepts and Theory (11 hours), Prejudice, Discrimination, and Minority Groups (8 hours), Crowds and Mobs (5 hours), After-Action Reports (3 hours), and Student Reports (6 hours). The course relies heavily on outside reading and individual activities. Lesson plans, behavioral objectives, textual material, and lists of additional readings are included along with suggested films and transparency sets (not included). Activities are directed at raising individual awareness of the social and psychological problems inherent in the imposition of authority on minority groups; correction and/or recognizing discrimination and prejudice on the part of individuals and the system; and developing strategies for handling these problems. It  is noted that material is applicable to police training, teacher education, or supervisory courses. (MEK)",

The project had three major components: (1) a two-credit course entitled Women's Life and Career Choices, (2) intensive advisement by female faculty members, and (3) the gathering of data on career attitudes and aspirations. The two-credit course was designed to provide specific information through lecture, discussion, and selected readings on careers for women, to demonstrate the possibilities for competence, success, and job satisfaction for women in nontraditional careers, and to provide role models for women students. The faculty-student advisement relationship was used to encourage the students to do some career exploration at the  beginning of their college careers. Seventy-five randomly selected incoming freshmen women participated in the experimental group. Findings indicated that there was a significant increase in self-esteem for the experimental group but not the control group over the year. There were no overall significant differences in career attitudes or expectations between the experimental and control group. The experimental group had a slightly higher retention rate for the sophomore year. (The course outline, instruments used, and course evaluation summaries are appended.) (LRA)",

        "description":"Underutilization of evaluation findings relative to the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) legislation may not stem primarily from factors usually identified in the literature (e.g., methodological reasons) but may be superseded by a more potent factor such as the prominence of the policy or program on the national agenda. Viewed from an evaluator's perspective, strategies to increase use of evalation findings and barriers which may prevent such use are seen as having methodological or organizational roots. However, the slow but identifiable shift from decategorized to more categorized employment and training programs can be traced through a series of strong federal administrative initiatives that have altered the balance of power between federal, state, and local  government delivery of employment and training activities. CETA, then, must be viewed as more than a training program. It is a part of national economic policy, and as such, responds to some of the ideas in good currency (e.g., high unemployment) which are then politically subsumed under its rubric. Therefore, by looking at programs in relation to (1) their place on the national agenda and (2) the ideas in good currency to which they relate, evaluators could more clearly focus evaluation questions in order to meet the needs of decision makers. Other types of evaluation activity, such as economic and other outcome factors, will also have a better chance of having an impact on policy making because they more directly adress ideas in good currency.

The model contained a matrix that compiled all these competencies into twelve domains of four performance phases each. The model provides a framework for all activities in the field of vocational special needs: research, development, demonstration, personnel preparation, and technical assistance. The remaining project objectives focused on creating and pilot testing a needs assessment instrument to measure individual educators' perceived needs for training within each phase of the twelve domains and their preferences for the delivery of this training. This instrument was designed to provide data (for  decision making) to inservice planners/deliverers at local, state, and/or national levels. Pilot test results indicated that the instrument could give useful data for making inservice/preservice planning decisions and that population subgroups had differing training needs.

Samples for the study were drawn from the 195 clients referred by counselors to the Wisconsin Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Office Concentrated Assessment and Diagnosis in Rehabilitation Entrance (CADRE) evaluation unit. Client vocational awareness was estimated from ratings provided by the counselors and the evaluator prior to and after evaluation on the Client Level of Functional Scale. The effects of vocational evaluation on client attitude and competency were estimated in a separate sample pretest/posttest design, career maturity inventory. While previous research on the effects of a two-week vocational evaluation on vocational  development of adolescents indicated improvement in vocational attitudes and some evidence of impact on self appraisal, goal selection, and vocational problem solving, the present research did not confirm those findings with the 4.5 day CADRE evaluation. Where previous research with youthful offenders found that they were aware of their vocational goals but were generally at a less than expected level on other dimensions, the present research found that the vast majority of clients were vocationally aware across all five dimensions.

An introductory section outlines the standards for driver education programs established by the Ohio Department of Education and makes suggestions for involving parents and the community. The multimedia guide includes sixteen lessons and suggestions for developing multimedia materials. Each lesson is designed to supplement existing prepackaged programs in two Aetna Life and Casualty multimedia systems--Multimedia Series and IPDE Response Series. The second guide, which deals with the driving simulation phase, supplements the printed  materials that accompany the simulation equipment and provides added learning, perceptual, and skill development activities. It includes thirteen lessons as well as suggestions for integrating the simulation phase into the driver education program. The third unit deals with the multiple-car range phase and discusses its definition and purposes, administrative considerations, facility design, and equipment. It contains eight lessons and supplementary activities. The format for each lesson plan in the entire guide provides some or all of the following information: related program(s) or film(s), task, objective, supplemental activities, teacher performances, and handouts. A concluding chart coordinates the three phases with classroom instruction. (YLB)",

Participants were carefully reviewed with respect to a number of variables including background, aptitude, attitude, and ability prior to the development of an individualized training format for each student. A profile feedback system was designed and utilized to provide inventory results and guidance information for each participant and counselor. Three of the seven participating CETA sites were selected to utilize each of two critical affective work competency modules: the  Pleasant/Orderly/Cheerful module and the Neat/Orderly/Personal Appearance/Manner module. The remaining site served as a control group. Pre- and post-test scores on the Affective Work Competencies Inventory (AWCI) were subjected to multiple regression procedures. Since both module treatments produced results significant at the .001 level, it was concluded that for the disadvantaged youths studied, awareness of desirable work habits, attitudes, and values was significantly higher than for those who had not completed the Affective Work Competencies training module. Utilization of Competency-Evaluation Profile, a computer printout feedback form, was also shown to provide supplemental career guidance for those completing the AWCI. A copy of the AWCI is appended.

        "description":"To examine the impact of evaluating one's transferable skills on subsequent employment experiences, a follow-up study compared past participants in Columbia University's Deep Investigation of Growth (DIG) program with a group of non-participants and a pre-program group. The program guides participants through a self-analysis process to identify personal success factors (skills) on which they are then encouraged to base career directions and job-seeking efforts. Data were collected on three principal measures of (1) extent to which skills were being utilized in present employment (Skill Utilization Index), (2) satisfaction with use of abilities, and (3) general job satisfaction--the latter two measures of the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ). Findings indicated no  statistically significant differences between post- and non-participants but appreciable differences between the pre- and post-groups on all measures. This indicates that those who elected the program were helped by it, but that the program may not benefit everyone equally. Those who elected the program did not appreciate their own versatility and skill marketability, and the composite of their skills were different from their peers. A weakness of the approach is that although transferable skills of an individual are identified and make the focus of job-finding activities, no mechanism exists for describing jobs in the same way.

Five presentations made up the symposium. Jerry Short spoke on New and Changing Occupations: Jobs and Skills for Tomorrow and offered strategies for teaching adaptability that could assist individuals in becoming adaptable. Speaking on An Employer's Concern with Occupational Adaptability, Richard Peterson stated that both employers and workers must become aware of the transferability of skills as opposed to job specificity in successfully preparing themselves and others for a lifetime of work. Paul Barton's presentation on The Early Youth Employment Experience  examined labor market data to show a relationship between education and work. Application of the concepts of transferable skills and occupational adaptability were examined and questioned. Judy Springer gave a status report on training in Business and Industry. In his presentation on Occupational Adaptability and Transferable Skills: Synthesis and Reaction, George Copa reviewed major issues discussed by the other symposium presenters. (LRA)",

These tests are available to all states that wish to utilize them. Many features of competency-based testing procedures offer advantages over other methods. These advantages include being free from sex bias and race bias. The identification of competency requirements for occupational areas is a process which requires a great deal of care.

Eight reasons for expressions of contempt emerged from a study of 95 societies drawn from the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, and were treated as independent variables, with the overall level of contempt as the dependent variable, in a application of multiple correlation procedures. Results indicated that six reasons for contempt account for 59% of the variance. In order of declining importance, these were: (1) lack or loss of children; (2) deterioration of appearance; (3) loss of physical strength and stamina; (4) gaining negative traits, such as being accused of being witches or sorcerers; (5) mental deterioration; and (6) lack or loss of skills and/or obsolescence thereof. Two  reasons for contempt, loss of wealth and hoarding of wealth, were excluded as insignificant. These findings suggest that children and other family members act as the first defense against older people being held in contempt, that physical change in appearance may be more important than is popularly believed, and that the possession of wealth may be less important.

Subjects were 25 farm couples and 24 non-farm couples, all residing in rural Alberta, Canada. Both groups were matched on age, income, and education. Findings support the existence of a retirement process with a developmental sequence beginning at about age 49 for men and age 47 for women. The process is characterized by a sequence of concerns with financial planning beginning at a mean age of 48, time planning at about age 50, and discussions with one's spouse regarding retirement at about age 54. Planning becomes important at somewhat different times for farmers and non-farmers and for men and women, as do the specific concerns. However, for all groups, the sequence of planning  was constant.

One category of factors potentially affecting differential response patterns, cognitive complexity, was investigated based on the assumption that if counselors and clients differ in their styles of processing interpersonal stimuli, these differences will generate different interaction sequences. Counselor trainees (N=41) were split into two complexity groups through a cluster analysis of five measures of cognitive complexity. Each trainee  conducted a counseling interview with two clients responding on the basis of a different cognitive style. Each verbal utterance of counselor and client was classified into one of four interaction process categories. For the sequence of response transitions generated by each counselor/client grouping, transition probabilities were estimated and organized into a transition matrix, then analyzed using chi square. The analyses showed that the complexity level of counselors and clients contribute to different interactional patterns and that these process differences were significant only during the early stages of the interview process.

The three articles on alcohol abuse suggest that: (1) there is a clear association between alcoholism and all kinds of domestic violence such as wife battering, child abuse, and incest; (2) many abuse victims are \"silent\" victims until threat of serious injury or death appears imminent; and (3) social services and the criminal justice system are beginning to develop programs involving hotlines, emergency shelters, and crisis centers to help with these problems. Other articles focus on the provision of services  for all children of alcoholics, not just those who exhibit behavioral problems, a program model for training counselors to handle referrals to child protective services, and policy issues related to federal regulations governing confidentiality of patient records and child abuse/neglect reports. A partial listing of family violence agencies is also provided. (HLM)",

The reliability of the scales was found to be approximately .80. The validity of this instrument was also examined by several studies.

Group therapy has advantages to offer anorectic patients in the form of certain curative factors including consensual validation from other anorectic group members, models of coping, peer feedback, and active participation in the treatment process. The effectiveness of group therapy, begun two years ago with a small, selected sample (N=14) of anorectic patients as an adjunct to their individual treatment, was investigated. Results indicated that six are still in treatment, one was discharged as cured, five dropped out after relatively short periods in the group, one left the group in order to focus on family therapy, and one patient died accidentally. The six  continuing patients differed from the dropouts in that they tended to be older and more separated from their parental homes. They seemed committed to their groups and showed themselves to be capable of functioning in group therapy and benefiting from it. However, despite this success, there are potential problems with this technique of which therapists should be aware, such as continued identification as an anorectic and teaching of anorectic behaviors to each other by group members.

Relationships between decoding problems and language difficulties were explored. Results showed that context facilitated recognition and identification of word meanings for all readers. There was no evidence of a deficit in use of context by reading disabled adolescents. Comparisons between groups suggested deficits in both word recognition and word meaning for reading disabled adolescents. Individual differences suggested independence between the two processes of decoding and meaning; some reading disabled adolescents  had primary difficulty in decoding, while others had primary difficulty in identifying word meanings.

Specifically, the study addressed three questions: Do parents want to help improve their children's reading? Can parents learn specific reading tutoring skills? Does parent tutoring improve children's reading, both at home and at school? The study involved 14 families, each with a child between the ages of 8 and 12 who was at least two years behind in reading. The parents were instructed in tutoring procedures that were designed to help children enjoy reading and become independent readers. The results showed that, at home, the tutored children progressed an average of 5.75 months in the level of book they could read, the overall accuracy of their reading  improved from 84.5% to 86.6%, and their percentage of self-corrected errors improved from 15.2% to 27.6%. At school, however, only two of the children showed progress. The findings indicated that parents did want to help their children with reading; that parents not only learned the tutoring procedures but, in some cases, used them with other children; and that reading gains in one setting did not automatically transfer to a second setting.

It was anticipated that some of the observed teachers would display patterns of assistance consistent with both the various outcomes of reading and the several components of instruction, including the concept of assisted learning. Although there was some evidence that two of the teachers displayed patterns of assistance, the overwhelming instructional activity across all six teachers was recitation, which made assistance incidental to the task of  completing the activity.

        "description":"In the past 30 or 40 years there has been much discussion about what factors contribute to readability in texts. In an attempt to characterize factors not measurable by current objective readability formulas, four texts that were adapted for younger readers were compared with their originals to see what kinds of changes adaptors had made and to assess the effectiveness of the changes. A taxonomy of the adaptive changes was developed and possible motivations behind the changes were suggested. Changes were found to be interdependent and influenced by factors such as assumed knowledge of the background, definition of the discourse topic, logical ordering of ideas, and syntactic structure, as well as limitations imposed on passage length, sentence length, and vocabulary choice.  Adaptation was found to be most successful when the adaptor functioned as a conscientious writer rather than as someone trying to make a text fit a readability formula. Based on these analyses, the use of readability formulas as guides to writing is not suggested. (Author/MKM)",

        "description":"The possibility that certain features of items on a reading comprehension test may lead to biased estimates of the reading achievement of particular subgroups of students was investigated. Item response data on the reading comprehension section of a frequently used achievement test were obtained from the Anchor Test Study data files. Eight nonoverlapping subgroups of students were defined by the combinations of three factors: student grade level (fifth or sixth), income level of the neighborhood in which the school was located (low or middle/above), and race of the student (black or white). Estimates of student ability and item parameters were obtained separately for each of the eight subgroups using the three-parameter logistic model. Bias indices were computed based on  differences in item characteristic curves for pairs of subgroups. A criterion for labeling an item as biased was developed using the distribution of bias indices for subgroups of the same race that differed only in income level or grade level. Using this criterion, three items were consistently identified as biased in four independent comparisons of subgroups of black and white students. Comparisons of content and format characteristics of items that were identified as biased with those that were not, or between items biased in different directions, did not lead to the identification of any systematic content differences.

The main premise is that although considerable strides have been made in the understanding of the learning process, essential developmental formulations of growth and change have been poorly articulated. It is suggested that there has been overreliance on the dominant theories of adult cognition and a return to a consideration of developmental issues within a framework of comparative psychology is advocated. Preliminary steps for a revived theory of development and learning are described, including a consideration of such topics as compatibility or naturalness, accessibility and flexibility of learning, and processes of induction. A three-pronged attack on  the investigation of essential features of learning is suggested that involves: detailed specification of developmental progressions and trajectories within a domain, microgenetic considerations of learning within a subject over time, and engineering change via the intervention of supportive others.

        "description":"The survey step in the SQ3R study reading strategy consists of scanning the reading material and its organizational features to establish the nature/magnitude of the reading task and to formulate guidelines for accomplishing that task. When the chapters of six history textbooks were examined for the presence, absence, and number of organizational features comprising the survey step, however, a wide range and variation in the use of those features were apparent. This variability in textbooks has implications for textbook selection and classroom instruction. When selecting textbooks, it is important to consider how the student will be reading the text. Since surveying is believed to be a viable, effective strategy in studying, students should develop this skill in material which  does not overwhelm them. Members of textbook selection committees should try surveying chapters of a proposed textbook to make sure that students are not handicapped by the lack or preponderance of certain text features. Once a textbook is selected, teachers should provide the students with a general introduction to the text, its features, and study strategies for dealing with the text. (RL)",

        "description":"One of the major assumptions of recent reading research has been that what the reader sees in the text plays as heavily in deteriming comprehension as does what the author says in the text. Although most researchers have tended to infer the reader's contributions by noting the differences between text structure and recall structures, there have been efforts to develop tools to quantify what the reader sees in the text. These efforts began with attention to a text's formal structure as the reader sees it and to the world knowledge of the reader presumed by the text. Four behavioral measures have been proposed for approaching text as a product of readers' perceptions: having readers mark off &quot;idea units&quot; in the text to determine where and how readers organize texts; rating these  idea units as important/unimportant to the author's main points; recording the immediate recalls of what has been read; and rating the importance of propositions ensuing from dependency analyses. Research dependent on these measures has begun, using college students as &quot;expert readers&quot;; and the interrelationships among the data suggest interesting connections between the manner in which students perceive text structure and the structure of their comprehension.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the impact on remedial reading instruction of recent Massachusetts legislation aimed at providing diagnostic/prescriptive services to identified special needs children in the public schools. Specifically, the study concerned available programs, certification and deployment of specialized personnel, delivery of prescribed services, and application to the state for reimbursement for services rendered. Of the questionnaires mailed to school superintendents in 351 communities in the state, 130 were completed and returned. The findings revealed that a large number of school systems had remedial reading programs that employed certified reading specialists and that reading specialists were characteristically used in the state-authorized  diagnostic/prescriptive procedure by which children were provided with special education services. They also revealed, however, that there was considerable confusion about the eligibility of school systems to receive state reimbursement funds when certified reading specialists provided diagnostic/prescriptive services to learning disabled children. As a consequence of this confusion, school systems whose administrators thought they were not eligible for reimbursement for reading specialists' services tended not to use specialists in this role, using instead special education teachers who might not have had specific preparation for teaching reading.

In preparation for this activity, the teacher should instruct students in the development of the story elements of plot, characterization, setting and time period, providing relevant writing practice after the discussion of each element. When students have become proficient in preparing story elements, each student is asked to write a description of either a plot, character, or setting; they are then grouped into appropriate triads and are asked to combine their three diverse elements to create a story. Variations involve students in writing stories based on  elements drawn randomly from previously prepared collections or on one element supplied to the class as a whole and two elements drawn individually from collections. After stories have been written, comparisons and contrasts may be made. Among the benefits of this technique are that divergent thinking and originality are rewarded, self-initiated activity is fostered, democratic processes are used, and provision is made for the acquisition of numerous language arts skills.

AS A FIRST STEP, IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT A VALID PERFORMANCE TEST OF TEACHER EFFECTIVENESS SHOULD DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN TWO EXTREME GROUPS-(1) NONTEACHERS AND (2) SUPERIOR EXPERIENCED TEACHERS-BEFORE IT COULD BE USED FOR ASSESSING TEACHERS WHO DIFFER IN SPECIFIED WAYS-(E.G., THOSE WHO ARE AND ARE NOT INTENSIVELY TRAINED TO BRING ABOUT BEHAVIOR CHANGE IN STUDENTS). SCORES ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT MEASURES ON TWO INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION TOPICS WERE ASSESSED FOR RELIABILITY AND INTERCORRELATED WITH MEASURES OF GRADE  POINT AVERAGE, INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT MATTER, AND WITH WONDERLIC PERSONNEL TEST SCORES. THE OBJECTIVE HERE WAS TO DETECT VARIABLES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED TO CONTROL FOR STUDENT DIFFERENCES IN SUCH FACTORS AS &quot;SET,&quot; INTELLIGENCE, ETC., IN ASSESSING TEACHER EFFECTIVENESS. KUDER-RICHARDSON RELIABILITY COEFFICIENTS OF .44 AND .78 WERE FOUND FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT TESTS. TEST SCORES CORRELATED .68 WITH GRADE POINT AVERAGE. A &quot;PERPLEXING&quot; FINDING WAS HIGHER TEST SCORES AMONG THOSE EXPRESSING LESS INTEREST IN THE INSTRUCTIONAL TOPIC. PRETEST SCORES WERE MORE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH POSTTEST SCORES THAN WERE WONDERLIC SCORES. (PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1966 AMER. EDUC. RES. ASSN. MEETING, CHICAGO, FEBRUARY 17-19, 1966). (AF)",

THE STUDENT TEACHERS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE OBSERVED FOR A TOTAL OF SIX CLASS HOURS--TWICE NEAR THE BEGINNING (PHASE ONE), TWICE NEAR THE MIDDLE (PHASE TWO), AND TWICE NEAR THE END (PHASE THREE) OF THE STUDENT TEACHING EXPERIENCE. SIX CLASS HOURS OF THEIR COOPERATING TEACHERS' VERBAL INTERACTION WERE ALSO OBTAINED. THE OBSERVATIONS WERE ALL CODED USING THE FLANDERS TECHNIQUE,  AND ANALYZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATED OBJECTIVES. IT WAS FOUND THAT STUDENT TEACHERS WHO RECEIVED TRAINING IN INTERACTION ANALYSIS WERE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE NON-RANDOM CHANGES IN VERBAL PATTERNS THAN THOSE NOT SO TRAINED. THESE CHANGES WERE GENERALLY TOWARD MORE INDIRECT TEACHING INFLUENCE. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS MORE LIKELY TO CHANGE IN RELATION TO THEIR COOPERATING TEACHERS THAN WAS THE CONTROL GROUP.

TASK ANALYSIS PROCEDURES AND CRITICAL INCIDENT TECHNIQUES ARE PROPOSED, AND DIFFERENCES AMONG STUDENTS (E.G., IN MOTIVATIONAL VARIABLES) HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED. (2) EVALUATION MUST ALSO FOCUS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TEACHER IN EACH OF A WIDE VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES WITH EACH OF A NUMBER OF TYPES OF STUDENTS, USING EITHER PROCESS OR PRODUCT MEASURES. CONTINUED RESEARCH ON PROCESS VARIABLES, USING SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED OBSERVATIONAL RECORD FORMS, RELATING TO THE PARTICULAR ACTIVITY AND TYPE OF STUDENT, IS RECOMMENDED. (3) IN PREDICTING TEACHER  EFFECTIVENESS, LONG-RANGE STUDIES (E.G., PROJECT TALENT) GIVE PROMISE OF PROVIDING DATA ON THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO TEACH AND WHO ARE EFFECTIVE TEACHERS. (4) RESEARCH ON TEACHER TURNOVER SHOULD LOOK INTO THE EFFECTS OF FAMILY DUTIES ON YOUNG WOMEN TEACHERS AND CONSIDER PART-TIME ASSIGNMENTS AND CLERICAL AIDES FOR SUCH TEACHERS. THE PRACTICE OF PLACING NEW TEACHERS IN DIFFICULT SCHOOLS AND WITH THE LESS DESIRABLE EXTRACURRICULAR ASSIGNMENTS SHOULD BE EXAMINED AS A CAUSAL FACTOR IN HIGH ATTRITION RATES AMONG BEGINNERS.

        "description":"TO REPLICATE PREVIOUS STUDIES OF SELF-CONCEPT AND TEACHING ATTITUDES IN STUDENT TEACHERS, 2 GROUPS OF WOMEN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION STUDENTS WERE TESTED ON A SEMANTIC DIFFERENTIAL SCALE BEFORE AND AFTER TUTORING AND PRACTICE TEACHING EXPERIENCE. ONE GROUP DID PRACTICE TEACHING IN MIDDLE-TO UPPER-MIDDLE CLASS SUBURBAN SCHOOLS. ALTHOUGH THIS SAMPLE DECLINED IN PROFESSIONAL ASPECTS OF SELF-CONCEPT AND &quot;DEMOCRATIC&quot; TEACHING ATTITUDES, IT ROSE IN PERSONALLY FULFILLING ASPECTS OF SELF-CONCEPT. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MIDDLE-CLASS STUDENTS TRAINED FOR MIDDLE-CLASS SCHOOLS HAVE DECLINING SELF-CONCEPT BECAUSE OF THE REALITIES OF THE TEACHING SITUATION. HOWEVER, PRACTICE TEACHERS IN AFFLUENT, SUBURBAN SCHOOLS APPEAR TO DERIVE MORE PERSONAL SATISFACTION FROM THEIR TEACHING  THAN THOSE IN DISADVANTAGED SCHOOLS USED IN THE AUTHOR'S PREVIOUS STUDIES. THE DECLINE IN PROFESSIONAL SELF-CONCEPT FOUND AMONG ALL GROUPS OF PRACTICE TEACHERS SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE NEED TO BE CLOSE TO CHILDREN AND THE ROLE DEMAND TO ESTABLISH AUTHORITY AS TEACHER LOWERS PROFESSIONAL ROLE SELF-EVALUATION. HOWEVER, THE TUTOR GROUP IN THE PRESENT STUDY WHO WORKED WITH ONE OR TWO CHILDREN IN SLUM SCHOOLS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. IN THE INTIMACY OF TUTORING, THE STUDENTS BECAME LESS CONTROLLING AND AUTHORITARIAN, AND MORE PUPIL-CENTERED. THIS IS INTERPRETED AS DUE TO THE INTIMACY OF TUTORING AND THE GREATER ATTENTION ONE CAN GIVE TO INDIVIDUALS. (RP)",

A 25 PERCENT RANDOM SAMPLE OF EACH CLASS TOOK THE CLASSROOM CLIMATE QUESTIONNAIRE WHILE A 50 PERCENT RANDOM SAMPLE TOOK THE THREE TESTS. USING MULTIPLE CORRELATION AND CANONICAL CORRELATION TECHNIQUES, CLASSES WITH HIGH GAINS IN SCIENCE UNDERSTANDING WERE PERCEIVED BY THE STUDENTS AS CONTAINING MORE FRICTION, STRICT CONTROL, AND PERSONAL INTIMACY AND LESS STRATIFICATION, GOAL DIRECTION AND SUBSERVIENCE THAN CLASSES HAVING LOW GAINS.  DISORGANIZATION, FORMALITY, AND SOCIAL HETEROGENEITY WERE IN DESCENDING ORDER OF IMPORTANCE, NEGATIVELY RELATED TO PHYSICS ACHIEVEMENT GAINS.

THIS PLAN WOULD USE THE MANY AVAILABLE TEACHER EDUCATION FILMS FOR INSERVICE EDUCATION, AVOIDING THE ADDITIONAL INCONVENIENCE ENTAILED IN THE PLANNING AND STAFFING OF WORKSHOPS OR INSERVICE PROGRAMS REQUIRING COURSE ATTENDANCE. THESE FILMS WOULD FORM THE BASIS FOR ALL INSERVICE EDUCATION. EACH MONTH, THE TEACHERS IN EACH DEPARTMENT WOULD SELECT AN APPROPRIATE FILM FOR THEIR STUDENTS TO VIEW IN THE AUDITORIUM, WHILE THEY (THE TEACHERS) WOULD BE VIEWING A RECENT TEACHER EDUCATION FILM CHOSEN FROM A LIST OF 66 COMPILED BY THE SECONDARY INSTRUCTIONAL COMMITTEE. THE PLAN WOULD BE ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY, REQUIRING NO TESTS, TERM PAPERS, OR  EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES, BUT ALSO OFFERING NO ARTIFICIAL INCENTIVES SUCH AS SALARY CREDITS. THE PILOT PROJECT IS TARGETED TO BEGIN IN JANUARY, 1968, WITH ONE PERSON IN EACH SECONDARY SCHOOL IN THE AREA HAVING BEEN CONTACTED TO AID IN EXPLAINING AND PROMOTING THE PROGRAM.

        "description":"2 STUDIES DESIGNED TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM ARE DESCRIBED. THE FIRST STUDY USED ABOUT 5 HOURS OF PROGRAMED HIGH SCHOOL GEOMETRY MATERIALS. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE MATERIALS WOULD BE INCREASED IF THE TEACHER ACTIVELY AUGMENTED INSTRUCTION THROUGH REPHRASING DIFFICULT ITEMS, ADDING EXAMPLES, WORKING PROBLEMS WITH THE STUDENT AND BRANCHING THE STUDENT TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PROGRAM. COMPARISON OF THIS ACTIVE TEACHER ROLE, WITH A MERELY MONITORIAL ONE, REVEALED NO DIFFERENCES AMONG TREATMENT GROUPS ON A POSTTEST. RESULTS LEAD TO THE CONJECTURE THAT THE TEACHER SHOULD PROGRAM HIS OWN BEHAVIOR AS CAREFULLY AS THE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IS PROGRAMMED, IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO AUGMENT THE MATERIAL. THE SECOND STUDY IS AN ATTEMPT TO  APPLY EMPIRICAL TRIAL-AND-REVISION PROCEDURES TO IMPROVE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION FOR FIRST-GRADE MEXICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN. CLASSROOM OBSERVATION OF READING INSTRUCTION IN 2 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS COUPLED WITH A TESTING PROGRAM REVEALED PARTICULAR DEFICIENCY IN USE OF SOME PARTICULARLY CRITICAL ADJECTIVES AND PREPOSITIONS. THE PLAN IS TO DEVELOP A DECISION FLOW CHART FROM USEFUL TECHNIQUES TO HELP THE TEACHER SELECT MATERIALS AND METHODS FOR DIFFERENT CHILDREN. USE OF OTHER CHILDREN AND PARENTS AS TUTORS, AND TANGIBLE REINFORCERS AS WELL AS MANY TYPES OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION. PAPER PRESENTED AT THE WESTERN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC.

JOHN KNOWLES'&quot;A SEPARATE PEACE,&quot; FOR EXAMPLE, LENDS ITSELF TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF LITERARY CRITICISM. AN ARCHETYPAL INTERPRETATION OF KNOWLES' THEMATIC PURPOSE REVEALS THAT THE NOVEL IS BASED ON TWO MYTHS--THE INITIATION OF INNOCENCE INTO EXPERIENCE AND THE SACRIFICE OF THE PURE AND INNOCENT FOR THE WELFARE OF ANOTHER. TO STRENGTHEN THESE TWO MYTHIC THEMES, MOTIFS OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE NOVEL--FOR EXAMPLE, THE COLOR PINK SYMBOLIZES BOTH SACRIFICE AND INNOCENCE, THE FOUR SEASONS PROGRESS IN THE COURSE OF THE NOVEL FROM A SUMMER OF INNOCENCE TO A SPRING OF RENEWAL, THE WAR INTRODUCES THE IMPLICATION OF EVIL, AND THE QUALITY OF FEAR MAKES EVERY CHARACTER CORRUPTIBLE EXCEPT FINNY, WHO IS WITHOUT FEAR. FOCUSING ON  THE MIND AND ART OF THE WRITER, A TRADITIONAL CRITICAL APPROACH INVOLVES A STUDY OF THE AUTHOR, OF THE PLOT STRUCTURE AND THEME OF THE LITERARY WORK, AND OF THE INTERACTION AND DIFFERENCES OF CHARACTERS.

AS ENGLISH BECOMES MORE UNIVERSAL, SO DOES THE ORAL-AURAL METHOD OF TEACHING IT. IN UNITED STATES CLASSROOMS, CHILDREN PRACTICE ORALLY THOSE PATTERNS THEY NEED, EXPERIMENT WITH WORD ORDER, AND GAIN A KNOWLEDGE OF SENTENCE STRUCTURE. USAGE IS APPROACHED LARGELY THROUGH ORAL PRACTICE, WITH ATTENTION GIVEN TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF DIALECTS WHICH DIFFER ACCORDING TO THE GEOGRAPHY, TIME, PRESTIGE, AND ETIQUETTE OF THE SITUATION. THE STUDY OF GRAMMAR IS A BLEND OF TRADITIONAL, STRUCTURAL, AND TRANSFORMATIONAL. THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LEXICOLOGY (ALL FACETS OF THE STUDY OF WORDS) ARE IMPORTANT PARTS OF LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION. RHETORIC TEACHING EMPHASIZES THE  COMBINATION OF INDEPENDENT ELEMENTS, SUBORDINATION, COMPACTNESS OF EXPRESSION, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF MODIFIERS. CLASSROOM METHODS STRESS ATTENTION TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND WIDE BUT SELECTIVE USE OF PROGRAMED MATERIALS. THE MEDIA SPECIALIST HELPS THE TEACHER MAKE EFFECTIVE USE OF A WIDE VARIETY OF AUDIO-VISUAL AND REFERENCE AIDS. OTHER INSTRUCTIONAL INNOVATIONS ARE COMPUTER-CONTROLLED LEARNING ROOMS, TEAM-TEACHING, AND THE NON-GRADED PLAN.

FORTY-THREE STUDENTS WERE GIVEN EXPERIMENTAL LINGUISTICALLY-ORIENTED MATERIALS DESIGNED TO TEACH THEM TO ANALYZE ENGLISH SENTENCES BY A STRUCTURAL GRAMMAR APPROACH AND TO CREATE AND COMBINE NEW SENTENCES BY A GENERATIVE-TRANSFORMATIONAL APPROACH. FIFTY STUDENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WERE GIVEN TRADITIONAL ENGLISH GRAMMAR INSTRUCTION.

THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT BOTH GROUPS MADE SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE STUDY AND THAT, ALTHOUGH THE LINGUISTIC GROUP MADE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SCORES ON THE POST-TEST, THE DIFFERENCES IN THE GAIN BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THEREFORE, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN STUDENT ABILITY TO WRITE COMPOSITIONS WAS SEEN BETWEEN STUDENTS WHO HAD MATERIALS BASED UPON STRUCTURAL AND GENERATIVE GRAMMARS AND STUDENTS WHO HAD TRADITIONAL LATINATE GRAMMAR INSTRUCTION.

        "description":"THE FREQUENCY OF 'ASPECT' (PERFECT AND PROGRESSIVE IN THE AUXILIARY) WAS REPORTED FOR RETARDED, NORMAL, AND SUPERIOR CHILDREN ACROSS AGE AND THE ORAL AND WRITTEN LANGUAGE MODALITIES. DATA WERE LIMITED IN SEVERAL RESPECTS, PARTICULARLY SIZE OF SAMPLE. THIS IS A PILOT STUDY RATHER THAN A SERIOUS EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND PROCESSES OF LANGUAGE ACQUISITION. THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT STUDY ARE NOT MEANT TO BE OF PEDAGOGICAL OR THEORETICAL VALUE. RATHER, THE RESULTS ARE TO BE OF METHODOLOGICAL VALUE TO THE RESEARCHER WHO IS INTERESTED IN PURSUING 'PROCESS QUESTIONS.' METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR USING FREQUENCY DATA AS INDICES OF THE ACQUISITION OF GRAMMAR CONSTITUTED THE CORE OF THE PAPER. NOTABLE WAS THE USE OF RESTRICTED (UNIQUE TO A CHILD'S GRAMMAR) AND CO-OCCURRING (MOST FREQUENTLY  ASSOCIATED) STRUCTURES. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE SUPERIOR GROUPS' USAGE OF THE PERFECT IN THE WRITTEN MODALITY, THERE WERE INSUFFICIENT DATA TO SUGGEST CONCLUSIONS FOR THE PERFORMANCE VARIABLES UNDER STUDY (MA, CA, MODALITIES). WITH RESPECT TO RESTRICTED STRUCTURES, THE PATTERNS OF TYPE AND CO-OCCURRING STRUCTURES WERE SIMILAR FOR BOTH DIMENSIONS OF ASPECT. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT FURTHER RESEARCH ON ASPECT BE CONDUCTED OVER LARGER SAMPLES. (AUTHOR/BO'D)",

THE STUDY WAS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE PROFICIENT WRITER SAYS AND HEARS AT A SUB-VOCAL LEVEL WHAT HE IS WRITING, AND IN THE PROCESS OF PRODUCING ACCEPTABLE WRITING HE TESTS WHAT HE WRITES AGAINST HIS INGRAINED VERBAL PATTERNS. THE OAV PROCEDURES, DEVISED TO PERMIT THE STUDENT TO REINFORCE THE PROCESS OF WRITING WITH HIS EAR, DEPEND ON USE OF TAPE RECORDERS AND OVERHEAD PROJECTORS. A YEAR'S STUDY USING A PRETEST-POSTTEST CONTROL GROUP EXPERIMENTAL GROUP DESIGN, RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT MEAN GAINS IN WRITING, READING, LISTENING, AND  ENGLISH USAGE. A SECOND YEAR'S STUDY, WITH STUDENTS STRATIFIED BY UPPER, MIDDLE, AND LOWER ABILITY LEVELS, REVEALED THAT OAV-TAUGHT STUDENTS HAD CONSIDERABLY HIGHER MEAN ACHIEVEMENT SCORES THAN COMPARABLE MEAN SCORES GIVEN IN NORM DATA FOR THE TESTS USED. THE OAV APPROACH SEEMED TO BE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE AT ALL ABILITY LEVELS. RATING OF SAMPLE COMPOSITIONS WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL EDUCATIONAL TESTING SERVICE RATING FORM PROVED INCONCLUSIVE FOR BOTH STUDY YEARS.

CHILDREN ORIGINALLY IN THE RECEIVING SCHOOLS MAINTAINED AND EVEN IMPROVED THEIR PERFORMANCE LEVEL ON THE LANGUAGE SCALES. SPECIFICALLY, THE AVERAGE GAIN IN RAW SCORE POINTS ACROSS ALL THE TEST SUBSCALES WAS PLUS 2.9 FOR THE CHILDREN FROM THE SENDING SCHOOL GROUP, PLUS 2.8 FOR THE COMPARISON SCHOOL GROUP, AND PLUS 3.7 FOR THE RECEIVING SCHOOLS GROUP. THE GREATEST GAIN FOR THE SENDING SCHOOL GROUP WAS 4.4 POINTS ON THE AUDITORY DECODING SUBSCALE. THE COMPARISON AND THE RECEIVING SCHOOLS GROUPS BOTH GAINED MOST ON THE MOTOR ENCODING SUBTEST, 4.1 AND 8.3 RAW SCORE POINTS RESPECTIVELY. TABLES ARE APPENDED. (LB)",

ALSO, DISADVANTAGED FAMILIES LACK STANDARD INFORMATION ON FAMILY PLANNING, HEALTH, AND SANITATION MEASURES AND HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF ETHNIC SUCCESS MODELS AVAILABLE TO THEM. ONE METHOD OF INVOLVING AND MOTIVATING THE ALIENATED INDIVIDUAL IS THROUGH THE INTEGRATED USE OF COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA, INCLUDING PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION, TELEVISION, TELEWRITER, AND A COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE SYSTEMS WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE COST  OF NATIONWIDE EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION. COMMUNITY LIBRARY PROGRAMS, DIRECTED AND STAFFED BY PERSONS SENSITIVE TO THE NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED GROUPS, MIGHT BE ESTABLISHED, AND THE DAILY DELIVERY OF NEWSPAPERS TO LOW-INCOME AREAS INSURED. IN ADDITION, ADVERTISING COMPANIES MIGHT CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE EDUCATIONAL INVOLVEMENT WITHIN DISADVANTAGED GROUPS.

THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT SUCH CHILDREN LIVE IN A WORLD OF ISOLATION, LIMITED EXPERIENCE, AND REJECTION. HOUSING CONDITIONS, A DEMORALIZING NEIGHBORHOOD, AND A DISORGANIZED FAMILY LIFE ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISADVANTAGED CHILD'S GENERAL IMPOVERISHMENT. THE ENVIRONMENT AFFECTS THE CHILD'S HEALTH, ATTITUDES, AND VALUES, AND HE DEVELOPS FEELINGS OF INADEQUACY AND ANTAGONISM. THESE ATTITUDES, AS WELL AS THE DISADVANTAGED PUPIL'S UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE VALUE OF AN EDUCATION, ARE CARRIED INTO THE CLASSROOM AND AFFECT HIS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. WHILE NEGRO GIRLS GENERALLY ACHIEVE BETTER THAN NEGRO BOYS, THE READING ACHIEVEMENT AND I.Q. SCORES OF ALL  DISADVANTAGED PUPILS REFLECT SERIOUS CUMULATIVE RETARDATION. THESE SCORES ARE A REFLECTION OF THE CHILD'S EARLY EXPERIENCES RATHER THAN A MEASURE OF HIS POTENTIAL. MOREOVER, DISADVANTAGED PUPILS ARE NEGATIVELY INFLUENCED BY INADEQUATE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. SLUM SCHOOLS ARE UNDERSTAFFED AND HAVE A HIGH RATE OF TEACHER TURNOVER, AND TEACHERS ARE OFTEN INEXPERIENCED AND UNPREPARED FOR WORK WITH THE DISADVANTAGED. FINALLY, RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT TEACHERS' EXPECTATIONS AND PERCEPTIONS OF PUPILS DIFFER FOR WHITE AND NEGRO CHILDREN, AND FOR CHILDREN OF DIFFERENT SOCIAL CLASSES. PERCEIVED BY THE TEACHERS AS INTELLECTUALLY LIMITED AND MISBEHAVING, THE LOWER-CLASS CHILD WILL SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVE LESS AND BEHAVE LESS SATISFACTORILY. (LB)",

PROGRAMS FOR DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN WHICH WERE OPERATED BY LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES (LEA) WERE ALLOCATED $1.16 BILLION, OF WHICH $970 MILLION WAS SPENT. PROGRAMS FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN WHICH WERE OPERATED BY STATE AGENCIES RECEIVED $15.9 MILLION AND SPENT ABOUT $11.2 MILLION. ABOUT $6.5 MILLION WAS SPENT OF THE $12.5 MILLION ALLOCATED  FOR STATE ADMINISTRATION OF TITLE I PROJECTS. OF THE APPROXIMATELY 8.3 MILLION CHILDREN WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE FIRST-YEAR TITLE I PROJECTS, 60 PERCENT WERE ENROLLED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND 6 PERCENT WERE NONPUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN. ABOUT 200,500 NEW TEACHING POSITIONS, TWO-THIRDS OF WHICH WERE FOR THE ELEMENTARY GRADES, WERE REQUIRED TO OPERATE TITLE I PROJECTS. IN ADDITION, ABOUT 181,200 OTHER STAFF POSITIONS WERE REQUIRED. A TOTAL OF 22,000 PROJECTS WERE OPERATED BY 17,500 SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ALMOST 70 PERCENT OF THESE PROJECTS HAD READING OR ENGLISH COMPONENTS. EXTENSIVE TABLES OFFER INFORMATION ABOUT EXPENDITURES, ENROLLMENT, AND STAFF IN THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS. (LB)",

DURING THE FIRST MONTH OF OPERATION, PROJECT PERSONNEL CONCENTRATED ON SUCH ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS AS TRAINING STAFF AND PREPARING FACILITIES. AN ARITHMETIC PROGRAM WAS SUBSEQUENTLY WRITTEN TO TEACH COUNTING AND NUMBER READING, AND WAS ADMINISTERED TO 12 SUBJECTS WITH LOW ARITHMETIC ABILITY FROM A VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT. DESPITE INITIAL UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT USING THE COMPUTER, THESE SUBJECTS HAD GENERALLY POSITIVE ATTITUDES ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE. WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS TRIED WITH NORMAL CHILDREN, MENTALLY RETARDED CHILDREN, AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, THE RETARDED CHILDREN FOUND THE COURSE TOO  DIFFICULT. DURING THE NEXT REPORTING PERIOD A GENERAL PROGRAM TO TEACH ADDITION WILL BE WRITTEN. FOR THE READING COURSE, SKILLS NECESSARY FOR THE VARIOUS READABILITY LEVELS HAVE BEEN OUTLINED AND PROGRAM OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED IN BEHAVIORAL TERMS. THE COURSE CONTAINS CONTENT AREAS AND MATERIALS OF HIGH INTEREST TO LEARNERS AND APPROPRIATE TO THEIR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE LEVEL. THE 40 EXERCISES AT EACH LEVEL WILL DEVELOP PREVOCATIONAL CONCEPTS AND ATTITUDES. AMONG THE ALREADY COMPLETED MATERIALS ARE LINEAR AND BRANCHING SUBSEQUENCES. ALTHOUGH AT PRESENT ONLY ABOUT HALF THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN WRITTEN FOR READABILITY LEVEL TWO, BY THE NEXT REPORTING PERIOD IT WILL BE COMPLETED, AND PART OF LEVEL THREE WILL BE FINISHED AND GIVEN TRIAL RUNS.

DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM AUGUST 1964 TO MAY 1965, AND CAME FROM THREE PRIMARY SOURCES -- (1) TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS WITH 150 BOYS WHO GRADUATED FROM THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HIGH SCHOOLS IN 1963 BUT HAD OBTAINED FULL-TIME WORK INSTEAD OF CONTINUING THEIR FORMAL EDUCATION, (2) THEIR OFFICIAL SCHOOL RECORDS (CLASS RANK, GRADES IN ENGLISH AND VOCATIONALLY-ORIENTED SUBJECTS, ATTENDANCE RECORDS, AND SCORES IN INTELLIGENCE AND THE DIFFERENTIAL APTITUDE TEST), AND (3) THE EMPLOYERS OF THE 150 BOYS WHO WERE INTERVIEWED BY THE INVESTIGATOR AT 123 PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT. EACH EMPLOYER DEFINED THE  JOB AS BEING ON ONE OF FOUR LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY, AND INDICATED THE ORDER OF IMPORTANCE OF THREE CLUSTERS OF CHARACTERISTICS -- (1) COMMUNICATION COMPETENCY (VALUED MOST IN 42 CASES), (2) PERSONAL ADEQUACY (VALUED MOST IN 91 CASES), AND (3) SKILLS UNIQUE TO THE JOB (VALUED MOST IN 17 CASES). BOYS FROM ALL THREE SCHOOLS WERE EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING JOBS RELATED TO THEIR TRAINING. ALTHOUGH NO SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN CLASS RANK IN SCHOOL AND RANK ON THE JOB, THE POOREST FOURTH OF GRADUATES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY POORER EVALUATIONS ON EVERY MEASURE OF JOB SUCCESS.

COSTS AND RETURNS WERE MEASURED BY COMPARING EARNINGS OF A GROUP OF 45 WHITE MALE GASTON TECHNICAL SCHOOL GRADUATES WITH EARNINGS FOR A GROUP OF 45 WHITE MALE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES HAVING SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS. THE COMPARISON COVERED A 7-YEAR PERIOD. THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE TOTAL COST TO SOCIETY FOR THE TWO YEARS OF TECHNICAL EDUCATION WAS $7,425 PER STUDENT WHICH INCLUDED $5,197 FOR LOSS IN PRODUCTIVITY WHILE IN SCHOOL AND $2,228 FOR COSTS OF PROVIDING SCHOOL FACILITIES,  SUPPLIES, AND PERSONNEL. THE AVERAGE TOTAL PRIVATE COST PER STUDENT FOR THE TWO YEARS OF TECHNICAL SCHOOLING AMOUNTED TO $4,920. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL INCOME FROM INVESTMENT IN TECHNICAL EDUCATION INCREASED FROM $553 IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER SCHOOLING TO $1,036 IN THE FOURTH POST-GRADUATE YEAR. THE ESTIMATED SOCIAL RATE OF RETURN ON INVESTMENTS IN TECHNICAL EDUCATION WAS 16.5 PERCENT AND THE PRIVATE RATE, 22 PERCENT, ASSUMING THAT PER CAPITA REAL EARNINGS WOULD INCREASE OVER TIME AT THE RATE OF 2 PERCENT PER ANNUM.

GENERAL EDUCATION IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO MUST OPERATE FARMS, MACHINES, SHOPS, AND OFFICES AND PROVIDE SERVICES. YOUTH FACE INCREASED JOB COMPETITION BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED SIZE OF THE 14- TO 24-YEAR AGE GROUP. UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG YOUNG WORKERS HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN HIGHER THAN FOR THE REST OF THE LABOR FORCE, WITH THE HIGHEST RATE AMONG 16- AND 17-YEAR-OLDS. IF PRESENT DROPOUT TRENDS CONTINUE, EIGHT OF 10 CHILDREN NOW IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WILL NOT FINISH COLLEGE. SCHOOL DROPOUTS COME CLOSE TO ECONOMIC SUICIDE. UNLESS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO INCREASE BOTH GEOGRAPHIC AND OCCUPATIONAL MOBILITY THROUGH ADDITIONAL TRAINING, THEY CANNOT ADAPT TO EMPLOYMENT SHIFTS SUCH AS  THOSE IN AGRICULTURE AND THE SERVICE OCCUPATIONS, OR TO THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR SKILLED WORKERS. ONE OF THE FREQUENTLY OFFERED SOLUTIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT IS MORE EDUCATION AND TRAINING, BUT THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO TAKE PLACE IN COLLEGE. STUDIES SHOW THAT IN COMMUNITIES WHERE STUDENTS WERE NOT OFFERED ADEQUATE VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS, THE DROPOUT RATE WAS THREE TIMES AS HIGH, AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS EIGHT TIMES AS HIGH AS IN AREAS WITH SUCH EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. AREA VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS, COMMUNITY COLLEGES, UNIVERSITY BRANCHES, AND BUSINESS, LABOR, AND OTHER PRIVATE PROGRAMS ARE OFFERING CAREER TRAINING IN INCREASING AMOUNTS, BUT THE PROBLEMS OF INADEQUATE CAREER INFORMATION, INADEQUATE INDIVIDUAL FITNESS EVALUATION, INADEQUATE TRAINING FACILITIES, AND A LACK OF FINANCIAL  PLANNING TO FACILITATE TRAINING PROGRAMS STILL EXIST.

THE STUDY POPULATIONS WERE INVESTIGATED IN TERMS OF FORMAL LEARNING, INFORMAL LEARNING, AND TECHNICAL LEARNING TO DETERMINE WHETHER VARIOUS GROUPS OF THE POOR UTILIZE THESE TYPES OF LEARNING DIFFERENTLY AND IN DIFFERENT FORMS AND WHETHER ETHNIC LEARNING STYLE MIGHT BE DEFINED BY THE PATTERN OF UTILIZATION. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN LEARNING STYLE AMONG THE ETHNIC GROUPS WERE DISCERNIBLE. THE LEARNING OUTCOMES  WERE RELATED TO FACTORS SUCH AS TEACHING STYLE AND NOT TO ETHNIC BACKGROUND. HOWEVER, THE PROPORTION OF NEGROES IN A GROUP SEEMED TO INTERVENE IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TEACHING. WHEN THE PROPORTION WAS LOW THE INTERACTION RATES WITH OTHER MEMBERS WAS LOW, AND STEREOTYPED BEHAVIORS, RHYTHM, SLOWNESS, DOCILITY, AND HIGHLY SLURRED, DIALECT SPEECH WERE EXHIBITED. WHEN THE PROPORTION WAS HIGH, THE INTERACTION WAS GREATLY INCREASED, AND STEREOTYPED BEHAVIORS WERE REPLACED BY HIGHLY POLITICAL, POWER-CONSCIOUS ONES. THE TEACHER WAS ALSO MADE TO FEEL THE POWER OF THE GROUP. IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT SPECIAL ATTENTION BE GIVEN IN STAFF TRAINING TO PROBLEMS CREATED BY ETHNIC PROPORTIONS, AND DURING THE FIRST 30 DAYS, AN EFFORT BE MADE TO HELP RURAL CORPSMEN ACHIEVE GREATER VERBAL PROFICIENCY.

THE MOST PREVALENT REDESIGN METHOD WAS THE INFORMAL PRACTICE OF ACCOMMODATING THE DECLINING PHYSICAL CAPACITIES OF A SPECIFIC AGING WORKER OR GROUP OF WORKERS. JOB REDESIGN REVEALED SOME ADVANTAGES OVER THE PRACTICE OF JOB REASSIGNING FOR BOTH THE OLDER WORKER AND MANAGEMENT. IN SEVERAL CASES, A SUBSTANTIAL RISE IN OUTPUT PER MAN-HOUR  OCCURRED. IN NONE OF THE CASES WAS PRODUCTIVITY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE FOUR CASE STUDIES SUMMARIZED SHOW JOB REDESIGN USING THE FRAMEWORK FOR FORMAL JOB PLACEMENT PROGRAMS WHICH CONTINUALLY EVALUATED EACH JOB AND EMPLOYEE IN TERMS OF DEMANDS AND CAPACITIES, UTILIZING MECHANICAL AIDS TO REPLACE MANUAL CONTROL, UTILIZING TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE FORM OF SPECIALLY DESIGNED FORKLIFT TRUCKS, AND INVOLVING REALLOCATION OF DUTIES.

TWENTY-EIGHT QUALIFIED HOME ECONOMISTS ATTENDED A 3-WEEK WORKSHOP TO DEVELOP INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND METHODS. LECTURES, REPORTS, AND DISCUSSIONS OF RESEARCH FINDINGS COVERED PROBLEM AREAS SUCH AS ETHICS OF HOMEMAKER SERVICE, MENTAL HEALTH, AND THE ILL AND AGING. EACH HOME ECONOMIST RETURNED TO HER PARISH AND TAUGHT A HOMEMAKER-HOME HEALTH AIDE TRAINING COURSE OF 60 HOURS OF CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION AND 20 HOURS OF SUPERVISED WORK EXPERIENCE. A TOTAL OF 380 HOMEMAKERS, 151 IN URBAN AND 229 IN RURAL AREAS,  COMPLETED THE COURSE. THE TEACHER TRAINING WORKSHOP, HOMEMAKER TRAINING PROGRAM, AND TRAINEE WORK EXPERIENCE WERE EVALUATED. SOME FINDINGS WERE -- (1) ADVISORY COMMITTEES CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROGRAMS, (2) THE SYLLABUS DEVELOPED BY HOME ECONOMISTS WAS AN EFFECTIVE TRAINING RESOURCE, (3) ANNOUNCEMENTS MADE THROUGH THE STATE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE AND LOCAL CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS AIDED TRAINEE RECRUITMENT AND PLACEMENT, (4) SERVICES OF PROGRAM GRADUATES RELIEVED DEMANDS ON NURSING HOMES AND HOSPITALS, (5) THE 80-HOUR TRAINING PROGRAM WAS JUDGED TO BE MORE SATISFACTORY THAN THE SHORTER ONES, AND (6) THE STRENGTH OF THE PROGRAM LAY IN THE ACQUIRED SKILLS AND ETHICAL CONDUCT OF CERTIFIED HOMEMAKERS. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS INCLUDE EXAMPLES OF AN ANNOTATED COURSE OUTLINE, OTHER  INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS, APPLICATION AND EVALUATION FORMS, A CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION, AN ORGANIZATIONAL PLAN, AND A PARISH DIRECTORY OF CERTIFIED HOMEMAKERS.

INTERVIEW DATA TO IDENTIFY INFORMATION SOURCES WERE COLLECTED FROM STATE AND COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION, UNIVERSITY FACULTY, PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES, EXPERTS IN SCHOOL-INDUSTRY RELATIONSHIPS, TRAINING DIRECTORS, SUPERVISORS,  COUNSELORS, OCCUPATIONAL TEACHERS, RECENT GRADUATES, AND SENIORS. IN THE GRAPHIC FLOW CHART MODEL PRODUCED, 49 CLOSED-LOOP SIGNAL PATHS, EACH INCORPORATING FEEDBACK, ARE TRACED AND DESCRIBED USING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF FREQUENCY, ENTROPY, FIGURE OF MERIT, RELIANCE, AND RECENCY. THESE ARE COLLECTIVELY RELATED TO OCCUPATIONAL INSTRUCTOR PERFORMANCE. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE MODEL APPROACH WAS FEASIBLE AND MODELS COULD BE DEVELOPED WHICH HAVE AN IMMEDIATE, PRACTICAL APPLICATION. RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE REFINING THE 49 FEEDBACK LOOPS, IDENTIFYING AND EVALUATING OTHER LOOPS, DEVELOPING MATHEMATICAL MEANS TO TEST THE MODEL, USING A LIFE-PROBLEM SIMULATION PROCESS TO IMPROVE THE MODEL, AND EXTENDING THIS TECHNIQUE OF SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS TO OTHER PROBLEM AREAS. FLOW CHARTS OF THE  MODEL ARE INCLUDED. (EM)",

THE FINAL OUTLINE WAS DIVIDED INTO AS MANY DIFFERENT AREAS AS THE CONSULTANTS FELT NECESSARY TO REPRESENT INDEPENDENT AREAS OF INSTRUCTION. EACH INDEPENDENT AREA WAS THEN SUBDIVIDED TO DETAIL THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE CURRICULUM. THE BREAKDOWN WILL BE USED TO INSURE A TEST ITEM POOL REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL AREAS OF THE CURRICULUM.

TWELVE  NORTH CAROLINA TECHNICAL INSTITUTES PARTICIPATED IN THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE PROJECT, AND 10 ADDITIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN ADMINISTERING THE PRELIMINARY FORMS OF THE TEST. METHODS AND TECHNIQUES OF EVALUATING THE PRELIMINARY FORMS AND THE PROBLEMS OF DATA STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL HAVE BEEN STUDIED.

HOWEVER, THE NOT-FOR-PROFIT SECTOR, WHICH INCLUDES NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT, ACCOUNTED FOR AT LEAST 27 PERCENT OF THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT IN 1963. GOVERNMENTAL AND NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS ARE BEING TRANSFORMED INTO ENTREPRENEURIAL STRUCTURES. THEY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRAINED MANPOWER SUCH AS PHYSICIANS, LAWYERS, ECONOMISTS, ENGINEERS, AND CHEMISTS. ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC EFFECTS ON PRIVATE ENTERPRISE IN UNDERTAKINGS SUCH AS URBAN RENEWAL, AND NUCLEAR POWER AND PRIVATE  REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT. FISCAL AND MONETARY ARRANGEMENTS CAN CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO PROVIDING NEEDED JOBS, BUT NEW ENTERPRISES, NEW PRODUCTS, AND NEW SERVICES ARE NEEDED. INNOVATION AND ENTERPRISE IN THE NOT-FOR-PROFIT SECTOR ARE THE PRECONDITIONS FOR EXPANDING EMPLOYMENT. BETTER SOCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR MANPOWER ANALYSIS AND TRAINING ARE NECESSARY TO INSURE THAT MANPOWER SUPPLIES ARE IN REASONABLE BALANCE WITH NEEDS. SINCE TWO-THIRDS OF ALL OUR EMPLOYMENT TODAY IS IN THE SERVICE SECTOR WHICH IS HEAVILY ANCHORED IN THE NOT-FOR-PROFIT SECTOR, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EVOLVE A WAY FOR THE MARKET SYSTEM TO WORK BETTER IN THIS AREA. A GROUP DISCUSSION OF THE SPEECH, MODERATED BY HOWARD ROSEN, IS INCLUDED. THIS SPEECH WAS PRESENTED AT THE SEMINAR ON MANPOWER POLICY AND PROGRAM (WASHINGTON, OCTOBER 7,  1966).

THIS INCREASE REFLECTS THE DRAMATIC CHANGE IN WOMEN'S WORK-LIFE PATTERNS. THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED INCREASE IN THE EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN OVER 35. THE WOMAN MOST LIKELY TO BE A WAGE EARNER IN 1967 WAS 45-54 YEARS OLD, AND OF THOSE IN THAT AGE GROUP WITH 5 YEARS OR MORE HIGHER EDUCATION, OVER 80 PERCENT WERE IN THE WORK FORCE. THIS MAJORITY OF MATURE WORKING WOMEN REFLECTS THE NEW REALITIES IN WOMEN'S LIVES. WOMEN MARRY YOUNGER, HALF BY 21 YEARS OF AGE, AND THEY BEAR CHILDREN YOUNGER. HALF HAVE THEIR LAST CHILD BY THE TIME THEY ARE 30. LIGHTENED HOUSEHOLD TASKS HAVE PROVIDED MORE TIME. EXPANDED EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES HAVE CONTRIBUTED  NEW SKILLS AND INTERESTS. THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING ECONOMY HAS PROVIDED THE JOBS, AND WOMEN HAVE SOUGHT THEM BECAUSE THEY NEEDED THE MONEY. IN 1966, 16 MILLION WIVES WERE IN THE LABOR FORCE. OF ALL HUSBAND-WIFE FAMILIES WITH WORKING WIVES, ONLY 6 PERCENT LIVED IN POVERTY, 28 PERCENT WERE IN THE $3,000-$7,000 INCOME BRACKET, AND 56 PERCENT HAD INCOMES OF $7,000-$15,000. WIVES' WAGES BOOSTED THE FAMILY INCOME LEVEL ALTHOUGH ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION WERE HIGH. IN 1965, 4.5 PERCENT OF THE WIVES EARNED $7,000 A YEAR OR MORE, A 76 PERCENT INCREASE OVER 1964. WOMEN'S WAGE AND SALARY EARNINGS IN 1966 WERE ESTIMATED TO BE $90 BILLION, WHICH IS ABOUT 23 PERCENT OF THE NATION'S TOTAL. THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL PERSONNEL WILL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WELL-TRAINED WOMEN IN  HIGHER LEVEL AND BETTER PAYING JOBS.

THE EFFORTS OF THE PROJECT WERE PRIMARILY DIRECTED TO THE REEMPLOYMENT OF THE WORKERS. IT CONTACTED EMPLOYEES WELL AHEAD OF THE LAYOFF AND ADMINISTERED GROUP TESTS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. IT MADE JOB SURVEYS, ACTED AS A CLEARINGHOUSE FOR ALL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE WORKERS' STATUS, NEEDS,  QUALIFICATIONS, AND JOB POSSIBILITIES, COUNSELED, AND MADE 1,160 REFERRALS RESULTING IN 317 PLACEMENTS. THE UNCERTAIN STATUS OF THE LAID-OFF WORKERS WAS THE MAIN DETERRENT TO THEIR REEMPLOYMENT. ANOTHER ADVERSE FACTOR WAS THE DIFFERENCE IN WAGE RATES THE WORKERS WERE ACCUSTOMED TO AND THOSE OF JOBS AVAILABLE TO THEM AFTER THE LAYOFF. EMPLOYERS WERE RELUCTANT TO HIRE LAID-OFF WORKERS LEST THEY QUIT AND RETURN TO THEIR ORIGINAL JOBS WHEN RECALLED. BESIDES DISPLACED WORKERS' UNWILLINGNESS TO FACE REALITY, THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE FACTOR INFLUENCING REEMPLOYMENT WAS INADEQUATE EDUCATION. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING PROJECT OPERATIONS WERE TO--(1) PROVIDE AN ORIENTATION CONTACT FOR EXPLAINING AND SELLING THE SERVICES OF THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE AND THE TESTS, IN PARTICULAR, (2) USE A  NONVERBAL TEST FOR THE FUNCTIONALLY ILLITERATE, (3) PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE AND OBJECTIVE STATISTICAL INFORMATION ON APPLICANT QUALIFICATIONS, (4) COORDINATE THE RESEARCH PHASE WITH THE EMPLOYMENT PHASE, (5) CLARIFY THE STATUS OF DISPLACED WORKERS, AND (6) PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROJECT FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL, AND EMPHASIZE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS, ESPECIALLY FOR ADULT EDUCATION OF A GENERAL NATURE.

THE RESURVEY INCLUDED 2.4 MILLION OF THE 2.7 MILLION YOUTH IN THE ORIGINAL SAMPLE. ONE OF 20 OF THE DROPOUTS AND ONE OF FIVE OF THE GRADUATES RETURNED TO SCHOOL BETWEEN 1963 AND 1965. ABOUT 13 PERCENT OF THE DROPOUTS AND 25 PERCENT OF THE GRADUATES HAD TAKEN SOME FORMAL JOB TRAINING OTHER THAN VOCATIONAL OR OTHER TRAINING RECEIVED IN REGULAR SCHOOLS. ONLY 4.9 PERCENT OF THE MEN WERE NOT IN THE LABOR FORCE IN 1965 WHILE 9.4 PERCENT WERE SO CLASSIFIED IN 1963. OVER ONE-FOURTH OF THE GRADUATES BUT  ONLY 11 PERCENT OF THE DROPOUTS HELD WHITE COLLAR JOBS. THE DATA FOR ALL MEASURES SUCH AS JOB HELD, UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, EARNINGS, STEADINESS OF EMPLOYMENT, HOURS OF WORK, AND LABOR MOBILITY SHOWED THAT THE MEN WITH MORE EDUCATION MADE GREATER ADVANCES OVER THE 2-YEAR PERIOD.

THE INCREASED NUMBER OF WOMEN WORKERS RESULTED NOT ONLY FROM THE EXPANDING JOB MARKET BUT ALSO FROM FEDERAL LEGISLATION OUTLAWING SEX DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT. IN THIS DECADE, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN WOMEN WORKERS, 25 PERCENT, HAS BEEN IN MARRIED WOMEN UNDER 35 YEARS OF AGE. THE DECLINING BIRTH RATE AMONG WIVES 21-24 YEARS OLD AND THE CHANGING ATTITUDES OF EMPLOYERS, SOCIETY, AND FAMILIES HAVE MADE YOUNG MOTHERS' WORKING MORE ACCEPTABLE. NEGRO WOMEN, WITH AND WITHOUT CHILDREN, CONTINUED TO HAVE HIGHER WORKER RATES AND LOWER INCOMES THAN WHITES, EVEN WHEN THEY WERE FAMILY HEADS. OVER HALF WERE SERVICE WORKERS WHILE ONLY 16 PERCENT OF  WHITES HELD SUCH JOBS. THE COMPARATIVELY LOW INCOME LEVELS AMONG NEGRO FAMILIES REFLECT THE CONCENTRATION OF FAMILY HEADS AMONG THE LESS SKILLED OCCUPATIONS, MANY IN WHICH INTERMITTENT EMPLOYMENT IS NOT UNUSUAL.

DATA INDICATED FOUR COMPONENT SUBAREAS OF THE PROBLEM FOR WHICH EFFECTIVE REMEDIAL MEASURES ARE DIFFICULT TO FIND -- (1) MOTIVATING  PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH-DEVELOPMENT-DESIGN PERSONNEL WHOSE SKILLS HAVE BECOME OUTDATED, (2) DETERMINING DISPOSITION OF THE SKILL OF OBSOLESCENT PERSONNEL WHEN REDUCTIONS IN PROFESSIONAL TECHNICAL WORK FORCE ARE NECESSARY, (3) IDENTIFYING, DEVELOPING, AND UPDATING COMPETENT PROJECT LEADERS, SYSTEMS ENGINEERS, AND OTHER KEY PRACTICING PROFESSIONALS, AND (4) ASSESSING THE KIND AND DEGREE OF UPDATING NEEDED BY TECHNICAL MANAGERS AND PROVIDING MEANS AND INCENTIVES NECESSARY TO BRING ABOUT SUCH UPDATING. DATA SUGGESTED SIMILAR SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES IN TECHNOLOGY-ORIENTED INDUSTRY AT LARGE, AND CONSEQUENTLY, A NEED FOR BROADER SCOPE RESEARCH INTO THESE PROBLEMS. (HC)",

A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO DEVELOP AN INSTRUMENT CAPABLE OF GIVING UNBIASED PROJECTIONS OF THE MANPOWER IMPACT OF SPECIFIC ADVANCES IN PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY. DEPENDENT VARIABLES WERE MAN-HOUR REQUIREMENTS PER UNIT PRODUCT AND REQUIRED SKILL LEVEL RATED ON A PRIVIOUSLY DEVELOPED SCALE. DATA FROM ACTUAL OBSERVATIONS OF PROCESSES, FROM COMPANY JOB ANALYSIS INSTRUMENTS, AND EMPLOYEE, COST, AND PRODUCTION RECORDS WERE COLLECTED INDEPENDENTLY FROM TWO FIRMS IN EACH INDUSTRY FOR WHICH AN OLD AND A NEW PROCESS WERE COMPARED -- BANKING, STEEL ANNEALING, STEEL GALVANIZING, AND AEROSPACE METAL MACHINING. ALL PAIRS  OF PROCESSES SHOWED THE EXPECTED REDUCTION IN MAN-HOUR REQUIREMENT PER UNIT, AND IN ALL CASES INSTALLATION OF THE NEW PROCESS WAS JUSTIFIED IN TERMS OF HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY. MEAN SKILL LEVELS WERE INCREASED TO A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EXTENT IN ALL CASES EXCEPT METAL MACHINING WHERE THEY WERE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY. HOWEVER, THE CHANGES WERE SMALL IN ABSOLUTE TERMS. MANPOWER DEMAND INCREASES RESULTING FROM USING THE NEW PROCESSES WERE NOT BIG ENOUGH TO AFFECT THE LABOR FORCE. THEREFORE, OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY WILL HAVE TO FURNISH NEEDED EMPLOYMENT.

MANY OF THE OBJECTIVE STANDARDS OF APPRENTICE SELECTION ARE RACIALLY MOTIVATED AND IF A SUPPLY OF QUALIFIED APPLICANTS IS GENERATED AND CONTINUES TO BE BARRED FROM APPRENTICE PROGRAMS, PUBLIC POLICY MIGHT HAVE TO DEVOTE MORE ATTENTION TO THE QUALIFICATIONS AND TESTING PROCEDURES USED TO SELECT TRAINEES. TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POLICIES NEEDED TO INCREASE NEGRO PARTICIPATION ARE MEASURES THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AVAILABLE TO DISADVANTAGED YOUTH AND POLICIES TO MAINTAIN FULL EMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.

THE NINE PROGRAM AREAS OF MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING ACT (MDTA) INSTRUCTION WERE AUTO MECHANICS, AUTO BODY REPAIR, INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, HIGHWAY TECHNICIAN, MACHINE TOOL AND DIE MAKING, WELDING, GENERAL OFFICE CLERK, PRACTICAL NURSING, AND STENOGRAPHY. SYSTEMATIC DOWNWARD BIAS WAS INTRODUCED INTO EACH VARIABLE IN ORDER TO KEEP FORMULAS CONSERVATIVE. PRIVATE COST INCLUDED STUDENT DIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTS. ANNUAL PRIVATE RETURN WAS CALCULATED UPON THE BASIS OF  PRE- AND POST-TRAINING ANNUAL INCOMES. SOCIAL COSTS WERE BASED UPON EDUCATIONAL EXPENDITURES, CAPITAL SPENT, AND MDTA SUBSIDIES TO STUDENTS. SOCIAL RETURNS WERE BASED UPON GROSS EARNING DIFFERENTIALS. FINDINGS LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WERE WIDE VARIATIONS IN PRIVATE GAINS. THE ZERO-OR-LESS GAINS WERE OFFSET BY THE INTANGIBLE SATISFACTION EXPRESSED BY TRAINEES. MEDIAN PRIVATE GAIN RATES WERE HIGHER OR EQUAL TO AVERAGE RATES EXPECTED OF OTHER INVESTMENTS. MEDIAN SOCIAL GAIN RATES WERE LOWER THAN OTHER SOCIAL INVESTMENTS. ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE GRADUATES WERE REMAINING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. (JM)",

HALF HAD ENROLLED IN THE  COURSE TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION, BUT HALF CONTINUED IN ATTENDANCE JUST UNDER FOUR MONTHS, MAINLY DROPPING OUT BECAUSE OF FAILURE. MOST OF THE PARTICIPANTS FELT THE PROGRAM VERY WORTHWHILE. IT WAS RECOMMENDED AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY THAT--(1) THE EDUCATIONAL AND WELFARE PROGRAMS SHOULD BE COORDINATED, (2) MORE MALES BETWEEN 20 AND 40 SHOULD BE RECRUITED, (3) MORE RECORDS BE KEPT BY TEACHERS, (4) BETTER TESTING PROCEDURES, INCLUDING PERFORMANCE TESTS, SHOULD BE USED, AND (5) MORE ADULTS FROM ETHNIC MINORITIES SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN CERTIFIED POSITIONS.

ONE FOURTH PROVIDED AWAY-FROM-THE-JOB-TRAINING, AVERAGING 8 HOURS PER EMPLOYEE PER YEAR, MOSTLY ON COMPANY PREMISES. EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS HAD SOME CRITICISM OF JOB APPLICANTS' SCHOOL PREPARATION.

RETURNING VOLUNTEERS, AFTER BEING TRAINED AS DISCUSSION LEADERS, HAVE BECOME OUTSTANDING TEACHERS IN THE TRAINING PROGRAMS, STRESSING THE NEED FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH FOR EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. IN-HOUSE TRAINING, IN WHICH TRAINING IS ENTIRELY RUN BY THE PEACE CORPS, HAS BEEN TRIED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO UNIVERSITY-SPONSORED TRAINING, AND ADVANCED  TRAINING FOR COLLEGE JUNIORS HAS BEGUN.

WRITING INSTRUCTION, THEREFORE, MUST INCLUDE EXERCISES NECESSITATING INTENSE CONCENTRATION. IN PLANNING A WRITING CURRICULUM THE FOLLOWING POINTS SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND--(1) GRAMMAR AND READING ARE NOT GOALS IN THEMSELVES BUT INDISPENSIBLE TOOLS, (2) WRITING HAS CERTAIN STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES FROM SPEECH, AND (3) FREE COMPOSITION OFTEN RESULTS IN WORD-FOR-WORD TRANSLATION AND UNGRAMMATICAL RESULTS. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WRITING MAY BE CONTROLLED BY  CONTROLLING THE PURPOSE OF THE WRITING. THE THREE GENERAL TYPES OF EXPOSITORY PROSE MOST USED IN CLASSROOMS ARE--(1) LECTURE AND READING NOTES WHICH REPORT FACTS, (2) ANSWERS TO EXAMINATION QUESTIONS WHICH EXPLAIN THEM, AND (3) RESEARCH OR CRITICAL PAPERS WHICH EVALUATE.

AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OBSERVERS PERCEIVED TO BE PRESENT DECREASED THE SPEED OF RESPONSE. WHEN VARYING THE TYPE OF OTHERS PRESENT, IT WAS FOUND THAT NEITHER SEX NOR PREVIOUS MEDICAL EXPERIENCE CAUSED ANY CHANGES IN REACTION SPEED. IN ANOTHER EXPERIMENT, A QUESTION WAS DIRECTLY ASKED OF--(1) THE BYSTANDER, (2) THE BYSTANDER AND ANOTHER PERSON, OR (3) THE OTHER PERSON, WHO IN ALL CASES RESPONDED BY MISINFORMING THE QUESTIONER. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT WHEN DIRECT INTERVENTION IS NEEDED, VARIATIONS IN THE SITUATIONS DETERMINE THE DEGREE  OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERVENTION. IN OTHER STUDIES, IT WAS FOUND THAT WHEN TWO SUBJECTS KNOW EACH OTHER, THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO RESPOND QUICKLY IN THE SEIZURE EXPERIMENT, AND THAT PREVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE VICTIM, FOR EVEN ONE MINUTE ENCOUNTER, INCREASED RESPONSE SPEED SIGNIFICANTLY. RESULTS ARE USED TO EXPLAIN THE FAILURE OF BYSTANDERS TO HELP IN EMERGENCIES IN LARGE CITIES.

A NEW METHOD FOR SELF-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR CHANGE WAS USED. CONTENT ANALYSIS COMPARISONS OF THE GROUPS REVEALED THREE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES--(1) HIGH-CHANGE SUBJECTS MORE FREQUENTLY STATED GOALS WITH IMPLICIT RECOGNITION THAT THE GOAL HAD NOT YET BEEN ATTAINED, (2) LOW-CHANGE SUBJECTS MORE FREQUENTLY DESCRIBED THEMSELVES WITH LITTLE RECOGNITION OF ALTERNATE POSSIBILITIES, AND (3) LOW-CHANGE SUBJECTS WERE HIGHER IN TENTATIVENESS AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THEMSELVES, EXHIBITING IDENTITY DIFFUSION. THESE FINDINGS WERE CROSS-VALIDATED IN A SECOND  SAMPLE OF STUDENTS WHO WERE SUCCESSFUL (N=9) AND UNSUCCESSFUL (N=22) IN REACHING THEIR CHANGE GOALS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SUCCESSFUL SELF-DIRECTED PERSONAL CHANGE IS MOTIVATED BY AWARENESS OF COGNITIVE DISSONANCE CREATED WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL COMMITS HIMSELF TO A VALUED GOAL PERCEIVED AS DIFFERING FROM HIS PRESENT BEHAVIOR. THE LOW-CHANGE SUBJECT IS ONE WHO DOES NOT CREATE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE IN THE PROCESS OF SETTING PERSONAL GOALS EITHER (1) BECAUSE THE GOAL IS IMPERFECTLY DIFFERENTIATED FROM PRESENT BEHAVIOR, OR (2) BECAUSE HE CAN TOLERATE AN UNUSUALLY GREAT AMOUNT OF INTERNAL SELF CONTRADICTION WITHOUT EXPERIENCING DISSONANCE.

CRONBACH'S THEORETICAL LIMIT FOR A VALIDITY COEFFICIENT OF A TEST IS THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE RELIABILITY COEFFICIENT. GHISELLI, IN REVIEWING HUNDREDS OF VALIDITY STUDIES COMPLETED BETWEEN 1919 AND 1964, FOUND THAT NONE OF HIS FOUR MAJOR CLASSES OF APTITUDE TESTS FORECAST PROFICIENCY ON ANY JOB WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY. ALTHOUGH TESTS CAN HAVE A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH DEGREE OF PREDICTIVE POWER TO BE OF PRACTICAL VALUE IN PERSONNEL SELECTION, THEY MAY ALSO FRUSTRATE THE COUNSELOR'S CHANCES OF HELPING THE CLIENT SOLVE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS. IN ACTUARIAL  INTERPRETATION AND BEHAVIOR PREDICTION BASED ON TEST DATA, GREATER RELIANCE SHOULD BE PLACED ON MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS. RIGOROUS COLLECTION, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING OF PREDICTION AND CRITERION DATA ARE NECESSARY.

ITS CONCERNS ARE WITH EDUCATIONAL PROCESSES THAT MAY BE OBSERVED IN THE CLASSROOM, WITH THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF CLASSROOM EVENTS, WITH THEORY ABOUT THOSE EVENTS, AND WITH DATA BEARING ON THAT THEORY. EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION IS BASED ON VIDEOTAPE RECORDINGS OF LIVE CLASSROOMS. OF THEORETICAL CONCERN ARE CLASSROOMS AND THEIR ACTIVITIES, AND ANALYSIS OF THOSE SOCIAL EVENTS THAT TIE TOGETHER TEACHERS, PUPILS, THEIR TASKS, AND THEIR EQUIPMENT. THIRTY-TWO SEPARATE CLASSROOMS WERE STUDIED, AND THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN THEIR ACTIVITY PATTERNS ARE REPORTED. CLASSROOM EVENTS ARE FOUND TO BE DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECTED BY FOUR INDEPENDENT  VARIABLES--SEX AND AGE OF TEACHER, SUBJECT MATTER, AND GRADE LEVEL. FINDINGS FOR THESE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES ARE BOTH CONTRASTED AND INTERRELATED. FINDINGS ARE ALSO PRESENTED FOR GENERAL ACTIVITY CHARACTERISTICS, COINCIDENTAL ACTIVITY PROPERTIES, AND SEQUENCES OF ACTIVITY EVENTS. (HW)",

IT EXAMINES THE ROLE, ACTIVITIES, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS IN NEW YORK STATE. THREE DIRECT APPROACHES (QUESTIONNAIRE, INTERVIEW, AND ACTIVITY LOG) AND TWO INDIRECT APPROACHES (PUBLICATIONS LISTING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, THE BACKGROUNDS OF THEIR PRESIDENTS, AND OUTSIDE JUDGMENTS OF THE PRESIDENT'S OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS) WERE USED TO SECURE INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORK AND ATTITUDES OF THE PRESIDENTS. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE RECEIVED FROM 185 PRESIDENTS, INTERVIEWS WERE HELD WITH 31 OF THESE PRESIDENTS, AND ACTIVITY LOGS WERE RECEIVED FROM 24 OF THOSE INTERVIEWED. FOUR RELATED TOPICS CONCERNING THE  PRESIDENTS ARE EXAMINED--(1) WHAT PRESIDENTS ACTUALLY DO ON THEIR JOBS, (2) THE PREPARATION AND CAREER PATTERNS OF COLLEGE PRESIDENTS, (3) THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PERFORMANCE IN THE POSITION, AND (4) HOW PRESIDENTS ARE RECRUITED AND SELECTED. RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOW THAT THE PRESIDENTS OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN NEW YORK STATE ACCEPT LEADERSHIP AS THEIR FIRST RESPONSIBILITY, BUT THEIR REPORTS OF THEIR ACTIVITIES, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND PROBLEMS LEAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THEIR ABILITY AND THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THIS RESPONSIBILITY. SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY. (HW)",

THE STUDY CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS--(1) A LONGITUDINAL STUDY WHICH FOLLOWED A 1964-65 GEORGIA BEGINNING-TEACHER POPULATION FOR THREE YEARS, AND (2) AN INTENSIVE STUDY WHICH COMPARED CHARACTERISTICS AND PERFORMANCES OF SAMPLES OF BEGINNING TEACHERS. PART II TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PROFESSIONAL TEACHERS DO NOT DIFFER FROM PROVISIONAL TEACHERS IN SELECTED CRITERIA. A CONCEPTUAL MODEL WAS PROPOSED THAT PROFESSIONAL TEACHERS DIFFERED FROM PROVISIONAL TEACHERS (1) VERY MUCH ON &quot;CHOICE OF VOCATION&quot; FACTORS, (2) SOMEWHAT LESS ON &quot;TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM&quot; PERCEPTIONS, (3)  VERY LITTLE ON REACTIONS TO FIRST-YEAR TEACHING EXPERIENCES, AND (4) VERY MUCH ON &quot;FUTURE PLANS&quot; OPINIONS. THE MODEL WAS CONFIRMED IN BOTH LONGITUDINAL AND INTENSIVE STUDIES. IN PART II, THE MAIN VARIABLES WERE FOUND TO BE TEACHER SEX, CERTIFICATE STATUS, TEACHING FIELD, AND PLACE OF TRAINING. PROFESSIONAL TEACHERS WERE RATED BY TRAINED OBSERVERS AS MORE SYSTEMATIC-RESPONSIBLE, MORE SKILLED IN THE USE OF TEACHING MEDIA, MORE COMPETENT IN NONSPECIFIC TEACHING BEHAVIOR, AND GENERALLY MORE COMPETENT. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICES AND RESEARCH ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. (HW)",

DURING THE FIRST YEAR, EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS OF 78 PARENTS EACH WERE SELECTED AND RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO SUBGROUPS BASED ON THE VOCATIONAL PLACEMENT OF THEIR CHILDREN. AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM OF GROUP LECTURES AND DISCUSSIONS WAS PROVIDED FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. BECAUSE OF POOR ATTENDANCE BY PARENTS DURING THE FIRST YEAR, METHODS OF MOTIVATING PARENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM WERE STUDIED. THE SECOND YEAR, 28 SETS OF LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS (SES)  PARENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO INCENTIVE GROUPS RECEIVING AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, GROUP ONE RECEIVED A $50 BONUS, GROUP TWO CHOSE AN INCENTIVE UNDER $50 IN VALUE, GROUP THREE PARTICIPATED IN A TELEVISION DRAWING, AND GROUP FOUR RECEIVED NO INCENTIVE. GROUP FIVE RECEIVED NEITHER EDUCATION NOR INCENTIVE. AN UPPER SES GROUP RECEIVED THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM BUT NO INCENTIVE. THE THIRD YEAR SAMPLE WAS COMPOSED OF PARENTS OF 165 RETARDED YOUNG ADULTS ASSIGNED TO A PARENT EDUCATION MEETING GROUP, A TELEPHONE GROUP, OR A CONTROL GROUP. CLIENTS AND FAMILIES CONTINUED TO RECEIVE SERVICE FROM AGENCIES BUT THE TWO EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS WERE GIVEN THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. PRE- AND POST-OBSERVER RATINGS WERE USED TO ASSESS THE WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE PROGRAM.  RESULTS OF ALL THREE STUDIES WERE INCONCLUSIVE. PARENT PARTICIPATION IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM REMAINED POOR ALL THREE YEARS. INCENTIVE METHODS TRIED DURING THE SECOND YEAR WERE INEFFECTIVE AT INCREASING ATTENDANCE FOR THE MAJORITY OF PARENTS OF LOW SES STATUS. PARENT PARTICIPATION AND VOCATIONAL ADJUSTMENT WERE RATED DURING THE THIRD YEAR. RATARDATES WHOSE PARENTS WERE CONTACTED SIX OR MORE TIMES BY TELEPHONE GAINED IN WORK ADJUSTMENT RATINGS AND THOSE WHOSE PARENTS ATTENDED SEVEN OR MORE PARTICIPATION GROUP MEETINGS DETERIORATED IN THE RATINGS.

QUESTIONNAIRES ANSWERED BY THE WOMEN, SCHOOL RECORDS, INTERVIEWS WITH SOME OF THE WOMEN, THEIR PARENTS, AND THEIR CURRENT EMPLOYERS WERE USED TO COLLECT DATA. INFORMATION ON MARITAL, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, EDUCATIONAL, AND VOCATIONAL STATUS, EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND, AND COMMUNICATIVE FUNCTIONING ON THE JOB IS PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORM. RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOW THAT THE DEAF WOMAN WHO WORKS PARALLELS HER HEARING PEERS IN TRAINING STATUS  AND EXPECTATIONS RELATING TO HER JOB. ACADEMICALLY TRAINED DEAF WOMEN DIFFER FROM THE VOCATIONALLY TRAINED IN OCCUPATIONAL STATUS, JOB GOALS, SOCIAL SKILLS, AND JOB MOBILITY. THE SCHOOL PLAYS A DUAL ROLE--(1) FOR THE ACADEMIC GROUP, SKILLS IN LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION, AND GENERAL OCCUPATIONAL AWARENESS WERE MOST BENEFICIAL AND (2) FOR THE VOCATIONAL GROUP, SPECIFIC JOB SKILLS WERE MOST IMPORTANT. PROBLEMS IN OCCUPATIONAL ADJUSTMENT CENTERED AROUND WORKING CONDITIONS AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, ALTHOUGH ON THE WHOLE BOTH THE DEAF WOMEN AND THEIR EMPLOYERS WERE MUTUALLY SATISFIED.

THE 36 CHILDREN SELECTED FOR THIS STUDY WERE IN GRADES 2, 4, AND 6 IN THE KENNEDY SCHOOL IN DAYTON, OHIO. ALL HAD SEVERE AUDITORY HANDICAPS AND WERE 10 TO 16 YEARS OLD. FOUR PSYCHOLOGISTS ADMINISTERED THE FOLLOWING TESTS--(1) LEITER INTERNATIONAL PERFORMANCE SCALE (LIPS), (2) GREY STANDARDIZED ORAL READING PARAGRAPHS, (3) BENDER VISUAL-MOTOR GESTALT, (4) WECHSLER INTELLIGENCE SCALE FOR CHILDREN (WISC) PERFORMANCE SCALE, (5) WIDE RANGE ACHIEVEMENT TEST (WRAT), AND (6) KNOX CUBE TEST FROM THE GRACE ARTHUR PERFORMANCE SCALE. ALL CHILDREN WERE ALSO GIVEN THE METROPOLITAN ACHIEVEMENT TEST (MAT), FORM B (1959). THE BENDER GESTALT RESULTS WERE DISCARDED  FOR NONRELEVANCY TO THE FACTORS UNDER STUDY. RESULTS INDICATED THAT (1) THE LEITER IQ SCORE WAS 15 TO 20 POINTS LOWER THAN THE WISC PERFORMANCE IQ SCORE (79-06), (2) THE GROUP APPEARED TO BE 3 YEARS OVERAGE FOR THEIR ACTUAL GRADE PLACEMENT BASED ON MAT SCORES. THE PEARSON PRODUCT MOMENT COEFFICIENT OF CORRELATION REVEALED SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN--(1) LEITER AND GROUP READING TEST SCORES (.01 LEVEL), (2) KNOX CUBE, WITH INDIVIDUAL READING (.01 LEVEL), (3) LEITER WITH THE INDIVIDUAL READING SCORES (.01 LEVEL), (4) LEITER AND WISC PERFORMANCE (.01), AND (5) WISC PERFORMANCE SCALE AND INDIVIDUAL READING (.05 LEVEL). IN THE THIRD ANALYSIS OF DATA, MULTIPLE CORRELATIONS USING AIKEN'S NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF REGRESSION ARE PRESENTED TABULARLY. SOME CONCLUSIONS ARE (1) THE LEITER MENTAL  AGE GRADE PLACEMENT SCORE IS THE SINGLE BEST PREDICTOR OF SUCCESS IN THE LANGUAGE ARTS FOR DEAF CHILDREN IN THE ELEMENTARY GRADES, (2) THE KNOX CUBE RAW SCORE IS THE SINGLE BEST PREDICTOR OF SUCCESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF WORD RECOGNITION SKILLS AND ORAL LANGUAGE IN DEAF CHILDREN IN THE ELEMENTARY GRADES, AND (3) A COMPLETE EVALUATION SHOULD INCLUDE THE LEITER, KNOX CUBE, AND WISC PERFORMANCE SCALES.

FORMS WERE CONSTRUCTED TO MEASURE (1) AUDITORY RECEPTION, (2) LIPREADING AND LISTENING, (3) LIPREADING ONLY, (4) FINGERSPELLING, AND (5) LANGUAGE OF SIGNS. EACH FORM HAD 5 SUBPARTS (1) VOCABULARY, (2) SIMPLE SENTENCES, (3) STORIES, (4) NARRATIONS, AND (5) RANDOM SENTENCES AND PHRASES. THE SCALE (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FIRST FORM WHICH COULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED AS A GROUP TEST) WAS GIVEN TO 417 SUBJECTS. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TEST RESULTS AND AGE, NUMBER OF YEARS IN SCHOOL, IQ, ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES, PARAGRAPH MEANING SCORES, DEAFNESS OF RELATIVES, STATUS OF HEARING LOSS, AND SCHOOL ENTRANCE AGE WERE INVESTIGATED. TEST  RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH TEACHER RATINGS AS A CRITERION MEASURE. TWO VARIMAX ROTATED FACTOR MATRICES WERE OBTAINED FROM EACH OF THE TWO SCHOOLS IN THE STUDY. ONE USED THE SUBTESTS AS FACTORS. THE OTHER USED THE TOTAL SCORE FOR THE ENTIRE FORM AS A FACTOR. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE TWO LIPREADING FORMS WERE VALID USING THE CRITERION OF TEACHERS' RATINGS. HOWEVER, THE &quot;LIPREADING ONLY&quot; FORM WAS NOT FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE &quot;LIPREADING AND LISTENING&quot; FORM. THE AUTHOR RECOMMENDED ELIMINATING THE FORMER. PERFORMANCE ON THE FINGERSPELLING AND LANGUAGE OF SIGNS FORMS WAS MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO AGE, YEARS IN SCHOOL, AND ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES THAN TO TEACHER RATINGS. IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT BETTER CRITERIA FOR RATING ABILITY IN FINGERSPELLING AND THE LANGUAGE OF SIGNS BE  FOUND SINCE TEACHER RATINGS OF THESE ITEMS WERE MORE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH AGE, YEARS IN SCHOOL, AND DEAFNESS OF RELATIVES THAN WITH PERFORMANCE ON THESE ITEMS. ANALYSIS OF DATA INDICATED THAT SUBPARTS ONE, TWO, AND FIVE WERE EVALUATING THE SAME FACTOR AND PARTS THREE AND FOUR ANOTHER. IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT PARTS ONE, TWO, AND FIVE BE COMBINED AND AND THAT EITHER PART THREE OR PART FOUR BE ELIMINATED. NO RELIABILITY INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AS YET.

        "description":"THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN OHIO'S PROGRAMS FOR PARTIALLY SEEING CHILDREN AND THE PROBLEMS OF INCIDENCE, VISUAL FUNCTIONING, AND MULTIPLE HANDICAPS. PARTIALLY SEEING CHILDREN IDENTIFIED BY THE STUDY HAD A VISUAL ACUITY AFTER CORRECTION OF 20/70 OR LESS AND/OR CORRECTION OF MORE THAN 10 DIOPTERS OF MYOPIA. THE SCHOOL NURSES IN COLUMBUS PUBLIC SCHOOLS SCREENED THE 23,611 FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH GRADE CHILDREN FOR VISUAL ACUITY. OF THE 214 CHILDREN SUSPECTED OF BEING PARTIALLY SEEING, 168 RECEIVED PARENTAL APPROVAL FOR OPHTHALMOLOGICAL AND OPTOMETRIC EXAMINATIONS. THE 36 CHILDREN IDENTIFIED AS PARTIALLY SEEING RECEIVED PEDIATRIC, NEUROLOGICAL, ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. OF THESE 36 CHILDREN, 25 WERE ALREADY IN CLASSES FOR  PARTIALLY SEEING. FINDINGS SUGGEST AN INCIDENCE OF BETWEEN .15 AND .20 PERCENT. MANY OF THE PARTIALLY SEEING CHILDREN HAD ADDITIONAL PHYSICAL OR MENTAL IMPAIRMENTS. ONLY 17 PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN HAD REFRACTIVE ERRORS. THE MEAN AVERAGE IQ ON INDIVIDUAL INTELLIGENCE TESTS WAS AT THE LOW AVERAGE LEVEL. MEAN ACHIEVEMENT WAS BELOW GRADE LEVEL EXPECTANCY. RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMS WHICH COMBINE LARGE TYPE AND BRAILLE STUDENTS, ELIMINATION OF THE 10 DIOPTERS OF MYOPIA AS A SOLE CRITERIA IN REFERRAL, AND EMPHASIS ON EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND REGISTRATION OF PARTIALLY SIGHTED CHILDREN. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH THE DIVISION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO STUDIES OF INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS AND THE CHILDREN'S NEEDS AND TO COMPARABLE STUDY IN A RURAL COMMUNITY AND A CITY  LIKE COLUMBUS IN A STATE OTHER THAN OHIO. OTHER CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE LISTED. GRAPHS AND TABLES ARE INCLUDED. THE APPENDIX DISPLAYS STATE STANDARDS AND FORMS, TOGETHER WITH FORMS USED IN THE STUDY.

THE COURSE CONSISTED OF A BASIC PROGRAM TO AID BLIND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES TO PREPARE FOR COLLEGE THROUGH PERSONAL ADJUSTMENT AND ORIENTATION TRAINING. BASIC TRAINING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM WERE CHOSEN FOR THEIR REHABILITATIVE VALUE RATHER THAN FOR ACADEMIC OR VOCATIONAL VALUE. ACTIVITIES INCLUDED INSTRUCTION IN COMMUNICATION SKILLS, MANUAL SKILLS, SOCIAL SKILLS, GROUP ACTIVITY, PERSONAL MANAGEMENT, ORIENTATION AND MOBILITY, AND GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING. THE CONTROL GROUP OF 49 SUBJECTS (MEAN AGE OF 18 YEARS) DID NOT RECEIVE THE COLLEGE PREPARATION TRAINING. THE CONTROL  GROUP INCLUDED FEWER SUBJECTS THAN THE TOTALLY BLIND GROUP AND MORE PARTIALLY SIGHTED SUBJECTS. MEAN IQ WAS 119 FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 121 FOR THE CONTROL GROUP. FOLLOWUP DATA WERE COLLECTED ON BOTH GROUPS FROM CASEWORK FILES AND PERSONAL INTERVIEWS OF STUDENTS AND COLLEGE STAFF PERSONNEL. SEVENTY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES LOCATED IN 20 STATES WERE INVOLVED. COMPARISONS MADE INCLUDED ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, MANNERISMS, ADAPTATIONS, NOTETAKING, METHODS OF TAKING EXAMINATIONS, WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS, READING, CLASS PARTICIPATION, EFFECT OF VISUAL AIDS, LABORATORY COURSES, LIBRARY USAGE, MOBILITY, SOCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ADJUSTMENT, FACULTY ACCEPTANCE, AND COMPARISON WITH OTHER HANDICAPPED STUDENTS. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS SUPERIOR IN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, THAT  ITS MEMBERS CONTINUED COLLEGE ATTENDANCE LONGER, AND THAT ON THE AVERAGE FEWER SEMESTERS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE WORK FOR COLLEGE GRADUATION.

        "description":"AN AUTOMATED INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED TO TEACH BEGINNING READING TO HEARING IMPAIRED CHILDREN USING A NON-ORAL METHOD. INSTRUCTION WAS DONE WITH VISUAL PRESENTATION USING 35MM SLIDES ON A REAR PROJECTION SCREEN. THIS TEACHING MACHINE, THE HONEYWELL UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA INSTRUCTIONAL DEVICE (HUMID) WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH AN AUTOMATIC DATA RECORDER AND PRINTOUT DEVICE. THE FIRST OF THREE STUDIES DISCOVERED THAT INSTRUMENTATION AND PROGRAMING NEEDED TO BE IMPROVED. TWO PRELIMINARY STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED. THE THIRD STUDY INVOLVED ONE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP OF 10 FIRST-GRADERS AND ONE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP OF TEN 9 AND 10 YEAR OLDS ENROLLED IN CLASSES FOR THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING. CONTROL GROUPS WERE MATCHED FOR IQ, AGE, SEX, HEARING AND LANGUAGE PERFORMANCE. OVER A PERIOD OF  35 DAYS, 34 PROGRAMS WERE TAUGHT TO THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS. TESTING DID NOT REVEAL ANY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS, ALTHOUGH THE OLDER GROUP PERFORMED CONSISTENTLY BETTER THAN THE YOUNGER GROUP. ON THE HUMID POST-TEST, THE FIRST-GRADERS PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER (AT THE .01 LEVEL) THAN THEIR CONTROL GROUP. THE OLDER GROUP ALSO PERFORMED BETTER THAN ITS CONTROL GROUP, ALTHOUGH THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. ON THE STANFORD ACHIEVEMENT TEST SUBTESTS OF WORD MEANING AND PARAGRAPH MEANING GIVEN TO ALL FOUR GROUPS, ONLY THE YOUNGER GROUP SURPASSED THEIR CONTROLS AT A LEVEL WHICH APPROACHED SIGNIFICANCE. THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE OLDER EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS. ALTHOUGH AN  AUTOMATED SYSTEM OF NON-ORAL READING INSTRUCTION CAN BE DEVELOPED SUCCESSFULLY, IT WOULD INVOLVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PROGRAMING. THE HUMID STAFF ESTIMATES THAT TO BRING DEAF CHILDREN FROM BEGINNING READING TO FOURTH GRADE READING WOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN 800 PROGRAMS OF 30 TO 40 FRAMES EACH AND MUST ALSO BE ACCOMPANIED BY A SYSTEMATIC PROGRAM OF LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. FIVE STUDIES WERE CARRIED OUT WITHIN THIS PROJECT BY GRADUATE STUDENTS. THE MAJOR FINDING WAS THAT DATA ON THE RESPONSE DELAYS HAS LIMITED USEFULNESS WITH THIS METHOD OF TEACHING READING. PROGRAMING TECHNIQUES, CONTENT OF PROGRAMS, AND INFORMATION ON THE TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT OF HUMID ARE PRESENTED. REFERENCE LIST CITES 34 ITEMS. (MW)",

IN PHASE II, TEACHERS IN A NATIONAL \"ACCIDENTAL\" SAMPLE ANSWERED A QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY THEIR AREAS OF INTEREST IN TEACHER EDUCATION. OVER 1100 RESPONDENTS EMPHASIZED THEIR INTEREST IN LEARNING MOTIVATION AND HELPING CHILDREN LEARN TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY. THUS, PHASE III WAS THE PRODUCTION OF A SAMPLE FILM IN THE PROPOSED TV SERIES FOR  TEACHERS, ORGANIZED AROUND TEACHING PROBLEMS RATHER THAN CURRICULUM. USING A GRADE 3 SCIENCE CLASS AND A GRADE 9 GEOGRAPHY CLASS, THE FILM DEMONSTRATES EFFECTIVE TEACHING TECHNIQUES. THE STUDY RECOMMENDS A WEEKLY, FLEXIBLE-FORMAT TV SERIES TO DISCUSS EDUCATIONAL INNOVATIONS USEFUL TO TEACHERS AT ALL GRADE LEVELS AND IN ALL SUBJECT AREAS. APPENDICES PRESENT 58 ABSTRACTS OF INNOVATIONAL PROJECTS, QUESTIONNAIRES, AND THE FILM TRANSCRIPT. (LH)",

SCALES. EACH OF 35 S.D. SCALES, WHICH WERE LOADED ON 4 VISUAL MEDIUM FACTORS, WAS USED TO DEVELOP A COMPARISON TEST OF LIKERT TYPE (LT) SCALES. THEN 4 GROUPS, TOTALING 253 SUBJECTS, EACH EVALUATED 3 STATEMENTS FROM A DIFFERENT MEDIUM AND A DIFFERENT CONCEPT. TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SD RESULTS COULD BE REPLICATED WITHOUT A PAPER AND PENCIL TEST, A SEMANTIC SPACE  ANALYZER (SSA) WAS DEVELOPED. IT PRESENTED THE SD SCALES ON SLIDES, AND 87 SUBJECTS RESPONDED ON A POTENTIOMETER. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE AND CORRELATIONAL ANALYSIS OF MEAN SCORES ON THE 3 TESTS SHOWED THAT THE CORRELATIONS WERE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT. FACTOR ANALYSIS OF THE SD, LT, AND SSA SCALES YIELDED 2 MAJOR FACTORS WHICH APPEARED CONSISTENTLY WITH DIFFERENT MEDIA AND DIFFERENT TESTS.

ALTHOUGH THE USE OF DIALOGUES AND PATTERN PRACTICE EXERCISES MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO VOCALIZE AND EVEN ANALOGIZE TO A FAIRLY HIGH DEGREE, IT IS FAR LESS SUCCESSFUL IN THE AREA OF AUDIO-COMPREHENSION. THE ASSUMPTION THAT A MARKED  IMPROVEMENT IN SPEAKING WILL RESULT IN A CONCOMITANT IMPROVEMENT IN LISTENING--IF NOT IN READING AND WRITING--IS NOT NECESSARILY BORNE OUT. REAL MASTERY OF A FOREIGN LANGUAGE INVOLVES SEVERAL SUCCESSIVE BREAKTHROUGHS, EACH OF WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY AN ACCELERATED SPURT OF LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY. THERE APPEAR TO BE AT LEAST THREE SUCCESSIVE PROFICIENCY LEVELS--THE PRE-NUCLEATION STAGE, THE POST-NUCLEATION STAGE, AND THE MASTERY STAGE. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE RIGHT NOW SHOULD BE TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT MATERIALS AND THE RIGHT LEARNING CONDITIONS WHICH WILL ENABLE THE LANGUAGE STUDENT TO REACH THE POST-NUCLEATION STAGE. WHAT IS ADVOCATED IS NUCLEATION FIRST, THEN NEAR-NATIVE LISTENING AND READING COMPREHENSION. THE POST-NUCLEATION EMPHASIS ON COMPREHENSION HAS OTHER IMPLICATIONS. IN THE CASE OF  READING, THE USE OF AN ENGLISH CRUTCH FAVORS A SMOOTHER TRANSITION TO LIBERATED READING THAN THE &quot;HUNT AND PICK&quot; METHOD, WHICH IS CLOSER AKIN TO PUZZLE SOLVING. IN ITS PRESENT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, THE AUDIOLINGUAL APPROACH IS FAR MORE LINGUAL THAN IT IS AUDIO. THE MOST UNDER-ESTIMATED AND LEAST UNDERSTOOD ASPECT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE LEARNING TODAY IS AUDIO-COMPREHENSION.

THE ILP PLANNED TO ACHIEVE ITS DUAL OBJECTIVES OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENT THROUGH A CHRONOLOGICALLY CONCEIVED SERIES OF  ACTIVITIES. ONCE A GENERALLY FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT IN THE STATE HAD BEEN CREATED IN WHICH ILP'S EXPANDED PROGRAM OF ACTIVITIES COULD THRIVE, IT BEGAN TO TRAIN LOCAL LEADERSHIP TO TAKE OVER EVENTUALLY MOST OF THE MANY NEW PROJECTS. IN THE FUTURE IT WILL CONCENTRATE ON SOLVING SUCH PROBLEMS AS TEACHER TRAINING, FLES, THE LANGUAGE LABORATORY, PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION, AND ARTICULATION IN A PROGRAM EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL LEVELS OF INSTRUCTION OF A PROGRESSIVELY INCREASING NUMBER OF TARGET LANGUAGES. IF ALL GOES AS PLANNED THE ILP HOPES, BY 1972, TO PHASE OUT OF THE TOTAL PROGRAM IN FAVOR OF LOCAL LEADERSHIP.

        "description":"ARTICULATION PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY A 3-YEAR STUDY OF STUDENTS WHO HAD BEGUN THEIR LANGUAGE STUDY IN AN ARIZONA HIGH SCHOOL AND CONTINUED THE STUDY OF THE SAME LANGUAGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA. PROBLEMS INCLUDE AN ADMINISTRATION POLICY WHICH PERMITS MOST UNIVERSITY STUDENTS TO REPEAT LANGUAGE STUDY AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION, POOR HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION, LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND AGREEMENT ON GOALS AND METHODS AMONG FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHERS, AND THE INTERRUPTION IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY WHICH OFTEN OCCURS BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING LANGUAGE STUDY AND ARTICULATION INCLUDE ELIMINATING THE UNIVERSITY POLICY ON REPEATING AND REPLACING IT WITH A SYSTEM OF PLACEMENT TESTING USING THE MLA COOPERATIVE FOREIGN LANGUAGE TESTS, OR SIMILAR  TESTS. COMMUNICATION AMONG TEACHERS COULD BE IMPROVED BY AN ACTIVE PROFESSIONAL FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHER ORGANIZATION, AND A COMMON SET OF PROFESSIONAL OBJECTIVES SHOULD BE AGREED UPON. MEETINGS BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL SUPERVISORS AND LANGUAGE DEPARTMENT CHAIRMEN IN STATE COLLEGES ALSO COULD PROVIDE IMPETUS AND DIRECTION FOR BETTER ARTICULATION. MORE ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO THE TRAINING OF LANGUAGE TEACHERS, AND THE STATE SHOULD STRENGTHEN TEACHER CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PROFESSIONAL FOREIGN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATIONS AND COUNSELING PERSONNEL (HIGH AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL), TO PREVENT INTERRUPTION OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY, WOULD FURTHER ALLEVIATE THE SITUATION. THIS SPEECH WAS DELIVERED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ARIZONA FOREIGN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION, UNIVERSITY OF  ARIZONA, TUCSON, NOVEMBER 4, 1967. (AF)",

PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING WHO MIGHT ATTEND VARIED AMONG THE COLLEGES, AND IN MOST CASES SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION. POLICIES OR PLANS TO DETERMINE FREQUENCY OF ATTENDANCE WERE GENERALLY LACKING, ALTHOUGH FUNDS WERE BUDGETED IN ALL BUT FOUR COLLEGES. THE RANGE OF BUDGET ALLOTMENTS WAS $700 TO $13,640, WITH LITTLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COLLEGE SIZE AND BUDGET PROVISION FOR THIS PURPOSE. GENERALLY, DISTRICTS PAID CONFERENCE  EXPENSES, EVEN WHEN OVERNIGHT LODGING WAS NOT REQUIRED. VARIATIONS EXISTED IN CLASS COVERAGE FOR TEACHERS ATTENDING CONFERENCES, WITH MOST USING OTHER FACULTY MEMBERS AS SUBSTITUTES. POST-CONFERENCE REPORTING PRACTICES VARIED.

THE REPORT FURTHER CONSIDERS THE CRITICAL SIZE OF THE STAFF AND EQUIPMENT EXPENDITURES, COMPARES IT WITH GRADUATE LEVEL INSTITUTIONS WHERE STAFF IS ENGAGED IN SEPARATELY BUDGETED  RESEARCH, THE NUMBER AND QUALIFICATIONS OF A REPRESENTATIVE STAFF, AND THE USE OF NONSPECIALISTS. IN SPITE OF HIRING DIFFICULTIES DUE TO LOW PAY AND LITTLE PRESTIGE, STAFF QUALIFICATIONS APPEAR TO BE IMPROVING, AS SHOWN BY THE INCREASE IN ADVANCED DEGREES. THE PRACTICE OF HIRING FOR ALL BUDGETED POSITIONS WHATEVER CANDIDATES ARE AVAILABLE, HOWEVER, MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE TRUE SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED TEACHERS. QUESTIONS STILL TO BE RESOLVED, IN LIGHT OF THE HETEROGENEOUS OFFERINGS OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE, ARE WHETHER SCARCE SCIENTIFIC STAFF RESOURCES ARE BEING DISSIPATED AND WHICH KINDS OF SCIENCE COURSES ARE MOST APPROPRIATE TO THIS SEGMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

        "description":"AN APPRAISAL OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE AS A \"SECOND-CHANCE\" INSTITUTION PRESENTS CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE OF SUCCESSFUL SALVAGING OF THE ABLE STUDENT. THE FAILURE OF THE STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY MAY BE DUE TO (1) EMOTIONAL IMMATURITY, (2) INABILITY TO ADJUST TO THE COMPLEXITY AND IMPERSONALITY OF THE LARGE CAMPUS, (3) LACK OF SOUND COUNSELING, OR (4) DEFICIENCY IN A BASIC SKILL SUCH AS READING. SINCE THE UNIVERSITY ADMITS ONLY SUPERIOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES, THE JUNIOR COLLEGES RUN NO ACADEMIC RISK IN ACCEPTING THEM, ALTHOUGH THEY FOLLOW DIFFERENT POLICIES FOR SUCH ADMISSIONS. SOME ADMIT THE STUDENTS AUTOMATICALLY, BUT OTHERS DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THOSE ON PROBATION AND THOSE DISMISSED. SOME REQUIRE A 1-SEMESTER LAYOUT, AND OTHERS RESTRICT THE UNIT LOAD. IN ONE SURVEY, JUNIOR COLLEGE  PRESIDENTS SUBMITTED INFORMATION ON NEARLY 300 SUCH STUDENTS WHO WERE CURRENTLY DOING WELL. FROM THIS IT APPEARS THAT THE JUNIOR COLLEGES ARE PERFORMING A VITAL COMMUNITY SERVICE AND IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT FURTHER INSTITUTIONAL STUDIES WILL BE CONDUCTED ON THE SECOND-CHANCE STUDENT.

IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE STUDENTS DID NOT LOOK ON THE PROGRAM AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ANYTHING OR  TO FORM A BASIS FOR A CHOICE BETWEEN COLLEGE OR SOME OTHER ACTIVITY, AND ALSO THAT THEY HAD NO ALTERNATIVE PLAN IN CASE OF FAILURE TO MEET COLLEGE ENTRANCE STANDARDS. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDED (1) AN EXTENSION FROM SIX TO NINE OR MORE WEEKS, (2) A REDUCTION IN DIFFICULTY IN THE MATHEMATICS COURSE, (3) ADDITION OF A COLLEGE ORIENTATION COURSE, (4) A STUDY OF SIMILAR REMEDIAL PROGRAMS AT OTHER COLLEGES, (5) THE USE OF VOLUNTEER FACULTY, (6) A TRIAL OF SMALL LABORATORY OR SEMINAR CLASSES, AND (7) EXTENSION OF LIBRARY HOURS FOR STUDY.

IT WAS FOUND THAT INFORMATION ON THESE 3 AREAS COULD BE OBTAINED MOST RELIABLY BY MEASURING INTELLIGENCE AND ACHIEVEMENT BY (1) THE STANFORD-BINET, (2) THE PRESCHOOL INVENTORY, AND (3) THE DRAW-A-PERSON AND BY MEASURING BEHAVIOR AND ADJUSTMENT TO SCHOOL BY (1) CERTAIN ITEMS OF THE READINESS CHECKLIST, (2) CERTAIN ITEMS OF THE FACE SHEET OF THE STANFORD-BINET, AND (3) THE BEHAVIOR INVENTORY. IN A SUBSEQUENT STUDY COMPARING THE SCORES ON VARIOUS TESTS OF THESE HEADSTART CHILDREN WITH NON-HEADSTART CHILDREN WHEN IN KINDERGARTEN, NO DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN GROUPS IN ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT.

THE HS GROUP OF 125 WAS SELECTED FROM 8 SAMPLE CENTERS. AN INTENSIVE SAMPLE OF 50 CHILDREN WAS USED FOR A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF HOW THIS GROUP MOVED FROM ONE LEVEL OF A CONCEPT TO ANOTHER. THE EXTENSIVE SAMPLE SHOWED HOW THE CHILD REACTED TO ACADEMICALLY RELATED MATERIAL AS MEASURED BY THESE CONCEPTS. TEACHER INTERVIEWS AND EVENT SAMPLING IN THE CLASSROOM WERE THE 2 RATING APPROACHES. (2) PRELIMINARY RESULTS PERTAINING TO THE HS AND NHS CHILDREN WERE FOUND. AN ANALYSIS  SUGGESTED THAT HS CHILDREN WERE EXCEEDING THE NHS CHILDREN IN CONCEPT ATTAINMENT EVEN IN THOSE AREAS IN WHICH SIGNIFICANCE WAS NOT ACHIEVED. (3) A FULL REPORT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HS PARENTS AS ADMINISTRATORS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS WAS MADE. SEVEN PARENTS (4 NEGRO AND 3 WHITE), WITH FROM NINTH TO TWELFTH GRADE EDUCATIONS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM AMONG 30 VOLUNTEERS. CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY GRADUATE STUDENTS WHO SERVED AS CONTROL TEST ADMINISTRATORS WERE ALL WHITE AND WERE GENERALLY EXPERIENCED IN TESTING PROCEDURES. FOUR TABLES WERE USED TO COMPARE RESULTS OF PARENT TESTERS AND GRADUATE STUDENT TESTERS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE RESULTED NOT FROM THE TESTER, BUT FROM THE TIME OR ORDER THE PRE-SCHOOL INVENTORY TEST WAS GIVEN. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT UNTRAINED PEOPLE MAY BE UTILIZED  FOR TESTING IF THEY ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED.

THE 3 TREATMENTS WERE INTRODUCED IN A STAGGERED ORDER, NOT ALL AT ONE TIME. STUDENTS WERE OBSERVED DURING MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, AND SOCIAL STUDIES CLASSES BUT ONLY THE MATHEMATICS CLASS HAD AN INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION ORIENTATION. MEASURING INSTRUMENTS WERE DESIGNED TO QUANTIFY PUPIL BEHAVIOR. NINE HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED. FOUR WERE REJECTED, 5 WERE NOT. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT MORE SELF-INITIATED BEHAVIOR WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE INDIVIDUALIZED MATHEMATICS CLASS THAN BY THE TEACHER-DOMINATED SCIENCE AND SOCIAL STUDIES CLASSES.

ARE THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE. FIFTY-ONE SLUM INFANTS AND A CONTROL GROUP OF 51 NON-SLUM INFANTS IN CHAMPAIGN-URBANA, ILLINOIS WERE TESTED IN THEIR 7TH, 11TH, 15TH, 18TH, AND 22ND MONTHS BY 3 SUB-SCALES OF THE INFANT PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT SCALE, AND 3 OTHER MEASURES OF DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, EACH INFANT WAS HOME TESTED BY AN EXAMINER WHOSE NOTES WERE LATER TRANSLATED INTO A 4-POINT SCORING SYSTEM AND ADDED TO INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE INFANT'S MOTHER. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING THE SIGN TEST, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOME  STIMULATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL ITEMS WAS ANALYZED THROUGH POINT-BISERIAL CORRELATIONS. RESULTS INDICATED THAT SLUM INFANTS SHOW SLOWER DEVELOPMENT AT A MUCH EARLIER AGE THAN PREVIOUSLY SUSPECTED, SUGGESTING THAT COMPENSATORY PROGRAMS SHOULD START EARLIER THAN 3 YEARS OF AGE. IT ALSO APPEARS THAT, CONTRARY TO ACCEPTED HYPOTHESES, OVER-STIMULATION DURING INFANCY MAY BE MORE DETRIMENTAL THAN UNDER-STIMULATION AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR. THIS PAPER WAS DELIVERED TO THE BIENNIAL MEETING OF THE SOCIETY FOR RESEARCH IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT IN NEW YORK, MARCH 29 - APRIL 1, 1967. (MS)",

CHARACTERISTICS WERE ASSESSED BY MEASURES OF INTELLIGENCE, PERSONALITY FACTORS, AND A PERSONAL INFORMATION QUESTIONNAIRE. SIX PRE- AND POST-TESTS OF CONVERGENT AND 4 TESTS OF DIVERGENT PRODUCTION MEASURED THE GROWTH OF THE GIFTED CHILDREN OVER 1 ACADEMIC YEAR. A SERIES OF MULTIPLE REGRESSION EQUATIONS WAS CALCULATED TO ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHANGES IN THE 23 CLASSES IN THE TEST SCORES AND THE 34 TEACHER, CLASS, AND STUDENT VARIABLES. FOR EACH MEASURE OF CHANGE, ITEMS SIGNIFICANT AT THE 1 PERCENT LEVEL WERE GROUPED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FINAL REGRESSION ANALYSIS LEADING TO AN INFLUENCE PROFILE. IT  WAS FOUND THAT TEACHER PERSONALITY TRAITS WERE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OF THE CHANGE-PRODUCING VARIABLES AND THAT DIFFERENT TYPES OF TEACHERS INFLUENCED DIFFERENT AREAS OF GROWTH. THE CHILDREN'S READING GROWTH RELATED SIGNIFICANTLY TO A TEACHER'S VERBAL I.Q., AND GROWTH IN WRITING RELATED SIGNIFICANTLY TO A TEACHER'S ANNUAL INCOME AND THE NUMBER OF COURSE-WORK HOURS IN THE EDUCATION OF GIFTED CHILDREN. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS PER CLASS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED GROWTH IN MATH. STUDY IMPLICATIONS ARE THAT GIFTED CHILDREN SHOULD BE EXPOSED BOTH TO TEACHERS WHOSE PERSONALITY TRAITS ARE BEST SUITED TO TEACH THE DIVERGENT AREA AND TO THOSE BEST SUITED TO TEACH THE CONVERGENT AREA, WITH TEACHER SELECTION BASED ACCORDINGLY.

EARLY AND CONTEMPORARY STUDIES HAVE BOTH BEEN CONCERNED WITH PROVIDING MORE PRECISE ANALYSES OF STIMULUS AND SITUATIONAL DETERMINANTS OF SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR, ALTHOUGH THE EARLY STUDIES WERE PRIMARILY DESCRIPTIVE WHEREAS THE EMPHASIS TODAY IS ON ANALYTIC STUDIES. TWO IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF STIMULUS-AND-SITUATIONAL-DETERMINANTS RESEARCH ARE (1) THE DEVELOPMENT OF ATTACHMENT BEHAVIOR IN INFANTS (ESPECIALLY TO THE MOTHER) AND (2) THE ROLE OF VARIOUS STIMULUS CUES AS ELICITORS OR REINFORCERS OF BEHAVIOR. INVESTIGATIONS OF APPROACH AND WITHDRAWAL PROCESSES INVOLVE A SECOND MAJOR RESEARCH AREA.  ASPECTS OF APPROACH AND WITHDRAWAL THAT DEAL ESSENTIALLY WITH THE DIRECTIONAL AND AROUSAL CHARACTERISTICS OF INFANT RESPONSES ARE (1) EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOR, (2) CURIOSITY, AND (3) INTRINSIC MOTIVATION. PRESENT RESEARCH PROBLEMS INVOLVE (1) ADEQUATE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF EMOTIONAL PROCESSES EARLY IN LIFE, (2) IDENTIFICATION OF THE BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS OF EMOTIONAL RESPONSES IN INFANTS, AND (3) DETERMINATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES ON SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR.

SAMPLING PROBLEMS ARE ENCOUNTERED BECAUSE OF THE NON-RANDOM VARIATIONS IN HS POPULATIONS AND THE INACCESSIBILITY OF SUITABLE CONTROL GROUPS. THE THIRD PROBLEM IS THAT OF LOGISTIC DIFFICULTIES. IT IS NECESSARY FOR EVALUATIVE PROCEDURES TO BE UNOBTRUSIVE. TYPICAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DISADVANTAGED HOME, LOW LITERACY LEVELS, AND THE PROBLEM OF RAPPORT BETWEEN DISADVANTAGED ADULTS AND MIDDLE-CLASS SCIENTISTS CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOGISTIC DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN GATHERING RESEARCH DATA.

FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS INADEQUACY INCLUDE--(1) LOWER INCOME, (2) SPARSITY OF POPULATION, (3) LOWER EDUCATIONAL LEVELS, AND (4) THE HIGHER COST OF PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN RURAL AREAS. EVEN THOUGH OUTPATIENT CLINICS REPRESENT THE MAJOR MODEL FOR THE CARE AND TREATMENT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF RURAL YOUTH, THE HARD DATA SHOW THAT THESE FACILITIES FREQUENTLY ARE UNAVAILABLE TO THOUSANDS OF RURAL YOUTH, AND WHEN AVAILABLE OFTEN PROVIDE ONLY MINIMAL LEVELS OF TREATMENT. TO COMBAT THESE DEFICIENCIES, THE CONGRESS ENACTED COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH LEGISLATION IN  1964. WHEN THE FULL RANGE AND COMPLEMENT OF SERVICES AND PROGRAMS ENVISAGED BY THIS LEGISLATION ARE OPERATIONAL, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR RURAL YOUTH TO DERIVE OPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS.

THESE RURAL YOUTH ARE CHARACTERIZED AS FOLLOWS--(1) TWO-THIRDS HAD FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL, WITH ONLY 10 PERCENT ACHIEVING A HIGHER LEVEL, (2) 60 PERCENT WERE MALES, AND (3) IN INTERVIEWS ALMOST HALF STATED THEY WERE SEEKING JOBS IN THE CLERICAL, SALES, AND SERVICE AREAS, WHILE MORE THAN TWO-FIFTHS ASPIRED TO MANUAL LABOR TYPE JOBS. LESS THAN TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE APPLICANTS AT THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE RECEIVED JOB REFERRALS, WHICH PROMPTED A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DATA TO DETERMINE THE REASONS FOR THIS POOR RECORD. THE  VARIABLES UTILIZED WERE--SEX, JOB CLASSIFICATIONS, EDUCATION, TIME IN THE CITY, DISTANCE TRAVELED, STATED INTEREST, AND COURSE TAKEN IN HIGH SCHOOL. CONCLUSIONS REACHED FROM THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS INCLUDE--(1) MALES ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN IN THE CITY LONGER THAN FEMALES SEEKING JOBS, (2) MALES ARE MORE LIKELY THAN FEMALES TO FIND JOBS OPEN TO THEM, AND (3) OLDER YOUTH ARE LIKELY TO BE MORE ADVANCED IN SCHOOL, AND THUS HAVE BETTER TRAINING, SPEND MORE TIME IN THE CITY, MIGRATE FARTHER, AND HAVE WIDER JOB INTERESTS.

        "description":"RECENT RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THE EXCESSIVE NATIONAL INDIAN DROPOUT RATE IS NOT WHOLLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE VALUE CONFLICT CREATED WHEN INDIAN YOUTH ENTER THE AMERICAN EDUCATION SYSTEM, BUT IS ALSO RELATED TO THE IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM EXPERIENCED BY THESE YOUNGSTERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO DETERMINE THE POSSIBLE CAUSES OF WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE CROSS-OVER PHENOMENON (AFTER SATISFACTORY ACHIEVEMENT FOR A TIME, A REVERSAL OCCURS AND A STEADY DECLINE IS SHOWN) IN THE EDUCATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF OGLALA SIOUX INDIAN STUDENTS. A TOTAL OF 415 INDIAN AND 223 WHITE STUDENTS FROM EIGHTH, NINTH, AND TWELFTH GRADES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY. ACHIEVEMENT RECORDS FOR THE INDIAN GROUP REVEALED PERFORMANCE ABOVE THE NATIONAL NORMS ON THE CALIFORNIA ACHIEVEMENT TEST FROM THE FOURTH  GRADE TO THE SIXTH GRADE. AT THIS POINT (7TH GRADE) THE INDIAN STUDENTS SUDDENLY BEGIN TO FALL BEHIND IN ACHIEVEMENT. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CONFLICT DURING THE PERIOD OF ADOLESCENCE CAUSES PERSONALITY PROBLEMS WHICH BLOCK EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT. CONSEQUENTLY, THE MINNESOTA MULTIPHASIC PERSONALITY INVENTORY WAS ADMINISTERED TO YOUNGSTERS IN BOTH GROUPS DISCLOSING PSYCHOLOGICAL CONFLICT AMONG MANY OF THE INDIAN YOUTH WHO WERE EXPERIENCING ACHIEVEMENT DIFFICULTIES. AS A RESULT OF THIS RESEARCH, A NEW COURSE CALLED ACCULTURATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR USE WITH INDIAN YOUTH. (ES)",

THE &quot;CYBERNETIC&quot; VIEW PROCEEDS FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT SENSORY FEEDBACK RATHER THAN CONFIRMATION AND REINFORCEMENT IS THE MECHANISM FOR LEARNING FROM PRINTED MATERIALS. A QUESTION MUST PRECEDE THE READING PASSAGE IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL BEHAVIOR. OTHERWISE, THE LEARNER MUST BE ALLOWED TO REVIEW THE MATERIAL AFTER SEEING THE QUESTION. THE EMPHASIS, THEREFORE, IS ON CONTROL AND INTEGRATION OF RESPONSES IN TERMS OF A PRESCRIBED CRITERION, THE QUESTION. IN CONTRAST, THE &quot;MATHEMAGENIC&quot; APPROACH STATES THAT THE ACQUISITION AND  RETENTION OF INFORMATION FROM PRINTED MATERIAL CAN BE RELATED TO ATTENTIVE RESPONSES, CALLED &quot;MATHEMAGENIC RESPONSES,&quot; WHICH ARE CONTROLLED BY TEST-LIKE EVENTS AND THE MATERIAL IN THE PASSAGE WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT CONTROLLING STIMULUS.

THE ITEM EXPOSURE TIME ON THE OTHER EXPERIMENTAL ADMINISTRATION WAS TWO-THIRDS THAT OF THE FORMER, AND IT WAS REGARDED AS THE PACED ADMINISTRATION. IN ADDITION, SUBJECTS WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE A CRITERION SCALE WHICH INVOLVED THEIR RANKING, ACCORDING TO PREFERENCE, THE OCCUPATIONS FOR WHICH SCORES ARE OBTAINED ON THE OII. THE DATA REVEALED THAT THE CRITERION MEASURE WAS RELATIVELY VALID. AN ANALYSIS OF THE DATA SUPPORTED THE BELIEF THAT VOCATIONAL INTEREST INVENTORIES SUCH AS THE OII YIELD SIMILAR SETS OF RANKINGS WHEN ITEMS ARE ADMINISTERED BY PROJECTING THEM ON A SCREEN AND WHEN THEY ARE PRESENTED IN BOOKLET FORM.

TWO CLASSES, EACH OF 24 CHILDREN RANGING IN AGE FROM 3-8 TO 5-7, ATTENDED PRESCHOOL CLASSES FOR TWO AND ONE-HALF HOURS DAILY AT THE MCKINLEY SCHOOL IN YORK, PENNSYLVANIA. INSTRUCTIONAL CONTENT, TEACHING STRATEGIES, AND PRESCHOOL MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES FOLLOWED THE PROGRAM WHICH BEREITER AND ENGLEMANN OUTLINED IN THEIR BOOK. THE CHILDREN WERE ALSO INSTRUCTED IN LANGUAGE, READING, AND ARITHMETIC FOR AN HOUR EACH DAY FOR 6 MONTHS. THE STANFORD-BINET INTELLIGENCE TEST WAS GIVEN DURING A 2-WEEK POST-TEST PERIOD. A YEAR LATER TWO SUBTESTS OF THE  ILLINOIS TEST OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC ABILITIES, AUDITORY VOCAL AUTOMATIC AND AUDITORY VOCAL ASSOCIATION, WERE GIVEN TO 38 OF THE 48 CHILDREN WHO THEN HAD 8 MONTHS OF PRESCHOOL EXPERIENCE, 2 MONTHS OF SUMMER EXPERIENCE, AND 1 MONTH OF KINDERGARTEN EXPERIENCE. RESULTS INDICATED THAT LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO THE BEREITER-ENGLEMANN PRESCHOOL CURRICULUM INCREASED INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT LEVELS AND STIMULATED DEVELOPMENT IN REASONING ABILITY, LANGUAGE FACILITY, AND UNDERSTANDING.

THIRTY-FOUR CHILDREN WITHOUT MOTIVATION WERE TAUGHT BY DEMONSTRATION TEACHERS WHO WORKED WITH GROUPS OF FROM ONE TO SIX CHILDREN FOR 30 TO 60 MINUTES ON 2 TO 5 DAYS A WEEK. THE TEACHING METHODS USED WERE DIAGNOSTIC, INDIVIDUALIZED, HIGHLY MOTIVATIVE, AND CREATIVE. TO CREATE IN THE CHILD THE DESIRE TO READ, MOTIVATIONAL TECHNIQUES VARIED WITH EACH CHILD. HOWEVER, THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE MOTIVATIONAL FACTOR WAS AN UNDERSTANDING TEACHER WHO ACCEPTED EACH CHILD FOR WHAT HE WAS, WHO RESPECTED HIS INDIVIDUALITY,  HAD CONFIDENCE IN HIS CAPABILITIES, AND ASSURED HIM OF SOME KIND OF SUCCESS. THE CENTER ALSO CONDUCTED RESEARCH AND EXAMINED INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. THROUGH AN OPERATIONAL GRANT, THE PILOT PROJECT WAS IMPROVED AND EXTENDED TO INCLUDE 12 SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN THE AREA.

THE RESULTS OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE SECOND-GRADE STUDY AND THE FIRST-GRADE REPLICATION RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN THIS THIRD PROGRESS REPORT. SECOND-GRADE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE SKILLS-CENTERED APPROACH WAS SUPERIOR TO THE LANGUAGE-EXPERIENCE APPROACH ON THE READING TESTS AND IN SPELLING. THE AUDIOVISUAL VARIATION OF THE LANGUAGE-EXPERIENCE APPROACH WAS LOWEST ON WORD DISCRIMINATION AND READING SUBTESTS. GREATER DIFFERENCES AMONG CLASSES WITHIN  EACH METHOD INDICATED THAT THE TEACHER WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUE. AN INTERCORRELATION MATRIX COMPUTATION REVEALED SOME FACTORS WHICH CORRELATED NEGATIVELY WITH READING ACHIEVEMENT. THE FIRST-GRADE REPLICATION STUDY USED THE FOUR ORIGINAL METHODS AND A PILOT METHOD WHICH COMBINED THE PHONOVISUAL TECHNIQUES WITH THE AUDIOVISUAL VARIATION OF THE LANGUAGE-EXPERIENCE APPROACH. THE SKILLS-CENTERED APPROACH PRODUCED SUPERIOR RESULTS IN SPELLING, AND THE PILOT METHOD PRODUCED SUPERIOR RESULTS IN VOCABULARY AND WORD STUDY SKILLS.

OTHER NEEDS ARE--(1) FOR BASIC RESEARCH THAT FOCUSES ON THE READING PROCESS, (2) FOR LEADERSHIP THAT VALUES SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVITY AND INTELLECTUAL HONESTY, AND (3) TO INFORM AND CONVINCE THE PUBLIC OF THE POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF READING RESEARCH. PROGRAMMATIC RESEARCH HAS A FLEXIBLE FORMAT, IS MULTIDISCIPLINARY, AND ALLOWS CREATIVITY, SIMULTANEOUS REPLICATION OF CRUCIAL EXPERIMENTS, AND THE USE OF NEW RESEARCH MANAGEMENT TOOLS. AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF PROGRAMMATIC RESEARCH IN THE FUTURE IS SUGGESTED BY--(1) THE FINDINGS OF THE COORDINATED FIRST GRADE READING STUDY WHICH SUGGEST THE NEED FOR BROADER STUDIES OF BEGINNING READING, (2) CHALL'S &quot;LEARNING TO READ--THE GREAT DEBATE&quot; WHICH ARGUES FOR  RESEARCH THAT WILL PRODUCE SOUND THEORIES ON READING, AND (3) PROJECT LITERACY AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY WHICH FOLLOWS THE PROGRAMMATIC FORMAT IN DESIGNING BEGINNING READING TEXTS.

EIGHTEEN HIGH ACHIEVERS AND 22 LOW ACHIEVERS WERE IDENTIFIED FROM AMONG 207 ADULTS ATTENDING ADULT BASIC EDUCATION CLASSES IN BUFFALO AND NIAGARA FALLS, NEW YORK. RESULTS REVEALED THAT HIGH ACHIEVERS WERE LESS FREQUENTLY ON WELFARE, MORE FREQUENTLY WOMEN, AND CAME FROM LESS DEPRIVED BACKGROUNDS. IN INDICATING REASONS FOR LACK OF ACHIEVEMENT, ACHIEVERS MENTIONED PERSONAL OR PARENTAL DISINTEREST, ILLNESS, FOREIGN BIRTH, AND POVERTY. NONACHIEVERS POINTED TO INABILITY TO  PROFIT FROM INSTRUCTION AND LACK OF SCHOOLS. NEITHER GROUP MENTIONED POOR TEACHING. THERE WAS A VERY SLIGHT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS' ATTITUDE TOWARD TELEVISION AND RADIO PROGRAMS. THE READING-ASSOCIATED INTERESTS MOST FREQUENTLY CHOSEN IN TERMS OF TITLES PRESENTED WERE FAMILY, SELF-IMPROVEMENT, JOBS, AND HEALTH. HIGH ACHIEVERS PREFERRED SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS.

        "description":"THIS STUDY POSES THE QUESTION OF HOW TO MEASURE THE DEGREE OF INEQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SUBGROUPS IN SOCIETY. IT EXAMINES AND REJECTS THE DOMINANT IDEA THAT EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY IS PROVIDED BY A COMMUNITY THROUGH THE PROVISION OF FACILITIES WITH FREE AND OPEN ACCESS FOR ALL, SUBSTITUTING THE IDEA THAT IT IS THE INTENSITY WITH WHICH A SCHOOL'S RESOURCES ARE EMPLOYED IN RELATION TO THE INTENSITY OF USE OF OUTSIDE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES (I.E., PARTICULARLY THE FAMILY) WHICH LEADS TO EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES. IT RECOGNIZES THAT BEFORE ATTENDING SCHOOL, CHILDREN HAVE VERY UNEQUAL LEARNING EXPERIENCES, WHICH MUST BE BALANCED BY MAKING SCHOOL EDUCATION MORE POWERFUL FOR THE MORE POORLY PREPARED GROUP. MEASUREMENT OF EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BY (1)  MEASURING THE LIST OF RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE EFFECTIVE FOR ACHIEVEMENT FOR EACH POPULATION GROUP, (2) THROUGH REGRESSION ANALYSIS, ESTIMATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH OF THESE RESOURCES FOR A GIVEN GROUP WHICH EXPERIENCED FEWER RESOURCES THAN A GIVEN BASELINE GROUP, SUCH AS WHITES IN THE SAME REGION, AND (3) USING THESE MEASURES OF EFFECTIVENESS AND THE REGRESSION WEIGHTS FOR THE DIFFERENT SCHOOL RESOURCES TO OBTAIN A PREDICTED INCREMENT OF ACHIEVEMENT IF THE GIVEN GROUP WERE TO HAVE THE SAME RESOURCES AS THE BASELINE GROUP. THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE IN EQUALITY BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. (AW)",

THE CURRICULUM CONSISTS OF EXPERIMENTAL TEXTBOOKS IN LANGUAGE (GENERAL LINGUISTIC MATERIAL AND TRANSFORMATIONAL GRAMMAR), LITERATURE, AND RHETORIC (ORAL AND WRITTEN COMPOSITION). A PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE OF THE CENTER WAS TO DEVELOP A CURRICULUM CHARACTERIZED BY INTELLECTUAL INTEGRITY OF CONTENT, AND BY AN ORDERED SEQUENCE BASED ON CONCEPTS RELEVANT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER BEING PRESENTED. THE CURRICULUM IN TRANSFORMATIONAL GRAMMAR OFFERED NO DIFFICULTIES IN THIS RESPECT, SINCE AS A SCIENTIFIC  DISCIPLINE IT IS RIGOROUSLY LOGICAL AND SEQUENTIAL. THE LITERATURE CURRICULUM IS ORGANIZED AROUND THE TERMS--SUBJECT, FORM, AND POINT OF VIEW--WHICH, IN ACCORDANCE WITH BRUNER'S THEORY OF THE SPIRAL, ARE PRESENTED THROUGH SIMPLE APPLICATIONS IN THE EARLY YEARS AND PROGRESSIVELY MORE COMPLEX ONES IN THE LATER YEARS. THE RHETORIC CURRICULUM IS SIMILARLY ORDERED AROUND THE CONCEPTS OF SUBSTANCE, STRUCTURE, AND STYLE. THE CENTER DEVELOPED A PATTERN OF RETRAINING OF TEACHERS SO AS TO EQUIP THEM TO TEACH NEW SUBJECT MATTER AND EMPLOY NEW TEACHING METHODS. IT ALSO PRODUCED A BATTERY OF TESTS TO DETERMINE STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN THE NEW CURRICULUM.

DISCUSSIONS AMONG 50 PROFESSORS OF ENGLISH WHO MET AT DARTMOUTH IN THE SUMMER OF 1966 AT THE ANGLO-AMERICAN SEMINAR ON THE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF ENGLISH INDICATE THAT EVEN AMONG ACCOMPLISHED MEMBERS OF THE PROFESSION THERE ARE MANY WHO FORGET THE PURPOSE OF ENGLISH. IN ONE DISCUSSION OF HOW TO TEACH A POEM, THESE TEACHERS NEVER CONSIDERED THE USES OF THE POEM, HOW TO PLACE IT IN  THE CLASSROOM, OR HOW TO SET UP VITAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE STUDENT AND THE LINES OF POETRY. BEFORE TEACHING A POEM, FOR EXAMPLE, THE TEACHER SHOULD FIRST INTRODUCE THE STUDENTS TO IDEAS AND SITUATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE POEM HE IS GOING TO TEACH. HE SHOULD TREAT THE POEM AS A THIRD VOICE IN THE ROOM--THE OTHER VOICES ARE HIS AND THE STUDENTS'. HIS OBLIGATION AS A GOOD TEACHER OF WRITING IS TO MOVE THE STUDENT CLOSER TO THE THING, AND TO FIND THE TALK THAT WILL CREATE A SUBJECT FOR THE STUDENT, A NEED FOR UTTERANCE, AND AN EAGERNESS TO NAME A TRUTH BEYOND THE TRUTH BEGUN WITH.

THE NATURE OF REALITY AND THE PURPOSE OF TEACHING, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE VIEWED DIFFERENTLY BY THE \"TRADITIONALIST,\" THE \"LIBERAL,\" OR THE \"SNOPESIAN CAREERIST.\" CATEGORIES SUCH AS THESE FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE PREMISES AND ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND JUDGMENTS MADE BY TEACHERS AND CRITICS OF LITERATURE WHICH MUST BE UNDERSTOOD AND CONSIDERED IN ANY PROGRAM OF REFORM. THIS IS WHY THE VOLUME OF PREDOMINANTLY TRADITIONALIST ESSAYS ON THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH IS DISAPPOINTING, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF A CHAPTER DEVOTED TO  STUDENTS. MOST OF THE AUTHORS INCLUDED FAIL TO CONSIDER THE BASIC QUESTIONS OF WHAT THE STUDY OF LITERATURE IS, WHAT IT CAN ACCOMPLISH, AND HOW THESE GOALS MAY BE BEST REALIZED. WAYNE C. BOOTH'S DISCUSSION OF \"THE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM\" AND MURRAY KRIEGER'S \"THE DISCIPLINE OF LITERARY CRITICISM\" ARE NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS.

BUT BEYOND THE QUANTITY AND VARIETY IN RESEARCH, THE KNOWLEDGE EXPLOSION INVOLVES THE NEED FOR A NEW KIND OF HISTORICAL SENSE, A KNOWLEDGE OF CHANGES WITHIN THE HUMANITIES WHICH WERE NOT APPARENT TO THOSE IN ANY AGE MUCH BEFORE OUR OWN. THESE CHANGES ARE MOST APPARENT IN THE AREAS OF THE CULTURAL RELEVANCE OF LITERATURE, THE EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF VERBAL PERFORMANCE AND ITS INTERACTION WITH THE NEWER MASS MEDIA, AND A SENSE OF THE SYNCHRONIC PRESENT, WHICH INCLUDES THE PAST. BECAUSE OF THESE CHANGES AND THE  GENERAL PUBLIC'S INSISTENCE ON THE RELEVANCE OF THE HUMANITIES, SCHOLARS SHOULD MAKE THEIR WORK RELEVANT.

        "description":"CURRENT RESEARCH INDICATES THAT SCHOOL AND HOME ENVIRONMENTS STRONGLY INFLUENCE AN INDIVIDUAL'S INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT, ALTHOUGH CERTAIN VERY BROAD HEREDITARY LIMITATIONS MAY ALSO AFFECT IT. THE ECONOMICALLY AND EDUCATIONALLY DISADVANTAGED YOUTH EXPERIENCES AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH LACKS STIMULI ESSENTIAL TO POSITIVE INTELLECTUAL GROWTH AND ACHIEVEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DISADVANTAGED YOUTH IS NOT EXPOSED BY HIS FAMILY TO EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS, TRAVEL EXPERIENCES, OR STANDARD LANGUAGE PATTERNS WHICH WOULD FACILITATE HIS VERBAL ABILITY OR GENERAL ACADEMIC READINESS. IN THE PHYSICALLY AND ACADEMICALLY SUBSTANDARD SCHOOLS WHICH THE DISADVANTAGED YOUTH ATTENDS, DEPRIVED CONDITIONS CAUSE AN ACTUAL DECLINE IN STUDENTS' MEASURED INTELLIGENCE AND ACHIEVEMENT AS THEY GROW OLDER. OTHER  STUDIES DOCUMENT THAT WHITE CHILDREN IN DEPRIVED ENVIRONMENTS ALSO MANIFEST AN I.Q. LAG. WITH A POSITIVE CHANGE IN ENVIRONMENT, HOWEVER, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN STUDENTS' MEASURED INTELLIGENCE. THUS THE SCHOOLS MUST BE MADE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH WOULD STIMULATE THIS POTENTIAL FOR INTELLECTUAL GROWTH. TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAMS MUST SPECIFICALLY PREPARE TEACHERS TO TEACH DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. MOREOVER, SCHOOLS NEED DYNAMIC ADMINISTRATORS WHO CAN DEMAND QUALITY EDUCATION IN THEIR SCHOOLS AND WHO WILL ELIMINATE SCHOOL SEGREGATION, WHICH NOT ONLY DEPRIVES THE NEGRO OF AN EQUAL EDUCATION BUT ALSO WARPS THE RACIAL ATTITUDES OF WHITE STUDENTS AND CAUSES THE NEGRO CHILD TO FEEL INFERIOR.

SOUTHERN SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE EVADED THE LAW BY SUCH MANEUVERS AS FREEDOM OF CHOICE PLANS, WHICH WERE ACCEPTED BY THE OFFICE. TO DISSUADE NEGROES FROM APPLYING FOR  SUCH TRANSFERS, SOUTHERN ADMINISTRATORS HAVE USED HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD USE ADMINISTRATIVE FIATS TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THE EVASIVE STRATEGIES OF LOCAL OFFICIALS. OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW CAN BE ENFORCED BY THE USE OF SEVERAL METHODS--(1) CUTTING OFF FUNDS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHICH REFUSE TO DESEGREGATE, (2) PROVIDING FUNDS FOR PROFESSIONAL TEAMS TO POLICE DESEGREGATION WHEN FEDERAL EXAMINERS ARE UNAVAILABLE, (3) SURVEYING THE SCHOOL CENSUS TO INSURE INTEGRATION AT ALL GRADE LEVELS, (4) INSISTING THAT PHASED DESEGREGATION NOT BE TOKEN, AND (5) ORGANIZED TRAINING SESSIONS FOR ALL DEEP SOUTH TEACHERS.

THE TABLES AND DISCUSSION IN THE SECOND APPENDIX DESCRIBE SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS OF CITY AND SUBURBAN SCHOOLS IN THE NORTHEAST, GREAT LAKES, GREAT PLAINS, SOUTHEAST, AND FAR WEST REGIONS. FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE EQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY SURVEY (COLEMAN, ET. AL.) IS REPORTED IN THE THIRD APPENDIX. HERE TABLES INDICATE THE EFFECT OF THE RACIAL  COMPOSITION OF A SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM ON NEGRO STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY ON THEIR COLLEGE ASPIRATIONS, AND ON NEGRO AND WHITE ADULTS WHO HAVE ATTENDED SEGREGATED OR DESEGREGATED ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. ALSO INDICATED IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND SUCH FACTORS AS STUDENT FAMILY BACKGROUND, TEACHER CHARACTERISTICS, CURRICULUMS, AND SCHOOL FACILITIES. THE REPORT INDICATES THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE AN UPWARD TREND IN THE ACHIEVEMENT LEVEL OF NEGRO STUDENTS AS THE PROPORTION OF THEIR WHITE CLASSMATES INCREASES. CONTAINED IN AN ADDITONAL SECTION ARE EVALUATIONS OF COMPENSATORY EDUCATION PROJECTS IN PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA, AND SYRACUSE, NEW YORK. ACCORDING TO THE EVALUATIONS THE PROJECTS DID NOT IMPROVE THE STUDENTS' READING PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER THE READING PERFORMANCE OF  NONPROJECT STUDENTS WHO WERE BUSED TO SCHOOLS WITH A MAJORITY OF WHITE STUDENTS NOTABLY INCREASED.

THE REVIEW DESCRIBES THE NEGRO'S MODEST EDUCATIONAL BEGINNINGS DURING THE COLONIAL PERIOD (PRIMARILY DEVOTED TO RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION) AND PRE- AND POST-CIVIL WAR DEVELOPMENTS. THE GREATEST EFFORT TOWARD ESTABLISHING SCHOOLS FOR NEGROES OCCURRED DURING THE RECONSTRUCTION ERA, MAINLY UNDER CHURCH SPONSORSHIP, WHEN THE MOST IMPORTANT NEGRO INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION WERE FOUNDED. THE DUAL EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN THE SOUTH WAS GIVEN LEGAL SANCTION IN 1896 BY THE PLESSY VS. FERGUSON CASE. ALTHOUGH IN THE 20TH CENTURY PROFOUND CHANGES IN PUBLIC EDUCATION FOR NEGROES TOOK PLACE, BOTH IN TERMS  OF ATTENDANCE RATES AND IMPROVEMENT IN EDUCATIONAL QUALITY, IT WAS CLEAR THAT SEGREGATED SCHOOLS WERE UNEQUAL.

IT WAS FOUND THAT OF THE 1.6 MILLION NEGRO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN 75 REPRESENTATIVE CITIES, 75 PERCENT ARE ENROLLED IN SCHOOLS WHICH ARE OVER 90 PERCENT NEGRO. THIS RAPIDLY INCREASING TREND IS CAUSED BY SUCH FACTORS AS SEGREGATED HOUSING PATTERNS, A NEARLY ALL-WHITE PRIVATE AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOL ENROLLMENT, AND DISCRIMINATORY EDUCATIONAL POLICIES AND PRACTICES. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT BOTH THE SOCIAL CLASS AND RACIAL COMPOSITION OF A SCHOOL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT UPON STUDENTS' ACHIEVEMENT AND ASPIRATIONS. EVEN WHERE COMPENSATORY PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED INTO GHETTO  SCHOOLS, NEGRO STUDENTS LAG CONSIDERABLY BEHIND NEGRO STUDENTS ATTENDING MAJORITY-WHITE SCHOOLS. FOR THIS REASON SCHOOL DESEGREGATION, ACCOMPANIED BY FEDERAL ACTION, VIGOROUS LEADERSHIP, EDUCATIONAL IMPROVEMENT, AND PROVISION FOR REMEDIAL ASSISTANCE, MUST BE IMPLEMENTED. ONE FEASIBLE FORM OF SCHOOL DESEGREGATION IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PARKS. THE REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT CONGRESS ESTABLISH A UNIFORM STANDARD PROVIDING FOR RACIAL BALANCE IN THE SCHOOL, THAT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BE GIVEN TO ALL SCHOOLS FOR EDUCATIONAL IMPROVEMENT, AND THAT CONGRESS PROVIDE FOR ADEQUATE TIME IN WHICH TO ACCOMPLISH THIS EDUCATIONAL IMPROVEMENT. IT ALSO MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FAIR HOUSING PRACTICES. THIS DOCUMENT IS ALSO AVAILABLE FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS, GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE,  WASHINGTON, D.C., 20402. (LB)",

HOWEVER THE NATIONAL COMMITMENT TO EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND ANTIPOVERTY EFFORTS REQUIRES THAT THERE BE A REASSESSMENT OF THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO ASSURE THAT THEY ARE BEING USED FOR NONDISCRIMINATORY PURPOSES. FEDERAL URBAN AID PROGRAMS COULD HELP TO OPEN THE SUBURBS TO NEGROES AND LOW-INCOME FAMILIES BY OFFERING LARGER EDUCATIONAL GRANTS AND HIGHER FUNDING PRIORITIES TO COMMUNITIES WITH LOW-INCOME NEGRO FAMILIES. ALL THE VARIOUS FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS FOR METROPOLITAN AREA HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COULD MAKE ALLOCATIONS CONTINGENT ON LOCAL COMMITMENTS TO  DESEGREGATION. THERE ALSO SHOULD BE A UNIFICATION OF GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS TO INSURE THAT ALL FEDERALLY ASSISTED PROGRAMS INCLUDE NONDISCRIMINATORY POLICIES AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY GOALS. A FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING LAW SHOULD BE ENACTED WHICH WOULD EQUALIZE ACCESS TO HOUSING AND WOULD STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LOCAL LAWS. FEDERAL LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROGRAMS SHOULD BE ENLARGED TO INCLUDE SUBSIDIES FOR SUBURBAN HOUSING AND FOR RELOCATION OF FAMILIES DISPLACED BY URBAN RENEWAL. THERE SHOULD BE A MECHANISM FOR NEGOTIATION BETWEEN CENTRAL CITIES AND SUBURBS TO RESOLVE ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

        "description":"RECENT FEDERAL REPORTS ON NEGRO ACHIEVEMENT IN BIRACIAL SCHOOLS SUGGEST THAT ON THE AVERAGE NEGROES AND WHITES ACHIEVE BEST IN WHITE-MAJORITY SCHOOLS, AND THAT THE RACIAL CONTACT IS AN IMPORTANT VARIABLE IN THIS EFFECT. PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN BIRACIAL LEARNING SETTINGS POINTS TO THREE FACTORS WHICH MAY HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON NEGRO STUDENTS. CHILDREN IN NEWLY INTEGRATED CLASSROOMS MAY EXPERIENCE A SOCIAL THREAT, A LOW EXPECTANCY OF SUCCESS, AND A FAILURE THREAT WHICH HAS A \"SOCIALLY PUNITIVE MEANING.\" THESE ADVERSE EFFECTS COULD BE MINIMIZED BY THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE EXPOSURE TO DESEGREGATED SCHOOLS. MOREOVER, A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS SHOWS THAT IN SITUATIONS OF SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE NEGROES WANT TO MEET THE HIGH ACADEMIC STANDARDS OF WHITE PEERS. THESE  STANDARDS OFFER THE NEGROES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SELF-EVALUATION AND HAVE HIGH INCENTIVE VALUE. NEGRO LOW ACHIEVERS ALSO BENEFIT FROM DESEGREGATION BECAUSE LOW SELF-ESTEEM MAY BE IMPROVED WHEN A CHILD FINDS HIS ENVIRONMENT RESPONSIVE TO HIS ACHIEVEMENT EFFORTS. RESEARCH HAS ALSO SHOWN THAT A TEACHER'S BEHAVIOR AFFECTS A NEGRO CHILD MORE THAN A WHITE CHILD. IF THE NEGRO FEELS REJECTED, HE BECOMES ANXIOUS AND ACHIEVES LESS, AND THUS HIS SCHOOL PROGRESS SLOWS. ABILITY GROUPING MAY ALSO BE DETRIMENTAL TO NEGRO PUPILS. UNTIL THERE IS FULL SCHOOL INTEGRATION, STANDARDS IN NEGRO SCHOOLS MUST BE RAISED AND NEGRO PARENTS ENCOURAGED TO FOSTER POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD EDUCATION. IN NEWLY INTEGRATED SCHOOLS TEACHERS SHOULD BE TRAINED TO UNDERSTAND THE EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS.

THE MATERIAL IS PRESENTED UNDER THE RUBRICS OF (1) THE CHIEF CORRELATES OF NEGRO ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, (2) RACIAL COMPOSITION OF THE CLASSROOM AND NEGRO ACHIEVEMENT, (3) USEFUL DEFINITIONS OF SEGREGATION, DESEGREGATION, AND INTEGRATION, (4) THE NONACADEMIC CONSEQUENCES OF INTERRACIAL EDUCATION, AND (5) THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPENSATORY EDUCATION IN SEGREGATED SCHOOLS AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR INTEGRATED EDUCATION. THE FINDINGS OF THESE STUDIES SHOW THAT SOCIAL CLASS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SCHOOL CORRELATE OF  ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES. ALSO TEACHER QUALITY IS A MORE SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT THAN SCHOOL FACILITIES, AND THE RACIAL COMPOSITION OF THE SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM HAS AN ACADEMIC AND PSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECT ON STUDENTS.

SUCH A TRANSFER PLAN WOULD RELIEVE OVERCROWDING AND UNDERUTILIZATION AND IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES OF NEGRO STUDENTS. REDISTRICTING AND PAIRINGS ARE CONSIDERED TRANSITIONAL STEPS WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE ABOUT 35 PERCENT OF ALL SEGREGATED SCHOOLS, BUT THEY MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY SHIFTING ALREADY PLANNED NEW SCHOOLS TO SITES OFFERING BETTER POSSIBILITIES FOR INTEGRATION. THREE PREDOMINANTLY ALL-NEGRO VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS SHOULD BE CLOSED, WITH STUDENTS REASSIGNED TO GENERAL HIGH SCHOOLS, AND TWO  OTHERS SHOULD BE CONVERTED INTO TRADE SCHOOLS. THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AT WASHBURN HIGH SCHOOL SHOULD EITHER BECOME NONDISCRIMINATORY OR BE ELIMINATED. THE EXISTING 89 INTEGRATED SCHOOLS SHOULD BECOME A MODEL ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT. EXPERIENCED PRINCIPALS SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE &quot;MOST DIFFICULT&quot; SCHOOLS AND NEGRO PRINCIPALS ASSIGNED TO WHITE SCHOOLS. ALL SCHOOLS MUST HAVE THE FULL ALLOTMENT OF TENURED TEACHERS. FEDERAL FUNDS SHOULD BE USED TO CUT CLASS SIZE, HIRE TEACHER AIDES, AND PLAN COOPERATIVE PROGRAMS. THERE SHOULD ALSO BE PARENT PARTICIPATION, WITH GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES WORKED OUT FOR DISPUTES.

MANY NEGROES AND PUERTO RICANS SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS FOR WHAT THEY THINK IS A BETTER EDUCATION, AND MANY WHITE STUDENTS TRAVEL INTO GHETTO AREAS TO ENROLL IN CATHOLIC SCHOOLS.

PROPOSALS FOR SUCH COOPERATION HAVE BEEN IN THE FORM OF OFFERS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOMS AND STAFF TO RELIEVE OVERCROWDING IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND TO PROVIDE SPECIAL PROGRAMS \"WITHOUT PROSELYTIZING,\" COOPERATION IN EDUCATIONAL PARKS, AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE EXTENSION AND BROADENING OF FEDERALLY FUNDED PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS.

        "description":"THE CAMPUS SCHOOL PLAN FOR AN EDUCATIONAL PARK IN SYRACUSE, NEW YORK, WAS CONCEIVED WHEN THE BOARD OF EDUCATION WAS FACED WITH THE NEED TO REPLACE EIGHT OUTMODED ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. THE PARK WOULD BE BUILT ON A SITE ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE CITY, TO WHICH STUDENTS WOULD BE TRANSPORTED BY BUS. THE FIRST CAMPUS WOULD ESTABLISH FOUR PAIRS OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WHICH WOULD SHARE CERTAIN COMMON FACILITIES, ALL SPECIALIZED STAFF, AND MAJOR FACILITIES OFFERED BY A CENTRAL CORE. EACH &quot;SATELLITE&quot; SCHOOL WOULD BE DESIGNED FOR FLEXIBLE USE OF SPACE. WITH CONSOLIDATED ATTENDANCE AT THE CAMPUS SCHOOL, WHICH WOULD REPLACE THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS, CLASS SIZE WOULD BE BETTER CONTROLLED AND ANCILLARY SERVICES MADE MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE. MOST IMPORTANT, HOWEVER, WOULD BE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR  IMPROVED INSTRUCTION--TEAM TEACHING, GREATER AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES OF AREA SPECIALISTS, INDIVIDUALIZED PUPIL PROGRESS, AND USE OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY. EDUCATIONAL EQUALITY WOULD BE ASSURED BECAUSE THE SATELLITES WOULD BE IDENTICAL AND WOULD HAVE A RACIAL BALANCE PROPORTIONATE TO THE CITYWIDE AVERAGE AT EACH GRADE LEVEL. THE CAMPUS PLAN WOULD PERMIT AN INDIVIDUAL CONTINUOUS PROGRESS CURRICULUM AND WOULD OFFER THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PUPIL A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN CAMPUS LIFE. THE CONCEPT IS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE BECAUSE 25 PERCENT MORE PUPILS CAN BE SERVED AT A SLIGHTLY HIGHER COST THAN THE COST OF THE NEEDED REPLACEMENTS FOR THE EIGHT SCHOOLS.

STAFF IN URBAN EDUCATION PROGRAMS SHOULD INCLUDE MINORITY-GROUP FACULTY MEMBERS AND SHOULD OFFER MORE INTENSIVE AND EXTENSIVE COURSES TO PREPARE TRAINEES TO WORK IN DEPRESSED AREAS. COLLEGES AND SCHOOL SYSTEMS SHOULD ORGANIZE COOPERATIVE FIFTH-YEAR PROGRAMS FOR BEGINNING TEACHERS, AND INSERVICE  TRAINING PROGRAMS SHOULD INCLUDE MUCH MORE DIRECT CONTACT WITH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

COMPENSATORY EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN SEGREGATED SCHOOLS, WHILE OSTENSIBLY AMELIORATIVE, MAY SERVE TO PERPETUATE SEGREGATED EDUCATION AND TO OBSCURE THE FACT THAT DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN RECEIVE INFERIOR EDUCATION. A SHIFT IN GOALS FROM IMMEDIATE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION TO INSURING QUALITY EDUCATION FOR NEGROES APPEARS NOW TO BE BOTH EXPEDIENT AND ATTAINABLE. HOWEVER ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL SYSTEMS SHOULD BE DEVELOPED IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE IN SEGREGATED SCHOOLS.  REALISTIC AND PRACTICAL PARALLEL SYSTEMS MIGHT INCLUDE STATE FINANCED REGIONAL SCHOOLS WHICH CUT ACROSS URBAN-SUBURBAN LINES, OR FEDERALLY FINANCED SCHOOLS WHICH ARE INTERSTATE AND POSSIBLY RESIDENTIAL. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, BUSINESS, INDUSTRY, AND LABOR UNIONS MIGHT OPERATE SCHOOLS WHICH WOULD BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.

EVALUATIONS HAVE BEEN HAMPERED BY A LACK OF LONGITUDINAL STUDIES AND CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS AND BY THE IMPRECISION OF THE STANDARD MEASURES. EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS, THOSE WHICH PRODUCE INCREASES IN LEARNING, SHOULD FEATURE (1) CURRICULUM ADAPTATION TO THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REALITIES OF POOR AND/OR NEGRO CHILDREN, (2) INSERVICE TRAINING IN ATTITUDES AND CURRICULUM FOR TEACHERS WHO HAVE NOT RAISED STUDENTS' ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE TO ADEQUATE LEVELS, (3) CONCERN FOR HEALTH, WELFARE, AND FOOD NEEDS, AND (4) PARENT INVOLVEMENT. ALL THESE FEATURES ARE EXPENSIVE BUT HIGH EXPENDITURES ALONE CAN NOT GUARANTEE PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS. THE MORE EFFECTIVE SCHOOLS PROGRAM IN NEW YORK CITY HAS BEEN  UNABLE TO STOP THE PROGRESSIVE RETARDATION OF DISADVANTAGED YOUTH BECAUSE IT HAS LACKED QUALIFIED TEACHERS AND INDIVIDUALIZED INNOVATIVE INSTRUCTION. REPORTS FROM VARIOUS STUDIES STRESS TEACHER ATTITUDES AND EXPECTANCY OF SUCCESS OR FAILURE AS IMPORTANT VARIABLES IN A DISADVANTAGED CHILD'S ACHIEVEMENT. OTHER STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT EFFECTIVE INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION--INTENSIVE READING TEAMS, TUTORS, AND HOMEWORK HELPERS--PRODUCES SIGNIFICANT ACADEMIC GAINS. ONE STUDY HAS SHOWN SIGNIFICANT I.Q. GAINS WHEN INFANT TUTORING STARTED AT 14 MONTHS. THE VASTNESS OF TITLE I PROGRAMS OFFERS THE CHANCE TO EVALUATE SYSTEMATICALLY WHAT TYPES OF COMPENSATORY PROGRAMS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE DISADVANTAGED STUDENT.

THE TRAINING INSTITUTES ON TEACHING THE DISADVANTAGED CHILD WHICH ASSUMED THAT TEACHERS NOW NEEDED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS AND MATERIALS FOR THIS GROUP ERRONEOUSLY SUGGESTED THAT THE PROBLEMS OF THE DISADVANTAGED BECAME A REALITY ONLY AS A RESULT OF DESEGREGATION.

CURRENTLY, THE USE OF FUNDS HAS SHIFTED TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS OR CONSULTANTS. THE  PAPER ALSO OUTLINES A SERIES OF STAGES FROM COMPLETE SCHOOL SEGREGATION TO COMPLETE INTEGRATION. THIS THEORETICAL CONTINUUM CAN HELP IN FRAMING PRIORITIES FOR TRAINING PROGRAMS AND FOR EVALUATING THEIR RELEVANCY.

        "description":"ONLY SCHOOL INTEGRATION CAN PROVIDE NEGRO STUDENTS WITH EQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY. AS CONFIRMED BY DATA FROM SUCH STUDIES AS THE COLEMAN REPORT AND THE U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS REPORT, &quot;RACIAL ISOLATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS,&quot; THE SOCIAL CLASS AND RACIAL COMPOSITION OF A SCHOOL STRONGLY INFLUENCES STUDENTS' ACHIEVEMENT AND ASPIRATIONS. NEGRO STUDENTS IN CLASSROOMS WHICH ARE MORE THAN HALF WHITE, AND ESPECIALLY STUDENTS IN CLASSROOMS WHERE THERE IS COMPLETE INTERRACIAL ACCEPTANCE, ACHIEVE AT A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVEL THAN NEGRO STUDENTS IN SEGREGATED CLASSROOMS. HOWEVER WHITE PUPILS IN PREDOMINANTLY NEGRO CLASSROOMS PERFORM BELOW THE LEVEL OF WHITE STUDENTS IN ALL-WHITE SCHOOLS. INTERRACIAL EDUCATION BENEFITS BOTH WHITE AND NEGRO STUDENTS BY OFFERING THEM  CONTACTS WHICH HELP TO PREPARE THEM FOR INTERRACIAL LIVING AS ADULTS. NEGRO STUDENTS IN INTEGRATED CLASSROOMS TEND TO HAVE A GREATER, MORE INTERNALIZED SENSE OF CONTROL OVER THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS AND ALSO TEND TO EVALUATE THEMSELVES ACCORDING TO MORE MIDDLE-CLASS, AND THUS HIGHER, STANDARDS OF ACHIEVEMENT AND ASPIRATION. NEGRO STUDENTS WHO HAVE CLOSE WHITE FRIENDS IN THEIR PEER GROUP MAKE THE MOST USE OF THIS CROSS-RACIAL SELF-EVALUATION, AND THUS ARE THE MOST STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THEIR INTERRACIAL SCHOOL EXPERIENCE.

NONWHITES MAKE UP ALMOST 12 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION, 92 PERCENT OF WHOM ARE NEGROES. THE FERTILITY OF NONWHITES IS HIGHER, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE RURAL, LESS EDUCATED GROUP, BUT THE BIRTH RATE SEEMS TO BE FALLING FASTER, MOST NOTICEABLY IN URBAN AREAS. THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXTENT OF EDUCATION AND BIRTH RATE AMONG BOTH RACES, WHO HAVE COMPARABLE RATES WHEN THEIR EDUCATIONAL STATUS IS THE SAME. THE GAP BETWEEN NONWHITE AND WHITE LIFE EXPECTANCY HAS NARROWED TO 10 PERCENT, ALTHOUGH THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MATERNAL AND INFANT DEATH RATES REMAIN QUITE HIGH. THIS DIFFERENTIAL MAY BE EXPLAINED BY HEREDITARY FACTORS, THE AVAILABILITY AND UTILIZATION OF MEDICAL  SERVICES, WHICH IN TURN IS RELATED TO SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, AND PERSONAL MOTIVATION. DATA ALSO SHOW THAT THE RATE OF MEDICAL SERVICES AMONG NONWHITES IS LOWER THAN AMONG WHITES AND THAT FAMILY INCOME HAS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE. MORE NONWHITES THAN WHITES ARE BELOW GRADE LEVEL, DROP OUT MORE FREQUENTLY, ACHIEVE LESS ACADEMICALLY, AND COMPLETE FEWER YEARS OF SCHOOLING. NEGROES ARE ONLY 5.7 PERCENT OF THOSE RECEIVING HIGHER EDUCATION. THREE TIMES AS MANY NONWHITES AS WHITES HAVE AN INCOME LESS THAN $3,000 ANNUALLY. HOUSING CONDITIONS ARE TWICE AS GOOD FOR WHITES THAN FOR NONWHITES.

THE FEDERATION FEELS THAT INSTEAD OF DIVIDING THE SCHOOLS INTO 30-60 DISCRETE SCHOOL DISTRICTS, WHICH MAY VASTLY INCREASE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND REINFORCE EXISTING PATTERNS OF SEGREGATION, THE SCHOOL SYSTEM MIGHT BEST BE DECENTRALIZED INTO NO MORE THAN 15 SEPARATE DISTRICTS. THE PRESENT BOARD OF EDUCATION WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOVED AND THE MAYOR MIGHT THEN SELECT A NONSALARIED CENTRAL BOARD FROM PERSONS INITIALLY ELECTED BY LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS. THESE LOCAL BOARDS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ELECT THEIR OWN DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS.  HOWEVER, THE HIRING AND DISMISSAL OF TEACHERS AND SUPERVISORS, DEVELOPMENT OF CURRICULUMS, AND SELECTION OF TEXTBOOKS SHOULD NOT BE LEFT IN THE UNPROFESSIONAL HANDS OF LAY PERSONS. AND, IF EACH DISTRICT IS ALLOWED TO RECRUIT ITS OWN STAFF, TEACHERS WILL GRAVITATE TO THE MOST DESIRABLE, LEAST DISADVANTAGED, DISTRICTS. UNDER THE BUNDY PLAN LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS WOULD HAVE TO COMPETE FOR A SHARE OF THE CENTRAL BUDGET. THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM OF INSUFFICIENT FUNDS MIGHT BE MET BY DOUBLING PRESENT PER PUPIL EXPENDITURES AND BY GUARANTEEING A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF FUNDS TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS. THE BUNDY REPORT'S RECOMMENDATION WOULD ALSO HAVE TEACHERS AND LOCALITIES COMPETE FOR THE REMAINS OF CENTRAL MONIES. TEACHER-COMMUNITY HOSTILITIES WOULD FURTHER INCREASE IF, AS SUGGESTED IN THE REPORT,  COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WERE CONDUCTED ON A LOCAL RATHER THAN CITYWIDE BASIS.

        "description":"IN THIS LETTER THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK DISCUSSES THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL SYSTEM RECOMMENDED BY HIS ADVISORY PANEL ON SCHOOL DECENTRALIZATION. HE NOTES THAT INSTEAD OF DECENTRALIZING THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS AT THIS TIME, ADMINISTRATORS MIGHT FOCUS ON THE OPERATION OF COMMUNITY BOARDS FOR THE ELEMENTARY AND INTERMEDIATE SCHOOLS, AND ON THE INVOLVEMENT OF PARENTS AT THIS LEVEL. HIGH SCHOOLS SHOULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE ON A CITYWIDE BASIS. ALSO, THERE SHOULD BE A CENTRAL BOARD OF EDUCATION (CBE) CONSISTING OF NINE UNPAID LAYMEN, CITYWIDE ENFORCEMENT OF STATE STANDARDS, AND CITYWIDE EVALUATION OF DISTRICT SCHOOLS AND DISSEMINATION OF PERTINENT INFORMATION. THE CBE WOULD REQUIRE EACH DISTRICT TO DEVELOP A LONG RANGE IMPROVEMENT PLAN. PERSONNEL FOR THE DECENTRALIZED SCHOOL DISTRICTS, WHO WOULD  TAKE A BASIC QUALIFYING EXAMINATION, WOULD BE RECRUITED BY THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS. EACH COMMUNITY SCHOOL BOARD SHOULD HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER THE ADMINISTRATION OF FUNDS ALLOCATED TO IT. THIRTY SUCH BOARDS, CONCURRENT WITH THE PRESENT 30 DISTRICTS AND CONSISTING OF TEACHERS, PARENTS, AND OTHER INVOLVED COMMUNITY MEMBERS, SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. TO EASE THE TRANSITION FROM CENTRAL TO LOCAL AUTHORITY, A TEMPORARY COMMISSION ON TRANSITION MIGHT BE FORMED. BY JULY 1970, ALMOST ALL THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL BOARDS SHOULD BE IN FULL OPERATION. TO CARRY OUT THESE PLANS THE CITY MUST SPECIFICALLY SEEK AND TRAIN PERSONS TO WORK EFFECTIVELY WITHIN THE PROPOSED SYSTEM. (LB)",

ADDITIONAL SECTIONS DISCUSS INNOVATIVE PROJECTS, METHODS OF INCREASING STAFF, AND MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS. AMONG THE PROJECTS' MAJOR PROBLEM AREAS WERE LACK OF PERSONNEL AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS AND INAPPROPRIATE STANDARDIZED TESTS FOR MEASURING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN. TWO OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED EVALUATION DESIGNS UTILIZED PRE- AND  POSTTEST PROJECT SCORES FOR COMPARISON WITH SCORES FROM LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL GROUPS. STANDARDIZED ACHIEVEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE TESTS, TEACHER-MADE TESTS, TEACHER OBSERVATION AND EVALUATION, AND PHYSICAL FITNESS TESTS WERE AMONG THE CHIEF MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS. PROJECT OBJECTIVES TO BE MEASURED INCLUDED STUDENTS' IMPROVEMENT IN READING, LANGUAGE, AND COMMUNICATIVE ARTS, MATHEMATICS, AND GENERAL ATTITUDES. OTHER OBJECTIVES WERE THE PROVISION OF HEALTH, FOOD, GUIDANCE, LIBRARY, AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. ALTHOUGH THE ATTAINING OF OBJECTIVES WAS HINDERED BY LACK OF ADEQUATE TIME, ALMOST ALL LOCAL DISTRICTS REPORTED PROGRESS. TABULAR DATA ARE PRESENTED THROUGHOUT THE REPORT. (LB)",

FOR NINE CONSECUTIVE WEDNESDAY EVENINGS, FOUR CLASSES OF FROM 10 TO 16 STUDENTS, SUPPLIED BY THE FOREMAN'S CLUB OF COLUMBUS, ALONG WITH FOUR UNTRAINED AND INEXPERIENCED GROUP LEADERS, WERE GIVEN INSTRUCTION, VIA EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION IN EFFECTIVE SPEAKING. AFTER THE 30-MINUTE PRESENTATION, THE LEADER IN EACH GROUP HANDLED THE CLASS. THE TELEVISION TEACHER HAD TWO ASSISTANTS AND A GUEST FROM EACH OF THE FOUR CLASSES FOR EACH OF HIS DEMONSTRATIONS. PRESENTATION, PARTICIPATION, AND GROUP LEADER EFFECTIVENESS WERE EVALUATED BY THREE JUDGES WHO VISITED EACH GROUP AT LEAST TWICE AND SUBMITTED 28 EVALUATIONS. THE TELEVISION PRESENTATION PHASE  RECEIVED 19 EXCELLENT RATINGS, AND THE GROUP PARTICIPATION PHASE RECEIVED 12 EXCELLENT AND 13 GOOD RATINGS. STUDENT OPINIONS FROM PRE- AND POST-COURSE QUESTIONNAIRES SHOWED--(1) 73 PERCENT FELT THE TELEVISION PRESENTATIONS WERE MORE INTERESTING THAN NORMAL PROCEDURES, (2) 88 PERCENT FELT THE TELEVISION INSTRUCTOR WAS MORE COMPETENT THAN THE GROUP LEADERS, (3) 70 PERCENT FELT THAT THE GROUP PROGRESSED FASTER THAN IF TELEVISION HAD NOT BEEN USED, AND (4) 57 PERCENT MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING QUESTIONS DURING THE TELEVISION PRESENTATION.

THE STUDY INVOLVED 465 STUDENTS IN TWO HIGH SCHOOLS USING FOUR DIFFERENT TREATMENTS--A CONVENTIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM, A 9-HOUR SIMULATOR CENTERED PROGRAM, A 6-HOUR AND A 3-HOUR SIMULATOR PROGRAM. TEN-DAY CONCENTRATED COURSES WERE APPARENTLY MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT THAN COURSES SPREAD OVER APPROXIMATELY 4 WEEKS. GENERALLY THE 6- AND 3-HOUR  SIMULATOR COURSE STUDENTS MADE FEWER ERRORS IN PRACTICE DRIVING THAN DID THE 9-HOUR SIMULATOR AND NON-SIMULATOR STUDENTS, AND THE 3-HOUR SIMULATOR COURSE RESULTED IN FEWER PRACTICE DRIVING ERRORS THAN THE 6-HOUR COURSE THOUGH NOT TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE. THE SIGNIFICANCE WAS IN THE PRACTICAL AREA OF LESS EXPENSE FOR THE SHORTER TRAINING TIME. APPARENTLY, THE FIRST FOUR INSTRUCTIONAL FILMS WERE THE MOST EFFECTIVE SINCE THEY WERE USED DURING THE FIRST 3 SIMULATOR HOURS. THE USE OF SIMULATOR MOVIES IN THE REGULAR CLASSROOM WITHOUT THE OTHER SIMULATOR EQUIPMENT SEEMED TO BE OF VALUE. GIRLS SEEMED TO HAVE HAD A BETTER CHANCE OF PASSING THE OPERATOR'S LICENSE TEST THE FIRST TIME IF THEY HAD SIMULATOR TRAINING.

BOTH SPECIAL EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION ARE BASED ON THE SAME ASSUMPTIONS, ARE INTEGRAL AREAS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION, HAVE A COMMON BACKGROUND AND DEVELOPMENT, ARE OBLIGATED BY THEIR OBJECTIVES TO SERVE THE SAME STUDENTS, AND ARE WORKING WITH STUDENTS WHO ARE MORE SIMILAR THAN DIFFERENT. EXCEPTIONAL STUDENTS ARE MOST OFTEN CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO INTELLECTUAL, PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, OR EMOTIONAL TRAITS. THEY HAVE HAD LESS OPPORTUNITY THAN NORMAL STUDENTS TO HAVE EXPERIENCES, ESPECIALLY INDUSTRIAL, THAT DEVELOP THE UNDERSTANDINGS AND ATTITUDES WHICH WILL  ENABLE THEM TO MAKE BETTER CHOICES. BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IS TO INTERPRET AN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY, BECAUSE ITS TEACHERS ARE PROFICIENT IN APPROPRIATE CONTENT AND PRINCIPLES, AND BECAUSE IT HAS ACCEPTED THE PRACTICE OF ESTABLISHING SPECIAL SECTIONS FOR PARTICULAR GROUPS, LOGICALLY IT SHOULD HAVE A PROGRAM FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN. SUCH PROGRAMS REQUIRE SMALLER CLASSES TO NARROW THE ABILITY RANGE WITHIN THE GROUP. VOCATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS MUST START AT AN EARLIER AGE AND BE GIVEN MORE ATTENTION. THE PROGRAM MUST PREPARE MANY FOR THE WORLD OF WORK SINCE A MAJORITY OF THE GROUP WILL NOT ATTEND OTHER POST-SECONDARY PROGRAMS. THE AMOUNT AND KIND OF TRAINING WILL DETERMINE THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD. INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THAT DETERMINATION.

THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO PREPARE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS TO SET UP OCCUPATIONAL CHILD-CARE AIDE TRAINING PROGRAMS AND TO STRENGTHEN THEIR ACADEMIC BACKGROUND IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND FAMILY RELATIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE COURSES, LABORATORY EXPERIENCES WITH CHILDREN IN NURSERY SCHOOL AND DAY CARE SETTINGS, FIELD TRIPS TO CHILD CARE AGENCIES, AND A GRADUATE-LEVEL SEMINAR WERE PRESENTED. THE FIRST HALF OF THE SEMINAR DEALT WITH LEARNING ABOUT THE ADOLESCENT GIRL WHO WILL SEEK CHILD CARE TRAINING AND THE LATTER HALF WITH DEVELOPING THE PHILOSOPHY, OBJECTIVES, COURSE CONTENT, AND RESOURCE MATERIALS FOR A CHILD CARE  TRAINING PROGRAM. MATERIALS DEVELOPED WERE \"A CHILD CARE TRAINING PROGRAM,\"\"ORIENTATION TO CHILD CARE EMPLOYMENT,\" AND \"DEVELOPMENT OF JOB SKILLS FOR WORK WITH YOUNG CHILDREN.\" EACH UNIT IN THE LAST TWO HAS SUGGESTED CONTENT, LEARNING EXPERIENCES, RESOURCES, AND A BIBLIOGRAPHY. FOLLOWUP EVALUATION IN LATE 1966 SHOWED THAT NINE CHILD CARE TRAINING PROGRAMS WERE IN OPERATION, THREE OTHERS WERE IN THE PLANNING STAGE, AND SIX OTHER COMMUNITIES HAD INDICATED A NEED AND WERE PLANNING EVENTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH PROGRAMS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT A 6-WEEK SUMMER WORKSHOP IS A MINIMAL BUT PRACTICAL AND EFFECTIVE MEANS OF ASSISTING TEACHERS IN SETTING UP WAGE-EARNING CLASSES AND UPDATING THEIR KNOWLEDGE. (FP)",

TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF USE OF ALLOCATED RESOURCES, THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN APPLICATION OF RESOURCES TO A PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND ATTAINMENT OF OBJECTIVES CAN BE DETERMINED BY BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS, THE RATIO OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE BENEFITS TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE COSTS. COSTS AND BENEFITS OF PARTICULAR VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS MUST BE ANALYZED FROM THE VIEWPOINTS OF BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT AND SOCIETY. THE DERIVED RATIOS ARE THE SOCIETAL BENEFIT-COST RATIO OF A PROGRAM. A VARIATION OF BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS TREATS BENEFITS AS AN UNKNOWN IN AN EQUATION INCLUDING KNOWN COSTS, NUMBER OF STUDENTS, AND AN ARBITRARILY SELECTED BENEFIT-COST RATIO. SOME LIMITATIONS  OF USING BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS FOR EVALUATING VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND AS A BASIS FOR MAKING PUBLIC EXPENDITURE DECISIONS IN THE FIELD ARE--(1) DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT MONEY VALUES SO THAT WHAT IS DOLLAR VALUE TO ONE MAY NOT BE TO ANOTHER, (2) THE SEARCH FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE PROGRAMS IS LIMITED TO ONLY THOSE PROPOSED, (3) IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE VALUE OF INTANGIBLE BENEFITS WHICH CANNOT BE MEASURED IN DOLLAR TERMS, AND (4) CONSIDERING PROGRAM VALUE FROM ONLY A LOCAL VIEWPOINT MAY RESULT IN MAINTAINING OR REJECTING ONE IN CONFLICT WITH THE AGGREGATE OR NATIONAL INTEREST. DESPITE POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS, USE OF BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS APPEARS DESIRABLE IN EVALUATING AND PLANNING VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS BECAUSE IT IDENTIFIES CURRENT OR PROPOSED PROGRAMS  IN WHICH PROBABLE ECONOMIC BENEFITS DO NOT JUSTIFY THE ACTUAL OR PROSPECTIVE EXPENDITURES.

CLASSROOM AND LABORATORY EXPERIENCES WERE SUPPLEMENTED BY VISITS TO COMMERCIAL TESTING LABORATORIES, FOUNDRIES, AND STEEL FABRICATORS. TESTS, ORAL, WRITTEN, HANDS-ON OPERATIONAL, OR SPECIAL, WERE GIVEN PERIODICALLY. TOWARD THE END OF THE COURSE, A SERIES OF TESTS AND  VALIDATED PERFORMANCE TRIALS WAS ADMINISTERED FOR QUALIFYING THE STUDENTS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF INDUSTRY. ALL GRADUATES WERE OFFERED JOBS IN THE FIELD OF RADIOGRAPHIC INSPECTION. THE LESSON PLANS AND RELATED INFORMATION DATA WERE DEVELOPED IN ROUGH OR BASIC FORM DURING THE FIRST COURSE AND USED, TESTED, AND IMPROVED IN THE SECOND COURSE.

THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT RESULTED IN SOME SHIFTING AND RETRAINING OF PERSONNEL BUT NO UNEMPLOYMENT. ACTUALLY MORE WORKERS WERE ADDED TO CARE FOR THE INCREASED VOLUME OF BUSINESS. ONLY 48 JOBS WERE ABOLISHED WHILE 58 WERE CREATED AND 40 WERE INCREASED.

BANKS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FILL THE EXECUTIVE RANKS WITH HIGHER  STARTING SALARIES, TRAINING PROGRAMS, AND RAPID PROMOTION BUT HAVE BEEN FORCED TO USE HANDICAPPED AND PART-TIME WORKERS SUCH AS HOUSEWIVES AND COLLEGE STUDENTS TO MEET PEAK SEASONAL DEMANDS.

COMPARISON OF THE TWO GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN WORK MOTIVATION WITH VARIANT SOCIAL ROLES OF THE HANDICAPPED CAUSING THE VARIATION. CHOICE OF OCCUPATIONAL ROLE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO THE PERCEIVED SOCIAL ROLE IN THE WORLD OF WORK. A RELATIONSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THE NATURE OF A PARTICULAR HANDICAP AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MEANINGS OF THE HANDICAP AS SOURCES OF INTERPERSONAL ANXIETY AND CONCERN. FOR EXAMPLE, FEELINGS OF RECENT AMPUTEES FROM VIETNAM OF BEING  MARGINAL SOCIALLY WHILE IN THE HOSPITAL AND THEIR CONCERN OF BEING SIGNIFICANT TO OTHERS AGAIN AFTER DISCHARGE MAY HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR ELEVATED SCORES. THE HIGHLY VARIANT SOCIAL ROLE OF THE NEURO-PSYCHIATRIC GROUP WAS REFLECTED IN HIGHLY VARIANT VALUE-ORIENTATION. THE DEAF VALUED WORK MORE HIGHLY BECAUSE IT PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS. THUS INTERPERSONAL CONCERNS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED VALUATION OF WORK IN THAT THE HANDICAPPED WERE SENSITIZED TO THOSE INTERPERSONAL ASPECTS OF WORK WHICH CAUSED THEM CONCERN. FURTHER STUDY IS NEEDED TO RELATE THE SOCIOPSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT OF VARIOUS GROUPS OF THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED TO PATTERNS OF WORK VALUATION. PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE STUDY IS TO PROVIDE HANDICAPPED WORKERS WITH A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SATISFACTION  THEY SEEK FROM WORK, SO THAT OCCUPATIONAL CHOICE CAN BE MORE IN LINE WITH VALUES.

MOST OF THE 75 PARTICIPANTS WHO CAME FROM 24 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AND TWO OTHER COUNTRIES, WERE HIGH-SCHOOL OR COLLEGE LEVEL TEACHERS. THE INSTRUCTION INCLUDED EIGHT UNITS ON FLUID POWER AND A SEMINAR IN  TEACHING FLUID POWER. CONVENTIONAL INSTRUCTION METHODS, TEACHING-DEMONSTRATION DEVICES, AND GUEST LECTURES AND CONSULTANTS WERE USED. THE PARTICIPANTS, WORKING AS TEAMS, DEVELOPED A RECOMMENDED CURRICULUM FOR THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF PRIMARY INTEREST TO EACH TEAM. RESULTS OF PRE- AND POST-TESTS OF 50 PROBLEMS SHOWED AN INCREASE IN MEAN SCORES FROM 26.4 TO 46.2, INDICATING A HIGH DEGREE OF SUCCESS IN INSTRUCTIONAL COMPETENCY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE SUMMER INSTITUTE CAN BE A MOST EFFECTIVE VEHICLE FOR INTRODUCING A NEW TECHNOLOGY TO TEACHERS, SINCE IT OFFERS A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AND THE EFFICIENT MEANS OF BRINGING TOGETHER THE TEACHERS AND EDUCATIONAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND TECHNOLOGICAL AUTHORITIES.

THE ANALYSIS COVERS (1) HISTORIES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITRUS, LETTUCE, AND COTTON INDUSTRIES WITH EXAMPLES OF COMPANIES USING DIFFERENT HARVESTING OPERATIONS, (2) THE ECONOMICS OF THE TECHNOLOGIES, (3) THE WORKERS, (4) THE PARTICIPANTS IN THEIR DISTINCTIVE CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS--MEXICAN-AMERICAN, ANGLO-ISOLATE, NEGRO, INDIAN, AND MANAGEMENT, AND (5) THE PARTICIPANTS IN THEIR COMMON TECHNOLOGICAL SETTING. SOME OF THE CONCLUSIONS WERE--(1) ARIZONA  AGRICULTURE, AS A VARIANT OF SOUTHWESTERN AGRICULTURE, IS AN INSTRUMENT OF EXPLOITATION OF UNSOPHISTICATED, CULTURALLY UNASSIMILATED PEOPLES, AND FUNCTIONS ALSO AS AN ASSIMILATIVE MECHANISM WORKING IN THE DIRECTION OF UPWARD OCCUPATIONAL MOBILITY AND BY DOING DEPLETES ITSELF OF ITS OWN LABOR SUPPLY, (2) DISPLACEMENT OF THE HIGHER OCCUPATIONAL CLASSES TENDS TO BE PERMANENT BECAUSE ITS MEMBERS DO NOT FIT THE LOWER OCCUPATIONAL CLASSES, AND (3) WHEN MEMBERS OF THE LOWER OCCUPATIONAL CLASSES ARE REPLACED BY HIGHER CLASS WORKERS, THE MEMBERS OF THE LOWER CLASSES TEND TO REMAIN IN THE INDUSTRY AND COMPETE FOR THE NEW HIGHER-STATUS JOBS. SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR FARM EMPLOYMENT AND MANPOWER WERE--(1) AN UNEMPLOYED WORKER SHOULD BE RETRAINED IN A HIGHER OCCUPATIONAL CLASS, (2) IF A WORKER IS  DISPLACED FROM THE HIGHEST OCCUPATIONAL STATUS IN THE INDUSTRY, HE SHOULD BE RETRAINED FOR ANOTHER INDUSTRY, (3) ANGLO-ISOLATES CANNOT BE REHABILITATED BY TRAINING PROGRAMS, AND (4) THE CONCEPT OF TRAINING FOR OCCUPATIONAL ADJUSTMENT MUST BE BROADENED TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH INSTITUTIONAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS.

        "description":"A SURVEY OF SALARIES PAID IN 26 KEY OCCUPATIONS WORKING WITH THE BLIND WAS CONDUCTED BY THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS IN 1966 (VT 003 405). THIS PUBLICATION INTERPRETS THE MAJOR FINDINGS OF THAT STUDY. OF 11,000 PERSONS GIVING DIRECT SERVICE TO THE BLIND, ABOUT HALF WERE IN PROFESSIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS. ANNUAL SALARIES OF ELEMENTARY TEACHERS IN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS FOR THE BLIND WERE $2,000 LESS THAN THOSE OF THE BLIND IN LOCAL DAY SCHOOLS AND $170 LESS THAN THOSE OF FACTORY WORKERS. VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION COUNSELORS IN GOVERNMENT OR STATE AGENCIES WITH AN ANNUAL SALARY OF $7,080 LED THOSE IN PRIVATE AGENCIES BY $550. GENERAL STATE VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICE COUNSELORS RECEIVED $530 MORE PER YEAR THAN THEIR INSTATE AGENCIES. SOCIAL CASEWORKERS WITH MASTER'S  DEGREE BARELY SURPASSED THE $7,000 MINIMUM RECOMMENDED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS FOR BEGINNING SOCIAL WORKERS WITH THIS DEGREE. THE AVERAGE INCOME OF REHABILITATION, OR HOME, TEACHERS WAS $5,880, LOWEST OF SALARIED AGENCY WORKERS. CASEWORK SUPERVISORS AVERAGED $8,110, ALSO LOWER THAN COUNTERPARTS WHO SUPERVISED VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION AND SOCIAL CASEWORKERS. ADMINISTRATOR SALARIES WERE $11,200 FOR GOVERNMENT AGENCY DIRECTORS, $11,290 FOR SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS, AND $8,700 FOR NONGOVERNMENT AGENCY DIRECTORS. GENERALLY, MEDIAN SALARIES OF WORKERS FOR THE BLIND WERE LITTLE MORE THAN BEGINNING SALARIES OFFERED IN THE BUSINESS WORLD.

THREE PUBLIC AND FIVE PRIVATE AGENCIES IN A LARGE EASTERN METROPOLITAN AREA PARTICIPATED IN THE PROJECT. APPROXIMATELY 400 PARENT COUPLES, 50 FROM EACH AGENCY, WERE INTERVIEWED BY 87 SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE EIGHT AGENCIES. THE 102-ITEM CASEWORKER'S RATING FORM FOR ADOPTIVE PARENTS WAS EVOLVED, PRETESTED, AND REVISED IN CONSULTATION WITH PROFESSIONALS IN THE ADOPTION FIELD. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT CASEWORKERS WERE DISCRIMINATING BUT THE RANGE WITHIN WHICH THEY MADE THEIR JUDGMENTS  WAS NARROW. THEREFORE THEIR ABILITY TO PREDICT CAPACITY TO FILL THE PARENTAL ROLE WAS QUESTIONED. THREE CHARACTERISTICS OF COUPLES SEEMED TO BE RELATED TO THEIR ACCEPTANCE BY CASEWORKERS--A POSITIVE OVERALL EFFECT, SUITABILITY FOR A DEVIANT CHILD, AND YOUTH AND A RELATIVELY RECENT MARRIAGE. COUPLES WERE JUDGED TO BE OVERALL POSITIVE, MARGINAL, OR POOR OR UNACCEPTABLE. THOSE COUPLES ASSESSED AS \"BETTER\" WERE AWARDED \"BETTER\" CHILDREN, AND THOSE WHO WERE \"MARGINAL\" WERE AWARDED MARGINAL OR DEVIANT CHILDREN. IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT A REPLICATION OF THE STUDY BE DONE AND THAT SOME OF THE FINDINGS BE VALIDATED. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH, TABULAR INFORMATION ON DIFFERENT FACETS OF THE ADOPTIVE PROCESS, THE CASEWORKER'S RATING FORM FOR ADOPTIVE APPLICANTS, AND A BIBLIOGRAPHY ARE INCLUDED.

DAILY LESSON PLANS WITH OBJECTIVES SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE WORLD OF WORK AND THE CLIENTS' PERSONAL MANAGEMENT WERE DEVELOPED FOR EACH WORKSHOP. TEACHERS CONCENTRATED ON CONCRETE EXPERIENCES EXPRESSED IN SIMPLE QUANTITATIVE LANGUAGE FREE OF ABSTRACTIONS. QUESTIONS AND ANSWER SESSIONS, ROLE PLAYING, PROBLEM SOLVING, DISCUSSIONS, AND FIELD TRIPS WERE THE INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS USED. CLIENT GROWTH WAS JUDGED ON THE BASIS OF TEACHER OBSERVATION AND THE CLIENT'S RESPONSE TO WORK EXPERIENCES. OF 1,218 CLIENTS  ENROLLED, 831 COMPLETED ORIENTATION, AND 48 PERCENT OF THOSE WERE EITHER EMPLOYED OR ENROLLED IN OTHER PROGRAMS. CLIENTS WHO RETAINED JOBS WERE COMPARED TO THOSE WHO LOST THEM ON THE BASIS OF SEX, AGE, EDUCATION COMPLETED, I.Q., MARITAL STATUS, POLICE RECORD, WORK HISTORY, AND THE DEGREE OF HIGH SUPPORT (PERSONALIZED CONCERN FOR THE CLIENT) PRESENT IN THE JOB SITUATION. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS OF CLIENTS EXCEPT ON THE FACTOR OF HIGH SUPPORT PRESENT IN THE JOB SITUATION. IT SEEMED TO CONTRIBUTE TO JOB RETENTION. A STUDY OF 10 PARTICIPATING COMPANIES PROVIDING HIGH SUPPORT AND 10 PROVIDING LITTLE OR NO HIGH SUPPORT SHOWED THAT THE FORMER RETAINED 82 PERCENT OF THE CLIENTS WHILE THE LATTER RETAINED ONLY 28 PERCENT OF THE CLIENTS EMPLOYED.

TO QUALIFY FOR APPRENTICESHIP IN ANY OF THE SKILLED TRADES, A YOUNG MAN OR WOMAN MUST HAVE MECHANICAL APTITUDE AND ABILITY, AND TO BE SUCCESSFUL MUST HAVE PERSEVERANCE, AMBITION, AND INITIATIVE. THE APPRENTICE TRAINING PROGRAM IS SUPERVISED BY A LOCAL JOINT APPRENTICESHIP COMMITTEE FOLLOWING STANDARDS DEVELOPED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF CONSULTANTS FROM THE BUREAU OF APPRENTICESHIP AND TRAINING AND REGISTERED WITH THE APPRENTICESHIP COUNCIL. MOST PROGRAMS ARE FOR 4 YEARS. APPRENTICES USUALLY RECEIVE 50 PERCENT OF JOURNEYMAN'S WAGE AND INCREASES AT REGULAR INTERVALS. IN MOST CASES THEY ATTEND CLASSES AT NIGHT 4 HOURS EACH  WEEK FOR AT LEAST 144 HOURS A YEAR. DAILY JOB INSTRUCTION IS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A SKILLED JOURNEYMAN. A YOUNG PERSON INTERESTED IN APPRENTICESHIP SHOULD (1) SELECT A TRADE FOR WHICH HE HAS APTITUDE AND PHYSICAL ABILITY, (2) FIND OUT IF HE MEETS THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS FOR THAT TRADE, (3) DECIDE WHETHER HE CAN WORK UNDER THE JOB CONDITIONS OF THAT TRADE, (4) OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE SPECIFIC PROCEDURES FOR MAKING APPLICATION, (5) TAKE THE APTITUDE OR OTHER TESTS WHERE REQUIRED, AND (6) IF THE JOINT APPRENTICESHIP COUNCIL HAS A WAITING LIST OF APPLICANTS, DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT HE IS SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED IN THE TRADE TO WAIT FOR AN OPENING OR WHETHER HE SHOULD SEEK OTHER EMPLOYMENT.

OF 264 INMATES SELECTED UPON THE BASIS OF TESTING AND OTHER CRITERIA, 137 WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO AN EXPERIMENTAL AND 127 TO A CONTROL GROUP. THE CONTROL GROUP FOLLOWED ORDINARY JAIL ROUTINE, AND THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED PUNCHED-CARD DATA-PROCESSING MACHINE TRAINING, REMEDIAL READING INSTRUCTION, INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING, POST-JAIL SUPPORTIVE SERVICE, AND JOB PLACEMENT ASSISTANCE. THE PROJECT WAS BESET BY PROBLEMS INCLUDING INSTITUTIONAL SPONSORSHIP, COMPLETE STAFF TURNOVER, FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, AND MISUNDERSTANDING. DESPITE THESE DIFFICULTIES, THE STUDY SHOWED EVIDENCE  THAT A VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM IN JAIL COUPLED WITH POST-RELEASE SERVICES DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN JOB PERFORMANCE AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS FAVORED THE FORMER GROUP IN (1) NON-RETURN TO JAIL, (2) NON-RETURN TO JAIL EVEN IF ADDICTED TO DRUGS, (3) NEW JOB OPPORTUNITIES UPON RELEASE, (4) SOCIAL MOBILITY AS EVIDENCED BY JOB LEVEL, (5) REDUCTION IN INCIDENCE OF PHYSICAL LABOR JOBS, (6) INCREASE IN JOBS WITH PROMOTION POTENTIAL, (7) INCREASE IN JOBS WHERE JOB TRAINING WAS AVAILABLE, AND (8) INCREASED TENURE WITH FIRMS HIRING INMATES UPON RELEASE.

FRAGMENTARY DATA SUGGEST THAT INCREASED COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXTENSION WOULD BE RELATIVELY SMALL IN RELATION TO THE COST OF THE ENTIRE GROUP INSURANCE PLAN.

TYPICALLY, THE ISSUE OF EXTENDED LAYOFF COVERAGE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE BARGAINING TABLE BY THE UNION AS A PART OF A HEALTH INSURANCE PACKAGE DEMAND, BUT THE BENEFIT HAS AT TIMES BEEN INITIATED BY  MANAGEMENT.

APPROXIMATELY 8.5 MILLION WORKERS, OR ABOUT 13 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, ARE EMPLOYED IN PRODUCER SERVICES. DURING THE 1950-60 DECADE, EMPLOYMENT IN PRODUCER SERVICES SHOWED A GROWTH RATE OF 21.3 PERCENT COMPARED TO 15.2 IN TOTAL EMPLOYMENT. ABOUT 23 PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL INCOME WAS GENERATED IN THE PRODUCER SERVICES WHILE CONSUMER SERVICES INDUSTRIES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF TOTAL EMPLOYMENT AND GENERATED ONLY 37 PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL INCOME. THE FELT NEED OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY FOR LONG-RANGE PLANNING IS RESULTING IN GREATER USE OF CONSULTATIVE  TYPES OF PRODUCER SERVICES, AND THE EXISTENCE OF DEVELOPED PRODUCER SERVICE INDUSTRIES ENCOURAGES THE ESTABLISHMENT AND GROWTH OF FIRMS WHICH USE SUCH SERVICES. THE PRODUCER SERVICES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOTH AS A CATALYTIC AGENT AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, AS AN INITIATING FACTOR BECAUSE THEY REDUCE THE COST OF FUNCTIONS FORMERLY PERFORMED INTERNALLY, PERMIT MANAGEMENT TO SPECIALIZE IN PRIMARY AREAS OF ACTIVITIES OF THE FIRM, AND MAKE INNOVATIONS POSSIBLE. WITH SPECIFIC REGARD TO MANPOWER PROBLEMS, RESEARCH IN PRODUCER SERVICES IS NEEDED ON THE NATURE AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT IN FIRMS SUPPLYING DIFFERENT KINDS OF SERVICES AND IN INDUSTRIES SUPPLYING SERVICES TO ANOTHER FIRM OR CONSUMER.

SOME KEY FINDINGS OF THE STUDY ARE  (1) THE POLICEMAN AND THE PRESIDENT ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT CONTACT POINTS FOR THE CHILD'S GROWING ACQUAINTANCE WITH GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY. (2) THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE IS RECOGNIZED QUITE EARLY. (3) PUBLIC AUTHORITY IS AT FIRST PERSONALIZED, BUT BECOMES MORE INSTITUTIONALIZED BY THE FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADES.

THE MODEL TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE LEVEL OF LOCALLY RAISED EXPENDITURES FOR EDUCATION IN EACH STATE COULD BE PREDICTED BETTER WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF EACH STATE'S TOTAL POPULATION IN EACH OF NINE AGE BRACKETS THAN WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION. THE STUDY WAS RESTRICTED TO FORTY-EIGHT STATES FOR THE YEARS 1930, 1940, 1950, AND 1960. THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES CONSISTED OF THE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION OF EACH STATE WITHIN NINE SELECTED AGE INTERVALS FOR EACH OF THESE YEARS. THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE WAS DEFINED AS LOCALLY DERIVED CURRENT EXPENDITURES PER PUPIL IN ADA FOR  ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL INSTRUCTION. THE MODEL, WITH GROSS ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTIC VARIABLES AND COHORT EFFECT VARIABLES CONTROLLED, YIELDED A MULTIPLE R OF .8194. THUS, THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES EXPLAINED ABOUT 67 PERCENT OF THE VARIANCE IN THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE. RESTRICTED MODELS WERE ALSO DEVELOPED BY OMITTING PARTICULAR VECTORS FROM THE MODEL. PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL EXPENDITURES WERE FOUND TO BE RELATED TO POPULATION AGE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STATES.

THREE TYPES OF EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS MEASURES ARE USED--STUDENT GROUP-ORIENTED, SCHOOL-ORIENTED, AND COMMUNITY-ORIENTED.

MEDIAN TESTS REVEALED THAT DIFFERENCES SIGNIFICANT AT THE .01 LEVEL EXISTED BETWEEN THE SPEECH HANDICAPPED AND THE NON SPEECH HANDICAPPED IN REGARD TO IQ, MA, AND CA. THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPEECH BY MA LEVELS OF THE RETARDATES COULD CLOSELY ALIGN WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOUNDS BY CA OF NORMAL CHILDREN WAS REJECTED. THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE SEVERITY OF ARTICULATION HANDICAPS IS A FUNCTION OF MA AND CA WAS ACCEPTED. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND THE CONTROL OF PLACEBO GROUP WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT.  SPEECH THERAPY WAS FOUND TO HAVE NO MORE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SOUND ERROR REDUCTION THAN DID MATURATION. DATA ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF SEX TO ERROR REDUCTION WAS NOT FOUND SIGNIFICANT.

THE CHILD'S DISABILITY DEPENDS ON THE CHILD AND ON THE TASK AND ON THE LEARNING SITUATION. AN EXPERIMENTAL CLASSROOM IN MADISON IS DESCRIBED.

THE DYSLEXIC CHILD IS USED AS AN EXAMPLE OF LEARNING DISABILITY. GUIDING PRINCIPLES INCLUDE--STARTING WITH THE MOST BASIC ELEMENT WITH WHICH THE CHILD HAS TROUBLE, MAKING THE STEPS SMALL ENOUGH (90 PERCENT CORRECT RESPONSES), AVOIDING NEGATIVE LEARNING AND CONFUSION.

SEVERAL DEVICES AND COMBINATIONS OF DEVICES WERE USED DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD. THE DEVICE FINALLY DEVELOPED, REFERRED TO AS THE AUDIO-VISUAL MANIPULATIVE (AVM) DESK, PRESENTS INFORMATION ON A SCREEN THROUGH THE USE OF A SLIDE PROJECTOR. AUDIO MESSAGES ARE TRANSMITTED THROUGH EARPHONES AND A SPEAKER, AND THE CHILD MANIPULATES OBJECTS OR WRITES ON THE RESPONSE SURFACE. TWENTY-ONE DIFFERENT SEQUENTIAL ARITHMETIC PROGRAMS WERE  DEVELOPED FOR THE DESK FOR TEACHING EMH CHILDREN SKILL SEQUENCES IN ARITHMETIC. DESK ADMINISTERED TESTS WERE ALSO DEVELOPED TO ASSESS THE CHILD'S UNDERSTANDING OF THESE CONCEPTS. OTHER MATERIALS DEVELOPED INCLUDE--(1) A MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS FOR TEACHERS (WHICH INCLUDES THE PROGRAM OBJECTIVES) AND (2) REINFORCEMENT MATERIALS FOR CLASSROOM USE.

FIVE DIFFERENT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO SPEECH AND HEARING CENTERS, SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF, TEACHERS OF THE DEAF, AND AUDIOLOGISTS. THE SURVEYS WERE DESIGNED TO--(1) ASSESS THE AMOUNT OF AUDIOLOGY IN TEACHER OF THE DEAF TRAINING PROGRAMS AND EDUCATION IN AUDIOLOGY TRAINING PROGRAMS, (2) DETERMINE TYPES OF AUDIOLOGIC SERVICES PROVIDED THE DEAF IN SPEECH AND HEARING CLINICS AND IN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR THE DEAF, AND (3) EXAMINE THE ATTITUDES OF AUDIOLOGISTS AND TEACHERS TOWARD THEIR TRAINING AND TOWARD EACH OTHER. THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUDIOLOGY AND EDUCATION OF  THE DEAF WHICH MET IN DECEMBER 1964 FORMULATED 29 SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS DEALING WITH IMPROVEMENT IN TRAINING, SERVICES, AND INTERPROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS. THE LAST PHASE OF THE PROJECT WAS A REGIONAL MEETING HELD IN WHITE PLAINS, NEW YORK, TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF OTHER REGIONAL MEETINGS. THE GENERAL CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THE PROJECT WERE--(1) THERE SHOULD BE A GREATER EMPHASIS ON DEAF EDUCATION IN AUDIOLOGY TRAINING PROGRAMS AND A GREATER EMPHASIS ON AUDIOLOGY IN TEACHER OF THE DEAF TRAINING PROGRAMS, (2) INCREASED COOPERATION BETWEEN AUDIOLOGISTS AND TEACHERS OF THE DEAF IS NECESSARY AT ALL REHABILITATION FACILITIES TO IMPROVE AUDIOLOGIC SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS. APPENDIXES PRESENT THE FIVE QUESTIONNAIRES USED, A LIST OF PARTICIPANTS, AND A LIST OF RESOLUTIONS ACTED  UPON AT THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUDIOLOGY AND EDUCATION OF THE DEAF.

        "description":"THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED AS A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING PROGRAMED LEARNING MATERIALS WITH BLIND STUDENTS. FOUR TYPES OF STIMULUS-REPONSE MODES FOR PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION WERE DEVELOPED--AUDIO STIMULUS-AUDIO RESPONSE, AUDIO STIMULUS-BRAILLE RESPONSE, BRAILLE STIMULUS-AUDIO RESPONSE, BRAILLE STIMULUS-BRAILLE RESPONSE. A PILOT TESTING PROGRAM REVEALED THE BRAILLE STIMULUS-BRAILLE RESPONSE MODE WAS MOST APPROPRIATE. TESTS DETERMINED THAT THE MOST EFFICIENT BRAILLE STIMULUS-BRAILLE RESPONSE FORMAT WAS A BOOKLET IN WHICH THE BRAILLE FRAME APPEARED ON ONE PAGE AND THE CORRECT RESPONSE ON THE NEXT. THE STUDENT RESPONDED WITH A BRAILLE WRITER OR BRAILLE SLATE AND STYLUS. COMMERCIALLY DEVELOPED PROGRAMS FOR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE WERE MODIFIED FOR  USE WITH BLIND STUDENTS. TWO 50 FRAME PROGRAMS REPRODUCED IN BRAILLE WERE TESTED WITH 57 BLIND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. RESULTS SHOWED THEY COULD HANDLE THESE PROGRAMED MATERIALS IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME AND WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY. INSTRUCTIONS WERE FOLLOWED WITH MINIMAL DIFFICULTY. PERFORMANCE IMPROVED WITH SECOND BOOK. IN MODIFYING THE PROGRAM FOR USE WITH THE BLIND, 32 SYMBOLS WERE DEVELOPED FOR THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED SCIENCE TERMS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE BULK OF BRAILLE MATERIALS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER BLIND STUDENTS COULD DISCRIMINATE AMONG THE SYMBOLS AND BETWEEN THE SYMBOLS AND BRAILLE, 43 BLIND STUDENTS (GRADES SIX TO TEN) WERE GIVEN TESTS IN THE FORM OF CHECKERS AND CHECKERBOARDS WHICH CONTAINED THE VARIOUS SPECIAL SCIENCE SYMBOLS. STUDENT SCORES IMPROVED AS IQ  ROSE, JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS SCORED BETTER THAN SIXTH GRADERS AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REACTED NEGATIVELY AND DID NOT DO WELL. ON SECOND TRIALS STUDENTS REQUIRED LESS TIME AND SCORED FEWER ERRORS.

        "description":"A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF THE TEACHING-LEARNING PROCESS USES A SYSTEMS APPROACH TO ALLOW COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF THE INTERACTION OF THE VARIABLES. THE PROCESS INCLUDES A TEACHING-LEARNING ENVIRONMENT, COMPOSED OF VARIABLES IN A CURRICULUM MODULE, THE INDIVIDUAL LEARNER AND HIS CHARACTERISTIC VARIABLES, AND INTERACTION OF THESE TWO THROUGH A TEACHING-LEARNING CYCLE. ONE SYSTEMS ORGANIZER, OR STATEMENT OF EDUCATIONAL GOALS, CORRESPONDS TO EACH MODULE AND TO A CURRICULUM MAP THAT LOCATES THE MODULE ACCORDING TO SEQUENCE OF DIFFICULTY AND LEVEL OF LEARNING. EACH MODULE CONSISTS OF VARIABLES RELATING TO A SPECIFIC BEHAVIORAL OBJECTIVE, THE LEARNING CONTENT, AND THE LEARNING PROCESS. MODULES PROVIDE INFORMATION USED TO MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING THE LEARNER AND HIS ENVIRONMENT. THE  TEACHING-LEARNING CYCLE PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISIONS. TEACHERS USE 2 COMPUTER DATA-FILES OF CURRICULUM MODULES AND INDIVIDUAL STUDENT CHARACTERISTICS TO MAKE INSTRUCTIONAL DECISIONS. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MODEL WILL REQUIRE RESTRUCTURING OF THE CURRICULUM BY A TEAM OF EDUCATORS, AND INSERVICE TEACHER TRAINING. THE TEACHER'S NEW ROLE WILL BE AS TUTOR AND CONSULTANT ON LEARNING ACTIVITIES. AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LANGUAGE ARTS CURRICULUM IS THE FOCUS OF A PILOT PROJECT FOR THIS MODEL. (LH)",

IN THE SUMERIAN GAME, STUDENTS SEATED AT THE TYPEWRITER TERMINALS PRETENDED TO BE PRIEST-RULERS IN ANCIENT SUMER. IN THE SIERRA LEONE GAME, THE STUDENT PLAYED AN A.I.D. OFFICER. THE THIRD GAME, FREE ENTERPRISE, HAS BEEN COMPLETED BUT NOT TESTED. RESULTS OBTAINED BY OBSERVATION, INTERVIEW, PRE- AND POSTTESTING OF STUDENTS SHOWED THAT (1) GRADE 6 STUDENTS ARE TECHNICALLY ABLE TO PLAY COMPUTER-BASED ECONOMICS GAMES, (2) THE GAMES WERE AT LEAST AS EFFECTIVE AS CONVENTIONAL INSTRUCTION, (3) THE CONTROL  GROUP RETAINED AN UNDERSTANDING OF ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES LONGER THAN THE EXPERIMENTALS, (4) THE AVERAGE EXPERIMENTAL TIME WAS ABOUT HALF THE CONTROL LEARNING TIME, (5) STUDENTS WITH HIGHER INTELLIGENCE AND READING ABILITY GAINED MORE FROM THE GAMES, (6) STUDENTS SPENDING THE LEAST TIME AT THE COMPUTER MADE THE GREATEST GAINS, (7) STUDENT INTEREST WAS HIGH. THE SUMERIAN AND SIERRA LEONE GAMES MAY BE PLAYED WHERE A 1401 COMPUTER WITH OPERATING TERMINALS IS LOCATED. OTHER FINDINGS ARE ALSO MENTIONED.

FIRST, THE ROLE OF TEACHING DEVICES SHOULD BE MAJOR BECAUSE THEIR SUCCESS COULD RESULT IN ECONOMIC AND MANPOWER ADVANTAGES WHICH USUALLY HAVE TO AWAIT A NEW GENERATION OF TEACHERS TRAINED IN A GIVEN DISCIPLINE. LESS THAN FULL USE OF DEVICES COULD LEAD TO DEPENDENCE ON TRADITIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES OFTEN BASED MORE ON WHIM THAN ON PSYCHOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE. SECOND, TEACHING DEVICES PROVIDE EXCELLENT RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPLORE INNOVATIONS IN TEACHING AND ALLOW COLLABORATION OF EDUCATORS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS. THIRD, THE SELECTION OF APPROPRIATE DEVICES DEPENDS MOST HIGHLY ON THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS--ABILITY TO PRESENT AUDITORY AND VISUAL STIMULI TO THE STUDENT, PROVISION FOR A MEANS OF RESPONDING, AND  CONFIRMATION OF THE STUDENT'S RESPONSES. ALSO IMPORTANT ARE FLEXIBILITY IN PRESENTATION OF LESSON MATERIALS, EASILY AND INEXPENSIVELY PREPARED MATERIALS, SIMPLICITY, RELIABILITY, ECONOMY, AND TIME.

CURRENT INTEREST DEMANDS A MODIFICATION OF THE AUDIOLINGUAL APPROACH TO INCLUDE TRAINING, AS SOON AS PEDAGOGICALLY FEASIBLE, IN ALL FOUR LANGUAGE SKILLS. INCREASED ENROLLMENTS AND EXTENDED STUDY SEQUENCES HAVE FORCED STUDENT PLACEMENT TO BE BASED ON DEMONSTRATED PROFICIENCY RATHER THAN ON LENGTH OF STUDY. THE LARGE NUMBER OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS NEEDED TO EXECUTE THESE CHANGES NECESSITATES IMMEDIATE ACTION IN THE FIELDS OF TEACHER RECRUITMENT, PREPARATION, CERTIFICATION, AND PLACEMENT. THE GREAT POSSIBILITIES FOR FOREIGN CONTACTS HAVE TRIGGERED MASS TRAVEL ABROAD BY LANGUAGE TEACHERS, HAVE CAUSED THE PROLIFERATION OF STUDENT EXCHANGE  PROGRAMS, AND HAVE MADE THE PROFESSION BROADEN ITS HORIZONS TO INCLUDE THE STUDY OF NON-WESTERN LANGUAGES. IF THE PROFESSION ANSWERS THE CHALLENGES BY FOLLOWING THE ENERGETIC LEADERSHIP OF STATE, REGIONAL, AND LOCAL SUPERVISORS AND CONSULTANTS AND BY SUPPORTING SUCH UNIFYING ORGANIZATIONS AS THE AMERICAN COUNCIL ON THE TEACHING OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES, THE NEW POPULARITY OF LANGUAGE STUDY WILL NOT DIMINISH. THIS PAPER WAS DELIVERED AT THE MLA OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SPRING CONFERENCE (SANTA BARBARA, APRIL 29, 1967), AND WAS PUBLISHED IN &quot;THE FORUM,&quot; VOLUME 5, NUMBER 4, JUNE 1967, PAGES 9-12.

THE FIRST OF THESE, A HYPOTHESIS OF LANGUAGE ACQUISITION, MAY BE ORIENTED TOWARD THE COGNITIVE APPROACH OR THE PERCEPTIVE APPROACH OR MAY REFLECT THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE BEHAVIORIST. THE SECOND, A MODEL OF GRAMMAR, MAY BE THE PRODUCT OF THE TRADITIONALIST, THE STRUCTURALIST, THE TRANSFORMATIONALIST OR THE TAGMEMICIST. THESE THEORETICIANS IN TURN INFLUENCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE THIRD CONCEPT, A STRATEGY FOR LANGUAGE TEACHING THAT TAKES IN ALL OF THE VARIETIES OF THE \"DIRECT METHOD\" AS WELL AS THE CONTRASTIVE LINGUISTIC SYSTEM. NO ONE OF THESE THEORIES EXPLAINS ALL GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES, BUT TRANSFORMATIONAL-GENERATIVE GRAMMAR SEEMS TO HAVE MORE LOGIC AND FEWER LIMITATIONS THAN THE OTHERS. THEREFORE, IT IS PREFERABLE  TO FOLLOW AN ECLECTIC PLAN BASED ON A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF ALL SYSTEMS USED.

THE PLAN PROVIDES FOR ESTABLISHING NOT MORE THAN 22 JUNIOR COLLEGE AREAS, WHICH SHOULD PUT A JUNIOR COLLEGE WITHIN REASONABLE COMMUTING DISTANCE OF EVERY POTENTIAL STUDENT IN THE STATE. CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING COMMUNITY JUNIOR COLLEGE AREAS ARE (1) THE EXISTENCE OF POST-HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS NOT BEING MET BY EXISTING INSTITUTIONS, (2) THE EFFECT OF A NEW COLLEGE ON THE PROGRAMS OF EXISTING INSTITUTIONS, (3) THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL STUDENTS, AND (4) AN ADEQUATE FINANCIAL BASE. A FEASIBILITY STUDY MUST BE COMPLETED AND THE REPORT MUST BE APPROVED BY THE STATE PRIOR TO A LOCAL ELECTION TO ESTABLISH A  COMMUNITY JUNIOR COLLEGE DISTRICT. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CURRICULUM MUST BE COMPREHENSIVE, PROVIDING (1) TRANSFER PROGRAMS, (2) VOCATIONAL EDUCATION TO PROVIDE PRE-ENTRY, TRADE EXTENSION, AND RETRAINING COURSES, (3) COURSES IN GENERAL EDUCATION DESIGNED TO MEET INDIVIDUAL NEEDS, AND (4) SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN PUBLIC SERVICES.

ACCREDITATION IS DEFINED AS THE RECOGNITION OF THE ACADEMIC  RESPECTABILITY OF AN INSTITUTION THAT MEETS STANDARDS OF ACHIEVEMENT ESTABLISHED BY A COMPETENT AGENCY. THERE ARE PRESENTLY SIX ACCREDITING ASSOCIATIONS, WITH SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. FIVE ADVANTAGES OF ACCREDITATION ARE (1) ITS RECOGNITION AS THE MARK OF QUALITY FOR MORE THAN LOCAL ACCEPTANCE, (2) THE INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS WITHIN A REGION FOR THE BETTERMENT OF ALL THE INSTITUTIONS, (3) SUPPORT IN THE SEARCH FOR FUNDS, (4) THE PROTECTION GIVEN BY THE ASSOCIATION TO ALL EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS, TO THE MAINTENANCE OF HIGH STANDARDS, AND TO THE PUBLIC AGAINST MISREPRESENTATION, AND (5) STUDIES AND PROGRAMS SPONSORED BY THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL.

THIS IS DUE, IN PART, TO THE PAUCITY OF SIGNIFICANT RESULTS AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, TO THE SHOCKINGLY DISRUPTIVE CHARACTER OF THE SOCIAL ATTITUDES IN THE AREA. FOR EXAMPLE, ALTHOUGH THE HEAD START STAFF WAS SUFFICIENTLY BUSY RECRUITING PUPILS AND PREPARING LESSONS AND CLASSROOM FACILITIES, IT BECAME ALSO NECESSARY THAT THEY GUARD THESE FACILITIES FROM VANDALISM AND ARSON. ALSO, THE STAFF WAS MADE AWARE OF THE THREAT TO NEGRO PARENTS THAT THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS IF THEIR CHILDREN WERE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. IN SHORT THE GENERAL WHITE  ATTITUDE WAS UNCOOPERATIVE AND HOSTILE, AND THE NEGRO ATTITUDE WAS FEARFUL. NEVERTHELESS, THE READING-READINESS PROGRAM WAS CARRIED THROUGH, AND SOME RESULTS WERE OBTAINED. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT BOTH THE ALLYN AND BACON AND THE ASHTON-WARNER METHODS OF TEACHING READING WERE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE PHONETIC METHOD.

A FURTHER AIM WAS TO DISCOVER PATTERNS OF LANGUAGE PERFORMANCE AMONG THE FIVE DIFFERING ETHNIC GROUPS. THE INVESTIGATORS RECRUITED AND TRAINED TWELVE RESEARCH ASSISTANTS OR LIBRARIANS WHO WERE COLLEGE STUDENTS. EACH LIBRARIAN WAS PROVIDED WITH A STANDARD KIT OF TEN BOOKS OF THREE TYPES (1) BOOKS OF ETHNIC IDENTIFICATION, (2) NON-VERBAL BOOKS, AND (3) CLASSIC CHILDREN'S BOOKS. DURING THE LAST PART OF THE PROGRAM, THE LIBRARIANS READ ABBREVIATED VERSIONS OF TWO SELECTED STORIES TO  THE CHILDREN AND HAD EACH CHILD RETELL BOTH STORIES. IT SEEMED THAT THE INCLUSION OF ETHNIC BOOKS IS USEFUL IN A PROGRAM AIMED AT NON-WHITE CHILDREN. (COD)",

RESULTS OF TESTING DURING THE HEAD START PROGRAM SHOWED SUBSTANTIAL GAIN IN ALL PERFORMANCE AREAS BETWEEN THE TWO TESTING PERIODS. NO CONTROL GROUP WAS USED. THEREFORE, NO EXPERIMENTALLY BASED CONCLUSION COULD BE MADE AS TO WHETHER THE GAIN WAS DUE TO THE HEAD START  EXPERIENCE OR TO A SIMPLE PASSAGE OF TIME AND RESULTING GENERAL DEVELOPMENT. MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE AFTER THE SUBJECTS ENTERED SCHOOL SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT GAINS BY HEAD START PUPILS OVER NON-HEAD START PUPILS. THE ONLY REAL DISTINCTION WAS IN SCHOOL ATTENDANCE, IN WHICH HEAD START PUPILS DID BETTER. THE FACT THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS SHOWED HIGH GAINS DURING THE HEAD START PROGRAM BUT FAILED TO EVIDENCE SUCH GAINS IN THE FORMAL SCHOOL SITUATION WAS EXPLAINED IN PART AS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CHILDREN WERE EMOTIONALLY UNREADY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEAD START PROGRAM TO BE TESTED BY RELATIVE STRANGERS IN UNFAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS.

NINETEEN TESTERS WHO FULFILLED SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS WERE CHOSEN TO ADMINISTER THE TESTS. IN ALL, 964 CHILDREN IN 72 CENTERS WERE TESTED. TESTS AND SCALES USED AND BRIEFLY DISCUSSED WERE THE PEABODY PICTURE VOCABULARY TEST, THE REVISED PRE-SCHOOL INVENTORY, THE BEHAVIOR INVENTORY, THE VINELAND SOCIAL MATURITY SCALE, AND THE DRAW-A-PERSON TEST.  RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TESTS. FROM ANALYSIS OF TEST SCORES IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO RELIABLE EVIDENCE OF AN AVERAGE DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE RELATED TO LENGTH OF PROGRAM ATTENDANCE.

FOUR TYPES OF DATA WERE USED, (1) PERSONAL RESEARCH INTO THE PUEBLO'S HISTORY, (2) TESTS AND OBSERVATIONS OF 50 INDIAN CHILDREN OF ALL AGES, (3) INFORMATION ABOUT SPECIFIC HEAD START FAMILIES, AND (4) INTERVIEWS WITH SAN JUAN RESIDENTS. SPANISH INFLUENCE UPON INDIAN LIFE DATING FROM THE 16TH CENTURY IS RELATED TO CURRENT AGRICULTURAL, MORAL, ECONOMIC, HEALTH, GOVERNMENTAL, RELIGIOUS, AND EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS. FORMAL EDUCATION IS REGARDED AS DESIRABLE BY THE INDIANS, BUT TEN PERCENT OF ALL SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN ARE NOT IN SCHOOL, AND THE DROP-OUT RATE IS HIGH. BECAUSE OF ILLITERACY, RESIGNATION TO THE STATE OF  THINGS AS THEY ARE, POOR COMMUNICATION, AND APATHY WITHIN THE PUEBLO, THE TYPICAL INDIAN CHILD WAS NOT REACHED BY THE 1965 ESPANOLA VALLEY SUMMER HEAD START PROGRAM. FUNDS ACCOMMODATED 45 CHILDREN, SEVEN OF WHOM WERE FROM SAN JUAN. HOWEVER, THEY WERE CHILDREN TO WHOM LOCAL ADVANTAGES WERE ALREADY ACCESSIBLE. PARALLEL TO THE HEAD START PROGRAM, THE AUTHOR CONDUCTED A TWO-WEEK EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM IN HIS HOME, ASCERTAINING THAT THE COMMUNITY THINKS THAT HEAD START IS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION TO ALL EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS. RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH TRIBAL LEADERS, PARENTS, TEACHERS, AND A CLERGYMAN INCLUDE EMPHASIS UPON TRIBAL SPONSORSHIP, LONGER DURATION OF PROGRAMS, TEACHERS TRAINED IN UNDERSTANDING INDIANS, INDIAN MATERIALS AND AUDIO-VISUAL AIDS, MODERN MEDICAL PRACTICES,  ENGLISH, PROVISION FOR SLOW LEARNERS, EXTRA-TRIBAL SOCIAL ACTIVITIES, AND UNANIMOUS PARTICIPATION OF TRIBAL CHILDREN.

USING THE 5,075 NINTH GRADE NEGRO STUDENTS FROM A SAMPLE OF SCHOOLS SELECTED IN THE METROPOLITAN AREAS OF NEW ENGLAND AND MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES, WHO HAD ATTENDED THEIR PRESENT SCHOOL IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR, THREE VARIABLES WERE ASSIGNED. THE AUTHOR CONSTRUCTED A SIX-LEVEL FAMILY SCALE BASED ON MOTHER'S EDUCATION AND FAMILY POSSESSIONS, A FOUR-CATEGORY RATING BASED ON THE PERCENT OF WHITE STUDENTS IN THE NINTH GRADE OF THE STUDENT'S SCHOOL, AND A FOUR-CATEGORY RATING BASED ON THE PROPORTION OF WHITE CLASSMATES. THE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA INDICATED THAT--(1) THE EFFECTS OF SCHOOL DESEGREGATION ON  ACHIEVEMENT CAN BE OFFSET BY SEGREGATION WITHIN THE SCHOOL, (2) CLASSROOM DESEGREGATION HAS AN APPARENT BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON VERBAL ACHIEVEMENT OF NEGRO STUDENTS IRRESPECTIVE OF RACIAL ENROLLMENT OF THE SCHOOL, AND (3) THE DIFFERENCES IN VERBAL ACHIEVEMENT BETWEEN NEGRO STUDENTS IN MOSTLY WHITE CLASSES AND THOSE IN MOSTLY NEGRO CLASSES IS NOT EXPLAINED BY SELECTION PROCESSES WHICH OPERATE WITHIN THE SCHOOL.

        "description":"ALTHOUGH RURAL EDUCATION HAS MANY ADVANTAGES, AMERICAN RURAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS ARE NOT CAPITALIZING UPON THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED THEM. WHILE MANY RURAL SCHOOLS HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST TWO DECADES, MOST DO HAVE LIBRARIES AND LABORATORIES. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY IS NOT SERVED BY SPECIALIZED CLASSES IN VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION, PROGRAMS FOR BLIND OR DEAF STUDENTS, LEARNING CENTERS, OR TEACHERS WHO ARE INQUISITIVE ENOUGH TO EXPLORE NEW AND DIFFERENT INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACHES TO PROVIDE MORE MEANINGFUL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES. MANY TIMES RURAL AREAS DO NOT BENEFIT FROM HIGH QUALITY TEACHERS BECAUSE THESE TEACHERS ARE LURED AWAY BY MORE DESIRABLE WAGES AND LIVING CONDITIONS IN URBAN AREAS. ALL OF THESE REASONS, PLUS THE FACT THAT MOST  RURAL SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE A KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM, LEAD TO RURAL STUDENTS' DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL AT AN EARLY AGE. CONSEQUENTLY, RURAL YOUTH ARE NOT BEING PREPARED TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THEIR FUTURE ENVIRONMENTS. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE NATIONAL OUTLOOK CONFERENCE ON RURAL YOUTH, OCTOBER 24, 1967, WASHINGTON, D. C., SPONSORED JOINTLY BY THE U. S.

        "description":"THE MAYO STATE VOCATIONAL-TECHNICAL SCHOOL WAS ESTABLISHED AT PAINTSVILLE, KENTUCKY IN 1938. IT IS LOCATED IN A RURAL AREA OF KENTUCKY WHERE COAL MINING HAS PROVIDED JOBS FOR MANY FAMILIES. IN RECENT YEARS, DEPLETION OF COAL AND MECHANIZATION OF MINING HAVE BEEN MAJOR FACTORS CAUSING UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS AREA. THE MAYO SCHOOL HAS SERVED TO PROVIDE SKILLS AND TRADES TO MANY OF THE BOYS AND GIRLS THROUGH THE MAIN CAMPUS AT PAINTSVILLE AND ITS SEVEN HIGH SCHOOL EXTENSION CENTERS IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. THESE CENTERS ENABLE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO COMPLETE ONE-HALF OF A TWO YEAR VOCATIONAL COURSE WHILE STILL ATTENDING HIGH SCHOOL. THROUGH CAREFUL PLANNING AND CORRELATION OF PROGRAMS, THE STUDENT MAY TRANSFER TO PAINTSVILLE AND COMPLETE HIS COURSE OF STUDY. STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED AT  THE PARENT INSTITUTION ACCORDING TO THE DATE SEQUENCE OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED. THE ONLY EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND REQUIRED FOR ADMITTANCE IS THE ABILITY TO READ INTELLIGENTLY. EMPHASES ARE PLACED ON THE INDIVIDUALIZATION OF CURRICULUM FOR EACH STUDENT AND ON INVOLVEMENT OF STUDENTS IN EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. THIS SPEECH WAS PRESENTED AT THE NATIONAL OUTLOOK CONFERENCE ON RURAL YOUTH, OCTOBER 23-26, WASHINGTON, D. C., SPONSORED JOINTLY BY THE U. S.

THIS CONSOLIDATED DISTRICT NOW HAS ONE HIGH SCHOOL (GRADES 9-12) WITH AN ENROLLMENT OF 1000 STUDENTS. AS A RESULT OF CONSOLIDATION, THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE NOW PROVIDED BETTER EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. SOME OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE--(1) INCREASED COURSE OFFERINGS, (2) ADDITIONAL COCURRICULAR ACTIVITIES, (3) MORE EFFECTIVE TEACHER UTILIZATION, (4) BETTER BALANCE IN CLASS SIZE, AND (5) ADDITIONAL STUDENT PERSONNEL SERVICES. TEST RESULTS SHOW THE SENIORS OF THE CONSOLIDATED HIGH SCHOOL ACHIEVING ONE GRADE LEVEL ABOVE THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE SMALL HIGH SCHOOLS PRIOR TO CONSOLIDATION. ALSO, MORE SENIORS ARE NOW ENROLLING IN  COLLEGE (NINE PER CENT). THE SPEAKER CONCLUDES THAT THE CONSOLIDATED HIGH SCHOOL OFFERS AN ACADEMIC CLIMATE WITH AN INCREASED EMPHASIS ON STUDENT COMPETITION.

MANY OF THESE PEOPLE LIVE IN EXTREMELY POOR HOUSING, EXIST ON VITAMIN DEFICIENT DIETS, AND ARE SURROUNDED BY A SEA OF FILTH AND DEBRIS. DISEASE RUNS RAMPANT AMONG THE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEIR UNDERNOURISHED BODIES HAVE LOW RESISTANCE, AND MEDICAL SERVICES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE. ALTHOUGH TWO FEDERAL FOOD PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED, THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES WHERE NEITHER OF THESE PROGRAMS IS ADEQUATE. FOR THESE CHILDREN WHO SUFFER MALNUTRITION IN EARLY CHILDHOOD, THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF NORMAL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT. THEY ARE DENIED THE HOPE OF DEVELOPING THEIR HUMAN POTENTIAL FOR COMPETING IN THE COMPLEX AND  DEMANDING SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY MUST LIVE.

        "description":"MANY OF THE DIVERSE EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR YEARS, BUT HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO LAY DORMANT. SOCIO-ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGEMENT IS EXHIBITED IN AREAS OF INCOME, UNEMPLOYMENT, SCHOOL DROPOUT RATE, EXPECTED LIFE SPAN, INFANT MORTALITY RATE, BIRTH RATE, AND HEALTH HISTORY. COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS BLOCK THE TEACHING-LEARNING EFFORT. THE SOCIAL SCIENTISTS' INTEREST IN ACCULTURATING THE INDIAN INTO THE AMERICAN NORM IS SEEN AS BEING FOCUSED UPON THE CHILDREN - THOSE WHO CAN LEAST RESIST IT. EFFORTS BY FIVE REGIONAL EDUCATIONAL LABORATORIES ARE DIRECTED TOWARD SOLVING SOME OF THE IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS. NEEDS REMAINING TO BE MET INCLUDE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT, COMPENSATORY INNOVATION, SUBJECT COVERAGE, CROSS-CULTURAL SENSITIVITY FOR TEACHERS,  INFORMATION CARRY-OVER, EVALUATION, SEPARATING EDUCATION FROM ETHNOCENTRISM, AND CORRELATING SCHOOL AND HOME LIFE.

EACH STAFF TEACHER WAS ASSIGNED TO HELP SIX INTERNING TEACHERS BY INTRODUCING THEM TO NEW IDEAS IN READING INSTRUCTION. FIFTY STAFF TEACHERS AND THEIR INTERNS WERE INVOLVED IN INSTRUCTION WHILE ANOTHER GROUP OF 50 TEACHERS AND THEIR INTERNS WORKED ON SELF-IMPROVEMENT, GUIDED STUDY, READING RESEARCH, AND PLANNING.

A PHILOSOPHY OF READING IS CONCERNED WITH THE NATURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, A PHILOSOPHY OF READING MUST CONSIDER THE NATURE AND DEMANDS OF THE CURRENT SOCIAL ORDER, AND, SO FAR AS POSSIBLE, IT MUST ATTEMPT TO PREDICT CHANGES THAT ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE DEMANDS OF THAT SOCIAL ORDER DURING THE LIFESPAN OF THE READER. OF CHIEF CONCERN IS THE IMPORTANCE OF MEANING AND HOW MEANING IS ACQUIRED. IT IS STRESSED THAT IN THE PERCEPTUAL PROCESS OF READING AND LISTENING, THE RAW MATERIALS FOR ALL MEANING MUST COME FROM EACH INDIVIDUAL'S  ENVIRONMENTALLY DELIMITED EXPERIENCES. THIS CALLS FOR MEETING THE NEEDS OF CULTURALLY DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN AS WELL AS THOSE OF MIDDLE-CLASS CHILDREN. SOME GOALS OF READING DEVELOPMENT AND PROPOSED METHODS FOR ATTAINING THEM ARE SUGGESTED. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL READING ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE (SEATTLE, MAY 4-6, 1967). (RH)",

A UNIQUENESS ANALYSIS BASED ON LARGE SAMPLES WAS USED TO OBTAIN ESTIMATES OF THE PERCENTAGE OF NONCHANCE VARIANCE. STUDENTS IN GRADE 12 NEAR PHILADELPHIA SERVED AS SUBJECTS FOR THE PRELIMINARY AND MAIN STUDIES. EIGHT READING COMPREHENSION SKILLS WERE TESTED. IN THE PRELIMINARY STUDY, TWO PARALLEL FORMS OF THE TEST WERE ADMINISTERED TO APPROXIMATELY 400 STUDENTS. A POOL OF 24 ITEMS FOR EACH OF THE EIGHT SKILLS WAS ASSIGNED TO TWO PARALLEL FORMS OF THE TEST. APPROXIMATELY 1,000 STUDENTS TOOK BOTH FORMS  OF THE TEST WITH 1 OR 2 DAYS INTERVENING. INTERCORRELATIONS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT COMPREHENSION AMONG MATURE READERS IS NOT A UNITARY MENTAL SKILL OR OPERATION. IT IS POINTED OUT THAT SYSTEMATIC LEARNING EXERCISES APPROPRIATE IN LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY FOR EACH PUPIL SHOULD BE PROVIDED.

        "description":"THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE PIAGET CONCEPT OF CONSERVATION WITH REGARD TO THE CHILD'S CONCEPT OF THE PROPERTY OF LIQUIDS. AN INVESTIGATOR-CONSTRUCTED CONSERVATION INVENTORY WAS GIVEN TO 45 KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE PUPILS SELECTED FROM THE PRAIRIE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, URBANA, ILLINOIS, TO PROVIDE AN INDEX OF THE CHILD'S UNDERSTANDING OF CONSERVATION. THIS INVENTORY EMPLOYED TASKS USING SOLID OBJECTS, VERBAL PREDICTION OF LIQUID BEHAVIOR, COMPENSATION PROBLEMS, AND THE MANIPULATION AND PREDICTION OF LIQUID TRANSFER. EACH CHILD WAS GIVEN THE PEABODY PICTURE VOCABULARY TEST (PPVT) IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH MENTAL COMPETENCE AND LEVEL. THIRTY CHILDREN WERE IDENTIFIED AS NONCONSERVERS AS A RESULT OF THE PRETESTS AND DIVIDED INTO 15 PAIRS MATCHED ON MENTAL AGE SCORES AND  ON THE PPVT. THE 15 EXPERIMENTAL CHILDREN WERE GIVEN FIVE DAYS OF TRAINING SESSIONS OF 15 TO 20 MINUTES PER DAY FOCUSING ON ESTABLISHING IN THE CHILD THE IDEAS OF (1) CONCEPTUAL INDEPENDENCE, AND (2) COMPENSATION. THE TRAINING WAS DONE IN SMALL GROUP INSTRUCTIONAL SESSIONS WITH THE EMPHASIS ON OBSERVATION BUT NOT ON ACTIVE PARTICIPATION. THE CONSERVATION INVENTORY AND THE PPVT WERE ALSO USED AS A POST-TEST. THE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA INDICATED (1) A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT ON THE CONSERVATION INVENTORY BY THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, AND (2) NO CHANGES ON THE PPVT. THE EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATION IS THAT THOSE PROPERTIES OF LIQUIDS THAT HAVE BEEN ASSUMED TO STAND FOR CONSERVATION CAN BE TAUGHT THROUGH INSTRUCTION. APPENDIXES INCLUDE (1) THE BASIC CONCEPTS TEST, AND (2) SPECIFIC TRAINING TASKS USED.  (DS)",

THE SAMPLE WAS COMPRISED OF FOURTH GRADE STUDENTS IN CLASSES SELECTED RANDOMLY FROM FOUR SCHOOLS IN THE HILLSBOROUGH TOWNSHIP PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ONE CLASS IN EACH SCHOOL WAS TAUGHT BY RECITATION-DEMONSTRATION METHODS, ONE BY PROJECT-RESEARCH METHODS WITHOUT INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS, AND ONE BY PROJECT-RESEARCH METHODS WITH INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. THE RECITATION-DEMONSTRATION GROUP WAS TAUGHT BY REGULAR  ASSIGNMENTS, QUESTION AND ANSWER RECITATIONS, AND DEMONSTRATIONS PERFORMED PREDOMINANTLY BY STUDENTS. THE PROJECT-RESEARCH GROUP COVERED THE SAME TOPICS, BUT THEY WERE GIVEN A GENERAL PROBLEM TO SOLVE. THE LATTER GROUP WAS ALSO GIVEN INQUIRY TRAINING SUCH AS THE &quot;YES-NO&quot; RESPONSE TECHNIQUE. THE GROUPS WERE PRETESTED AND POST-TESTED USING INVESTIGATOR CONSTRUCTED UNIT ACHIEVEMENT TESTS AND STEP SCIENCE TESTS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT (1) IN TERMS OF GROWTH IN SUBJECT MATTER KNOWLEDGE THE PROJECT-RESEARCH METHOD WITHOUT INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS APPEARS TO BE SUPERIOR TO THE PROJECT-RESEARCH METHOD WITH PROJECTS AND THE RECITATION-DEMONSTRATION METHOD, (2) MOST STUDENTS OF THIS AGE GROUP ARE NOT PREPARED TO HANDLE INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS OF THE TYPE USED IN THIS STUDY, AND (3) THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN METHODS AND GROWTH IN (A) PROBLEM SOLVING ABILITY, AND (B) WORK STUDY SKILLS.

        "description":"IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE RELATION BETWEEN SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE AND THE CHOICE OF TEACHING OR NONTEACHING COLLEGE PROGRAMS, A STUDY WAS MADE OF A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF VIRGINIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IN 1963, ENROLLED AS COLLEGE FRESHMEN. OF 1,960 SUCH PERSONS IN THE SAMPLE, 1184 (60 PERCENT) RESPONDED TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY INTENDED A TEACHING CAREER. SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE (SCAT) SCORES WERE SECURED FROM SCHOOL RECORDS. IT WAS FOUND THAT (1) THE MEAN OF SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE TEST SCORES FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES PLANNING TO BECOME TEACHERS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF THOSE ENTERING COLLEGE WHO PLANNED NONTEACHING CAREERS. (2) MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE SCORES WERE THE HIGHER PROPORTION OF THOSE PLANNING TO BECOME TEACHERS WHO SCORED  BELOW THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE AND THE HIGHER PROPORTION OF THOSE PLANNING NONTEACHING CAREERS WHO SCORED AT OR ABOVE THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE. (3) FORTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE BELOW THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE PLANNED TO BECOME TEACHERS, WHILE ONLY 28 PERCENT OF THOSE AT OR ABOVE THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE HAD SIMILAR VOCATIONAL PLANS. THE FINDINGS INDICATED THAT TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS DO NOT COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH OTHER FIELDS IN RECRUITING CAPABLE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES.

TESTING THE VALIDITY OF PREDICTORS OF TEACHER COMPETENCE IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT WOULD REQUIRE HIRING A SIZABLE RANDOM SAMPLE OF ALL WHO APPLY FOR POSITIONS, WITHOUT PRIOR SCREENING. FURTHER, TEACHER APTITUDE TESTS WRONGLY ASSUME THAT THE FACTORS IN SUCCESSFUL TEACHING OPERATE PRIOR TO THE START OF TEACHING IN A SPECIFIC SCHOOL OR SCHOOL SYSTEM. INSTEAD, TEACHING BEHAVIOR PROBABLY VARIES WITH THE TEACHING SITUATION. ACCORDINGLY, AN ACHIEVEMENT RATHER THAN A PREDICTIVE MODEL SHOULD BE USED IN HIRING NEW TEACHERS. PAST LEARNING (E.G., AS MEASURED BY COLLEGE GRADES) IS ONE SUCH MEASURE. TEACHING PERFORMANCE IS ANOTHER ACHIEVEMENT  MEASURE. THAT IS, IF, AFTER ONE YEAR, THE PROBATIONARY TEACHER HAS NOT LEARNED TO TEACH, HE SHOULD NOT BE REHIRED.

INTERVIEWS WITH 112 FACULTY MEMBERS PRODUCED 663 SPECIMEN STATEMENTS OF EXPERIENCES, FROM WHICH 31 POSITIVE AND 31 NEGATIVE ONES WERE SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF FREQUENCY OF MENTION AND APPLICABILITY TO MORALE. THEY WERE ARRANGED IN RANDOM ORDER IN CHECKLIST FORM AND SUBMITTED TO 512 FACULTY MEMBERS. THE 282 RESPONDENTS CHECKED THE EXPERIENCES APPLICABLE TO THEM AND RATED THEMSELVES ON AN 11-POINT MORALE SCALE. IT WAS FOUND THAT 3 POSITIVE STATEMENTS WERE CHECKED FOR EVERY  NEGATIVE ONE. ITEM ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED FIVE EXPERIENCES (MOST PROMINENTLY, SALARY INCREASE) AS BEING STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH MORALE AND 9 EXPERIENCES AS MOST STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOW MORALE. MORALE LEVEL WAS FOUND TO BE PREDICTABLE BY FORMULAE USING THE RATIO OF POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE STATEMENTS CHECKED, AGREEING WITH EARLIER FINDINGS IN THE DOMAIN OF STUDENT ATTITUDES TOWARD MATHEMATICS. FACTOR ANALYSIS OF THE 62 EXPERIENCE STATEMENTS YEILDED FOUR FACTORS.

CRITERION MEASURES ADMINISTERED INCLUDED THE ALLPORT-VERNON-LINDZEY STUDY OF VALUES (AUL), THE EDWARDS PERSONAL PREFERENCE SCHEDULE (EPPS), THE MINNESOTA TEACHER ATTITUDE INVENTORY (MTAI) AND THE CLASSROOM CLIMATE QUESTIONNAIRE (CCQ), A NEW MEASURE DESIGNED FOR THIS STUDY. DATA WAS COLLECTED THROUGH A NEW TECHNIQUE OF RANDOMIZED DATA GATHERING IN THE CLASSROOM. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS INVOLVED CANONICAL CORRELATIONS OF 29 TEACHER PERSONALITY MEASURES AND  18 CLASSROOM CLIMATE MEASURES. FINDINGS INCLUDED (A) TEACHERS WITH NEEDS FOR DEPENDENCE AND POWER, ORDER AND CHANGE HAD FORMAL, SUBSERVIENT CLASSES WITH LITTLE ANIMOSITY BETWEEN CLASS MEMBERS. (B) TEACHERS WITH NEEDS FOR INTERACTION (AGGRESSIVE AND AFFILIATIVE) HAD CONTROLLED, GOAL DIRECTED CLASSES (STUDENTS MAY FEEL LESS PERSONAL INTIMACY WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE TEACHER MAY MONOPOLIZE AFFECTIVE GROUP INTERACTION). AND (C) THE SELF-CENTERED TEACHER HAD A CLASS THAT WAS DISORGANIZED, CONSTRAINED, LOOSE IN STUDENT SUPERVISON, AND LOWER IN GROUP STATUS. (AF)",

THE SECOND-YEAR PROJECT CONTINUED THE USE OF THESE METHODS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD GRADES, BUT UTILIZED FOUR METHODS IN GRADES FOUR THROUGH SIX BY USING, IN SOME CLASSES, THE SCIENCE RESEARCH ASSOCIATES' SPELLING LABORATORY IN COMBINATION WITH EACH OF THE ORIGINAL METHODS. THE THIRD WAS A LONGITUDINAL STUDY BASED UPON DATA FROM THE OTHER TWO. THE INDIVIDUALIZED METHOD PROVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AT LEAST AS MUCH SPELLING GROWTH AS THE WHOLE-CLASS METHOD. HOWEVER, PRIMARY STUDENTS OF LOW  READING ABILITY APPEARED TO BENEFIT MORE FROM THE WHOLE-CLASS APPROACH. SYSTEMATIC, INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION IN SPELLING PRINCIPLES WAS FOUND TO BE VALUABLE IN CONJUNCTION WITH EITHER METHOD, PARTICULARLY IN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADES WITH STUDENTS OF MEDIUM OR LOW READING ABILITY.

AS AN EXTENSION OF ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED IN THE PROGRESS REPORT OF JUNE 1964, THE EXPERIMENT DESCRIBED HERE WAS DESIGNED (1) TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A SIMILAR PROGRAM ON FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENTS, AND (2) TO EXAMINE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRACTICE LISTENING SESSIONS CONTAINING NUMEROUS REST PERIODS AS COMPARED WITH UNINTERRUPTED LISTENING FOR LONGER PERIODS. THE NELSON-DENNY READING TEST WAS USED TO MEASURE READING COMPREHENSION, VOCABULARY, AND READING RATE, WHILE THE STEP LISTENING TEST WAS USED TO MEASURE NORMAL SPEED LISTENING SKILL. THE RESULTS  GENERALLY CONFIRMED THE EARLIER FINDINGS THAT LOSS AT APPROXIMATELY DOUBLE NORMAL SPEED IS NOT VERY GREAT. THE MEAN LOSS WITH LITTLE TRAINING IS LESS THAN 20 PERCENT OF NORMAL SPEED SCORE. THERE WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MEAN SCORE ON A VERY HIGH SPEED PASSAGE REPEATED AFTER TRAINING. THE CONCLUSIONS WERE THAT MALE AND FEMALE SUBJECTS DID NOT DIFFER IN THEIR LISTENING COMPREHENSION PERFORMANCE, NOR DID MORE FREQUENT REST BREAKS IMPROVE PERFORMANCE.

COMPARISONS WERE MADE BETWEEN THE RESPONSES OF FARMERS AND ADULT MEMBERS OF FARMERS' HOUSEHOLDS, AND FOUR LEVELS OF NONAGRICULTURAL WORKERS AND ADULT MEMBERS OF NONAGRICULTURAL HOUSEHOLDS--UPPER AND LOWER NONMANUAL AND UPPER AND LOWER MANUAL. THE FINDINGS GENERALLY SUPPORTED THE POPULAR STEREOTYPES, AND INDICATED THAT IN CONTRAST WITH MOST URBAN WORKERS, FARMERS ARE MORE TRADITIONAL IN RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND MORE ASCETIC, WORK-ORIENTED, PURITANICAL, PREJUDICED, ETHNOCENTRIC,  ISOLATIONIST, UNINFORMED, UNLIKELY TO READ BOOKS OR NEWSPAPERS, DISTRUSTFUL OF PEOPLE, INTOLERANT OF DEVIANCE, OPPOSED TO CIVIL LIBERTIES AND BIRTH CONTROL, AND FAVORABLE TO EARLY MARRIAGE AND HIGH FERTILITY. HOWEVER FARMERS' POLITICAL ATTITUDES AND INTERESTS RANKED BETWEEN URBAN MANUAL AND NONMANUAL WORKERS IN AUTHORITARIANISM. FARMERS' RESPONSES GENERALLY WERE MORE SIMILAR TO THE RESPONSES OF MANUAL WORKERS THAN TO THOSE OF NONMANUAL OR WHITE-COLLAR WORKERS. SOME OF THESE RURAL-URBAN DIFFERENCES MIGHT BE EITHER A REFLECTION OF PERVASIVE PROTESTANT INFLUENCE IN RURAL AREAS OR A RESULT OF THE SIZE, DENSITY, OR COMPOSITION OF THE POPULATION.

THE DECISION HAD PROFOUND EFFECTS ON DE FACTO SEGREGATION, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO THE DEMOCRATIC IDEALS OF EQUALITY AND TO THE DAMAGED SELF-IMAGE CREATED BY SEGREGATED SCHOOLS. IT POINTED THE WAY TO AN INVESTIGATION OF WHETHER OR NOT NORTHERN SCHOOL PATTERNS HAD THE SAME DETRIMENTAL EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS AS THOSE FOUND IN SOUTHERN SCHOOLS PREVIOUSLY SEGREGATED BY LAW. THE FINDING THAT SUCH EFFECTS DID EXIST LED TO POLITICAL PRESSURES FOR REMEDIAL ACTION AND TO FURTHER STUDY AND ACTION BY SOCIAL SCIENTISTS AND EDUCATORS. THE NEW YORK CITY HIGHER HORIZONS PROGRAM WAS A FIRST STEP TOWARD THE DESIGN OF A  PROGRAM TO INCREASE THE MOTIVATION, STANDARDS, AND ACHIEVEMENT OF MINORITY GROUP CHILDREN IN PREDOMINANTLY SEGREGATED SCHOOLS. FINDINGS FROM THIS PROJECT HAVE SHOWN THAT SUCH ENRICHMENT AND REMEDIATION, COUPLED WITH OPEN ENROLLMENT POLICIES, MUST BE MORE WIDELY INCORPORATED INTO THE GENERAL EDUCATIONAL PROCESS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ALTHOUGH RESEARCH IS STILL NEEDED ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE VERY EXISTENCE OF RACIALLY HOMOGENEOUS SCHOOLS HAS DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON TEACHER MORALE, CHILDREN'S SELF IMAGE, AND PARENTAL ATTITUDES, PROGRAMS MUST BE DEVELOPED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN GETTING AN INTEGRATED EDUCATION.

IMPLICATIONS FOR TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR THE VERY POOR AND FOR SOME BASIC AND ACTION RESEARCH FOLLOW THIS DISCUSSION. ONE OF THE BOOK'S MAJOR CONCLUSIONS IS THAT RESEARCH ON THE VERY POOR IS FRAGMENTARY AND THAT RESEARCHERS OFTEN NEGLECT INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITIES WITHIN GROUP TENDENCIES. THEN, BECAUSE MIDDLE-CLASS NORMS ARE APPLIED TO THE POOR, THESE PERSONS APPEAR TO BE PARTICULARLY MALADJUSTED, WHEN IN FACT MIDDLE  CLASS PATTERNS OF ADJUSTMENT MAY BE UNSUITABLE FOR LIFE IN POVERTY CONDITIONS. IT IS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT ALTHOUGH LOWER-CLASS FAMILIES ARE LESS STABLE THAN MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES, THEY STILL IN FACT ARE STABLE.

FUNCTIONING AS A SEMI-AUTONOMOUS UNIT WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM, MSD HAS AS ITS BASIC OBJECTIVES IMPROVING EDUCATIONAL QUALITY, SERVING THE SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY, STIMULATING SCHOOL-COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT, AND INITIATING ADMINISTRATIVE INNOVATIONS. ONE OF ITS SPECIAL GOALS HAS BEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE THE LEARNING POTENTIAL OF A TARGET POPULATION OF SOME 16,500 DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. PROGRAMMATIC INNOVATIONS INCLUDE STAFF DEVELOPMENT, CURRICULUM IMPROVEMENTS, NEW CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION, AND CULTURAL ENRICHMENT. OTHER MSD PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN THE AREAS OF TRAINING COLLEGE GRADUATES FOR URBAN TEACHING, EVOLVING A  CORPS OF &quot;PARAPROFESSIONALS&quot; TO BE ASSISTANTS AND AIDES, OPENING FIVE PRESCHOOL CENTERS, AND DEVELOPING THE MSD UNITS INTO &quot;COMMUNITY SCHOOLS.&quot; THREE NEW PROGRAMS WHICH ARE PLANNED ARE A COOPERATIVE COLLEGE-SCHOOL PROJECT, A RESIDENTIAL JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL, AND A HIGH SCHOOL COURSE IN DATA PROCESSING. EVALUATIONS OF MSD HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED BY INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONS AND BY THE DIVISION ITSELF. THE MAJOR DIFFICULTY FACED BY MSD IS THE CONSTANT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT FUNDING AND OTHER SUPPORT FROM THE BOARD OF EDUCATION. (NH)",

DATA WERE GATHERED FROM (1) OBSERVATIONAL VISITS TO CLASSROOMS BY TWO-MEMBER TEAMS OF EDUCATORS AND SOCIAL SCIENTISTS, (2) STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH ADMINISTRATIVE AND TEACHING STAFF, (3) INVENTORIES ADMINISTERED TO THE CHILDREN TO ASSESS THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF SELF AND SCHOOL, AND (4) STUDENT'S SCORES ON THE METROPOLITAN ACHIEVEMENT TEST IN ARITHMETIC AND READING. DATA WERE ALSO COLLECTED ABOUT TEACHERS' ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR, CLASS SIZE, GROUPING PRACTICES, SCHOOL CLIMATE, ETHNIC COMPOSITION, ATTENDANCE, AND COSTS. THESE DATA WERE COMPARED WITH EVALUATIVE DATA FROM EIGHT CONTROL SCHOOLS AND  FROM THE 1966-67 EVALUATION OF THE FREE CHOICE OPEN ENROLLMENT PROGRAM. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM VARIED CONSIDERABLY WITH EACH SCHOOL, BUT THE GENERAL MES ATMOSPHERE AND STAFF, PARENT, AND COMMUNITY ATTITUDES TOWARD THE PROGRAM WERE ALL ENTHUSIASTIC AND OPTIMISTIC. HOWEVER THE PROGRAM HAD HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND THE GAINS PER ACADEMIC YEAR WHICH HAD BEEN NOTED IN PREVIOUS EVALUATIONS WERE NOT BEING MAINTAINED. CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN IN THE MES PROGRAM FOR THREE YEARS WERE EVEN FURTHER BEHIND NORMAL STANDARDS THAN WHEN THEY HAD BEGUN. THUS, ALTHOUGH ADMINISTRATIVE RESTRUCTURING (SMALLER CLASSES, SPECIAL SERVICES, ETC.) CREATED A GENERAL OPTIMISM, THE ABSENCE OF ANY SUCH RESTRUCTURING IN CURRICULUM AND IN BASIC TEACHING METHODS  RESTRICTED PUPIL ACHIEVEMENT. (LB)",

THE UFT MAINTAINS THAT SINCE 18 OF THE 21 MES WERE FORMER SPECIAL SERVICE (SS) SCHOOLS, CUE SHOULD HAVE USED SS SCHOOL NORMS AS A BASIS OF EVALUATION RATHER THAN STANDARDIZED NATIONAL GROUP NORMS. MOREOVER, CUE INCONSISTENTLY AND UNSCIENTIFICALLY MATCHED 21 MES WITH ONLY EIGHT CONTROL SCHOOLS, AND COMPARED MES STUDENTS WITH STUDENTS IN OPEN-ENROLLMENT SCHOOLS, A HIGHLY MOTIVATED SCHOOL POPULATION. IN ASSESSING THE READING ACHIEVEMENT OF MES STUDENTS AS COMPARED WITH THAT OF CONTROL STUDENTS, CUE USED INVALID TESTS AND IGNORED AVAILABLE  READING SCORES WHICH SHOWED THAT THE NON-MES SS STUDENTS HAD GAINED LITTLE IN READING ACHIEVEMENT. UFT FEELS THAT THE READING ACCOMPLISHMENT OF MES STUDENTS CAN BE WITNESSED BY AN ACHIEVEMENT CLOSE TO NATIONAL NORMS IN GRADES FOUR TO SIX. ALSO, IN ARITHMETIC SIXTH-GRADE MES STUDENTS ARE ONLY ONE YEAR BELOW GRADE LEVEL WHEREAS NON-MES SS STUDENTS ARE TWO YEARS BELOW. SINCE MES CHILDREN ENTERED THE PROGRAM WITH A SEVERE EDUCATIONAL RETARDATION, THESE GAINS SHOW GREAT PROGRESS. MOREOVER THE LONGER A STUDENT IS IN AN MES PROGRAM, THE BETTER HIS ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. OTHER ASPECTS OF THE CUE REPORT WHICH THE UFT REFUTES INCLUDE EVALUATIONS OF TEACHING TECHNIQUES (PARTICULARLY UFT'S LESSON OBSERVATION CRITERIA), TEACHER AND STUDENT ATTITUDES, SCHOOL CLIMATE, THE EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAM, AND  SCHOOL-COMMUNITY RELATIONS.

THE FUNDAMENTAL AIM WAS TO COMBINE ACTION AND RESEARCH TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT THE STATE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE COULD DO IN AREAS WHERE THE LABOR MARKET WAS RAPIDLY CHANGING. END-OF-YEAR PERSONNEL DATA FROM 1956 AND 1962 FOR ALL HOME OFFICE EMPLOYEES WAS COLLECTED FROM A LARGE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY PAYROLL TO OBTAIN AN OVERALL PICTURE OF THE SITUATION BEFORE AND AFTER COMPUTER CONVERSION. THE DIVISIONS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT MOST AFFECTED BY THE COMPUTER WERE STUDIED BY PREPARING AND COMPARING STAFFING PATTERNS AND INDIVIDUAL WORKER INFORMATION RECORDS BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER EACH UNIT WAS CONVERTED TO ELECTRONIC  DATA PROCESSING. ASSUMING THE INSURANCE COMPANY STUDIED IS REPRESENTATIVE OF OTHER LARGE COMPANIES IN WHICH &quot;PAPER WORK&quot; IS THE END PRODUCT, SOME CONCLUSIONS WERE -- (1) THE PROPORTION OF CLERICAL WORKERS WILL INCREASE AT A SLOWER RATE THAN IN RECENT YEARS, (2) THE PROPORTION OF PROFESSIONAL WORKERS WILL INCREASE AT A FASTER RATE, (3) PRODUCTIVITY PER CLERICAL WORKER IS INCREASING RAPIDLY IN AUTOMATED ESTABLISHMENTS, (4) THE NUMBER OF CLERICAL POSITIONS OPEN TO WORK FORCE ENTRANTS IN THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS DECLINING, AND (5) TRADITIONAL POSITIONS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES AT THE PRESENT VOLUME.

A JURY OF 12 EXPERTS FROM PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY AND ENGINEERING HELPED VALIDATE THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF THE TECHNICIANS. SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LABOR FORCE WERE -- (1) MOST FIRMS AND BUSINESSES WERE MULTIPURPOSE AND ENGAGED IN SEVERAL MAJOR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, (2) TECHNICIANS WERE EMPLOYED BY 40 PERCENT OF THE TRACTOR AND MACHINERY DEALERS,  AND BY ONE-THIRD OF THE FIRMS IN THE AREA OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION, (3) 1,460 PERSONS WERE EMPLOYED FULL-TIME BY 35 PERCENT OF THE FIRMS RESPONDING, AND THE OVERALL RATIO OF TECHNICIANS TO PROFESSIONAL PERSONNEL WAS 0.64 TO 1, AND (4) A 69 PERCENT INCREASE IN LABOR PLACEMENT FOR TECHNICIANS WAS ANTICIPATED BY 1969. ACTIVITIES ENGAGED IN BY TECHNICIANS WERE GIVING LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTION TO OTHERS, MAKING VERBAL OR WRITTEN ACCOUNTING, AND OFFERING ADVICE AND EXPERTNESS. COMMUNICATION SKILLS, APPLIED ARITHMETIC, ELEMENTARY MECHANICS, PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, AND PSYCHOLOGY WERE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT NEEDED GENERAL EDUCATION SUBJECT AREAS. ONE RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT PROGRAMS FOR PREPARING TECHNICIANS BE DEVELOPED TO PREPARE BOTH &quot;AGRICULTURAL TECHNICIANS-ENGINEERING&quot; AND &quot;AGRICULTURAL  TECHNICIANS-MECHANIZED AGRICULTURE.&quot; A SUGGESTED CURRICULUM FOR TRAINING AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING TECHNICIANS, SELECTED TABLES FROM THE STUDY, AND AN EXTENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY ARE INCLUDED.

SOME FACTORS AFFECTING HEALTH MANPOWER ARE (1) DEVELOPMENTS IN DIAGNOSIS AND PATIENT CARE, INCLUDING AUTOMATED CLINICAL LABORATORY EQUIPMENT, IMPROVED SURGICAL TECHNIQUES AND EQUIPMENT, AND THE USE OF THE ELECTRONIC COMPUTER IN DIAGNOSIS, (2) HOSPITAL INFORMATION HANDLING, ESPECIALLY THE APPLICATION OF THE ELECTRONIC COMPUTER, (3) IMPROVEMENT IN HOSPITAL SUPPLIES AND SERVICES, INCLUDING THE USE OF DISPOSABLE ITEMS AND IMPROVED MATERIALS HANDLING EQUIPMENT, AND (4) IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MANAGEMENT AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF HEALTH FACILITIES FOR BETTER  UTILIZATION OF PERSONNEL, EQUIPMENT, AND SPACE.

ABOUT 32 PERCENT OF ALL EMPLOYED WOMEN WERE CLERICAL WORKERS, 16 PERCENT WERE SERVICE WORKERS, 15 PERCENT WERE OPERATIVES, AND ALMOST 14 PERCENT WERE PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL WORKERS. A MEDIAN INCOME OF $3,710 WAS RECEIVED BY YEAR-ROUND FULL-TIME WOMEN WORKERS IN 1964. ALMOST 15 MILLION WOMEN WORKERS WERE AT LEAST HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES, AND 4.9 MILLION OF THESE HAD  SOME COLLEGE EDUCATION. ALMOST THREE-FIFTHS OF COLLEGE GRADUATES, BUT LESS THAN ONE-THIRD OF WOMEN WHO HAVE COMPLETED GRADE SCHOOL ONLY, WERE IN THE LABOR FORCE. THIRTY-FOUR STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AND PUERTO RICO HAD MINIMUM WAGE LAWS THAT APPLIED TO WOMEN.

FROM A COMPOSITE LISTING OF 619 MANUFACTURING COMPANIES WHICH HAD LOCATED IN COLORADO, NEW MEXICO, ARIZONA, NEVADA, IDAHO, UTAH, AND WYOMING SINCE JANUARY 1960, 116 INTERVIEWS AND 90 COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE OBTAINED. SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS INDICATED THAT VOCATIONAL EDUCATION WAS A SELECTION FACTOR. OF 28 DIFFERENT PLANT SITE SELECTION FACTORS SUBMITTED BY THE INDUSTRIES, VOCATIONAL EDUCATION RANKED APPROXIMATELY IN THE MIDDLE IN DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS MENTIONED AS FACTORS IN PLANT SITE SELECTION WERE MACHINE SHOP, METAL FABRICATION, ELECTRONICS, BUSINESS AND SECRETARIAL, AND  ELECTRICAL. THE SIX FACTORS CONSIDERED MOST IMPORTANT IN SITE SELECTION WERE LABOR SUPPLY AND LABOR RELATIONS, GROUND AND AIR TRANSPORTATION, AVAILABLE LAND AND BUILDINGS, MARKET AND PROXIMITY TO MARKET, COLLEGE EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, AND ALLIED BUSINESS AND FEDERAL BUSINESS RELATIONS.

MORE THAN ONE OF THREE MOTHERS WAS A WORKER IN MAY 1967. IT IS CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED THAT BY 1980, 5.3 MILLION MOTHERS 20 TO 44 YEARS OF AGE WITH CHILDREN UNDER 5 YEARS OF AGE WILL BE WORKERS -- A 43 PERCENT INCREASE OVER 1970. MORE THAN 17 MILLION CHILDREN UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE HAD WORKING MOTHERS IN MARCH 1965. OF THESE CHILDREN, 4.5 MILLION WERE UNDER SIX YEARS OF AGE. IN FEBRUARY 1965, A NATIONAL SURVEY OF 6.1 MILLION MOTHERS WHO WORKED 27 WEEKS OR MORE  IN 1964 WAS MADE TO ASCERTAIN HOW THE CHILDREN OF WORKING MOTHERS WERE CARED FOR. FINDINGS WERE (1) NEARLY HALF WERE CARED FOR IN THEIR OWN HOMES BY THEIR FATHERS, OTHER RELATIVES, BABYSITTERS, OR HOUSEKEEPERS, (2) 28 PERCENT WERE CARED FOR BY THEIR MOTHERS WHO EITHER WORKED ONLY DURING THEIR CHILDREN'S SCHOOL HOURS OR TOOK CARE OF THEM WHILE WORKING, (3) 18 PERCENT WERE CARED FOR AWAY FROM HOME, AND (4) 8 PERCENT LOOKED AFTER THEMSELVES. TOO MANY CHILDREN HAD EITHER QUESTIONABLE OR COMPLETELY INADEQUATE CARE. (PS)",

THE LEGAL BASES FOR TAKING ADVERSE-EFFECT ACTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE POLICY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR HAS DEVELOPED ARE DISCUSSED. THE ADVERSE-EFFECT CONCEPT DEVELOPED  THROUGH APPLICATIONS IN 1953, 1956, AND 1958 WHEN EMPLOYERS OF MEXICAN NATIONALS HAD TO INCREASE THEIR WAGES TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST DOMESTIC LABOR. IN 1959, SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR JUDGING ADVERSE-EFFECT WERE ESTABLISHED AND FORMED THE BASIS FOR A WIDESPREAD ADVERSE-EFFECT PROGRAM DURING 1960-61. PUBLIC LAW 78 WAS EXTENDED, WITH INCREASING ADVERSE-EFFECT REGULATIONS, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 1964. THEREAFTER, FOREIGN WORKERS COULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTRY FOR TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT IN AGRICULTURE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, WHICH CONTINUED ADVERSE-EFFECT REGULATIONS.

        "description":"INCREASED MECHANIZATION, MORE EXTENSIVE USE OF CHEMICALS, AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS HAVE REDUCED FARM-LABOR NEEDS AND INCREASED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. COTTON, SUGAR BEETS, POTATOES, AND VEGETABLES FOR PROCESSING ARE SOME OF THE CROPS REQUIRING FEWER MAN-HOURS DUE TO NEW OR IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY. CONTINUOUS EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO DESIGN MACHINERY AND LABOR-SAVING TECHNIQUES FOR PRODUCING AND HARVESTING MOST FRUITS, VEGETABLES FOR FRESH MARKET, AND SOME VEGETABLES FOR PROCESSING. MECHANICAL HARVESTING OF MANY CROPS HAS BEEN RETARDED BECAUSE OF LACK OF UNIFORMITY IN SIZE, MATURITY, AND TEXTURE OF THE PLANT OR MARKETABLE PRODUCT. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND FUTURE IMPLICATIONS OF MECHANIZATION AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES FOR 27 SELECTED CROPS INCLUDING APPLES, ASPARAGUS,  SNAP BEANS, POTATOES, BERRIES, SUGAR BEETS, TOBACCO, AND TOMATOES ARE DISCUSSED. CONCLUSIONS ARE -- (1) THE MACHINE METHOD IS STILL IN THE EXPERIMENTAL STAGE AND HAS NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON EMPLOYMENT IN SOME INSTANCES, BUT IN OTHERS THE USE OF HAND LABOR HAS ALMOST DISAPPEARED, (2) IT IS DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT THE EXACT CROPS TO BE MOST AFFECTED BY MECHANIZATION, BUT AGRICULTURE'S NEED FOR HAND LABOR WILL DIMINISH, AND (3) THE PROCESS OF ADAPTING HAND LABORERS TO A NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL PRESENT PROBLEMS.

        "description":"INFORMATION ACQUIRED FROM SIX SUPPLEMENTS TO THE REGULAR \"CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY\" BETWEEN JUNE 1964 AND JUNE 1966 WAS USED TO EXAMINE THE REASONS UNEMPLOYED MEMBERS OF THE LABOR FORCE BEGIN TO LOOK FOR WORK. THE DATA, WHEN AVERAGED, REVEALED THAT DURING THIS PERIOD OF RAPID ECONOMIC EXPANSION (1) 40 PERCENT HAD LOST THEIR PREVIOUS JOBS, (2) 15 PERCENT HAD QUIT THEIR LAST JOBS, (3) 25 PERCENT WERE REENTERING THE LABOR FORCE AFTER A PERIOD OF ABSENCE, AND (4) 20 PERCENT WERE NEW ENTRANTS WHO HAD NEVER HELD A FULL-TIME JOB. IN JUNE 1966, JOB LOSERS, THOSE WHOSE EMPLOYMENT WAS TERMINATED OR THOSE ON LAYOFF, ACCOUNTED FOR ONE-FOURTH OF ALL UNEMPLOYED PERSONS, AND IN DECEMBER 1964 AND JANUARY 1966 THE PROPORTION HAD RISEN TO ONE-HALF. THE NEGRO JOB-LOSER RATE WAS ABOUT TWO AND  ONE-HALF TIMES THE WHITE RATE. PERSONS WHO LEFT THEIR JOBS VOLUNTARILY AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO LOOK FOR WORK ACCOUNTED FOR 12 TO 18 PERCENT OF THE UNEMPLOYED. THE DATA SUGGEST THAT THE NEW ENTRANT RATE DURING PERIODS OF ABUNDANT JOB OPPORTUNITIES MAY KEEP UNEMPLOYMENT RATES UP. SINCE OVERALL ECONOMIC EXPANSION SEEMS TO AFFECT ENTRANT AND JOB-LEAVER RATES VERY LITTLE AND VERY SLOWLY, JOB MARKET PROGRAMS AIMED AT SPECIFIC GROUPS WILL BE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE TOTAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BELOW THREE AND ONE-HALF PERCENT.

ENROLLMENT INCREASE FOR THE THREE YEARS, 1965-1967, WAS ABOUT 300 PERCENT LARGER THAN THE ENROLLMENT INCREASE FOR THE THREE YEARS PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION ACT OF 1963. DURING 1966, 25.4 PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS IN PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS (GRADES 9-12) WERE ENROLLED IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. IN A NATIONAL SAMPLE OF 606,872 GRADUATES IN OCTOBER 1966, 80 PERCENT OF THOSE AVAILABLE FOR PLACEMENT WERE PLACED IN  A FIELD FOR WHICH THEY WERE TRAINED OR IN A RELATED FIELD. AN EXPANDED CONCEPT OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IS REQUIRED BECAUSE OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS, UNEMPLOYMENT (IN 1966, FOR EXAMPLE, 12.0 PERCENT OF 14-19 YEAR OLDS WERE UNEMPLOYED), LARGE CITY PROBLEMS, A CRISIS IN RURAL AREAS, AND THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS.

        "description":"THE RESEARCH IN THIS REPORT IS CONCERNED WITH TWO AREAS--(1) STUDY OF THE COPYRIGHT PRACTICES OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS RESPONSIBLE FOR PHOTODUPLICATION SERVICES AND THEIR INTERPRETATIONS OF THE &quot;FAIR USE&quot; ASPECT OF COPYRIGHT LAW IN PROVIDING SERVICE TO THEIR CLIENTS, AS WELL AS A STUDY OF WHAT FEDERAL STATUTE AND CASE LAW ACTUALLY PROVIDES IN THIS AREA AND (2) THE FIRST STUDY OF LIBRARY COPYING ON A LARGE-SAMPLE SCALE WITH REFERENCE TO THE ECONOMICS OF COPYRIGHT. THIS SECOND INVESTIGATION RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF STATISTICS AND ONE OR MORE POSSIBLY NEW USAGE RELATIONS. AT LEAST ONE BILLION PAGES OF PROFESSIONAL AND SCHOLARLY COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL ARE MADE ANNUALLY AS SINGLE COPIES. MULTIPLE COPYING IS NEGLIGIBLE IN U.S. LIBRARIES. EIGHTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE MATERIAL COPIED IS LESS  THAN FIVE YEARS OLD, AND IT IS PREPONDERANTLY SCIENTIFIC-TECHNICAL IN NATURE AND IN THE FORM OF COMPLETE ARTICLES COPIED FROM JOURNALS, PUBLISHED BY NONPROFIT PUBLISHERS. FIVE PERCENT OF THE FEWER THAN 1,000 PUBLISHERS WHOSE WORKS ARE COPIED ACCOUNT FOR 40 PERCENT OF THE MATERIAL COPIED IN U.S. LIBRARIES. THE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT UNDER CURRENT BELIEFS AND PRACTICES SINGLE-COPY REPRODUCTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED OR RESTRICTED BY COPYRIGHT LAW, AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE CONGRESS CONSIDER THIS FACT IN WRITING FUTURE LEGISLATION. AN OPEN ATTITUDE IS HELD BY LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS TOWARD A SYSTEM OF COPYRIGHT ACCESS, PERMISSIONS, AND PAYMENTS, PROVIDED THERE BE JOINT USER-OWNER CONTROL. MANY OTHER CONCLUSIONS, APPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE REPORTED. INCLUDED IN APPENDICES ARE THE  FIRST ANNUAL REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE COPYRIGHT PROBLEMS AFFECTING COMMUNICATION IN SCIENCE AND EDUCATION (CICP) AND RELEVANT TABLES FROM THE CICP LIBRARY SURVEY.

(1) THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL EMERGE WITH PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADULT EDUCATION. (2) MORE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION WILL OFFER ADVANCED DEGREES IN ADULT EDUCATION. (3) BY 1980, 20 PERCENT OF THE ADULT POPULATION WILL BE COMMITTED TO AT LEAST ONE PROGRAM OF PART-TIME STUDY. (4) ADULTS WILL BE PAID TO GO TO SCHOOL AS AN ORDINARY PRACTICE. (5) ADULT EDUCATION WILL EMERGE AS A MAJOR CONCERN OF SOCIAL SCIENTISTS. (6) \"EASIER LEARNING IN LESS TIME,\" MADE POSSIBLE BY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, WILL ENJOY A BRIEF PERIOD OF GENERAL ENTHUSIASM BY THE EDUCATIONAL SCIENTIST. (7) THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WILL EMERGE AS THE FASTEST-GROWING SEGMENT OF ADULT  EDUCATION. (8) THE ADULT EDUCATION ASSOCIATION WILL GAIN ENORMOUS STRENGTH AS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ALL ADULT EDUCATORS. (9) COMPARATIVE ADULT EDUCATION WILL BECOME A FAVORITE STUDY OF PROFESSIONAL ADULT EDUCATORS. (10) A CONCERN FOR VALUES WILL REQUIRE ASSISTANCE OF PHILOSOPHERS IN DEVELOPING CURRICULUM.

THE NATURE OF SBK IS DESCRIBED, AND INDIVIDUAL, GROUP, ORGANIZATIONAL, AND COMMUNAL MEANS OF ALTERING ASPECTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S BEHAVIOR ARE ILLUSTRATED BY FOUR STUDIES. SBK HAS THESE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS--(1) IT MAINTAINS OR CHANGES BEHAVIOR, (2) EMPIRICAL CORROBORATION MAY BE SUPPLIED, AND (3) IT IS OPERATIONAL. THE MAJOR REQUISITES FOR SOCIO-BEHAVIORAL PRACTICE (SBP) ARE THAT IT IMPLEMENT SBK, AND THAT IT BE BEHAVIORALLY SPECIFIC IN FIVE AREAS. THESE AREAS ARE--(1) BEHAVIOR SPECIFICATION OF PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR, (2)  SPECIFIC CONTEMPORANEOUS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLLING CONDITIONS, (3) DESIRED BEHAVIOR IN THE FORM OF A BEHAVIORAL CURRICULA, (4) IDENTIFICATION OF THE TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED TO ACHIEVE BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATION, AND (5) SPECIFIC CONSEQUENCES OF CHANGE. PRINCIPLE JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS APPROACH IS RESEARCH INDICATION THAT IT IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN TRADITIONAL TECHNIQUES. TWO ADVANTAGES OF SBP ARE THE APPLICATION OF KNOWLEDGE BASED UPON EMPIRICAL CORROBORATION, AND THE USE OF CONCRETE TECHNIQUES. (PR)",

A SELF-IMAGE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DEVELOPED TO SELECT MODAL ADOLESCENTS ON THE BASIS OF HOW CLOSE THEY COME TO PSYCHOLOGICAL NORMS. AFTER THREE YEARS, COMPLETE INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED FOR 73 BOYS. THE DATA CONSISTED OF INTERVIEWS, A PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST BATTERY, SCHOOL RECORDS, AND PARENT INTERVIEWS. IN THE HOME ENVIRONMENT, RESULTS INDICATE--(1) TEENAGERS NEED TO IDENTIFY WITH MORE THAN ONE ADULT, (2) TEENAGERS BASICALLY SHARE THEIR PARENTS' VALUES, (3) TEENAGERS ARE CONTENT WITH THEMSELVES AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT, AND (4) TEENAGERS ARE ORIENTED TOWARD THE FUTURE. ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY OF TEENAGERS HAVE LIMITED SEXUAL EXPERIENCE, THIS INHIBITION OF  THE SEXUAL URGE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES. A POSSIBLE LIMITATION TO THE STUDY MAY BE THE FACT THAT WHILE MANY TEENAGERS BRAG ABOUT SEX, OTHERS ARE UNWILLING TO TALK FREELY. A FOLLOWUP STUDY OF THE GROUP THROUGH COLLEGE IS EXPECTED TO OBTAIN FURTHER DATA CONCERNING THEIR DEVELOPMENT. (PR)",

WORK HAD MEANING WHEN IT MEANT SURVIVAL OR WAS CONNECTED TO A FEAR OF GOD. FREUD SAW WORK AS A FORCE WHICH BINDS MAN TO REALITY. OTHERS SEE IT AS A MEANS TO SELF-FULLFILLMENT, OR AS A PROTECTION AGAINST THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF DEATH. HOWEVER, THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES THE RESHAPING OF ATTITUDES TOWARD WORK. A LACK OF CONGRUENCY EXISTS BETWEEN THE GOALS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THOSE OF THE ORGANIZATION. MAN, INVOLVED IN A CHOICE BETWEEN AUTONOMY AND HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING, HAS CHOSEN THE GOOD LIFE. ALTHOUGH MARX'S EARLY WRITINGS PREDICTED THE LOSS OF INDIVIDUALISM, WORK ALIENATION IS NOT CONNECTED TO ANY  POLITICAL IDEOLOGY. RATHER, IT IS CAUSED BY ANY SYSTEM UTILIZING MASS PRODUCTION PROCESSES. RELIEF FROM FEELINGS OF ALIENATION IN WORK BY MORE PROFITABLE USE OF LEISURE TIME IS NOT A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION. THE FRUSTRATIONS, RESENTMENT, AND LACK OF SELF-ESTEEM CAUSED BY WORK ALIENATION ARE CARRIED OVER INTO LEISURE PERIODS. MAN MUST DEVELOP A NEW ATTITUDE EMPHASIZING HIS ROLE AS A COOPERATIVE TEAM MEMBER RATHER THAN HIS ROLE AS AN UNDIVIDUALIST.

EXCERPTS FROM SELF-EVALUATIONS WRITTEN OVER A  FOUR-YEAR PERIOD BY A COLLEGE GIRL ARE PRESENTED FOR ILLUSTRATION AND INTERPRETATION. DATA RELATED TO STUDENT DEVELOPMENT IS ANALYZED. TO EVALUATE EMOTIONAL INDEPENDENCE, STUDENTS FROM EIGHT COLLEGES WERE ADMINISTERED, IN THEIR FIRST AND FOURTH YEAR, SIX SCALES FROM THE OMNIBUS PERSONALITY INVENTORY AND THREE SCALES FROM THE STERN ACTIVITIES INDEX.

FURTHERMORE, N AC SIGNIFICANTLY DISCRIMINATED THE HIGH FROM THE LOW ACHIEVERS, EVEN WITHIN THE SAME LEVELS OF INTELLECTUAL ABILITY. OF ALL THE SUBTESTS THAT COMPRISE N AC, INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITY CORRELATED MORE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE CRITERION  (GPA) THAN ANY OTHER, INCLUDING THE TOTAL SCORE. THE PRESENT STUDY HAS ALSO SHED LIGHT ON WHAT MOTIVE REALLY IS, AND HOW IT SHOULD BE MEASURED BY PROJECTIVE TESTS. ACADEMIC MOTIVATION WAS ALSO FOUND TO BE RELATED TO A GREAT NUMBER OF OTHER VARIABLES WHICH CORRELATE IN A SIMILAR MANNER WITH GPA. THEREFORE, N AC MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE IN THE STUDY, AND PREDICTION OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE MAY SUMMARIZE SYSTEMATIC VARIATIONS IN OTHER VARIABLES EQUALLY RELATED TO PERFORMANCE. (SK)",

AN INEXPERIENCED TEACHER USED THE TEXT IN A NINE WEEK COURSE WITH SEVENTH GRADE STUDENTS. ONLY A POST-TEST CONTROL GROUP DESIGN WAS USED. THE TWO FACTORS STUDIED WERE TREATMENT AND SEX. THE TEST OF INFERENCE PATTERNS (TIP), USED BY HOWELL IN AN EARLIER STUDY, WAS THE CRITERION MEASURE AT THE END OF THE FIRST NINE WEEK PERIOD. STUDENT IQ'S WERE ALSO AVAILABLE. THE INFERENTIAL REASONING ANLYSIS (IRA) BY HOWELL WAS THE CRITERION MEASURE USED FOR THE SECOND NINE WEEK PERIOD. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE OF TOTAL TEST SCORES ON TIP YIELDED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE SCORES OF MALE AND FEMALE STUDENTS OR BETWEEN TREATMENT AND SEX. USING A COVARIANCE ADJUSTMENT, IT WAS FOUND THAT IQ HAD AN EFFECT ON THE CRITERION. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE OF PART I, II, IV, AND TOTAL SCORES OF THE IRA PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SCORES FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE SEXES FOR TOTAL IRA SCORES. NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION WAS FOUND BETWEEN TREATMENT AND SEX.

        "description":"IN A SPECIALLY ORGANIZED NURSERY SCHOOL SETTING, DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN BETWEEN TWO AND ONE-HALF AND THREE AND ONE-HALF YEARS OF AGE, EXPERIENCED CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT (CM) PROCEDURES TO MODIFY VERBAL BEHAVIOR. IN ONE ROOM OF A LARGE, PRIVATE DWELLING CONVERTED INTO A NURSERY SCHOOL, REQUISITE ANTECEDENT BEHAVIORS (RAB) WERE ESTABLISHED IN EACH CHILD, WITH REINFORCEMENT PROVIDED BY THE DISPENSATION OF METAL WASHERS. TOPOGRAPHICAL ACCURACY OF THE CHILD'S RESPONSES WERE ENCOURAGED THROUGH THE SIMPLEST, MOST DIRECT CONTROLS. RESPONSES WERE THEN BROUGHT UNDER THE CONTROL OF OTHER, MORE REALISTIC STIMULI. SKINNER'S TERMS &quot;TACT&quot; AND &quot;MAND&quot; ARE UTILIZED TO DESCRIBE A TYPICAL SESSION ON TACT TRAINING. A CRITERION TEST WAS ADMINISTERED AND THE DESIRED BEHAVIOR WAS REACHED WITH ALL  SUBJECTS AFTER A MEAN OF SIX SESSIONS. CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND TOKEN ECONOMY ARE BELIEVED TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN MAINTAINING AND STRENGTHENING MODIFIED VERBAL BEHAVIOR. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT--(1) DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN RESPOND TO CM PROCEDURES AS WELL AS MIDDLE CLASS CHILDREN DO, (2) THE STRATEGIES INVOLVED IN RAB TRAINING AND TRANSFERS TO GENERAL GROUP ACTIVITIES APPEAR TO BE SOUND, AND (3) VERBAL BEHAVIOR IN VERY YOUNG CHILDREN APPEARS TO BE AMENABLE TO MODIFICATION UNDER CM PROCEDURES.

THE STUDY IS BASED UPON INTERVIEWS WITH 803 OREGON HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS. THE TYPICAL OREGON HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER IS FOUND TO BE MORE CONSERVATIVE POLITICALLY THAN HIS COMMUNITY AND TO BECOME MORE CONSERVATIVE THE LONGER HE TEACHES. SMALL-TOWN TEACHERS, FEMALE TEACHERS, AND TEACHERS OF BUSINESS EDUCATION OR GENERAL EDUCATION ARE THE MOST CONSERVATIVE. THE POLITICAL LIFE OF THE OREGON HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER IS FOUND TO BE MARKEDLY LESS THAN THAT OF OTHER POPULATIONS WITH COMPARABLE EDUCATION AND  INCOME. THE FEW TEACHERS WHO DO TAKE PART IN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES ARE LIKELY TO BE MEN SUPPORTING SCHOOL BOND ISSUES AND SEEKING INCREASES IN THEIR OWN SALARIES.

PLANNING OF A SCHOOL PARK  WILL BE A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IN CITY PLANNING, AND FINANCING OF EDUCATIONAL PARKS WILL REQUIRE LARGE-SCALE FEDERAL SUPPORT. AS A STEP TOWARD FULL COMMITMENT, SCHOOLS CAN BE GROUPED INTO COOPERATIVE COMPLEXES. THIS REPORT WAS PREPARED FOR THE U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS. (HM)",

STATISTICAL ANALYSES, PRIMARILY BY TWO-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE AND PEARSON PRODUCT-MOMENT CORRELATION, CONFIRMED THE STUDY'S TWO MAJOR HYPOTHESES--(1) MALE EDUCATORS ARE MORE FAVORABLY INCLINED THAN FEMALE EDUCATORS TOWARD COLLECTIVE TEACHER ACTION, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS, SANCTIONS, AND STRIKES, AND (2) CLASSROOM TEACHERS ARE MORE  FAVORABLY INCLINED THAN PRINCIPALS TOWARD TEACHER COLLECTIVE ACTION, INCLUDING COLLECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS, SANCTIONS, AND STRIKES. RELATED FACTORS ANALYZED INCLUDED THE PERIOD OF EDUCATOR'S RESIDENCE IN THE STATE, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, TYPE OF SCHOOL UNIT IN WHICH EMPLOYED, SIZE OF TOWN, LENGTH OF EXPERIENCE, LEVEL AT WHICH EMPLOYED, AND LEVEL OF CERTIFICATION.

PRIMARY FINDINGS INCLUDED--(1) MOST COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA WERE NEGATIVELY RELATED TO ELECTION SUCCESS, (2) A COMMUNITY NORM OF BOND ELECTION PASSAGE OR FAILURE APPEARED TO BE OPERATIVE, (3) DIFFERENTIATION WAS MINIMAL BETWEEN ELECTIONS FOR VOCATIONALLY RELATED PURPOSES AND THOSE FOR OTHER PURPOSES, AND (4) THE LACK OF TRENDS AND SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS INDICATES THERE WAS AS MUCH VARIANCE WITHIN AS BETWEEN DISTRICTS STUDIED.

IN PHASE I OF THE PROJECT, 51 EDUCABLE RETARDED AND 18 NORMAL SUBJECTS RECEIVED A 20-DAY PROGRAM IN SIMILARITIES-DIFFERENCES CONCEPT FORMATION AND WERE COMPARED WITH 42 EDUCABLE RETARDED AND 24 NORMAL CONTROL SUBJECTS. CHANGE SCORES FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS ON 30 TEST VARIABLES, INCLUDING CONCEPT FORMATION, REASONING, INTELLIGENCE, AND ACHIEVEMENT TESTS, WERE COMPARED BY T TESTS AND A MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. THE HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING IMPROVEMENT IN CONCEPT FORMATION WAS STRONGLY SUSTAINED. ALSO GAINS WERE OBSERVED IN RELATED AREAS OF REASONING AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, IN VERBAL  AREAS. HYPOTHESES OF CHANGE IN GENERAL INTELLIGENCE AND ACHIEVEMENT WERE NOT SUSTAINED WHEN SIMILARITIES-DIFFERENCES EFFECTS WERE REMOVED, ALTHOUGH A GENERAL TREND IN FAVOR OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS WAS NOTED. IN PHASE II, 16 EDUCABLE RETARDED AND 16 BRIGHT NORMAL SUBJECTS RECEIVED A 20-DAY PROGRAM IN COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY AND WERE COMPARED TO 16 CONTROL SUBJECTS IN EACH GROUP BY A 2 X 2 FACTORAL DESIGN. CHANGE WAS MEASURED BY A FLEXIBILITY TEST BATTERY, COMPOSED OF FIVE SUBTESTS, AND THE STANFORD-BINET INTELLIGENCE SCALE. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE PREDICTED DIRECTION WAS FOUND FOR BOTH TEST VARIABLES. IN PHASE III, A TEST AND TRAINING PROGRAM IN THE AREA OF PRODUCTIVITY-RESPONSIVENESS WAS DEVELOPED TO THE TRYOUT STAGE.

THE TEST WAS TO REFLECT LINGUISTIC ASPECTS OF A CHILD'S BEHAVIOR, BUT NOT EXTRALINGUISTIC ASPECTS SUCH AS READING AND WRITING. IT CONSISTED OF FIVE SUBTESTS--(1) REPETITION OF SENTENCES, (2) IDENTIFICATION OF NON-SENTENCES, (3) CORRECTION OF NON-SENTENCES, (4) NONVERBAL RESPONSE TO MORPHOLOGICAL AND SYNTACTIC CONTRASTS, (5) CHOICE OF APPROPRIATE SUFFIX. THE TEST WAS GIVEN TO A GROUP OF HEARING SECOND AND THIRD GRADERS AND A GROUP OF DEAF STUDENTS AGED NINE TO 20. PERFORMANCE OF THE TWO GROUPS WAS COMPARED ON SELECTED ITEMS (THOSE PASSED BY AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OF THE SECOND GRADERS AND 75 PERCENT OF THE THIRD  GRADERS IN A PRELIMINARY TEST). RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE AVERAGE TOTAL SCORE FOR THE THIRD GRADERS WAS NEARLY PERFECT AND HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE TOTAL SCORE FOR THE SECOND GRADERS. THE AVERAGE TOTAL SCORE OF THE DEAF GROUP WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS THAT OF THE HEARING SECOND GRADERS. THE TEST AS A WHOLE DID NOT MEET THE CRITERIA OF CONSTRUCT VALIDITY BECAUSE THE SECOND GRADERS DID NOT ATTAIN NEARLY PERFECT SCORES AND SUBSTANTIAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN TEST AND READING COMPREHENSION SCORES FOR HEARING SUBJECTS WERE OBTAINED. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LANGUAGE PERFORMANCE OF THE DEAF GROUP DOES NOT DIFFER MARKEDLY FROM THAT OF THE HEARING. FURTHER RESEARCH WAS RECOMMENDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VERBAL PRODUCTIONS OF DEAF AND HEARING ARE DUE TO SUPERFICIAL DIFFERENCES IN  GRAMMATICAL RULES OR TO DIFFERENCES IN RULES OF PERFORMANCE. THE FIVE SUBTESTS AND RELATED DATA ARE PRESENTED. A 24-ITEM BIBLIOGRAPHY IS INCLUDED. (AB)",

IN THE FIRST PHASE, SUBJECTS WERE 42 DEAF GALLAUDET COLLEGE PREPARATORY STUDENTS, 26 HEARING FACULTY AND STAFF MEMBERS OF THE NEW MEXICO SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF, AND 14 HEARING GRADUATE STUDENTS AT GALLAUDET. THEIR PROGRAMS CONSISTED OF 17 LESSONS AND 8 FILMED TESTS. A RELATIONSHIP OF .90 OR ABOVE (WITH ONE EXCEPTION) WAS OBTAINED BETWEEN PRE- AND POST-TEST SCORES. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE ON SCORES FROM VARIATIONS IN RATE OF PRESENTATION AND AMOUNT OF REPETITION OF THE STIMULUS MATERIAL FOR THE PREPARATORY STUDENTS  SHOWED NONE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY EFFECTIVE, BUT THERE WAS AN OVERALL MEAN GAIN (STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, P IS LESS THAN .01) FOR READING WORDS AND FOR READING SENTENCES. FOR THE HEARING FACULTY GROUP AND THE GRADUATE STUDENT GROUP, DIFFERENCES IN RESPONSE METHOD (ORAL, WRITTEN, OR MANUAL) FAILED TO ACHIEVE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. IMPROVEMENT IN READING WORDS ACHIEVED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE (P IS LESS THAN .01) FOR BOTH GROUPS, BUT MEAN GAIN FOR READING SENTENCES WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR EITHER GROUP. THE FILM COURSE WAS JUDGED AN INEFFECTIVE INSTRUCTIONAL TOOL. THE SECOND PHASE UTILIZED A CHANGE IN PRESENTATION AND A REVISED, EXPANDED FILM PROGRAM (24 LESSONS) AND TWO FILM TESTS. FORTY-EIGHT HEARING COLLEGE STUDENTS SERVED AS SUBJECTS.  ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE SHOWED REPETITION WAS THE ONLY EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTING SCORES FOR WORDS AND FOR SENTENCES (P IS GREATER THAN .01 AND LESS THAN .05). DATA FOR BOTH PHASES IS PRESENTED TABULARLY. APPENDIXES INCLUDE (1) CAPTIONED INSTRUCTIONS AND SCRIPTS FOR READING THE FILM COURSE AND THE TWO REVISED TESTS AND (2) COPIES OF FORMS USED FOR WRITTEN RESPONSES. REFERENCE LIST CITES 12 ITEMS.

        "description":"THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT DEFINES THE SPATIAL APPROACH TO PLANNING THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND SUGGESTS A MORE NATURAL APPROACH TO A LESS RESTRICTED ARCHITECTURE. ONE OF THE TWO BASIC ARCHITECTURAL ELEMENTS IN THE SPATIAL CONCEPT IS THE HORIZONTAL SCREEN WHICH KEEPS THE SUN AND RAIN OFF, LETS IN LIGHT, KEEPS OUT SUN HEAT, RETAINS ROOM HEAT, AND FRAMES DESIRABLE VIEWS WHILE TAKING ON ANY SHAPE OR POSITION. THE OTHER ELEMENT, THE VERTICAL SCREEN, ACTS AS A WIND BREAK, A SOUND SOURCE, THERMAL SCREEN AND VIEW SCREEN. ARCHITECTS WORK WITH THE FOLLOWING FOUR BASIC SCREEN TYPES--(1) THE TRANSPARENT SCREEN WHICH CAN SERVE AS A WIND BREAK, SOUND BARRIER, THERMAL SCREEN AND AT THE SAME TIME PERMIT A VIEW, (2) THE TRANSLUCENT SCREEN WHICH PROVIDES THE SAME EFFECTS, PERMITS LIGHT BUT  ELIMINATES A VIEW, (3) THE SOLID OR OPAQUE SCREEN WHICH PROVIDES ALL THESE FUNCTIONS EXCEPT THAT IT ELIMINATES BOTH LIGHT AND VIEW, AND (4) THE PIERCED SCREEN WHICH CAN HAVE THE QUALITIES OF OPAQUENESS, TRANSLUCENCY, AND TRANSPARENCY WITH THE ADDED QUALITY OF ALLOWING AIR FLOW. THE SPATIAL APPROACH GIVES THE ARCHITECT THE FREEDOM TO BALANCE THE CONSTRUCTION BUDGET, GIVES THE EDUCATOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE STUDENTS COMFORTABLE AND HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL SPACES FOR LEARNING, AND LEADS TO A NEW TYPE OF UNRESTRICTED ARCHITECTURE THAT IS AS TECHNOLOGICALLY PROGRESSIVE AND INDEPENDENT AS THE CIVILIZATION WHICH IS PRODUCING IT. IN ESSENCE, THE ARCHITECT STARTS WITH ALL NATURE, KEEPING EVERYTHING DESIRABLE--SPACIOUSNESS, VIEW, NATURAL LIGHT, COMFORTING BREEZES--AND ELIMINATES ONLY THE  UNDESIRABLE. (RK)",

GOAL WAS TO ASCERTAIN KINDS OF LEARNING SITUATIONS FOR WHICH PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION COULD BE IMPROVED VIA SELF-DIRECTION, I.E. MAXIMUM STUDENT FREEDOM TO CONTROL THE LEARNING PROCESS. RATIONALE FOR THE RESEARCH CAME FROM A COGNITIVE-PREDICTIVE-THEORETICAL MODEL. 2 FACTORS IMPORTANT TO LEARNING RATE AND VIEWED IN TERMS OF SELF-DIRECTION WERE--MEANINGFULNESS TO THE STUDENT OF THE LEARNING TASK AT ANY MOMENT AND MOTIVATION. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE MOST PROMISING LEARNING OBJECTIVES FOR SD ARE THOSE IN WHICH PROBLEM SOLVING AND TRANSFER OF TRAINING ARE REQUIRED. UNCOACHED SD APPEARED TO MAGNIFY EFFECTS OF MOTIVATION AND ABILITY OF LEARNING. THE MOST PROMISING  SINGLE RESULT WAS THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF A WEEK OF SD PRACTICE DURING WHICH CRITICAL SELF-APPRAISAL OF STUDY TACTICS WAS ENCOURAGED. THIS SUGGESTED THAT TO MAKE SD SUCCESSFUL, REMOVAL OF STUDENTS' STRONG HABIT OF PASSIVE ACQUIESCENCE IS NECESSARY. (LH)",

THIS SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS USES LINEAR PROGRAMS IN ARITHMETIC, SPELLING, AND GENERAL SCIENCE. FOR GRADE 1, ASPECTS STUDIED INCLUDE TEACHING MACHINES, TEACHER-PROGRAM ARRANGEMENTS, DAILY WORK-PROGRAM DISTRIBUTION, PREFAMILIARIZATION AND POST-LEARNING PRACTICE. FOR GRADE 4, EFFECTS OF PROGRAMMED INSTRUCTION ON REVIEW, ACCELERATION, AND CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT ARE STUDIED. FOR GRADE 7, ENRICHMENT ACTIVITY, OVERVIEW OF MATERIAL, AND PREFAMILIARIZATION ARE KEY VARIABLES. FOR GRADE 9, EFFECTS OF A PROGRAM ON HIGH AND AVERAGE IQ GROUPS ARE STUDIED. ALTHOUGH THE  AUTHORS WERE AWARE OF THE NECESSITY TO CONTROL FOR THE QUALITY AND SUBJECT MATTER OF PROGRAMMED MATERIALS, TEACHER CHARACTERISTICS, CEILING EFFECTS OF ACHIEVEMENT TESTS, AND CLASS DIFFERENCES IN ABILITY, THESE FACTORS WERE NOT WHOLLY CONTROLLED IN STUDY DESIGN, BUT THEY WERE CONSIDERED IN REPORTING RESULTS. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS ARE--EXTENSIVE VARIATION IN LEARNING RATE PREVAILS UNDER SELF-PACING CONDITIONS, PRETEST SCORES SHOW THAT MANY STUDENTS KNOW THE SUBJECT AND SOME ARE NOT READY TO LEARN, INTELLIGENCE IS RELATED TO PACE, STUDENTS REQUIRED TO LEARN MORE DO LEARN MORE, DIFFERENT TEACHER-PROGRAM COMBINATIONS IN SEVERAL GRADES DO NOT AFFECT ACHIEVEMENT.

        "description":"PROJECT HEAD START WAS CONCEIVED IN PART, TO INCREASE THE ORDINARILY REDUCED NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE CHILD AND OTHER PEOPLE. FOUR QUESTIONS WERE ASKED. (1) WOULD THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS OF HEAD START CHILDREN DIFFER FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN IN A CONTROL GROUP. (2) WOULD HEAD START CHILDREN DEVELOP APPROPRIATE SOCIAL TRUST. (3) WOULD THE TEACHERS' COGNITIVE STYLES AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS. (4) WOULD THE TEACHERS' PERCEPTIONS OF HEAD START CHILDREN AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS. TWO-THIRDS OF THE STUDENTS, OR 978 CHILDREN IN THE DELAWARE SUMMER 1965 HEAD START PROGRAMS WERE GIVEN A PRE-TEST ON ELEVEN TASKS FROM THE SELF-SOCIAL SYMBOLS TASKS, AND 945 OF THE CHILDREN WERE POST-TESTED, 100 NON-HEAD START  CHILDREN OF A COMPARABLE BACKGROUND WERE USED AS A CONTROL GROUP AND TESTED IN THEIR HOMES AT THE SAME TIME AS THE HEAD START STUDENTS. EIGHTY PAIRS OF CHILDREN WERE PRE-TESTED ON A SHARING TASK MEASURING SOCIAL TRUST, AND 20 PAIRS WERE POST-TESTED. RESULTS OF THE TESTS SHOWED THAT THE HEAD START EXPERIENCE PRODUCED POSITIVE CHANGES IN SELF AND SELF-OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. HEAD START CHILDREN GAINED A PERCEPTION OF SELF AS BEING SIMILAR TO OTHERS AND TENDED TO MAINTAIN SELF AS CENTRAL. CONTROLS SHOWED A SHIFT TOWARD LOWER SELF-ESTEEM AND A LACK OF CHANGE FROM A SELF-DIFFERENT TO A SELF-SAME RESPONSE. (CO'D)",

(1) EACH CHILD SHOULD BE SPOKEN WITH EVERY DAY, IN ORDER TO OVERCOME HIS SILENCE. (2) HELPING CHILDREN BECOME SKILLFUL AT OBSERVATION BY CLASSIFYING OBJECTS AND READING PICTURES WILL ALSO INCREASE THEIR CURIOSITY. (3) DEMONSTRATIONS SUCH AS ZIPPING A ZIPPER ARE EFFECTIVE IN TEACHING PRACTICAL SKILLS. (4) THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO BUILD SELF IMAGE OR SELF RESPECT IN CHILDREN. ONE WAY IS TO LEARN RESPECT FOR OTHERS BY GIVING EACH  CHILD SOME PERSONAL POSSESSION. (5) CHILDREN ALSO NEED TO USE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS RUNNING AND PAINTING EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS. (6) FOR CHILDREN TO DEVELOP CURIOSITY THROUGH SCIENCE THEY CAN HAVE PETS AND PLANTS IN THE CLASSROOM.

        "description":"THE GOAL OF THE BEREITER-ENGELMANN PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IS TO GET DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN READY FOR THE LEARNING TASKS OF PUBLIC SCHOOL BY TEACHING A TEACHING LANGUAGE. THIS IS DONE BY MEANS OF A HIGHLY ORGANIZED AND STRUCTURED DIRECT LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION DESIGNED TO TEACH THAT A SENTENCE IS A SEQUENCE OF MEANINGFUL PARTS. THE CHILDREN BEGIN WITH LEARNING THE BASIC POINTING-OUT, OR IDENTIFYING, STATEMENT. WHEN THE CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE RENDITION OF THE IDENTIFYING STATEMENT, THEY ARE TAUGHT THE NEGATIVE STATEMENT. CATEGORIZATIONS, SUCH AS FARM ANIMALS AND WILD ANIMALS, ARE THEN INTRODUCED. THE CHILDREN LEARN THE VARIOUS AND PRECISE USES OF &quot;AND,&quot;&quot;OR,&quot;&quot;ONLY,&quot; AND &quot;SOME.&quot; THEY ARE NEXT GIVEN A SERIES OF TASKS THAT DEAL WITH VERB TENSES, VERB EXPANSIONS, AND PERSONAL  PRONOUNS. WHEN THE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN DIRECTED THROUGH THIS COURSE IN BASIC LOGICAL USAGE, THEIR LANGUAGE ABILITY THEN PERMITS SOME PROBLEM SOLVING. RESULTS OF THE STANFORD-BINET AT THE END OF TWO YEARS OF INSTRUCTION INDICATE THAT THE CHILDREN'S IQ'S HAVE RISEN AND ALSO THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE THE LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION TO ACQUIRE READING AND ARITHMETIC SKILLS.

THE STUDY SAMPLE WAS COMPOSED OF THE THREE CENTERS HAVING THE BEST RECRUITMENT RECORD AND THE THREE HAVING THE POOREST. EACH GROUP HAD ONE NEGRO, ONE PUERTO RICAN, AND ONE MIXED SCHOOL. MATCHED SETS OF 150 HEAD START AND 150 NON-HEAD START CHILDREN FROM THESE SCHOOLS WERE CHOSEN. THEIR PARENTS WERE INTERVIEWED BY INTERVIEWERS OF THE MATCHING ETHNIC GROUP. FINDINGS WERE THAT SOME ELIGIBLE FAMILIES HAD THE MEANS TO PROVIDE OTHER SUMMER PROGRAMS AS ALTERNATES AND SO DID NOT ENROLL THEIR CHILDREN. SOME LOW INCOME PARENTS HELD HIGH EDUCATIONAL ASPIRATIONS FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND ENROLLED THEM TO HELP REALIZE THEIR GOALS.  INTERVIEWS BY INDIGENOUS PERSONNEL WERE FOUND TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE IN RECRUITING. ETHNIC BACKGROUND AFFECTED PARENTAL REASONS FOR ENROLLMENT. FOR INSTANCE, PUERTO RICAN MOTHERS WANTED THEIR CHILDREN TO BE EXPOSED TO SITUATIONS OUTSIDE THEIR OWN CULTURAL EXPERIENCE. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR ENROLLMENT WAS THAT HEAD START WOULD HELP CHILDREN ADJUST SOCIALLY TO SCHOOL. SOME PARENTS GAVE EDUCATION, RECREATION, AND CHILD CARE AS REASONS FOR ENROLLMENT. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR NOT ENROLLING CHILDREN WAS THE LACK OF ENROLLMENT INFORMATION. INTERVIEWS REVEALED ENTHUSIASM FOR HEAD START AND A NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE RECRUITMENT.

THE PRIMARY CONCERN CENTERED AROUND FOUR MAJOR QUESTIONS--(1) THE EXTENT OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUP SEGREGATION IN THE SCHOOLS, (2) WHETHER THE SCHOOLS OFFERED EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, (3) THE DEGREE OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUP DIFFERENCES ON STANDARDIZED ACHIEVEMENT TESTS, AND (4) THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE KINDS OF SCHOOLS ATTENDED AND ACHIEVEMENT TEST PERFORMANCE. CERTAIN FINDINGS BY MAYESKE FROM THE SURVEY REPORT BY COLEMAN AND OTHERS INDICATE WAYS IN WHICH THE EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT OF MEXICAN-AMERICANS ARE AFFECTED. SOME OF THOSE RESULTS ARE--(1) SCHOOLS CAN PROVIDE CERTAIN EXPERIENCES SUCH AS ATTENDANCE AT KINDERGARTEN AND VERBALLY ENRICHING MATERIALS WHICH WILL HELP TO  OVERCOME THE LANGUAGE HANDICAP EXPERIENCED BY MANY MEXICAN-AMERICANS, (2) THE FAMILY BACKGROUND DOES INFLUENCE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, (3) BECAUSE OF PEER INFLUENCE, THE SOCIAL COMPOSITION OF THE STUDENT BODY IS HIGHLY RELATED TO ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, (4) TEACHER ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION INFLUENCE ACHIEVEMENT, AND (5) STUDENTS' ATTITUDES TOWARD SCHOOL AFFECT THEIR ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT.

HOWEVER, IN THIS GENERATION TOO OFTEN HEALTHY DISCONTENT GIVES WAY TO DISENCHANTMENT AND SICK DESPAIR, AND THERE IS AMPLE REASON FOR YOUTH TO BE DISCONTENTED WITH OUR SOCIETY, WHEN WE ARE UNABLE TO MOBILIZE OUR VAST CAPACITIES TO MAXIMUM EFFECTIVENESS. SOME OF THESE CAPACITIES INCLUDE--EXCELLENT EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, SURPLUSES OF FOOD, AND AMPLE MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL FACILITIES. SOCIETY HAS FAILED TO GIVE YOUTH THE NEEDED INSPIRATION TO FORESTALL THIS DISENCHANTMENT BECAUSE TOO MANY AMERICANS ARE SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME DEGRADING OUR OWN COUNTRY, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS MADE MORE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THAN ANY ONE COUNTRY IN ALL THE HISTORY OF MANKIND. THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF AMERICA  SHOULD REMAIN DISCONTENTED BUT SHOULD NOT LOSE THEIR FAITH OR PERSPECTIVE IN THE FUTURE. THEIR CHALLENGE IS TO BUILD ON WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THE PAST AND NOT DESTROY THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF OUR PAST GENERATIONS.

THIS IS COMPOUNDED BY--(1) THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PATIENT AND THE HEALTH SERVICES, (2) LACK OF TRANSPORTATION, (3) LACK OF COMMUNICATION, AND (4) LACK OF HEALTH SERVICES, PERSONNEL, FACILITIES, AND SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. ONE METHOD OF PROVIDING BETTER HEALTH SERVICES HAS BEEN TO TRAIN NON-PROFESSIONAL HEALTH AIDES TO TEACH GOOD HEALTH PRACTICES. AN ATTEMPT TO ATTRACT PHYSICIANS TO RURAL AREAS INVOLVES COMMUNITY SUPPORT OF A PROGRAM TO CONSTRUCT A RURAL HEALTH CENTER. THE UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING A PROJECT TO RECRUIT PHYSICIANS IN GROUPS, BY ESTABLISHING A STRONG TIE-IN BETWEEN A RURAL CLINIC AND A UNIVERSITY  MEDICAL CENTER, AND BY ENCOURAGING LOCAL COMMUNITY ACCEPTANCE OF THE PHYSICIANS' FAMILIES.

THE METHODOLOGY INCLUDED--(1) OBSERVATIONS BY THE RESEARCHER, (2) INTERVIEWS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH TEACHERS, SCHOOL PRINCIPALS, AND THE CHILDREN, AND (3) THE USE OF SEVERAL QUESTIONNAIRES DESIGNED FOR SELECTED CONCERT SITUATIONS WITH CHILDREN. THE FOLLOWING  CONCLUSIONS WERE MADE AS A RESULT OF CHILDREN OBSERVING LIVE MUSIC PERFORMANCES--(1) CHILDREN CAN ACQUIRE FACTS ABOUT THE MUSIC, THE PERFORMERS, THE INSTRUMENTS PLAYED, AND THE PERFORMANCE AS A WHOLE, (2) ATTITUDES MAY BE OBSERVED IN EXPRESSIONS OF THEIR INTEREST IN THE MUSIC AND DESIRE FOR STUDYING AN INSTRUMENT HEARD IN THE PERFORMANCE, AND (3) TRANSFER EFFECTS IN THE AREAS OF ACCULTURATION, AND SPECIFICALLY, SELF-CONCEPT, ARE MOST DIFFICULT TO MEASURE.

A PRACTICAL WAY TO RATIONALIZE THE RURAL-URBAN MOVEMENT WOULD BE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SERIES OF \"SENDING\" AND \"RECEIVING\" CENTERS IN THE MAJOR AREAS OF MIGRATION. \"SENDING\" CENTERS, LOCATED IN THE RURAL AREAS, WOULD CHANNEL PEOPLE TO THE \"RECEIVING\" CENTERS IN THE METROPOLITAN AREAS.

MOST OF THESE SCHOOLS WERE FINANCIALLY UNABLE TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO THEIR PROGRAMS, AND AS A RESULT MANY BECAME INVOLVED IN PROJECTS (10 ARE DESCRIBED HERE) WHICH WERE TO BE ATTEMPTED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TEACHING-LEARNING PROCESS. MULTIGRADED CLASSES, CORRESPONDENCE COURSES, MULTIMEDIA INSTRUCTION, PROGRAMED MATERIALS, CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, AND SHARED SERVICES WERE AMONG THE PRACTICES ATTEMPTED IN DIFFERENT AREAS. THE SPECIFIC PRACTICES THAT SEEMED TO HOLD MOST PROMISE FOR SMALL SCHOOLS WERE THE NONGRADED SYSTEM, TEAM TEACHING, TEACHER AIDES, AND INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION IN THE ONE-TEACHER  SCHOOL. IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE THAT ADOPTION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES CAN HELP PREVENT THE ISOLATED SMALL SCHOOL FROM BEING INFERIOR IF THERE IS COMMUNITY SUPPORT, BOARD OF EDUCATION SUPPORT, AND IF AN EXPERIENCED AND HIGHLY TRAINED FACULTY CAN BE EMPLOYED.

FAMILIES CONTRIBUTE TO DELINQUENCY BY CREATING DISTURBED PERSONALITIES, FAILING TO TEACH AND ENFORCE PROPER CONDUCT, AND BY FAILING TO PROVIDE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BACKGROUND FOR ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF SOME OF THESE REGULATIONS WOULD NOT PERMIT THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES IN RURAL AREAS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE SUCH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS DAY CARE, EXTENSIVE SPECIALIZATION, AND THE CONSULTATION PROCESS. THE SECOND SECTION RELATES TO THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEANINGFUL SERVICE WHICH RURAL YOUTH MAY EXPERIENCE WHILE WORKING IN MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. DUE TO THE SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, COLLEGE  STUDENTS AND OTHER YOUTH HAVE BEEN UTILIZED TO PROVIDE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE.

FROM AN ANALYSIS OF CLASSICAL AND MODERN RESEARCH, A HEURISTIC MODEL WAS CONSTRUCTED WHICH DELINEATED THE DIRECTLY INTERACTING SYSTEMS POSTULATED AS FUNCTIONING DURING ORAL READING. THE MODEL AS OUTLINED WAS DIFFERENTIATED LOGICALLY INTO THREE MAJOR PROCESSING FUNCTIONS--SENSORY, RECOGNITIONAL, AND RESPONSE. DATA WERE DERIVED FROM 2,465 EYE-VOICE SPAN PAIRINGS FURNISHED BY EIGHT SUBJECTS READING THREE PASSAGES OF VARYING DIFFICULTY. THE SYNCHRONIZATION OF RECORDINGS USING THE GILBERT EYE-MOVEMENT CAMERA AND TAPED ORAL READING SHOWED RELATIVELY CONSTANT EYE-VOICE SPAN. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN MEASURES OF SMOOTH READING AND THE CONSTANCY OF TEMPORAL EYE-VOICE SPAN WERE HIGH. THE ESTIMATED TIME ELAPSING  BETWEEN EYE AND VOICE DURING SMOOTH READING WAS VALIDATED. REESTABLISHING A STEADY STATE FOLLOWING AN INTERRUPTION WAS NOT STATISTICALLY STABLE. THE USE OF MULTIPLE FIXATIONS, REGRESSIONS, AND PROLONGED FIXATION PAUSES WAS SUBSTANTIATED, AND SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS AMONG EYE-MOVEMENT PATTERNS WERE FOUND. THE NEED TO TEMPORALLY BALANCE INPUT AND OUTPUT SYSTEMS AND THE NEED TO CORRECT EYE-FUNCTIONING IN ORDER TO REESTABLISH TEMPORAL BALANCE WERE EVIDENT. THE MODEL WAS DECLARED INCOMPLETE, AND, ALTHOUGH IT MAY ADD TO CUMULATIVE KNOWLEDGE OF READING PHENOMENA, HAS LITTLE TO OFFER THE TEACHER AT PRESENT.

IT WAS HOPED THAT CHILDREN WOULD EXHIBIT A CONSISTENT PATTERN OF CHOICES OVER TRIALS, WHICH MIGHT HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING WORD RECOGNITION AND OTHER READING SKILLS. THE DIGIT SPAN SUBTEST OF THE WECHSLER INTELLIGENCE SCALE FOR CHILDREN, AN AUDITORY TEST, MEASURED MEMORY SPAN AND WAS USED AS THE SCREENING DEVICE. FIVE-LETTER NONSENSE WORDS COMPRISED THE WORD RECOGNITION TASK. CHILDREN WERE REQUIRED TO SELECT FROM A GROUP OF NONSENSE WORDS THE ONE SIMILAR TO THE WORD THAT HAD JUST BEEN SHOWN TO THEM. EACH WORD IN THE RESPONSE GROUP  CONTAINED ONE CUE WHICH APPEARED IN THE SAME POSITION AS IN THE STIMULUS WORD WITH THE OTHER CUES HELD CONSTANT. FIVE CUES WERE EXAMINED--POSITIONS 1, 2, 3, 4, AND 5, AND EACH SUBJECT HAD AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO EACH CUE.

WORKSHOPS WERE CONCERNED WITH FACULTY DEVELOPMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER TEACHERS, MANY OF WHOM WERE EXPERIENCED IN ENGINEERING DESIGN EDUCATION, COULD SUCCESSFULLY GUIDE STUDENTS THROUGH UNSTRUCTURED DESIGN PROJECTS. WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED THEIR EXPERIENCES, AND FOUR EXPERTS IN DESIGN-RELATED FIELDS, WHO HAD VISITED THE WORKSHOPS, DESCRIBED THEIR IMPRESSIONS. ONE SESSION WAS DEVOTED TO THE CASE STUDY METHOD OF DESIGN EDUCATION USED AT STANFORD. INVITED LECTURERS DESCRIBED HOW SOME OF THE NATION'S MAJOR INDUSTRIES ACCOMPLISHED  INTERDISCIPLINARY DESIGN. SECTIONS OF THE REPORT DEAL WITH (1) INTRODUCTION, (2) DESIGN LABORATORY WORKSHOPS, (3) CASE METHOD WORKSHOPS, AND (4) SPEAKERS FROM INDUSTRY. APPENDIXES LIST (1) THE CONFERENCE PROGRAM, (2) CONFERENCE ATTENDEES, AND (3) WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS.

THE LANGUAGE OF SCIENCE, ITS METHODS OF INQUIRY, AND CONCEPTUAL SCHEMES ARE THEN RELATED TO STIMULUS-RESPONSE LEARNING THEORY. AFTER A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF INHIBITION, THE SOCIAL, PHYSICAL, AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD IS CONSIDERED. CONCLUDING SECTIONS OFFER PRACTICAL ADVICE IN THE APPLICATION OF LEARNING THEORY TO CLASSROOM SITUATIONS. INTRODUCTORY SECTIONS OF THE PAPER ON  CREATIVITY ARE DEVOTED TO THE NATURE OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF CREATIVE TALENT IN THE CLASSROOM. MANY CHARACTERISTICS OF CREATIVE INDIVIDUALS ARE LISTED AND DISCUSSED. FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF RESEARCH STUDIES THAT HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR SCIENCE TEACHING THAT ENCOURAGES AND FOSTERS CREATIVITY, SUGGESTIONS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING SCIENCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE MADE.

THE PROGRAM SHOULD REFLECT THE NATURE OF SCIENCE AS AN ENTERPRISE OF INTELLIGENCE AND SHOULD USE THE METHODS OF INTELLIGENCE. THE PURPOSES OF THE SCIENCE TEACHER SHOULD BE IN HARMONY WITH THOSE OF THE SCIENTIST. THUS TEACHERS SHOULD CREATE SITUATIONS THROUGH WHICH CHILDREN ENGAGE IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE TO SEEK ORDERLY EXPLANATIONS OF PHENOMENA AND TO TEST THESE EXPLANATIONS. THE CURRICULUM STRUCTURE WHICH PROVIDES SUPPORT AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE &quot;INGREDIENT PROCESSES&quot; MUST POSSESS STABILITY. A CURRICULUM BASED ON CONCEPTS PROVIDES A MEANS THROUGH WHICH  CHILDREN CAN DEVELOP THE ABILITY TO CLASSIFY OR CATEGORIZE INFORMATION IN THE LEARNING PROCESS. CONCEPTS ARE DEVELOPED OVER LONG PERIODS OF ACTIVITY AND THOUGHT (DISCRIMINATING EXPERIENCE) AND INVOLVE (1) OLD COMPREHENSION, (2) CONFRONTATION, (3) INVESTIGATION, AND (4) NEW COMPREHENSION. DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXPERIENCE INTRODUCED AT DIFFERENT GRADE LEVELS, OR LEVELS OF MATURATION, RESULT IN CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT AND INCREASED SOPHISTICATION IN CONCEPT ATTAINMENT.

THE STRATEGY WAS TO SELECT A SAMPLE OF WORD PAIRS (240 COMMON NOUNS ARRANGED INTO 120 PAIRS TO REPRESENT A VARIETY OF JUDGED RELATIONSHIPS) AND THEN TO STUDY THESE PAIRS EXTENSIVELY IN A VARIETY OF EXPERIMENTAL TASK SITUATIONS. PAIRED-ASSOCIATES LEARNING AND VERBAL DISCRIMINATION LEARNING SCORES WERE DETERMINED IN TWO EXPERIMENTS. THE INTEREST WAS IN ACHIEVING A STABLE SCORE FOR EACH PAIR. TO DO THIS A GROUP STUDY-TEST PROCEDURE WAS DEVELOPED AND USED WITH APPROPRIATE MINOR CHANGES IN BOTH EXPERIMENTS.  EACH PAIR APPEARED IN FIVE DIFFERENT 60-ITEM LISTS. EACH LIST WAS PRESENTED TO AN INDEPENDENT GROUP OF SUBJECTS FOR THREE TRIALS. THE LEARNING TASK SCORES WERE CORRELATED WITH ALL OF THE VARIABLES DESCRIBING ASPECTS OF THE STIMULUS MATERIAL. THE MAJOR INTEREST WAS IN COMPARING THE PATTERNS OF CORRELATION FOR THE TWO EXPERIMENTS. SEVERAL MAJOR DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND. PAIRED-ASSOCIATE PERFORMANCE CORRELATES SUBSTANTIALLY WITH THE MEASURES OF DIRECT ASSOCIATION WHILE VERBAL DISCRIMINATION PERFORMANCE CORRELATES NEAR ZERO. THE GENERAL CONCLUSION IS THAT PROPERTIES OF THE STIMULUS MATERIAL PLAY VERY DIFFERENT PARTS IN THE TWO TASKS. (AMM)",

BY ANALYZING THE WORKINGS OF THE PSYCHOSOCIAL SYSTEM THROUGH THE GENERAL SYSTEMS THEORY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW CHANGE OCCURS IN AN INDIVIDUAL FAMILY OR COMMUNITY. APPLIED TO A FAMILY INTERVIEW, THE MODEL INDICATES THAT THE INTERVIEWER PLAYS A DISTURBING ROLE IN ORDER TO RENDER A STABLE SYSTEM UNSTABLE AND TO INDUCE A NEW LEVEL OF STABILITY. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE PROCESS OF THERAPY CONSISTS OF A LONG SERIES OF SUCH EQUILIBRIA, DISEQUILIBRIA, AND NEW EQUILIBRIA. TO DETERMINE THE DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM OF ANY SOCIAL SYSTEM, THE INITIAL STATE OF THE SYSTEM, THE ADEQUACY OF REGULATORY RESOURCES, THE CONSTANCY OF THE ENVIRONMENT, NATURE,  FORCE, RATE, AND SEQUENCE OF DISTURBANCES, AND THE CONSEQUENT LEVEL OF ANXIETY MUST BE ASSESSED.

SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITIES ARE OF TWO TYPES--(1) SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS, AND (2) CONSENSUAL DIFFICULTY LEVEL OR GENERALIZED JUDGMENTS ABOUT DIFFICULTY. VARIOUS TECHNIQUES FOR ELIMINATING OR CONTROLLING INDIVIDUAL COMPETENCE JUDGMENTS HAVE BEEN DEVISED. IN ONE METHOD, THE SUBJECT STATES HIS PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS FOR THE TASK. IN ANOTHER METHOD, THE SUBJECT IS GIVEN AN ASSESSMENT OF HIS COMPETENCE PRIOR TO PERFORMANCE OF THE TASK. SOME RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE COMPETENCE VARIABLE IS RELEVANT IN  MEASURING ACHIEVEMENT MOTIVATION. THIS TOPIC REQUIRES FURTHER INVESTIGATION. EXTRINSIC INCENTIVES SUCH AS SOCIAL APPROVAL AND PRESTIGE ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN THE COMPETENCE VARIABLE.

EVENTUAL COLLEGE PERSISTERS DID NOT DIFFER WIDELY FROM THEIR CLASSMATES ON PERSONALITY SCALES ADMINISTERED IN 1959, BUT BY 1963, WERE MORE INTELLECTUAL AND FAR MORE AUTONOMOUS, AS MEASURED BY THE OMNIBUS PERSONALITY INVENTORY SCALES USED. THOSE WHO DID NOT ATTEND COLLEGE REGRESSED IN INTELLECTUAL INTERESTS AND AUTONOMY, AND THOSE WHO WITHDREW WITHIN THREE YEARS FELL BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO GROUPS. THE EVIDENCE WAS STRONG THAT THE LONGER THE PERSISTENCE IN COLLEGE, THE GREATER THE GROWTH IN MEASURED INTELLECTUALITY AND AUTONOMY. LEVEL OF ABILITY  WAS RELATED TO ENTRANCE INTO COLLEGE, BUT LESS THAN SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS. MARKED DIFFERENCES IN ACADEMIC MOTIVATION AND PARENTAL ENCOURAGEMENT ALSO DISTINGUISHED COLLEGE ATTENDERS FROM NONATTENDERS. MANY MORE ATTENDERS, WHILE STILL HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS, FELT THAT COLLEGE WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, AND MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY ATTENDERS AS NONATTENDERS REPORTED PARENTAL ENCOURAGEMENT TO ENROLL. MOST OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE IDENTIFIED, RELIGIOUSLY AND POLITICALLY, WITH THEIR PARENTS AND SEEMED AS CONFORMING AND UNCRITICAL OF EXISTING SOCIAL NORMS AS PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS. (AUTHOR)",

THE TAXONOMY CATEGORIES ARE SENSATION, FIGURE PERCEPTION, SYMBOL PERCEPTION, PERCEPTION OF MEANING, AND PERCEPTIVE PERFORMANCE. POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS OF THE TAXONOMY ARE ILLUSTRATED BY THE CLASSIFICATION OF TWO DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR TYPES, EACH HAVING A CLEARLY PERCEPTUAL BASIS. A HIERARCHY OF TESTS WAS DEVISED, RANGING FROM THE SIMPLEST SENSORY TO THE MOST COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL TASK, TO MEASURE AUDITORY DIAGNOSTIC ABILITY IN STUDENTS OF AUTOMOBILE MECHANICS. SEPARATE TEST BATTERIES OF MUSICAL ABILITY, THE \"SEASHORE MEASURES OF  MUSICAL TALENTS\" AND THE \"WING STANDARDIZED TESTS OF MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE,\" WERE PLACED IN THE TAXONOMY CATEGORIES WITH ADDITIONAL NECESSARY TESTS SUGGESTED TO ENCOMPASS THE PERCEPTUAL DOMAIN. PERCEPTUAL ANALYSIS MAY BE USEFUL IN INDICATING THE LEVELS AT WHICH INDIVIDUAL PERCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES OCCUR. OTHER APPLICATIONS OF A TAXONOMY OF PERCEPTION ARE ALSO SUGGESTED. (WR)",

        "description":"A CURRICULUM DESIGN WHICH APPEARS APPROPRIATE TO THE MIDDLE SCHOOL YEARS IS DESCRIBED. BECAUSE OF RAPID CHANGE AND HIGHLY VARIABLE INDIVIDUAL GROWTH PATTERNS, THE MIDDLE SCHOOL HAS THE MOST DIVERSE STUDENT BODY OF ANY SCHOOL UNIT. VARIED THOUGH THE STUDENTS MAY BE, DEVELOPMENTAL TASKS AT THIS AGE INCLUDE ACHIEVING SELF-UNDERSTANDING TO REACH A STABLE SELF-CONCEPT AND ACQUIRING THE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND ATTITUDES ESSENTIAL FOR GOOD HUMAN RELATIONS. A CURRICULUM DESIGN MUST TAKE PROPER ACCOUNT OF A SOCIAL AND CULTURAL MILIEU CHARACTERIZED BY VALUE CONFLICTS, STRESS, ROLE CHANGES, AND ACCELERATING SOCIAL CHANGE. ANY MEANINGFUL DESIGN MUST ALSO INCLUDE HOW MAN ORGANIZES, EXPANDS, AND INTERRELATES KNOWLEDGE. A PROGRAM THAT GIVES ADEQUATE AND BALANCED ATTENTION TO THE LEARNER, TO  SOCIETY, AND TO ORGANIZED KNOWLEDGE IS NEEDED. THE AUTHOR QUESTIONS THE VALUE OF CURRICULUMS BUILT AROUND THE ORGANIZED FIELDS OF KNOWLEDGE. SPECIALIZATION, THE KNOWLEDGE EXPLOSION, INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, AND THE RAPID CHANGES IN ADOLESCENTS CALL FOR A CONTINUOUS, NONGRADED, VERTICAL PROGRESSION THROUGH LEARNING EXPERIENCES WITH GENUINE SEQUENTIAL ORGANIZATION IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL CURRICULUM DESIGN. A CORE CURRICULUM GIVES THE NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY IN GROUPING, SCHEDULING, AND ORGANIZATION. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE CONFERENCE OF THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION (11TH, UNIV. OF TOLEDO, OHIO, NOVEMBER 11, 1967). (WR)",

THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE VARIOUS SKILLS WAS MADE THROUGH OBSERVATION AND ISOLATION OF TEACHER VARIATIONS WHICH RESULT IN STUDENT PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCES ON PRECONSTRUCTED CRITERIA TESTS. THE GENERALITY OF TEACHER BEHAVIORS WAS ANALYZED FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS OF LEARNERS, DIFFERENT PACKETS OF CONTENT, AND A COMBINATION OF THESE TWO. AN ASSESSMENT STUDY WAS MADE TO ASCERTAIN THE RELATIONSHIP OF LEARNER PERFORMANCES TO SUPERVISORY RATINGS OF PARTICIPATING TEACHERS. ADAPTATIONS OF RYAN'S CLASSROOM OBSERVATION RECORD AND THE STANFORD TEACHER APPRAISAL GUIDE OF TEACHING COMPETENCE WERE USED TO GATHER THE SUPERVISORY RATINGS DATA. THE  FINDINGS OF THE STUDY IMPLY GENERALITY OVER CONTENT PACKETS ACROSS LEARNER GROUPS, NO ASSUMPTIONS OF GENERALITY OVER LEARNER GROUPS ACROSS CONTENT PACKETS, AND NO GENERALITY OVER CONTENT PACKETS AND LEARNER GROUPS. THE PRINCIPAL IMPLICATION IS THAT ELEMENTARY TEACHERS SEEM TO PRESENT THE SAME PACKET OF CONTENT WITH SIMILAR SUCCESS TO DIFFERENT LEARNER GROUPS. NO SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR WAS FOUND TO GENERALLY DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN EXTREME TEACHERS, EVEN THOUGH SEVERAL COMMON DISCRIMINATING BEHAVIORS WERE FOUND BETWEEN ANY TWO OF THE THREE CONTENT AREAS. POSITIVE CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN SUPERVISORY RATINGS AND AVERAGE STUDENT PERFORMANCE SCORES. (HW)",

SUGGESTIONS FOR ACTIVITY MODIFICATIONS INCLUDE (1) RAISING THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITIES FROM IMITATIVE TO MEANINGFUL, (2) DIVERSIFYING INPUTS AND OUTPUTS, (3) DIVERSIFYING INTEGRATION, (4) INCREASING ATTENTION SPAN, (5) DEVELOPING SEQUENCED INSTRUCTION IN SMALL STEPS, AND (6) INCREASING SOCIAL INTERACTIONS.

RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE IN AN INTERIM REPORT. A LONGITUDINAL STUDY WAS PLANNED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE NEW PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN WITH MINIMAL BRAIN DAMAGE AND WITH AT LEAST POTENTIALLY NORMAL INTELLIGENCE WAS MEETING THE CHILDREN'S NEEDS. THE PRESENT REPORT IS BASED UPON TWO GROUPS OF SUBJECTS--SIX STUDENTS WHO HAD BEEN IN THE PILOT CLASS IN 1958 OR EARLIER AND 19 OF THE 32 CHILDREN WHO WERE IN CLASSES FOR BRAIN INJURED CHILDREN IN APRIL 1960 AND FOR WHOM FOLLOWUP DATA COULD BE OBTAINED. CLASSES WERE  OBSERVED, TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS WERE INTERVIEWED, THE RECORDS OF THE SUBJECTS WERE EXAMINED, SUBJECTS WERE ADMINISTERED STANDARDIZED TESTS OF READING AND MATHEMATICS, AND TWO SCALES MEASURING CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIOR WERE OBTAINED FOR THE 19 SUBJECTS. RESULTS OF THE TESTS INDICATED THAT AVERAGE GAIN OVER THE PERIOD OF 2 1/2 YEARS WAS 1.0 YEARS IN READING AND 1.3 YEARS IN MATHEMATICS. THE AVERAGE IQ WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE 75. IMPROVEMENT IN TEST TAKING BEHAVIOR AND IN NEGATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OCCURRED FOR THE GROUP AS A WHOLE. THE GROUP OF SIX SUBJECTS FROM THE PILOT CLASS WERE PRESENTLY ENROLLED IN SIX DIFFERENT SCHOOLS--THREE WERE IN MENTALLY RETARDED CLASSES, TWO WERE IN REGULAR CLASSES, AND ONE WAS IN A HEALTH CONSERVATION CLASS. ACHIEVEMENT TESTS IN READING AND MATHEMATICS SHOWED AN  AVERAGE GAIN OF ABOUT 2 YEARS ON THE TESTS OVER THE FOLLOWUP PERIOD OF ABOUT 3 1/2 YEARS. BASED ON THE OBSERVATIONS AND INTERVIEWS, RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE CONCERNING (1) MEDICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND EDUCATIVE EVALUATION, (2) SELECTION AND TRAINING OF TEACHERS, (3) SUPERVISION, (4) PROVISION OF AUXILIARY SERVICES, (5) CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, (6) PARENT EDUCATION, (7) INTERCOMMUNICATION AMONG AGENCIES, AND (8) WIDENING THE PROGRAM.

RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY WAS SIGNIFICANT (P IS LESS THAN .01). THE TEST IS USEFUL WITH EMH FEMALES TO AGE 16 AND WITH EMH MALES TO AGE 20 YEARS. ALTHOUGH THE MAXIMUM CHRONOLOGICAL AGE DIVISOR OF 15 WAS ESTABLISHED BY HARRIS, THE INTRA-SCORER RELIABILITY COEFFICIENT AFTER 6 WEEKS WAS .99. IN CONCLUSION, THE DAM TEST AS A MEASURE OF CONCRETE CONCEPT FORMATION SEEMS TO BE A RELIABLE INSTRUMENT FOR GAINING INFORMATION ABOUT MILDLY MENTALLY HANDICAPPED ADOLESCENTS.

THE SUBJECTS RANGED IN AGE FROM 7-16 YEARS AND WERE OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE. ALL HAD HEARING LOSS FROM BIRTH IN EXCESS OF 65 DECIBELS AT 500 CPS AND RESIDUAL HEARING ONLY FOR LOW TONES. FOLLOWING 1 WEEK OF TRAINING IN THE USE OF THE TWO HEARING AIDS, SIX TESTS OF AUDITION WERE GIVEN AND STATISTICALLY ANALYZED USING THE MANN WHITNEY TEST. THE SUBJECTS' AUDITION OF CONSONANTS WAS POOR WITH EITHER AID, BUT  SIGNIFICANTLY (.01 LEVEL) BETTER RESULTS WERE OBTAINED WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL AID ON TESTS DESIGNED TO MEASURE THE RELATIVE AUDIBILITY OF VOICED PHONEMES, AUDIBILITY OF SYLLABIC STRUCTURE, AWARENESS OF STRESS, AND DISCRIMINATION OF VOWELS. OBTAINED FROM TWO QUESTIONNAIRES (ANALYZED BY THE 2-TAILED SIGN TEST), INDEPENDENT JUDGEMENTS OF THE PARENTS ALSO DEMONSTRATED THE SUPERIORITY OF LOW FREQUENCY AMPLIFICATION IN TERMS OF THE GREATER RANGE OF SOUNDS TO WHICH THEIR CHILDREN RESPONDED, THE GREATER DISTANCES AT WHICH THEY COULD ATTRACT THEIR CHILDREN'S ATTENTION, BETTER CONTROL OF PITCH IN CHILDREN'S VOICES, AND GREATER EASE OF COMMUNICATION. MORE GENERAL USE OF HEARING AIDS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL TYPE, WHICH AMPLIFY A WIDE RANGE OF SOUND FROM 80 CPS UPWARD, WAS RECOMMENDED FOR AUDITORY  REHABILITATION WORK WITH DEAF CHILDREN WHO HAVE LOW-TONE RESIDUAL HEARING.

IN THE DESCRIPTIVE ASPECT OF THE STUDY, 32 EDUCABLE MENTALLY RETARDED, EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED CHILDREN (MEAN CHRONOLOGICAL AGE OF 12-6, MEAN MENTAL AGE OF 7-4, AND MEAN IQ OF 61) WERE GIVEN A DIAGNOSTIC BATTERY BASED ON AN EXTENDED MODEL OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC FUNCTIONING. THE GROUP DID NOT EVIDENCE AN OVERALL DEFICIT IN THE ENTIRE AUTOMATIC-SEQUENTIAL LEVEL OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC  FUNCTIONING, A DEFICIT WHICH HAD BEEN POSITED IN OTHER RESEARCH AS TYPICAL OF THE RETARDED. EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE AS WELL AS GROSS HETEROGENEITY IN THE GROUP'S PERFORMANCE WERE SEEN AS FACTORS PRECLUDING OBTAINMENT OF A SINGLE, GENERALIZED (I.E. TYPICAL) DEFICIT. IN THE REMEDIATION ASPECT, 15 OF THESE CHILDREN, MATCHED IN TRIADS BASED ON OBTAINED PSYCHOLINGUISTIC CHARACTERISTICS, WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THREE GROUPS. EXCLUDING THE NON-TREATMENT GROUP, SUBJECTS WERE TUTORED INDIVIDUALLY FOR 30 SESSIONS. ALL 15 SUBJECTS WERE RETESTED ON THE 17-TEST DIAGNOSTIC BATTERY. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, RECEIVING REMEDIATION BASED ON A LEARNING DISABILITY (I.E. PSYCHOLINGUISTIC) APPROACH, SHOWED GREATER GAINS IN DISABILITY AREAS AND OVERALL LEVEL OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC FUNCTIONING THAN THE OTHER TWO  GROUPS. THE NON-TREATMENT GROUP SHOWED GREATER GAINS THAN THE COMPARISON GROUP WHICH HAD RECEIVED TRADITIONAL REMEDIATION.

        "description":"THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT REWARDS FOR INTENTIONAL LEARNING ON INCIDENTAL LEARNING ACQUIRED BY PRESCHOOL EDUCABLE MENTAL RETARDATES IN A GAME SITUATION. AN ADULT EXPERIMENTER TAUGHT EACH RETARDATE TO PLAY MOTOR, SOCIAL AND PROBLEM-SOVLING GAMES (INTENTIONAL LEARNING.) A SECOND ADULT SERVED AS A PLAYER AND EXHIBITED MANNERISMS (INCIDENTAL LEARNING) WHILE PLAYING. TO EMPHASIZE THE RULES, THIS PLAYER MADE ERRORS AND WAS CORRECTED BY THE EXPERIMENTER. THE PLAYERS EITHER WERE GIVEN TANGIBLE, SYMBOLIC, OR SOCIAL REWARDS, OR WERE NOT REWARDED. THEY RECEIVED ONLY ONE TYPE OF REWARD IN ANY ONE GAME. IT HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE HIGHEST INTENTIONAL AND LOWEST INCIDENTAL SCORES WOULD RESULT FROM TANGIBLE REWARDS. THE BEST INTENTIONAL-INCIDENTAL SCORE  COMBINATION WOULD RESULT FROM SOCIAL AND SYMBOLIC REWARDS. THE HIGHEST INCIDENTAL SCORES WOULD OCCUR IN THE NO-REWARD CONDITION. THE FOLLOWING RESULTS WERE OBTAINED. IN EXPERIMENT ONE INTENTIONAL LEARNING DID NOT VARY AS A FUNCTION OF TYPE OF REWARD. SUCCESS IN THE GAME APPEARED TO BE A MORE POWERFUL REINFORCER THAN THE REWARDS OFFERED BY THE EXPERIMENTER (THE RETARDATE TYPICALLY EXPERIENCES SOCIAL PLAY DEPRIVATION AND FAILURE IN GAME SITUATIONS). IN EXPERIMENT TWO ALL RETARDATES WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SUCCESS IN GAME SITUATIONS. THE HIGHEST INTENTIONAL SCORES RESULTED FROM TANGIBLE REWARDS. THE HIGHEST INCIDENTAL SCORES OCCURRED IN THE NO-REWARD CONDITION. THE INCIDENTAL SCORES IN THE TANGIBLE AND SOCIAL REWARD CONDITIONS DID NOT DIFFER.

IN FOREIGN-LANGUAGE LEARNING, WHERE THE EMPHASIS IS ON CROSS-CULTURAL COMMUNICATION, THE AUDIO-LINGUAL APPROACH IS NOW RECOMMENDED BY NEARLY ALL LEADERS IN THE TEACHING PROFESSION. SOME OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN LINGUISTICS--TRANSFORMATIONAL GRAMMAR AND FEATURE AND ASPECT ANALYSIS--ARE STILL TOO THEORETICAL TO AFFECT THE TEACHING OF GRAMMAR, BUT MANY OTHER NEW AUDIO-LINGUAL AIDS ARE ALREADY IN USE. NEW LANGUAGES ARE BEING TAUGHT IN THE UNIVERSITIES AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, STUDY SEQUENCES HAVE BEEN  LENGTHENED, AND CURRICULAR COORDINATION IS HELPING TO PROMOTE CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING. THE MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION, AND OTHER GROUPS, ARE DEFINING NEW STANDARDS OF COMPETENCE FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. RESEARCH IS GOING ON IN SUCH RELATED FIELDS AS THE PHYSIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY, AND SOCIOLOGY OF LANGUAGE LEARNING, LINGUISTICS, AND THE SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT OF LANGUAGES.

THE THIRD EXPERIMENT ATTEMPTED TO MEASURE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PHONETICALLY ACCURATE PRONUNCIATION OF EACH OF 34 FRENCH PHONEMES COULD BE ACQUIRED BY THE AMERICAN STUDENT THROUGH THE SIMPLE REPETITIVE IMITATION OF MODEL SOUNDS. PRELIMINARY SOUND DISCRIMINATION TRAINING OR PRONUNCIATION COACHING WAS DELIBERATELY AVOIDED IN FAVOR OF A SIMPLIFIED BASELINE PROCEDURE OF UNAIDED &quot;SELF-SHAPING.&quot; THE FOURTH AND FIFTH EXPERIMENTS  COMPARED THE SOUND JUDGING ACCURACY OF INDIGENOUS NATIVE SPEAKERS OF FRENCH TO THAT OF NATIVE FRENCH SPEAKERS FAMILIAR WITH ENGLISH AND TO AMERICAN TEACHERS OF FRENCH WHO HAD LEARNED FRENCH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE.

THE PUBLIC FELT THAT THIS NEED MUST BE MET, ALONG WITH MORE TRADITIONAL LITERARY OBJECTIVES, AND WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR IT. RECENT TECHNICAL BREAKTHROUGHS HAVE MADE LANGUAGE LEARNING AND TEACHING MORE SCIENTIFIC. BECAUSE OF MEDICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH, PRACTICE AND ANALOGY HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE JUST AS NECESSARY IN SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNING AS IN THE LEARNING OF A NATIVE TONGUE. DESCRIPTIVE LINGUISTICS HAS CLARIFIED WHAT A LANGUAGE IS, AND HOW IT CAN BE ANALYZED, PRESENTED, AND  DRILLED. ELECTRONICS AND RECORDINGS AID THE CLASSROOM AND THE LANGUAGE LABORATORY.

WELL-PREPARED TESTS BEAR OUT WHAT A GOOD TEACHER ALREADY KNOWS, AND ALSO HELP THE STUDENTS BY TEACHING NEW ITEMS BY IMITATION, INDUCTION, OR ANALOGY AS THEY TEST. BECAUSE LANGUAGE LEARNING ACHIEVEMENT IS CUMULATIVE, AND REQUIRES ANALYTICAL POWERS PLUS GREAT AMOUNTS OF MEMORIZATION, HABITUAL REPETITION, AND PRACTICE, TESTS NOT ONLY SHOULD REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE OF NEW WORK BUT ALSO SHOULD BE  COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH TO SHOW THE STUDENTS' ASSIMILATION OF PREVIOUSLY LEARNED MATERIAL. TESTING IS ALSO A VERY EFFECTIVE MEANS OF MOTIVATING STUDENTS TOWARD SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES AND TERMINAL BEHAVIOR--PRETEST STUDY AND THE TESTING PERIOD ITSELF RECEIVE A STUDENT'S BEST CONCENTRATION. THE PRINCIPLE OF SPACED LEARNING APPLIES WELL TO SPACED TESTING. FREQUENT SHORT TESTS ARE MORE RELIABLE, PRODUCTIVE, AND FAIR TO STUDENTS THAN INFREQUENT LONG ONES, BUT BOTH SHOULD BE USED. SHORT SPOTCHECK TESTS ARE RELIABLE IF THERE ARE ENOUGH RECURRENCES OF ITEMS FROM A COMMON CATEGORY. ORAL WORK CAN BE GRADED EASILY BY USING A SIMPLE TAPED TEST. THIS SPEECH WAS DELIVERED AT THE MEETING OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE, CHICAGO, DECEMBER 27, 1967. (AS)",

        "description":"FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING IS BASED UPON THE DIVISION OF CLASS SESSIONS INTO MODULES OF 20 TO 25 MINUTES. MODULES CAN BE COMBINED IN VARIOUS WAYS TO SUIT THE INSTRUCTIONAL PROCESS, AND MORE FLEXIBLE USE MAY BE MADE OF THE SUBJECT OR CURRICULUM, THE PUPILS, AND THE TEACHERS. IF FLEXIBILITY IS APPLIED TO BOTH THE CURRICULUM AND THE PUPIL, PROGRESS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE MUST BE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF ACHIEVEMENT RATHER THAN IN TERMS OF TIME SPENT IN THE CLASSROOM. WHILE CHANGING FROM TRADITIONAL TO FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING, IT IS INITIALLY SAFER TO REAPPORTION FAMILIAR ACTIVITIES TO DIFFERENT SPANS OF TIME THAN TO REDISTRIBUTE ACTIVITIES INTO NEW MODES OF INSTRUCTION (LARGE GROUP, SMALL GROUP, LABORATORY). INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS MAY BE CUT BY REPLACING TRADITIONAL INFLEXIBLE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION  WITH LARGE GROUP MEETINGS, LABORATORY WORK, OR SELF INSTRUCTION. HOWEVER, A CAREFULLY PLANNED CURRICULUM IS NECESSARY TO ALTERNATE BETWEEN THESE KINDS OF INSTRUCTION. FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING CAN BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR SOLVING SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONAL PROBLEMS AND IMPROVING INSTRUCTION.

IT CAN BE USED TO ASSESS PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS BY GIVING IT AS A PRE- AND POSTTEST. IT CAN BE ADMINISTERED INDIVIDUALLY, OR TO GROUPS OF UP TO 15 IF THERE IS 1 ADULT FOR 3 OR 4 CHILDREN, AND TAKES FROM 15 TO 30 MINUTES TO ADMINISTER. THE TEST ITEMS ARE URBAN-ORIENTED AND WERE SELECTED FROM A POOL OF 500. THE FINAL TEST STANDARDIZATION WAS BASED ON STAFF-ADMINISTERED TESTS OF A SAMPLE OF 539 DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN SELECTED FROM URBAN AREAS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. A KUDER-RICHARDSON 20 (KR 20) RELIABILITY OF .90 WAS OBTAINED, TOGETHER WITH A TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY OF .87. THE LAST IS QUITE UNUSUAL FOR A GROUP TEST OF 4-YEAR OLDS. THE TEST IS NOW  AVAILABLE ONLY ON AN EXPERIMENTAL BASIS, BUT PUBLICATION IS BEING CONSIDERED. (DR)",

THE JUILLIARD REPERTORY PROJECT WAS ESTABLISHED TO FIND NEW MATERIALS, IN THE FORM OF GOOD MUSIC IN ITS ORIGINALLY COMPOSED STATE, SUITABLE FOR USE IN THE ELEMENTARY GRADES. EXPERT CONSULTANTS WERE ENGAGED TO COLLECT AND EVALUATE A GREAT QUANTITY OF INSTRUMENTAL AND VOCAL MUSIC FROM THE VARIOUS PERIODS OF MUSIC HISTORY (PRE-RENAISSANCE, RENAISSANCE, BAROQUE, CLASSICAL, ROMANTIC AND CONTEMPORARY) AND FROM THE INTERNATIONAL FOLK MUSIC REPERTORY OF ALL PERIODS. A PANEL OF MUSIC EDUCATORS REVIEWED THE SELECTIONS SUBMITTED BY THE CONSULTANTS AND RECOMMENDED CERTAIN ONES OF THEM FOR CLASSROOM TESTING.  SEVEN DIVERSE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS, EACH RECOGNIZED AS MAINTAINING A HIGH QUALITY OF MUSICAL INSTRUCTION, PARTICIPATED IN THE TESTING PROGRAM. EVALUATIONS OF TEACHER AND STUDENT RESPONSES TO THE TEST MATERIALS WERE SUBMITTED TO THE PROJECT STAFF. AN ANTHOLOGY OF WORKS SELECTED FROM THOSE TESTED IS TO BE PUBLISHED. INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT REPORT ARE (1) ACCOUNTS OF THE PROCEDURES EMPLOYED IN THE SELECTION OF SUITABLE WORKS FOR TESTING, (2) DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TESTING ENVIRONMENTS AND PROCEDURES, (3) EVALUATIVE REPORTS FROM PROJECT CONSULTANTS AND TESTERS, AND (4) A LIST OF THE MATERIALS PRODUCED BY THIS PROJECT.

THE HIGHLY STRUCTURED PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO OVERCOME PARTICULAR WEAKNESSES OF DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN, WITH PARTICULAR STRESS PLACED ON LANGUAGE SKILLS. THE 55 SUBJECTS WHO TOOK PART IN THE 2-MONTH STUDY WERE SELECTED FROM LOW SOCIOECONOMIC HOMES AND WERE ASSIGNED TO CLASSES IN SUCH A WAY THAT EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE MATCHED IN IQ, SEX, RACE, AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THE SUBJECTS WERE PRE- AND POSTTESTED WITH THE STANFORD-BINET INTELLIGENCE SCALE, THE ILLINOIS TEST OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC ABILITIES, THE PEABODY  PICTURE VOCABULARY TEST, AND THE FROSTIG DEVELOPMENTAL TEST OF VISUAL PERCEPTION, AND WERE POSTTESTED WITH THE METROPOLITAN READINESS TESTS. COMPARISONS INDICATED THAT (1) EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PROGRESS IN MEASURED IQ, (2) OVERALL PROGRESS IN PSYCHOLINGUISTIC ABILITIES WAS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME FOR BOTH GROUPS, (3) THE CONTROL GROUP SHOWED SLIGHTLY HIGHER VOCABULARY GAINS, ALTHOUGH THE GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY, (4) THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP SHOWED GREATER GAINS IN VISUAL PERCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT, AND (5) THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN EACH AREA OF THE READINESS TESTS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE HIGHLY STRUCTURED PROGRAM IS MORE EFFECTIVE, BUT FINAL EVALUATION MUST AWAIT THE EVALUATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SUBJECTS IN  SCHOOL. (DR)",

IN THE NEXT PART OF THE REPORT IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT YEARS OF LEARNING ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 4 AND 6. JUNIOR KINDERGARTENS COULD THEREFORE HAVE GREAT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CHILD'S FUTURE LEARNING PATTERN. YET, SOME EDUCATORS FEEL THAT PRESCHOOL IS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE MIDDLE-CLASS CHILD AND THAT KINDERGARTEN IS ADEQUATE. STILL OTHER EDUCATORS FEEL THAT IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE STIMULATION AND GUIDANCE TO ALL PRESCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN. THERE HAVE BEEN CONFLICTING RESULTS IN STUDIES MADE. THESE COULD BE DUE TO THE VARIOUS TYPES OF CHILDREN, TEACHER-CHILD INTERACTION AND THE  NATURE OF THE PROGRAM. DUE TO THE LACK OF CONCLUSIVE RESULTS, FURTHER RESEARCH TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF HAVING A JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN WAS JUDGED TO BE NECESSARY. (CO)",

        "description":"IN 1960 AT TORONTO, CANADA, A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF ACHIEVEMENT WAS BEGUN IN JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN WITH 8,695 CHILDREN. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY WERE (1) TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN ATTENDANCE ON THE ACHIEVEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN, AND (2) TO EXAMINE THE NATURE OF THE WORLD OF JUNIOR AND SENIOR KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN. THE DATA COLLECTED CONSISTED OF INFORMATION AND SCORES FROM (1) THE DRAW-A-CLASSROOM TEST, (2) THE PUPIL PROFILE FOLDER, (3) THE RATING QUESTIONNAIRE, (4) THE METROPOLITAN ACHIEVEMENT TEST, AND (5) THE OTIS QUICK-SCORING MENTAL ABILITY TEST. FOUR TABLES WERE MADE TO COMPARE JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN WITH SENIOR KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN WHO HAD NOT ATTENDED JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN. OF THOSE WHO DID NOT GO TO JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN, MATCH 1  INCLUDES CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS CHOSE NOT TO SEND THEM TO JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN. MATCH 2 INCLUDES CHILDREN LIVING WHERE JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN WAS NOT AVAILABLE. STATISTICALLY, MATCH 1 SHOWED JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN TO BE A GREAT ADVANTAGE. MATCH 2 SHOWED LITTLE DIFFERENCE, AND IN SOME CASES THE JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN GROUP WAS ACTUALLY SURPASSED BY THE SENIOR KINDERGARTEN GROUP. A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE INSIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE SHOWN IN MATCH 2 IS THAT PARENTS OF THOSE SENIOR KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN HAD JUST ENOUGH SCHOOLING TO PLACE A HIGH VALUE ON EDUCATION. THE EFFECTS OF JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN DISAPPEAR IN ABOUT 4 YEARS. IF JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN IS TO HAVE A LASTING EFFECT, THEN THE ENTIRE SCHOOL PROGRAM SHOULD BUILD ON THIS EXPERIENCE.
