        "description":"The out-of-school time (OST) domain offers a promising resource for enriching young people's experience of science, technology, and engineering. Belief is widespread that OST programs are ideal locations in which to learn science and that youth participation may increase access to science for underrepresented groups, such as girls or minorities, and enhance the science workforce. Indeed, many afterschool programs do offer science activities. The Coalition for Science After School found that 88 percent of programs in its network offered science activities, yet most offered 40 or fewer hours of science programming per year. In this paper, the authors describe initial findings about the characteristics of these programs and their home organizations, including aspects of program design, structure, funding, staffing, and youth audience. They then discuss how organization types differ in these program aspects and draw out implications for practice. (Contains 6 figures, 2 tables and 2 notes.)",

        "description":"Expanded learning opportunities, such as afterschool and summer programs, are particularly well positioned to help address science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education crisis. A large percentage of youth participating in afterschool programs are members of groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. Additionally, the nature of these programs--featuring low student-to-staff ratios and opportunities for hands-on and project-based learning--makes them an ideal environment for inquiry-based informal science education. Nevertheless, high-quality STEM education does not seem to be happening at scale. Science education is not typically expected of programs in the way that art, music, and physical activity are. To address the STEM gap in expanded learning programs, expectations of programs must change and frontline staff must be supported with professional development in STEM.

        "description":"In an afterschool space, desks are grouped in fours. In the center of each group is a seemingly random assortment of materials, including uncooked spaghetti, spiced gumdrops, and a small cardboard square. After a brief introduction to the activity, a staff member posts the challenge on the wall: Using only these materials and working together as a team, each group must build the tallest possible tower that can support a 20-ounce water bottle independently for 10 seconds. The author is describing a typical scene in the 21st Century Community Learning Center (21st CCLC) he used to direct. The team members are the fourth-graders his program served--but they could equally well be the staff leader and his counterparts. As a program director, he worked to create a \"culture of STEM\" for both program participants and staff. Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) served as the central topic across all of his enrichment clubs. Most of the time, the author and his colleagues integrated STEM with other content areas such as language arts. They thus had taken the first steps toward making STEM learning an intentional component of their program.",

        "description":"Play is a major component of early intervention for infants and toddlers with special needs. Many of these children are from low-income families with limited resources. The authors investigate the attitudes, practices, and concerns of early-intervention providers (professionals whose services support young children with developmental disabilities and delay) concerning their use of toys in their work and their worries about poor youngsters without such playthings. The authors' survey of 320 early-intervention providers revealed that nearly all took play materials with them into the homes of some children but most of them also used items already present there. More than 80 percent of providers gave toys to their clients because of their concern that the family's poverty made toys scarce. As a group, physical therapists and occupational therapists were significantly less likely to use play materials they took into the homes. Most significantly, perhaps, all providers found that poverty increased the need for related therapist services, for educating parents about play, and for using play materials in therapy.

Using the Group Embedded Figures Test, the Articulation of the Body Scale, and written responses to three questions, the authors found significant relationships between children's field-independent or field-dependent thinking styles and play preferences; play preferences and academic performance; thinking styles and academic performance; and thinking styles and cultural setting. They also discovered that children's preferences for sports related, both positively and negatively, to their scores on state-mandated tests for language and math; that children who preferred unstructured play activities tended to achieve academic success; and that cultural values were correlated to thinking style. The authors argue that their study has applied value for educators because it relates children's play preferences to other aspects of their life experiences, which can help school policy makers decide the extracurricular activities and the types of play they should encourage.

        "author":["Prager, Phillip"],
        "description":"Dada, an art movement that became well known in the late 1910s and early 1920s, challenged traditional notions of art and aesthetics. Dada artists, for example, tossed colored scraps of paper into the air to compose chance-based collages, performed sound poems devoid of semantic value, and modeled a headpiece fashioned of sardine cans. To most art historians, Dada remains a culturally contingent expression of World War I trauma, nihilism, political disillusionment, and an aggressive attack on the moral bankruptcy of Western culture. The author suggests that this negative interpretation originates from art history's methodological blindness to the importance of play, not only to creative and artistic endeavors, but to human identity itself. Dada is characterized by an effervescent love of improvisation, curiosity, novelty and an unselfconscious exploration of the phenomenal world; it emphatically professed to be \"anti-art\" and \"a state-of-mind.\" When considered from the perspective of play research and positive psychology, Dada emerges as an early and visionary milestone in understanding play as a fundamental expression of humanity almost a century before academia would take adult play seriously.

        "description":"In this Retrospective, we revisit our 2007 \"College Composition and Communication\" article in order to clarify our primary argument, address some questions and critiques that have arisen, and consider anew the value of composition courses that study writing. We review our core argument that engaging students with the research and ideas of writing studies, building declarative and procedural knowledge of writing, improves learning transfer. Now, using the example of Jan Meyer and Ray Land's notion of threshold concepts, we argue for the field to better name its knowledge and conceptions and to decide what portion is suitable for first-year students. We clarify the distinction between this broad underlying goal and our personal approaches to accomplishing it, emphasizing the diversity of approaches that have come to embody the study of writing in first-year composition. While maintaining that writing studies lacks recognition of itself as a field and of the value of its specialized knowledge to writing instruction, we revise our original argument to show how writing instructors from other fields and with other expertise can build familiarity with writing studies research without extensive, specialized study. Ultimately, we continue to advocate teaching our field's knowledge in first-year composition, while expanding our sense both of how to prepare instructors to do so and of the value of such teaching.",

Examined in the context of consumer culture, students' narratives about university life illustrate how they marshal, appropriate, and deploy consumerist metaphors and to what ends. Using Fredric Jameson's concept of \"cognitive mapping,\" I argue that students rhetorically position themselves as consumer and as marketing strategist because these roles have significant standing in the contemporary capitalist culture, helping students adjust to a new place where they may feel powerless or disoriented. Following my analysis of these narratives, I suggest curricular methods that can be used in the classroom to question the meaning of an education. I advocate offering students the role of \"active learner,\" a role comparable to that of \"consumer\" but which also offers students a vantage point from which they can shape their university experience.

        "description":"Once controversial or cutting-edge, freewriting has recently become \"part of every writing teacher's repertoire\" (Bizzell and Herzberg in Elbow 393). On par with outlining or webbing, freewriting seems to be a go-to practice in a writing teacher's tool kit. This downshift into uncritical acceptance presents an apt moment to reconsider how we implement freewriting practices in the college writing classroom. Toward this reexamination, this essay problematizes the pervasive assumption about freewriting that it is above all else \"easy, effortless, quick, and free from judgment, hesitation, and doubt\". The essay suggests that this assumed ease remains one of the thorniest and obscured problems in the practice of classroom-based freewriting and hypothesizes that the mode required to freewrite is not necessarily natural or automatic for student writers, but rather requires training, conversation, and reorientation. In order for freewriting to be an effective means of stimulating critical and creative thinking, teachers of writing need to consider not only how we can add in analytical and reflective thinking \"about\" freewriting texts, but also how we can get students to do productive, questioning, and exploratory thinking \"within\" freewriting itself. Above all, facilitators of freewriting can benefit from assuming the difficulties of thinking through freewriting. (Contains 2 figures and 6 notes.)",

This essay demonstrates the pedagogical value of the scrapbook for how it encourages student composers to select, appropriate, and redesign external cover materials to communicate the message inside the book and how it emphasizes the haptic sense (touch). In short, the scrapbook assignment is pedagogically important because it teaches students the concept of affordances and demonstrates to them how materiality impacts design, composition, and rhetorical choices; it also provides a low-tech, low-stakes entry into multimodal composing and reflexivity on the rhetorical decision-making process.

Deploying Kenneth Burke's notion of ingenuous and cunning identification, it advances an argument that, through persistent acts of omission, clarity can become a cunning rhetorical form, a form often set into motion by unintentionally manifested cultural pressures.

        "description":"Grammatical gender embedded in determiners, nouns and adjectives allows indirect and more rapid processing of the referents implied in sentences. However in a language such as Spanish, this useful information cannot be reliably retrieved from a single source of information. Instead, noun gender may be extracted either from phono-morphological, semantic or syntactic cues, such as determiner-noun frames. This experimental work sought to explore toddlers' ability to use feminine and masculine determiners to infer a referent whose name was marked for grammatical gender, ending in \"o\" or \"a\", as well as a referent whose name was unmarked. Using the intermodal preferential looking paradigm, 24-, 30- and 36-month-old children were presented with pairs of images, target and distracter, of familiar objects while, at the same time, they heard a feminine or masculine definite (Experiment 1) or indefinite (Experiment 2) article that could only refer to one of the images displayed. Half of the trials presented objects whose target names ended in a final-vowel indicative of grammatical gender and the other half had another ending. The results demonstrated toddlers' ability to use the determiners to infer a target. Differences between toddlers' use of definite and indefinite determiners were found. The ability to use indefinite articles preceded the ability to use definite articles. In general, the results showed that anticipation of the noun from the determiner is mostly a function of phono-morphological cues embedded in marked nouns. Nevertheless, 36-month-old children were also able to associate the articles to targets whose names were unmarked for grammatical gender. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)",

In consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC), rats that have had experience drinking 32% sucrose solution drink significantly less 4% sucrose solution than rats that have drunk only 4% solution. It triggers an aversive-emotional reaction similar to fear or anxiety. We studied whether neonatal treatment with CLI alters the cSNC's response in adult rats. The findings of the present work suggest that the neonatal treatment with an antidepressive could generate an increase tolerance to frustration in adult animals. CLI rats showed a faster recovery from the cSNC than control animals, which may be explained by an alteration of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis (HPA), a serotonergic system deficit, a low expectative formation during pre-shift phase, or a combination of all these factors.

In Experiment 1, Long-Evans rats that encountered a novel object in either the black PA compartment or the open field, as well as those encountering a familiar object located in the black PA compartment all displayed weaker fear at test than did those subjects that encountered a familiar object in the open field. These effects were explained in terms of a counter-conditioning of fear resulting from the appetitive aspects of novelty exposure. Experiment 2 compared the fear-reducing capabilities of novel object exposure to a more simple extinction procedure. While both the extinction and novelty groups generally showed reduced fear compared to control animals, some evidence suggested that novel object exposure resulted in significantly less fear at test than did extinction alone.

The idea of embedding an IRT model for missingness into the measurement model is not new but, differently from the existing literature, the model presented in this paper belongs to the Rasch family of models. As a member of the exponential family, the model offers several advantages, such as existence of non trivial sufficient statistics and possibility of specific objective parameter estimation; feasibility of conditional inference; goodness of fit analysis via conditional likelihood ratio tests. Maximum likelihood estimation is discussed, and the applicability of the proposed model is illustrated by using a real data set. (Contains 7 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"The a priori determination of a proper sample size necessary to achieve some specified power is an important problem encountered frequently in practical studies. To establish the needed sample size for a two-sample \"t\" test, researchers may conduct the power analysis by specifying scientifically important values as the underlying population means while using a variance estimate obtained from related research or pilot study. In order to take account of the variability of sample variance, this article considers two approaches to sample size determinations. One provides the sample size required to guarantee with a given assurance probability that the actual power exceeds the planned power. The other gives the necessary sample size such that the expected power attains the designated power level. The suggested paradigm of adjusted sample variance combines the existing procedures into one unified framework. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the usefulness and advantages of the proposed approaches that accommodate the stochastic nature of the sample variance. More importantly, supplementary computer programs are developed to aid the usefulness and implementation of the suggested techniques. The exposition helps to clarify discrepancy in the previous demonstration and to extend the development of sample size methodology. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"A college degree is often the key to jumpstarting a career. And data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) consistently show that workers who have a college degree earn more than workers who don't. Not surprisingly, a college education is increasingly popular. For example, according to the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), postsecondary enrollment at all levels grew between fall 1980 and fall 2010--from about 12 million to 21 million students. Those students were less than half of the college-age population in 1980 but about 70 percent in 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The cost of attending college rose during that time as well. NCES data also show that between academic years 1980-81 and 2010-11, the cost of college, adjusted for inflation, more than doubled at both public and private institutions. But sources of money to help students pay for college haven't kept pace. And some types of financial assistance, such as state-funded aid, have shrunk. \"The result is that, today, student debt is largely unavoidable,\" says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of financial aid websites Fastweb and FinAid. This article is a guide to affording higher education. The first section describes ways to plan for college expenses before enrolling. The second section explains how to finance higher education. The third section offers tips for money management before, during, and after college. Resources for more information are listed at the end of the article. Strategies described in this article focus primarily on attendance at 4-year colleges and universities. However, the information is broadly applicable to different levels of higher education.",

The author works as a composer in the movie industry, creating music that supports a film's story. Other composers work on television shows, and some do both television and film. The composer uses music to tell the audience what kind of movie it is and to help convey what the actors are expressing. The music can vary, depending on the emotion in each scene. The author studies each project and decides where music will be most effective. When he does live recordings of music for a project, he writes sheet music for each instrument, rents a studio, records the pieces, then edits and mixes the tracks. After the music is recorded, he sends it to the production company along with a list of the precise locations where the music needs to be put into the picture. He says there is no minimum education and no particular career path to become a composer. Spend a lot of time studying the art of composition. One needs to have a firm grasp of the technical stuff. The author makes a concerted effort to keep up with the technological changes in the industry. He reads a lot of magazines and music websites online. He also spends a lot of time exchanging ideas with his colleagues and peers and hearing what they're doing.",

This article gives an overview of the data in the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) occupation profiles. It describes different jobseeking situations and shows how employment and wage data could be useful in each case. The first section describes how to use the three types of data in each profile: national, industry, and geographic.

        "description":"As online shopping has grown, so too has the number of people who make money selling products online. Online sellers can sell just about anything. Starting an online business can be as simple as having something to sell and access to the Internet. But there are a lot of factors to consider if one is going to have a business that thrives. One is to have confidence in one's idea, especially early on. Another factor for business success is helping one's product to stand out among the millions of other products online. One of the easiest ways to start selling online is to set up an account with an established shopping website, which brings in customers and provides guidance on how to sell online, usually at some cost to the seller. Online sellers do a variety of tasks. They photograph and write descriptions of the items they will sell and put the information online. They calculate total purchase amounts, taxes, and shipping costs; process payments; and send orders. And they interact with customers to answer questions or resolve problems. No formal education is required to become an online seller. Still, it's important to have good writing skills for crafting product descriptions and other web content, strong organizational and bookkeeping ability for keeping track of earnings and expenses, and resourcefulness for figuring out how to get products noticed.",

        "description":"Educators' expectations and understandings of parental involvement in our nation's schools are often disconnected from the reality of students' home lives. This qualitative study purports that educators often lose opportunities to more fully understand and serve students, particularly when perceptions of parental involvement and home-school-community relationships are not accurate or expansive enough to appreciate the nuances of different cultural, economic, or geographic circumstances. Parent (or caregiver) engagement, as we define it, encapsulates both parent voice and parent presence. Parent voice implies not only that parents have ideas and opinions about their children, but also that educators are receptive to this voice, allowing for an open, multidirectional flow of communication. Similarly, parent presence refers to actions related to the voices of caregivers. Based on a grounded theory model of qualitative research, we used a small, theoretically derived sample of parents involved with a local parent education program to further understand parent engagement, presenting detailed descriptions of conversations and writing done by participants through focus groups and interviews. From these data, new models of parent voice and presence emerged. These models act as precursors to a reconfigured and more comprehensive model of parent engagement. Crucial to the final model is an understanding of parent participation in children's lives that is fluid, robust, and specific to context and culture. The final model presented herein is a combination of parent voice and parent presence, whereby children's well being is central to the interactions. (Contains 3 figures and 3 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Parental involvement is an important component of children's school success. Although the literature on parental involvement among Latino families is growing and moving from deficit-based perspectives, very few studies have examined the parental involvement beliefs and practices of Latino families who vary across demographic and sociocultural lines within the same school community. This qualitative study explored Latino parents' beliefs about children's education, their involvement and advocacy beliefs and practices, and their perceptions of feeling welcome at their children's school. In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 parents of preschool and kindergarten children who attended a bilingual school. Qualitative descriptive analyses revealed that the majority of parents espoused the cultural value of \"educacion,\" engaged in learning activities at home, and viewed themselves as living models of behavior for children, regardless of their education or immigrant status. Only first generation immigrant parents made explicit reference to children's futures. All parents attributed supportive relationships with school personnel and a bilingual climate as the most important sources of feeling welcome at school. However, parents with more education valued what they perceived as an \"open door policy\" and were more vocal in critiquing policies. Findings have implications for the development of multicultural competence among teachers and for ways diverse Latino families might develop a shared voice within the school sector.

Drawing on Bourdieu's concept of symbolic violence, the article discusses how deficit perspectives held toward Latina mothers and the privileging of White, middle-class frames result in symbolic violence. Some of the consequences that these episodes of violence produce for Latina mothers personally and for their participation in schooling are revealed. A caring encounter is presented as a contrast to show that some educators do come to their interactions with Latina mothers prepared to listen and learn from their diverse ways of doing. This article suggests an ideological stance that must be present for caring encounters to take place and some implications for teacher and administrative credentialing programs.",

This is an exploration of the intrinsic value and the complex dynamics of the organizing process of a small group of Latino immigrant parents struggling to improve their children's educational opportunities at their local middle school. It is based on a microanalysis of the parents' interactions, exploring the process of awareness and mobilization as the participant families challenged established school policies and practices they perceived as discriminatory towards the education of their children. It chronicles and examines the process by which the participating families and their children increased their visibility in the school community, eventually gaining access to more challenging instruction and to an improved school experience. The author examines the parents' process of engagement at the school by focusing on specific moments and interactions called trigger events, which play a critical role in the parents' mobilization. These events galvanize and inspire their increased participation in a process marked by initial feelings of indignation and alienation but which, over time, engages the participants in a journey of joint discovery, collaboration, and hope.",

Yet, a dearth of research is available for advancing evidence-based practices for setting and monitoring home visiting goals or for understanding how family characteristics or program features are associated with them. With the intent of stimulating empirical attention to this pivotal objective in Head Start's home-based program, this study explored a home-based Head Start program's routine practices for identifying and monitoring goals. In addition, the interrelationship of demographic characteristics and home visiting frequency with goal activity was examined. Findings from this explorative study indicated that goal identification occurred for slightly more than half of the families. Additionally, goals were largely adult focused. Goal attainment occurred at a low frequency. For the most part, family demographics were unrelated to goal activity. However, higher home visiting frequency was associated with increased goal setting. Emanating from this study are implications for practice as well as for future research.

        "description":"This field report investigates how the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program, a college-readiness system targeting populations traditionally underrepresented in postsecondary education, provides students with consistent academic support while enrolled in a rigorous course of study. The report also addresses strategies AVID utilizes to engage students and families in the college preparation process as well as the various ways successful AVID programs foster a strong sense of community within schools. As a way to closely examine the depth and breadth of this well-regarded precollegiate program from a number of perspectives, four distinct but interrelated lenses are utilized. First, AVID is introduced to orient readers to its purpose, scope, and significance. Second, a brief review of research related to college access documents the barriers low-income students frequently face in the pursuit of higher education. This data further situates both the relevance and importance of the program. Third, a discussion of cultural capital draws attention to the multiple challenges low-income students encounter in school and documents the program's methods for facilitating both intellectual and affective growth. This analysis highlights how AVID's structure and philosophical orientation encourage and support the development of meaningful relationships among teachers, school staff, and program participants and their families. The article concludes by considering potential challenges administrators and teachers may confront when implementing AVID and offering practical recommendations that could benefit ALL students and their families.",

Using data from the New York Public Schools' annual Learning Environment Survey, path analysis was used to examine the role that school climate plays in mediating the relationship between school size and parents' perceptions of invitations for involvement. Results from an analysis of middle and high school parents who participated in the annual school survey provided evidence that parents' perceptions of safety and of respect from the school mediated the relationship between school size and perceptions of the extent of the invitations for involvement provided by the school. The indirect effect of school size via perception of safety and respect was larger than the direct effect of school size on parents' perceptions of invitation for involvement.

        "description":"The Task-based Language Teaching (TBLT) method has been the proposed teaching method under the current national English curriculum since 2001. However, few studies have investigated in-service teachers' response to this proposed language teaching method. In this study, thirty public school English teachers were recruited in Beijing across school levels. Through participant interviews and class observations, the researcher examined how Chinese teachers of English at different school levels in Beijing respond to TBLT. Results suggest that teachers' responses to the proposed teaching method ranged from negative denial, passive acceptance, to active application of the TBLT in their classrooms and they served as the examiners, technicians, and explorers accordingly. Furthermore, teachers who actively applied the TBLT method into their instruction demonstrated different instructional foci in terms of task selection and task implementation. The study addresses pedagogical implications of TBLT for curriculum development and English instruction in Beijing, China. (Contains 1 table, 5 figures, and 1 note.)",

We then go on to report on a small-scale study which examines how student non-native speakers of English use a range of digital devices beyond the classroom in both their first (L1) and second (L2) languages. We look also at the extent to which they believe that their L2-based activity helps consciously and/or unconsciously with their language learning, practice, and acquisition. We argue that these data, combined with other recent trends in the field, suggest a need to move from CALL towards a more accurate acronym: mobile assisted language use (MALU). We conclude with a definition of MALU together with a brief discussion of a potential alignment of MALU with the notion of the digital resident and a newly emerging educational theory of connectivism.",

        "description":"The present study investigated the effect of form-focused and non-form-focused tasks on EFL learners' vocabulary learning through written input. The form-focused task aimed to draw students' attention to the word itself through word recognition activities. Non-form-focused tasks were divided into (a) the comprehension question task, which required an overall understanding of the text without focusing on any words; and (b) the message-oriented task, which pushed the learners into considering the context surrounding the word. The selection of the tasks was based on the notion of \"task-induced involvement\" and the \"Involvement Load Hypotheses\" (Laufer & Hulstijn, 2001). Forty-five EFL learners were given a list of words in order to discover unfamiliar target words. During the treatment phase, participants were asked to read a text containing target words and to perform one of the three tasks. Results show that the retention of unfamiliar words was higher in the two experimental groups (form-focused and message-oriented) than the control group (comprehension-question). Furthermore, the form-focused task yielded better results than the non-form-focused tasks (comprehension-question and message-oriented). These findings provide evidence for Laufer and Hulstijn's involvement model in which task effectiveness hinges upon the degree of involvement tasks induce. (Contains 8 tables.)",

While there is a very significant instructional aspect to this equation, providing effective support and services to students enrolled in online education is becoming comparatively important, especially with accrediting bodies. However, in meeting the needs of this unique population, institutions are discovering that the services they provide to distance learners can be offered to all students, regardless of where they live or how they choose to take their classes.

This paper explores student-student online coaching from the coach perspective. The empirical case is the project Math Coach, where K-12 students are coached by teacher students using instant messaging. This research is an adaptation of the community of inquiry model to an online coaching setting, which we refer to as a relationship of inquiry. The adapted model was used to gain a better understanding of the practice of online coaching by exploring the extent to which cognitive, social, and teaching presence exists in this case of online coaching. A relationship of inquiry survey was distributed to and answered by all active coaches (N = 41). The adapted cognitive, social and teaching presence measures achieved an acceptable level of reliability. Differences between three presences, and their respective sub-categories, demonstrate a unique pattern of interaction between coaches and coachees in the online coaching environment. Findings suggest the online inquiry model fits as well for a relationship of inquiry as it does for a community of inquiry. The model provides valuable information for better understanding of online coaching. (Contains 6 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Online education is no longer a peripheral phenomenon in higher education: over one-third of faculty members have taught or developed an online course. As institutions of higher education expand their online education offerings, administrators need to recognize that supporting faculty members through the use of incentives and through effective faculty development programs for online instruction is important to the improvement of the quality of educational programs. This quantitative study used an online survey to investigate the types and frequency of faculty development programs for online instruction at institutions with an established teaching and learning development unit (TLDU). The average TLDU offered about fifteen different types of faculty development programs, the most common being websites, technical services, printed materials, and consultation with instructional design experts. Findings indicate that some faculty development programs for online instruction are being offered more frequently; this increase has resource and staffing implications for the support of these programs.

        "description":"Rural schools face the challenges of motivating and retaining students, often in the face of severe resource constraints. This paper synthesizes fifteen years of the author's rural research on secondary students' school-related motivation, distilling it into strategic principles for rural teachers and administrators. Effective motivational knowledge and strategies supported by both theory and research can help school staff fill the gap between potential and actual student achievement. Multi-level strategies for motivating individuals and groups include elements of classroom instructional practice, interpersonal relationships, and the broader school motivational climate including policy. By motivating students effectively, teachers and administrators can bridge the gap between what students do achieve and what they could achieve. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

Here, we discuss three programs the Arkansas Department of Education has used to attract teachers to teacher Geographic Shortage Districts (GSDs) through material incentives. Unfortunately, none of the programs have had much success, perhaps in part since the funding offered was inadequate to attract new teachers to isolated communities. Additionally, we analyze the use of materialistic and non-materialistic incentives on the websites of all school districts designated as GSDs by the Arkansas Department of Education. Few GSDs display non-materialistic appeals that might entice individuals to seek out employment in the district, with the notable exception of KIPP Delta, the only charter school on the list, which has much more success recruiting teachers. We end with suggestions for policymakers and school district officials seeking to attract teachers to geographic shortage areas. (Contains 3 tables.)",

This article reports on a phenomenological inquiry which explored the nature of this relationship in the context of teacher education. Participant's lived experiences were hermeneutically interpreted against the philosophical writings of Heidegger and Gadamer. In this way, the research focused on the teacher-student relationship as it is &quot;experienced&quot; by lecturers and student teachers in pre-service teacher education programs, rather than how it might be &quot;theorised&quot;. The research found that relationships are essential and matter to the educational experience whether this is recognised or not. Similarly, a teacher's comportment was found to have a communicative aspect that is felt and sensed. Further, relationships are experienced as a play that is lived beyond the rules of engagement. Consistent with critical approaches to education, this research calls for the re-educating of educators towards essential understandings of relationship and the relational sensibilities that are integral to being in relationship.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a mid-career B. Sc. Agricultural Extension Curriculum in meeting the educational needs of mid-career extension agents. The study was descriptive and used a validated questionnaire to collect data from 30 purposively selected graduates of the program. The study revealed that 66.7% were aged between 40-49 years, and 93.3% had at least 10 years of working experience before entering the program. The graduates considered their competencies at the start of the program to be below average in all but 6 of the 25 courses offered under the program. After going through the program, all the graduates had attained competencies that were rated from high to very high. Improvement in academic status, knowledge and skills in the human relations as well as technical areas in agriculture, and attitude to work, were perceived as the major benefits of the program. The effectiveness of the program in meeting the needs of the graduates was attributed to the availability of appropriate facilities and the conducive environment for the teaching-learning process, availability of adequate and competent lecturers, committed and supportive administrative staff, balanced curriculum and a well-planned and supervised field component of the program known as the supervised enterprise projects (SEPs).

        "description":"Definitions, differences and relationships between formal, non-formal and informal learning have long been contentious. There has been a significant change in language and reference from adult education to what amounts to forms of learning categorised by their modes of facilitation. Nonetheless, there is currently a renewed interest in the recognition of non-formal and informal learning internationally and in Australia. This has been evidenced through the New OECD Activity on Recognition of Non-Formal and Informal Learning and recent policy developments in Australia. These developments have implications for the recognition of skills derived from informal and non-formal learning, especially for those disadvantaged in the labour market. This paper reports on data from a learning grid in a Learning Survey of labour market program participants (n = 172) from northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. We find that life (informal learning) and work experience (non-formal learning) are relatively more important for gaining self-reported skills than formal training/study. We conclude by arguing for a holistic focus on the dynamic interrelatedness of these forms of learning rather than being constrained by a deterministic dichotomy between formality and informality.

Previous studies have shown that gender and socioeconomic status (SES) are key variables related to equal access to education. Are these variables related to adults' engagement in lifelong learning in a specific country? This study analysed data from a survey of adults that was administered by the Ministry of Education in 2009. The results show a strong relationship between gender, SES and the learning experiences of adults. Women in low and middle SES groups were more likely to engage in lifelong learning. This study reveals that women's engagement in lifelong learning depended on their family concerns. Men's engagement in lifelong learning, in contrast, was often for career or work-related reasons. By explaining the connections between the gender and SES of adult learners engaging in lifelong learning, the results of this study will enrich the context of lifelong learning.

        "description":"This paper traces the policies and lessons learned from two consecutive German national programs aimed at developing learning cities/regions. Known as Learning Regions Promotion of Networks, this first program transitioned into the current program, Learning on Place. A case study chosen is from the Tolzer region where a network has self-sustained from its genesis in the initial program and conducts successful Learning Festivals. The German Government funded the Learning Regions Promotion of Networks Program from 2001 to 2008, with support from the European Union (EU) Social Fund. Over 70 regions were supported with a substantial budget on a phasing-out funding basis. When this program ended in 2008, a new program titled Learning on Place began, funded by the German Government and the EU Social Fund, commencing in 2009. This program has a focus on public and private partnership in supporting good educational management in cities and rural communities. In this way, by involving private foundations as partners, a framework for civic engagement has been introduced. To understand the purposes of and outcomes from these initiatives, it is important to grasp the European context within which the German Government and its Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF [&quot;Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung&quot;]) responded in answering the call to implement &quot;coherent and comprehensive strategies for lifelong learning&quot; (European Commission 2001: 4). In setting this challenge, the Commission communication quoted from a Chinese proverb that has philosophically underpinned the approach: When planning for a year, plant corn. When planning for a decade, plant trees. When planning for life, train and educate people. (Guanzi c. 645BC) (Contains 2 figures and 4 footnotes.)",

A qualitative study was conducted in 2011 in Melbourne, Australia utilising focus groups with 87 refugee background women from Karen, Iraqi, Assyrian Chaldean, Lebanese, South Sudanese and Bhutanese refugee backgrounds. Focus groups and interviews were also conducted with 18 service providers and five bicultural and community workers. Several barriers were identified that prevented refugee mothers from learning English; however, some innovative and flexible models appear promising. The development, implementation and evaluation of innovative models and settings for refugee background women with young children to learn English in a culturally appropriate way are essential.",

        "description":"Over the past decade the issue of food and in particular, food consumed within schools has come to encapsulate a broad range of concerns regarding children and young people's health and wellbeing. In Australia, the UK and more recently the USA, attempts to ameliorate a range of public health concerns have provided the impetus for an unprecedented proliferation of school food initiatives and legislative reforms governing the types of foods that may or may not be provided within schools. While academic enquiry in this area has largely focussed upon attempts to govern children, recent initiatives in the UK and Australia have begun to target parents in their attempts to promote healthy food practices. In this paper we interrogate the ways in which parents, or more specifically, mothers are positioned in relation to school food discourses in Australia and in the UK and suggest that school food has become a site through which an array of pedagogical opportunities are opened up to invoke particular subject positions premised on normative views of affective middle class motherhood. In short, we seek to explore the means through which mothers come to be regarded as legitimate targets of school food pedagogy. The paper draws on empirical data from Australia and the UK to compare a range of pedagogic techniques employed in the two countries. Drawing on governmentality studies we explore how school food pedagogies seek to regulate mothers and their children's food related choices. We consider school lunches and the various techniques that have been deployed in both countries to consider the moralising work that takes place around food and motherhood.

A combination of secondary research and primary data collected through in-depth interviews with former program participants, as well as student reflective essays written in the field, shows that the sensory experience with food is an important pedagogical tool. Focusing on questions of intentionality, sensory learning, and the meaning of authenticity, we explore the complications inherent in a formal education program built around culinary tourism. We argue that by the end of the three-week program in Spain, students identify as informed culinary tourists who recognize the complexity of authenticity and understand how sensory experiences can inspire and motivate both a bodily and an intellectual understanding of food and their relationship with it.

Given that farmers do not necessarily self-identify as educators, it is important to understand that in raising this critique, this paper is as much a challenge the author is extending to herself and other educators interested in food sovereignty as it is to members of the organic farming movement. This paper draws from the author's personal experiences and interest in the small-scale organic farming movement. It provides a brief overview of this movement, which is followed by a discussion of anti-racist food scholarship that critically assesses the inequities and inconsistencies that have developed as a result of hegemonic whiteness within the movement. It then demonstrates how a movement of Indigenous food sovereignty is emerging parallel to the organic farming movement and how food sovereignty is directly related to empowerment through the reclamation of cultural, spiritual, and linguistic practices. Finally, it discusses the potential benefits of adult educators interested in the organic farming movement linking their efforts to a broader framework of food sovereignty, especially through learning to become better allies with Indigenous populations in different parts of the world.

        "author":["Reiher, Cornelia"],
        "description":"Japan's Basic Law on Food Education (Shokuiku kihonho) was enacted in June 2005 as a response to various concerns related to food and nutrition, such as food scandals, an increase in obesity and lifestyle-related diseases and an assumed loss of traditional food culture. The Law defines food education (shokuiku) rather vaguely as the acquisition of knowledge about food and the ability to make appropriate food choices. In this paper, my focus is the impact of shokuiku on discourses about food safety in relation to the nuclear disaster. I will address the following problems: Firstly, the assumption that &quot;domestic food products are the safest in the world&quot;; secondly, the power relations between municipal authorities, producers and consumers in Japan; and thirdly, the question of whether food pedagogies can adequately address food safety concerns after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. I argue that, although the Basic Law offers a holistic approach to food in theory, with its focus on nutrition and the emphasis on domestic food, food pedagogies, practiced according to the Basic Law cannot adequately deal with the food safety problems that Japanese consumers face after the Fukushima nuclear accident. Because of the ignorance regarding food safety issues from official sides, Japanese consumers are left with a lack of awareness for these issues. Therefore, stakeholders who are not included in the state's shokuiku campaign, such as consumer co-ops and Civil Radioactivity Measurement Stations try to provide knowledge about food to enable Japanese consumers to make appropriate food choices.",

          "Swan, Elaine"],
        "description":"In this paper, we apply a framework from Nikolas Rose to analyse the politics of &quot;doing good&quot; in food activist education, what we call food pedagogies. We argue that a detailed exploration of food pedagogies has been neglected in adult education and in the growing field of food studies, in spite of the rapidly proliferating forms and site of food education, advice and learning in Australia and other countries. In contrast to other frameworks in adult education which focus on classifying approaches as behaviourist, humanist, progressive and radical, we deploy problematisations, technologies, authorities and teleologies. These latter &quot;pathways&quot; move away from an abstract idea of &quot;power as property&quot; and as coercive (Gore 1993) to an examination of &quot;power as technique&quot; and as productive. Drawing on qualitative data with three different types of food activist educators--a biodynamic educator, a health promotion managers and two farmer-activists, we show Rose's framework opens up our ideas about what can be seen as pedagogical to include the non-human and how adult educators authorise their claims to be doing good. We conclude by arguing that the differences in how each of these activists see food and health should not simply be seen as a difference in opinion but a difference in what Annemarie Mol (1999) calls ontological politics. In so doing, the paper contributes new findings and theorising on pedagogies to food studies, and a new analytic framework for analysing adult education approaches and in particular their claims to be &quot;doing good.&quot; (Contains 2 tables.)",

It further examines how these pedagogies challenge racialised, classed and gendered ideologies and practices in their aims, curricular content, and publically documented educational processes. The first case is Growing Power, an urban farm which embraces small scale capitalism and vocational education as an end toward community food security, social and ecological justice, and anti-racist education. The second case, Tsyunhehkw[superscript caret], is the &quot;integrated community food system&quot; of the Oneida Nation in rural Wisconsin, centred on cultural decolonisation through the growing and eating of traditional Oneida foods. In both these projects, there are strong possibilities to teach a critical, social justice alternative to white, middle class norms and practices of food production and consumption.",

        "description":"This paper explores the way learning to cook remains important for the maintenance of &quot;ethnic&quot; food traditions and how sharing food knowledge plays a role in intercultural exchanges. Ethnographic data from an ongoing study in Melbourne is presented to highlight how, in everyday practices, both tradition and innovation are involved in learning experiences related to cooking. Using an everyday multiculturalism perspective, the study was designed to investigate the resilience of ethnic food cultures in the face of increasing industrialisation in global food systems. In this paper, I focus in particular on the interplay between tradition and innovation in everyday settings by drawing closely on three women's accounts of cooking and learning. The women remain attached to the food traditions they learned by observing and taking part in daily routines of meal preparation and they stress that many of these practices need to be preserved. At the same time, their accounts reveal how everyday settings can be considered as &quot;pedagogical spaces&quot; where opportunities for innovation arise and new knowledge about food and cooking can be acquired. Families, schools, travel, workplaces and neighbourhood networks emerged as sites where traditional food knowledge can be shared and new skills developed. The paper contributes to our understanding of food pedagogies by highlighting the dynamic relationship between tradition and innovation in everyday, mundane encounters and exchanges in multicultural societies.",

          "Gallegos, Danielle"],
        "description":"There has been a recent surge of interest in cooking skills in a diverse range of fields, such as health, education and public policy. There appears to be an assumption that cooking skills are in decline and that this is having an adverse impact on individual health and well-being, and family wholesomeness. The problematisation of cooking skills is not new, and can be seen in a number of historical developments that have specified particular pedagogies about food and eating. The purpose of this paper is to examine pedagogies on cooking skills and the importance accorded them. The paper draws on Foucault's work on governmentality. By using examples from the USA, UK and Australia, the paper demonstrates the ways that authoritative discourses on the know how and the know what about food and cooking--called here &quot;savoir fare&quot;--are developed and promulgated. These discourses, and the moral panics in which they are embedded, require individuals to make choices about what to cook and how to cook, and in doing so establish moral pedagogies concerning good and bad cooking. The development of food literacy programmes, which see cooking skills as life skills, further extends the obligations to &quot;cook properly&quot; to wider populations. The emphasis on cooking knowledge and skills has ushered in new forms of government, firstly, through a relationship between expertise and politics which is readily visible through the authority that underpins the need to develop skills in food provisioning and preparation; secondly, through a new pluralisation of &quot;social&quot; technologies which invites a range of private-public interest through, for example, television cooking programmes featuring cooking skills, albeit it set in a particular milieu of entertainment; and lastly, through a new specification of the subject can be seen in the formation of a choosing subject, one which has to problematise food choice in relation to expert advice and guidance. A governmentality focus shows that as discourses develop about what is the correct level of &quot;savoir fare&quot;, new discursive subject positions are opened up. Armed with the understanding of what is considered expert-endorsed acceptable food knowledge, subjects judge themselves through self-surveillance. The result is a powerful food and family morality that is both disciplined and disciplinary.",

Its legitimacy as a rigorous conceptual category continues to be debated; even as small states assume a strident visibility on the world stage because of climate change negotiations. This paper reviews the scepticism that hovers around the small state concept, and invites a largely social constructivist discussion that looks at a syndrome of behavioural issues which are more likely to occur with decreasing polity size. Education remains a key policy battleground for small states, as the latter balance human resource needs with the trans-territorial aspirations of their brightest and ablest (and often wealthiest). In spite of spectacular advances in information and communication technologies, the personality of the small state has not essentially changed; and this remains characterised by rootedness and mobility.",

        "description":"Drawing upon recent work for the Commonwealth Secretariat and our ongoing comparative research, this article focuses upon the nature, impact and implications of contemporary development challenges for education in small states. It is argued that the post-Jomtien era has been dominated by international goals and targets that have focussed predominantly upon basic education, an area of strength for many small states. During this era, many small states found themselves ahead of other nations in terms of access to basic education. They were, therefore, extending the boundaries and parameters of many international educational agendas, pressing ahead and often challenging the focus of international development trajectories. In this article we argue that, because of this, small states have much innovative and pioneering experience to share with those who are now considering the possible nature and direction of post-2015 global education agendas. This includes a rationale for the strengthening of educational research capacity within small states, and an acknowledgement of the fact that small states have much to share with each other, and to contribute to wider development discourse and educational policy deliberations worldwide.

        "description":"Though the existing literature on the &quot;favelas&quot; (or shantytowns) of Brazil thoroughly documents the chaotic and violent nature of life within them, few connections have been made between the literature on &quot;favelas&quot;, fragility and small states, particularly with regard to the fragile state of educational institutions in &quot;favelas&quot;. This article summarizes the primary findings of prominent favela studies across the social sciences alongside the literature on fragility, drawing out a summative definition of fragility that easily applies to the context of education in Brazilian favelas. Primarily, this article argues that not only do the slums of Brazil qualify for classification as fragile small states, but such a classification by prominent multilaterals would open these areas to donor funding for educational programming that could greatly mitigate their fragility and advance educational equity, as occurs in other postconflict and fragile settings around the world.",

        "description":"This paper analyzes drivers and impediments to secondary school reform in Trinidad and Tobago during the period from 1999 to 2009. International assessment data suggested limited progress on improving system quality and equity. Several policy levers and barriers have been defined in current system reform theory. However, explanations for the failure or success of education reforms in Commonwealth small states must also consider theory related to their unique contexts, namely smallness and colonial history. In this study, whole system reform theory is bridged with contextualized small state and postcolonial theories to analyze themes derived from a qualitative analysis of experiences in a major reform project for the secondary school sector. The identified barriers to change were ambiguity, coherence, and stringency and the contextualized drivers were leadership, support, and participation. Small state and postcolonial theory had added explanatory value, providing more precise insights into the specific impediments to change within these contexts. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"This article analyses the institutional power of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in the process of education policy formation in El Salvador during 2003-2005. The results show how bi- and multi-lateral institutions are able to leverage financial and intellectual capital to guide the policymaking process and sway which policies are seen as acceptable and desirable. As is shown, one key to this influence is how USAID was able to manipulate the policymaking process by creating key events and producing key informational inputs that led to future events and subsequent opportunities to present and emphasize their research. Additionally, this research underscores how even exceptional leadership and political will at the national level can be insufficient to avoid the agendas that are at times advanced by international institutions. Finally, it is suggested that research on education in small states expand the notion of smallness to focus on institutional capacity, particularly within the context of the &quot;global architecture of education.&quot; (Contains 2 tables and 13 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Between 1960 and 2010, Singapore's real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita skyrocketed from $4,383 to $55,862, while Jamaica's barely increased from $6,417 to $8,539. It is plausible that differing rates of GDP growth are associated with differences in the development of education systems but causally the linkage is not well understood. Using a comparative analysis of education in Jamaica and Singapore, this paper explores the critical factors in education development in small states. This article argues that education development can substantively help small states overcome many of the limitations of their smallness that are exacerbated in an increasingly global economy. Three significant factors that shaped the education development of Jamaica and Singapore are identified. First, the timing of reforms is important, not just the content of educational reforms. Second, having a vocational strategy is key. Third, a balanced, forward-looking education development strategy that closely ties education, economic and national development is crucial.

Focusing on international communication networks, student mobility, or international curriculum development, universities invest human and financial resources to prepare graduates to meet global challenges. Globalization and post-Soviet independence have promoted emerging patterns of international education strategies and new approaches to managing international activities. This study explores current trends of university internationalization in post-Soviet Moldova as understood and interpreted by Moldova state universities' administrators. International Relations Department officials who are responsible for the design and implementation of international education programs discuss their perceptions of post-Soviet small state international outreach strategies, smallness and marginalization, and the unique aspects of academic internationalization in Moldova. Respondents' diverse internationalization techniques and expectations illustrate the importance of academic dialogue with post-USSR small states and raise possible standards for international collaboration with Eastern and Southern European universities.",

However, since the 1960s, when the country first engaged in &quot;modernization&quot; development and global politics, Bhutan has been anything but fragile and helpless. The Royal Government's focus on sustainable development, cultural heritage, and Gross National Happiness as a template for all social policies has empowered Bhutan to become a leader in the alternative development of small states. This article explores Bhutanese development in one specific area: inclusive education. As Bhutan has shifted its educational policy from elite monasticism to secular &quot;Education for All&quot;, issues of educating a heterogenous student population led to the development of inclusive education policies. This article examines how equity-based educational policies provide an alternative to economic-based policy prescriptions of the World Bank for small states.",

Findings enlighten how the kindergarten is serving as the basis to building on living traditions through cultural reinvigoration efforts, while the very essence of the kindergarten's sustainability has become dependent upon the revitalization of traditional practices historically fundamental to Kahuan society. From this, implications drawn address how community-based initiatives can facilitate early childhood education while still supporting context-specific cultures and identities through sustainable initiatives.

This year was like many in the past, where for decades, everyone convenes to continue traditions and preparations that have centered on a single, special event. This special event or celebration contextualizes the academic and social experiences of successful graduates of one HBCU located in Jefferson City, Missouri. In this paper, the authors utilize the literary devices of &quot;prologue&quot; and &quot;flashback&quot; to contextualize the rich history behind the Lincoln University Homecoming tradition. Their work investigated the origins of the institution to discover why it is that so many individuals continue to converge on the Hill at Lincoln every year. To address this fundamental question, the authors conducted oral histories of African-American women graduates in the late 1930s and 1940s primarily to learn why Lincoln was so special and why its graduates were so successful. The authors found that the colored soldiers' initial plans and dreams for African Americans were being realized. In addition, the authors suggest that through their listening to the voices of some longtime alumnae who also dreamed for a better future, they can identify the characteristics of one historically Black university where individuals engaged in solid and supportive educational experiences as a result of a deep belief that every student should be valued.",

        "description":"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are areas designated as STEM disciplines. There is national and international attention being given to these fields as they are the foundation for partnerships and alliances in the global economy. Education beyond high school is necessary to achieve desired levels of competency and efficiency in STEM fields. Despite the demonstrated need, there is a shortage of individuals trained in these areas, especially women and ethnic minorities (BHEF, 2006). Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have contributed meaningfully to addressing the void of qualified STEM educators and researchers (Allen, 2002). Studies at the beginning of the new millennium (in 2000), indicated that 40% of African Americans graduating with a bachelor's degree in biological sciences matriculated from an HBCU (Cronkite, 2000; National Science Foundation, 2002). Furthermore, HBCUs were responsible for 40% of the bachelor's degrees awarded to African Americans in other STEM fields, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, environment sciences and mathematics (Cronkite, 2000; National Science Foundation, 2002). Although these studies have established trends on the role that HBCUs have played in generating the pool of African Americans with degrees in STEM areas, most of these studies relied on data collected in the 1990s. Moreover, the last national report on the status of HBCUs and STEM graduates entitled \"Science and Engineering Degrees, by Race/Ethnicity of Recipients: 1991-2002\" was published in 2002, using data from that time period, collected as part of the Integrated Post-secondary Education Data System (IPEDS; National Science Foundation, 2002). Studies are needed to update the contribution of HBCUs to address the shortage of STEM graduates in the years subsequent. The purpose of the present descriptive study is to reexamine the number and percentage of African Americans graduating from HBCUs with STEM degrees in a nine year period. This study used national data produced by National Center for Educational Statistics (2010). The focus is to report the impact that HBCUs are having on educating African American undergraduates in STEM fields. (Contains 10 tables.)",

One lens to assess these experiences is through examining their engagement on campus. Student engagement is defined as the amount of time and energy students choose to devote to activities both inside and outside the classroom (Kuh, 2001). Although there have been studies on student engagement at HBCUs (Harper, et al., 2004; National Survey on Student Engagement [NSSE], 2004; Nelson Laird, Bridges, Morelon-Quainoo, Williams, & Holmes, 2007), few are empirical or theoretical studies (Closson & Henry, 2008; Peterson & Hamrick, 2009) that address aspects of engagement for subpopulations such as White undergraduate students.

        "description":"Teacher preparation programs across the country have faced criticisms regarding the quality of their programs. Additionally, these programs now compete with non-traditional programs when their graduates seek positions in public schools. As a result of many conversations as well as audits of the degree program at institutions in the state of Texas, the authors were interested in examining dimensions of the student teaching program at one institution. The dimension of the program they were most interested in evaluating was mentoring. Much of the literature on mentoring is on the in-service dimension, i.e., practicing teachers. They were interested in studying the impacts of mentoring with pre-service teachers, i.e., student teachers. This study on mentoring of pre-service teachers focused on the perceptions of the mentoring experiences of HBCU student teachers. This study affirmed that the student teaching program must include a succinct focus and actualization of mentoring with student teachers. The authors found that these programs must be tailored to the actual needs of the student teachers. They also found a need for a pre-student teaching phase where pre-service teachers could be acquire an understanding of the expectations, components, goals, and challenges of the student teaching experience.

        "description":"One of the major outcomes of the educational reform movement in the United States during the past decade has been the increased focus on the professional preparation of educators (Darling-Hammond, 1997). According to Sanders and Rivers, numerous studies indicate that educators make a significant difference in their students' education (1996). In response to the incessant calls to improve and assure educator quality, the education programs at Albany State University adopted a conceptual framework that integrates state, national, and professional standards into its education preparation programs. As such a standards-based preparation approach was developed to empower future professional educators who graduate from Albany State University. The conceptual framework at Albany State University consists of multiple forms of knowledge, drawn from many disciplines and sources, including research, best practices, historical and cultural perspectives, the learning community of education practitioners and professional and community values. One tenet of the conceptual framework is the goal of a reflective transformative practitioner. This principle is based on the assumption that the knowledge that supports its program is dynamic and continues to evolve as inquiry and research about teaching and learning are established. In order to become a reflective transformative practitioner, one must first understand what a reflective practitioner is and what transformation means. A transformative leader engages in reflection and action. Therefore in order for an educator to become a transformative leader, they must first learn the important skill of reflection. The next section of this article will describe the concept of reflection and the concept of transformation independently. These independent definitions will provide a foundation for the combination of the two concepts that are used in the teacher preparation program at Albany State University.",

        "description":"Since the passage of Proposition 48 (NCAA, 1984), African-American student-athletes entering National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) major colleges and universities have meet new challenges in their future as student-athletes. This major change altered the landscape of the future of college athletics particularly for students of color. Proposition 48 mandates minimum scores from the ACT (17), SAT (700), and a 2.0 high school grade point average (GPA). The NCAA believes that by putting a criterion on student-athletes, it will improve the graduation success rate and it will allow colleges and universities to be more selective of the students they admit through their doors on athletic scholarships. There are other factors that affect the academic achievement of student-athletes at the college level. For example, the demographic variables of gender, family structure, and socioeconomic status have a significant impact on the academic performance of African-American student athletes. These variables have accounted for some successes and failures of student-athletes. The purpose of this study was to predict the relationship between the independent variable (the demographic variables) which consist of family structure, socioeconomic status, and gender toward athletics and the dependent variable (academic performance) as measured by the Cognitive Grade Point Averages (CGPA) of student athletes in selected NCAA Division I basketball programs from universities in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The variables of family structure, socioeconomic status, and gender were found to have a linear relationship with the academic performance of basketball players on college campuses. Particularly, the variables gender and socioeconomic status were positively related to the academic performance among basketball players. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"One of the many challenges facing music educators is diminishing class time in lower secondary school in the face of the increasingly crowded curriculum and the advent of arts &quot;taster&quot; courses. However, music educators are still expected to be able to produce musically literate students capable of completing high level music courses in upper secondary school. This article reports on an intervention study which set out to accelerate music literacy acquisition among Year 7 students through use of a Direct Instruction (DI) teaching approach. Although controversial, Direct Instruction was chosen because its advocates claim its effectiveness and time efficiency in teaching basic skills. The study involved the development of a carefully scripted 10 minute per lesson DI music literacy program which was then implemented in a control group research setting. Two classes of Year 7 students (40 students) were taught music literacy via the DI program, while two separate Year 7 classes (34 students) acted as the control group. The intervention was administered over a trimester of 20 lessons (13 weeks), with levels of student music literacy tested via Gordon's Iowa Tests for Music Literacy at both the pre and post-test stages. The results revealed significant increases in music literacy levels among the DI classes, especially on the measures of rhythmic literacy. Given these results, the researchers recommend further investigation of the potential of DI as an instructional method in music education for better utilising diminishing class teaching time and improving student music literacy levels among lower secondary school students.

Young children need access to hear different genres of music, learn a variety of repertoire, engage in composing and play musical instruments. With the changing reform agenda in early childhood education however, little is known about the way music is positioned in the kindergarten classrooms. Little is known if music is still considered an important foundation for children's learning. This study provides a snapshot of music activities in two kindergartens in Queensland, Australia. At each of the case sites, music plays an important role in helping the children learn. Findings reveal that music is seen as a foundation for many of the daily routines and an important element of inquiry based-learning in the classroom. The kindergarten teachers are essential in developing the domain-intrinsic knowledge of the children. Findings show the importance of the teacher in helping children learn music in the early years.",

Discussion includes staff perspectives, and covers the varying ways ePortfolio components are utilised in a range of subject areas, issues staff encounter in introducing ePortfolios into their subjects, methods to adapt existing assessment assignments into ePortfolio tasks, and ways in which the inclusion of ePortfolio work leads to changes in learning and teaching practices. Challenges of assessing in an ePortfolio environment are explored, and a map of ePortfolios in the final years of the degree program is discussed. The mapping process, whereby ePortfolio work is perceived as transitioning into the content of this degree program, is explained and demonstrated. The paper covers the design of the map that targets the sequential development of students' ePortfolio skills through subjects in the degree program. Mapping assessment tasks for any degree program is ongoing, and researchers in this case rely on student products and formal and informal feedback to continue designing assessment tasks in a meaningful way to engage eLearners in developing ePortfolios for use inside and outside this degree program. The process is not about creating more work for students and staff, or re-inventing existing curricula by removing and adding tasks. It is about evaluating existing assessment tasks in this degree program and modifying them to act viably in an information technology environment to reflect and advance student learning.

        "description":"In this thematic case study in a rural primary school, young children of diverse socio-cultural origins use transformative and transmodal redesign in music as they explore new conceptual meanings through self-reflexive interaction in classroom music events. A focus on music dialogue created by interaction between modes is seen to promote inclusiveness and transformation of learning. This praxial approach to music learning in the classroom context uncovers hidden dogma used to justify existing structures in the curriculum. In music education in Australia there is still a common failure to acknowledge that embodied and situated music making found in &quot;everyday life&quot; (De Nora, 2011) is linked to conceptual knowledge of music. In this study, investigating young children's selections of semiotic resources when redesigning meaning in a dialogue of modes enables educators to determine how conceptual knowledge of music is established, extended and expanded through children's developing understanding of the elements of music during redesign. The complexity of young children's use of music imagery and genre and their grasp of music concepts is evident in their interactions in classroom music events. Awareness of the space of music dialogue allows for a deeper insight in children's capacity for music invention. (Contains 2 figures and 3 transcripts.)",

Research has found that school teachers in Victoria struggle to provide the aspired to multicultural education for pupils, especially in the area of music education. An online survey was conducted to identify the reasons for this and to provide a snapshot of the current situation in Australian schools. This survey found that, as many teachers do not possess appropriate knowledge, resources and educational background, artists in residence are often invited to teach multicultural music in schools as an alternative strategy. The participant teachers identified the involvement of these culture/tradition bearers as the most authentic method to teach world music and their presence in schools as the most accessible resource and more engaging approach for students. This study explores how governmental regulations and policies, including curriculum frameworks that address multiculturalism and multicultural (music) education, effect current practices in Victorian schools. The voices of teachers at the &quot;chalk face&quot; are rarely heard in such discussion and this survey attempted to address this hiatus. (Contains 5 figures and 2 footnotes.)",

It is an educational tool that seeks to change our educational system from the traditional to the interactive (Sacchanand, 2008). This study will compare students' course achievement and attitudes toward music learning between two course delivery methods: blended and face-to-face (FTF). A pre-test/post-test control group experimental design model was used. Thus, participants were assigned to either experimental or control groups purposefully in order to achieve group equivalency. The study was conducted during the fall of the 2010-2011 academic year. The participants consisted of 179 university students who were taking a music course as a university elective course at Al-Quds University. The experimental group was taught with the blended mode of instruction, which involved using both FTF and online instruction. The control group was taught with FTF instruction alone. Prior knowledge about music was measured in both groups at the beginning of the study. Students' final course scores and attitude scores toward music learning were evaluated at the end of the study. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-tests. A statistically significant difference was found between the FTF and the blended group. The analysis showed that the blended group was more successful than the traditional FTF group in terms of both course achievement and attitudes toward music learning. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"This study documents and analyses the environment where music education happens in a regional Conservatorium in New South Wales, Australia. The study aimed to gain insight into the structure, nature and professional practice of a regional conservatorium, and identify innovative pedagogical possibilities. An ethnographic case study was undertaken over one year, with intensity ranging from weeklong immersion schedules to occasional short-term observation of activities. Schwab's (1969) commonplaces of schooling (milieu, subject matter, students and teachers) were applied as a priori themes, providing a scaffold for preliminary classification and exploration of the data. Empirical themes were identified as they emerged through data analysis, and subsequently applied. A dominant finding of the study is the areas of intersection between the commonplaces of schooling: the triangulation of expertise (teacher, performer and musician); a curriculum design that is student centred; mechanisms to enhance the sustainability of a regional Conservatorium; adaptation of pre-established curricula; students need to be prepared for a musical life beyond the Conservatorium; and parental involvement is central for success.",

        "description":"For pre-service music teachers it is important to develop a personal philosophy of music education before entering the teaching profession. Having a philosophy to music education enables students to clearly articulate the meaning of music not only in their own lives but also how this might impact on their practice as a teacher. Many philosophies and theories (Elliott, 1995; Reimer, 1970; Swanwick, 1999) as well as particular methods (see Dalcroze, Kodaly and Suzuki for example) have been developed concerning the approaches to the teaching and learning of music. This paper will draw on some of these explorations however its main focus will be on the work of Steve Dillon. It will preface the inquiry by asking Dillon's three framing questions: Where is music in my life? Where is music in the life of a child? and Where is music in the life of a school? (Dillon, 2007). Discourse around these questions will be inspired by Steve's work in schools, universities and music communities. It will also feature interview data with Steve as well as his research publications. We dedicate this paper to him in memory of his passion and commitment to music education generally, but overall compassion and keenness for music and life.",

        "description":"South Africa prides itself in a rich and colorful array of the Arts where music plays a significant role in social regeneration, unity and reconciliation. Little research has been undertaken in teacher education courses in South Africa regarding the inclusion of African music within multicultural music practice. Using the theoretical frameworks of understanding multiculturalism, I report on the teaching and learning of multicultural music at Pretoria University. My narrative highlights what I had learned and reports on the interview data with the tertiary music educator in October 2010. Using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, two themes are discussed: the need for multicultural music and the inclusion of students as indigenous culture bearers. Lessons learnt at Pretoria University can be replicated elsewhere in Australia where the sharing of ownership in multicultural music as a hands-on approach is viewed positively, promoting understanding and respect in a shared space and place.",

The ideas of expert flute educator Thomas Pinschof have been fundamental to this research, particularly those concerning the various elements of mature tone pedagogy that is acquired through a state of equilibrium and awareness in all physical and non-physical aspects of flute performance. Holistically, the entire process of tone production is a combination of different attributes that contribute to the ultimate goal in tone pedagogy--mastering the art of &quot;letting the tone happen&quot;.

        "description":"Anecdotal evidence suggests that many schools in rural areas, do not operate classroom music programs due to a shortage of qualified staff and with access to tertiary music education rapidly diminishing in regional Victoria, there is little indication that the situation will improve. This paper reports on a mixed methods research project that shows numbers and types of music programs operating in rural primary schools and universities, then how music teachers perceived their roles and undergraduate preparation for music teaching. The findings show that tertiary specialist music education has all but disappeared from regional Victoria. Principals are struggling to find staff to teach music in their schools and only a small percentage of responding music teachers were qualified specialists. Pre-service training in music is seen to be lacking in both quantity and quality and teachers are highly critical of the placement of music within the Arts Key Learning Area particularly when it comes to reporting. The article concludes that despite the arts' inclusion in the new &quot;Australian Curriculum&quot;, Victorian primary schools students will not have equality of access to music education until there is an increase in status/funding of music education and accordingly, in the number of music teachers being educated.

        "description":"This study explores the career paths, employment, business opportunities and community contributions made available through the provision and development of the contemporary performance bands' culture in the State of Victoria. It is framed with the support given to live music performers by Arts Victoria, Small Business Victoria and Music Victoria. Central to this study are two foci, first the identification of the issues and challenges of running a successful music business, which in turn leads to a contemporary performing musician being able to build a sustainable career. And second, companion employment and professional opportunities--not specifically aligned with the music industry--that also provide a variety of career paths, and enable the development of successful businesses, whilst supporting musicians' career development. Excellence in musical skills alone is not sufficient for a musician to achieve and sustain financial security from a career in the music industry. This study highlights the success of the government financial activity that supports the contemporary live performance bands' culture in Victoria. In 2009-2010 the live music industry contributed more than $AUD500 million to the Victorian economy. The Victorian Government has supported a suite of programs such as FReeZA, Contemporary Music and Live Development, &quot;Face the Music&quot; conference, a small business festival and targeted mentoring for musicians playing in bands and their businesses have all played a significant role. These programs have contributed to the development of sustainable practices for performing musicians.",

        "author":["James, Barbara"],
        "description":"Playing the piano can result in intense muscular activity with the potential to cause injury to the hand and fingers. It was reasoned some time ago that technique had to be made sustainable. This resulted in the exploration of ways to make muscular use more economic in playing because even small energy savings are worthwhile in making technique physiologically efficient. The substantial changes in the musical environment including keyboards led musical theorists of more than a century ago to respond with technical concepts applying mechanical and physiological principles to technique based on efficient muscle use. One solution was to use arm weight with the assistance of gravity, an ever-present force affecting our body movements, particularly downward vertical movements. Recent neuroscience research examined the effect on muscle activity by a process of lifting the hand and dropping it onto the keys and comparing with a downstroke generated at key level. Results showed that gravity could be used successfully, with enhanced efficiency of muscular use and a reduction in the finger-key force generated. Playing expressively with increased tempo or sound level intensified finger force, but increasing both simultaneously had a very more detrimental effect on force levels, particularly through increasing the sound level. It was also deleterious to movement organisation in these circumstances and could result in reduced performance time without fatigue. The outcomes of the studies are explained in terms of mechanical and functional principles. The implications of the findings include the need to apply the findings to teaching strategies for application to performance itself. Piano practice also needs careful consideration and the need for education in injury prevention so individuals know how to protect themselves. Pedagogy aimed at teaching children is another urgent area of attention. (Contains 2 figures and 3 footnotes.)",

They find three difficulties with teachers and students being friends. First, friendship requires a bias for the friend that is inappropriate to the teacher-student relationship. Second, the classroom requires one-way bureaucratic judgment that mere learning between friends does not, which necessarily involves an imbalance of power. Third, friendships require time and intimacy to form, which is rarely possible in the restricted setting of the educational system. Although teachers and students may rarely become friends in the larger flow of events, the teacher must normally suspend the possibility of friendship within the classroom relationship.

He will articulate caveats to this argument and hope that they will clarify his position and not render it timid or less interesting. First, the author wants to be clear about what he means by a post-institutional moment. He does not mean to suggest that there is no work in philosophy of education that is not explicitly tethered to institutions (read=schools). The journals in the field attest to that. Still, it seems the majority of scholarship in foundations of education and even specifically in philosophy of education is connected to the workings of schools in some way. He is suggesting a new \"focus\" is in order, not an altogether new kind of scholarship. His argument here is that philosophy of education might serve itself well to shift its focus from transformationism to postmodernism in the sense that educators are not likely to wrest modern schools from the grips of neoliberalism, yet they can pursue philosophical questions about the nature of knowledge and of the self \"after\" the heyday of modern institutions and other lines of inquiry that are related to education conceived in the broadest sense in order to contribute to important conversations at the end of modernity and its institutions.

        "author":["Bull, Barry L."],
        "description":"In light of the importance and the potential danger of education during childhood for politically liberal societies, the author has devoted much of his professional career to thinking about and formulating the moral principles that should govern such a society's educational institutions. However, this task cannot be accomplished for all such societies in the abstract because there are many different configurations of politically liberal societies. Therefore, the author has focused on developing moral principles for the United States and possibly for societies that share many similarities to this country. The starting place for such principles is the most frequent considerations that Americans think relevant to their schools--liberty, democracy, equal opportunity, and economic growth. From these considerations, the author has attempted in \"Social Justice in Education: An Introduction\" to articulate the overlapping consensus that seems consistent with this way of thinking about schooling. This overlapping consensus consists of four principles for the conduct of public schooling during childhood: (1) Personal Liberty; (2) Democracy; (3) Equality of Opportunity; and (4) Economic Growth. In this article, the author wants to indicate three important features of these principles. First, they do not depend on a complete theory of justice for all of America's institutions because, in his judgment, a comprehensive overlapping consensus does not currently exist in the United States. Second, among the institutions that are not addressed specifically by these principles are institutions of higher education. Third, however, these principles appropriately modified might provide at least a partial basis for an overlapping consensus about higher education in that the general issues with which they deal figure prominently in Americans' conceptions of the purposes of colleges and universities in addition to schools. The real focus of this essay, then, is to consider whether it is possible to begin formulating an overlapping consensus for higher education based in part on the overlapping consensus about schools and in part on the distinctive ways that Americans think about those institutions and on the distinctive functions that they have in Americans' lives.

        "author":["Kimball, Bruce A."],
        "description":"The author wishes to thank Barry Bull for his excellent and stimulating paper, and he would like to pose five questions or points for his consideration in response. In preface to his first question, the author wants to say that he finds cogent and persuasive the discussion in the section \"Issues for Political Liberalism in Higher Education\" of reasons for a politically liberal society to take responsibility for higher education. He suggests that all of these \"reasons\" have to do with the \"instrumental value,\" as Professor Bull says at one point, of education for politically liberal society. In other words, all these \"reasons\" explain ways in which education fosters political liberalism and prepares citizens for political liberalism. He makes this point because the term \"reasons\" and other wording in these pages and in the opening paragraphs of the section on \"Political Liberalism and Children's Education\" suggest that education, in its nature, is especially suited or important to politically liberal society. However, to make that argument would require a large discussion about the nature of education. The author's second question concerns the relationship between Rawls's views of justice as fairness and the politically liberal society. His third question concerns the relationship between empirical and normative claims in the essay, as well as the relationship between American society and political liberalism. His fourth question concerns what might be called the conceptual status of the four points that are presented in the essay and the accompanying table. His fifth and final question concerns the balance between personal and social considerations in formulating principles and policies that are politically liberal. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"In his presidential address, which is included in this collection of papers, Kip Kline suggests that the time has arrived to redirect the work of philosophy of education away from the path of critical theory, and thus to depart from what he described as the discourse of \"parrhesia.\" The author takes Kline's critique of critical philosophy of education to accurately indicate a failure amongst those who have taken up the tradition of \"parrhesia\" to take up the risk-taking venture of \"parrhesia,\" i.e., to speak freely and fearlessly, or as Nietzsche exhorted, \"to live dangerously!\" And thus the author proposes that the time has arrived for \"parrhesia\" to be enacted as a practice of politics in the discursive field of philosophy of education through disruptive forms of writing that interrupt the conventional arrangement of communication within the arenas, or public realms, where the field is rooted and propagates itself. The piece that appears in this paper is part of the ongoing effort to take up an original philosophy of education, here and now, through revelatory forms of writing that might best be described by what Walter Benjamin calls \"collection\": \"The true, greatly misunderstood passion of the collector is always anarchistic, destructive. For this is its dialectics: to combine with loyalty to an object, to individual items, to things sheltered in his care, a stubborn subversive protest against the typical, the classifiable.\" What is offered here is philosophy of education as \"parrhesia\": thought arranged freely, and outside the current convention of writing philosophy. It is \"destructive,\" in the sense that it is a momentary interruption and redistribution of the discursive field. And, at the same time, it does not seek to act under an over-arching principle, nor to re-establish, nor reform the field. Hence, it is an-archic. (Contains 24 footnotes.)",

        "author":["Rocha, Samuel D."],
        "description":"John Dewey provided philosophical accounts on an enormity of issues and ideas within the corpus of his work. Given his incredible productivity, it is especially difficult to locate any singular focus without almost immediately falling into oversimplification. There is, however, a concern that reoccurs with reliable frequency in his work. Dewey's commitment to democracy is, perhaps, the hallmark of his academic project that expresses, albeit implicitly at times, the spirit of his work. This is not an original claim, to be sure. Nonetheless, while many have considered the social, political, educational, and pragmatic elements of Dewey's commitment to democracy, there has yet to be extended reflection upon whether Dewey's democratic commitment opens the gates--even the floodgates--to the realm of philosophy. Therefore, the author's interest is to explore the potential within a Deweyan democratic vision for sketching, and expanding, some ideas on philosophical identity. At the core of this investigation is the foundational question: Who \"is\" a philosopher? That is, who exactly can \"legitimately\" claim to philosophize? These questions should be of particular interest within education, as philosophers of education insist on the need for philosophy in (professional) education, yet, at the same time, they seem hesitant to entertain the idea that, perhaps, schoolteachers are philosophers. In other words, while they generally agree that philosophy is essential for schoolteachers, there seems to be much less consensus among philosophers of education on whether schoolteachers are philosophers.

        "author":["Peckover, Christopher"],
        "description":"Jean-Jacques Rousseau believed that Nature is master. Children acknowledge this truth perhaps better than most adults. Nature gives life to humanity and provides humans with the tools necessary to survive. Even as an infant, Nature urges the child to scream for nourishment. As children, humans trust their master. The idea of resisting their human nature does not exist. Although it is not natural for humans to remain children, it is also not natural for humans to resist Nature. But as the child matures into adulthood, social conditions deceive humans into thinking control is in the hands of humanity. The urge to heed Nature's call and fulfill one's self with natural sustenance is suppressed and replaced with the illusion of control. It is this attempt by humans to feed on the unnatural sustenance of control that leaves them starving for something more. For humans to satiate their hunger pangs, they must heed the call of Nature. Humans must be allowed to connect with the nature of their being. Modern society disrupts this connection through formal education. In the United States, formal education has been standardized. Education in the United States is not about connecting with the nature of one's being, but about the attempt to control the future by manipulating both one's natural urges and the natural environment to ensure individual economic gain. For a single human being, this illusion of control rests on the manipulation of one's actions. For a society of human beings, controlling the future requires all members to act in a predictable pattern in a predictable environment. Rousseau argues that a proper education is one that does not include constructs created by humans for the purpose of controlling other humans. A proper education is one that allows Nature to teach humans according to their nature. (Contains 40 footnotes.)",

While contemporary textbooks increasingly depict the experiences of historically marginalized groups such as women, African Americans, Latinos, American Indians, and the poor, they continue to incorporate these groups through the restrictive practice of mentioning, which limits possible resistant teachings and/or readings of American history. In addition to discussing the limiting function of incorporation, the author also argues that textbooks abject knowledge deemed unfit for the curricular body of official knowledge and the selective tradition of American history. The psychoanalytic theory of abjection is the other side of incorporation and the contribution this essay makes to existent scholarship on official knowledge and textbooks. (Contains 33 footnotes.)",

        "title":"The Lippmann-Dewey \"Debate\" Revisited: The Problem of Knowledge and the Role of Experts in Modern Democratic Theory",
        "author":["DeCesare, Tony"],
        "description":"With only some fear of oversimplification, the fundamental differences between Walter Lippmann and John Dewey that are of concern here can be introduced by giving attention to Lippmann's deceptively simple formulation of a central problem in democratic theory: \"The environment is complex. Man's political capacity is simple. Can a bridge be built between them?\" Or, borrowing Dewey's formulation of the same problem, one might ask \"how the gap between the limited capacities of the citizen and the complexity of his environment [is] to be bridged.\" That such a gap existed was a point of agreement between Dewey and Lippmann. Both understood the difficulties that would result from a relatively uninformed and incompetent citizenry governing popularly in the complex modern age of political affairs. Where the two men had a fundamental disagreement was not so much in their diagnoses or critiques of the problems in modern democracy as in the constructive and prescriptive aspects of their respective democratic theories. This essay focuses on the \"problem of knowledge\" as understood by Lippmann and Dewey and on the different roles that each subsequently gives to the \"expert\" in the constructive aspects of their respective democratic theories. The author argues that the heart of Lippmann's and Dewey's disagreement over the role of the expert vis-a-vis the public in a democracy are fundamental differences of thought concerning (1) the kind and degree of knowledge and competence required of citizens in a popularly governed polity and, related, (2) the potential of the average citizen to acquire and exercise such knowledge and competence in political affairs and practical life in general.

        "author":["Currie-Knight, Kevin"],
        "description":"American public education has become increasingly centralized over the last hundred and fifty years. Everything from curricular objectives and assessment tools to teacher certification criteria (and, often, textbook decisions) are being made at the state level rather than the county, district, or school level. Increasingly, teachers are told what they must teach, what \"best practices\" they need to employ, what tests they must give, etc. This paper brings the arguments of economist Friedrich A. Hayek to bear on the problem of centralized decision making in education. Hayek marshaled several arguments against central planning of economies that the author will argue should be applied to similar trends in the field of education. Namely, Hayek argued that there was a \"knowledge problem\" in society, whereby knowledge is naturally dispersed throughout society in such a way that attempts to concentrate it into a single planner or planning board are, at best, inefficient and, at worst, impossible. Just as with economies, attempting to centralize the governance of educational institutions necessarily overlooks the essential role of local and personal knowledge (teachers reacting to the particularities of their student demographic, schools revising their practices in response to local conditions, and so forth) in educational endeavors.

        "author":["Hurley, Angela"],
        "description":"Numerous popular figures currently espouse the importance of spirituality. Some prominent voices, such as Deepak Chopra, Marianne Williamson, and Eckhart Tolle, advocate a more spiritual existence, warning that the earth and humanity are engaged in a seismic change. The shift of spiritual leaders from fringe to fairly mainline attention is intriguing and perhaps represents a reevaluation of the separation constructed during modernity that relegated the religious, spiritual, and the emotive to an inferior status--that is, as being subjective and the stuff of non-intellectuals. Andrew Harvey, an Oxford-educated academic, provides somewhat of a bridge between the popular culture and academia in spiritual matters. Advocating for spirituality that will lead to sacred activism, Harvey proposes not just connecting with, but embodying, the often-identified major elements of spirituality: compassion and love. Much like Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, Harvey stresses the importance of living the divine Love. Harvey's philosophy is raising important problems and giving a solution that has historically been a part of many world religions and of selected philosophic thought. However, because of the ways in which religion has been conceptualized, especially during modernity, Harvey's definitions of the spiritual and the sacred seem a bit odd and inappropriate, especially for academic settings. But that is the problem that the author is attempting to raise in this essay: people are out of practice in being able to talk about the sacred, or the spiritual, and that may be a reason why many individuals report a state of imbalance in their lives, institutions, and in the general culture. Therefore, after examining the effects of the separation of faith and reason during modernity, the author will note the possible benefits of encouraging the inclusion of spirituality in the learning experiences of individuals, giving examples from the work of recent advocates.

As a philosophical approach to human reality, phenomenology contributes insight into the connection between the experiential grounding of collective memory and the reality of the social world. The inspiration for exploring these connections is related to the author's ongoing ethnographic fieldwork in Colombia, South America, which began in 2007 and continues to the present. As part of this research, the author has had extended visits to Afrodescendent rainforest peasant river communities in the Cacarica, Jiguaminando, and Curvarado river basin areas of the Atrato River on the northwestern region of Pacific coast, near the Colombia-Panama border. In 1997, the paramilitaries and government forces violently displaced these communities. Since the time of their forced removal, members of these communities, in an act of civil resistance, have returned and reclaimed their collectively titled ancestral territories now encompassed in the war zone. They have returned to their territories, declaring their land as humanitarian zones that are accompanied and protected by the &quot;Comision Intereclesial de Justicia y Paz,&quot; the &quot;Inter-American Court of Human Rights&quot; (IACHR), and the &quot;United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights&quot; (UNHCHR).

        "title":"Democratic Visions/Pluralist Critiques: One Essential Conversation for 21st-Century Philosophy of Education",
        "author":["Narey, Daniel C."],
        "description":"Democracy is often theorized as a form of political association grounded in shared meanings, common experiences, and convergent interests among the associated individuals. Because differences and divergences seem to stand in the way of commonality and consensus, the coexistence of a plurality of meanings, experiences, interests, languages, discourse communities, etc., is often seen as an obstacle to democratic progress. Against the grain of mainstream political thought, Sharon Todd has argued that the aims of democratic education would be better served if one were to start from a view of political life grounded in an \"ontology of plurality\"--a philosophical standpoint from which divergence and conflict are seen as manifestations of human uniqueness, not simply as failures of communication or understanding. Todd's work draws heavily upon the Continental tradition of political thought, particularly engaging with the writings of poststructuralist and postphenomenological philosophers. In this paper, the author attempts to provoke some productive discord by reading Todd against the background of pragmatist political thought, for which Dewey's vision of democracy-as-community remains the central figure. He then borrows from Colin Koopman's contemporary reinterpretation of the pragmatist tradition to offer a version of political pragmatism that is consonant with Todd's radical pluralism. His primary argument is that pluralist critiques--critiques in the name of \"difference\"--are essential to the vitality of democracy. The corollary to this argument is that democracy is emptied of vitality when it becomes merely a vision of communication without conflict, participation without dissent, community without strife--in other words, an abstract ideal with no referent among present or historical forms of political life.

        "description":"In the first half of the twentieth century, the ideal of democracy influenced the conceptions people had of the academic subject matters. A common criticism was that abstract academic subjects served aristocratic societies. Although most theorists considered the academic subjects to be important, they had differing views on the conception of democracy, the nature of the academic subjects, and the ways those studies served democracy. For example, John Dewey and William Bagley argued that knowledge of the academic subjects could enlarge the experiences of students, but they offered contrasting interpretations as to the ways this happened. Boyd Bode drew many of his ideas from both of these theorists; however, he combined their views in ways that corrected some of the problems he found in each of their views. The author points out that the task of education was for people to realize the problems. Teachers could not impose a view on students because indoctrination contradicted the democratic spirit. The best that teachers could do was to help the students reconstruct experiences for themselves. Given this opportunity, the students would choose democracy. At least, this was the faith that Bode believed was essential to fulfill the promise that education and democracy offered. (Contains 29 footnotes.)",

The participants of the study, selected through maximum variety method within purposive sampling, included 210 students enrolled on face-to-face and distance education programs of computer programming department. In addition to a personal data form aiming to obtain information on demographic features of the participants, a personality inventory and an Internet addiction scale were utilized to gather data. As an analysis model concurrently exerting both the mediation and direct effects, path analysis with observed variables was utilized in the current study to test the developed model. The findings revealed that while the most powerful predictor variable of internet addiction was conscientiousness, openness to experience was found as the weakest independent variable predictor. Additionally the developed model was observed as valid for both face to face and distance education students. (Contains 6 tables and 2 figures.)",

As a craft has been taught in conventional approach, the students and experts have been facing several problems especially when expert needs to teach a group of students. An appropriate mapping of craft education and Information and Communication Technologies using Multimedia technology for instance, has the potential in transforming traditional craft learning into more flexible environment. This paper reports on a research project on development of an interactive multimedia courseware package for teaching and learning traditional craft called e-CRAFT. The e-CRAFT is specially designed for songket weaving course taught to certificate and diploma students from Fakulti Seni Kraf Tenunan in their first year study at Institut Kraf Negara, Malaysia (National Craft Institute). The courseware was developed in a web-based environment and overall development process was based on the Dick and Carey's process model and conceptual Instructional Design framework. It is made up of eight learning modules: Introduction, Materials &amp; Tools, Knowing Motifs, Learn How to Weave, Quizzes &amp; Test, Online Discussion, Glossary and Help module. In order to test whether the courseware is suitable in terms of usability, pilot testing was done to a sample of 10 students. The results from pilot test received positive feedback which signifies the courseware is considered acceptable for effectiveness study and help for further improve of the e-CRAFT courseware.

This study has investigated the initial perceptions of Greek teachers about the integration of LAMS, a Learning Activity Management System, in the educational praxis. Through a multifaceted research method, involving a small scale participatory action research, the research team attempted to investigate the preconditions required to integrate LAMS in the everyday lesson. Two tutorial workshops were organized with the participation of 46 educators from geographically diverse urban areas, from K-12 to Tertiary Education. Results indicated that teachers have developed a positive attitude towards LAMS and the use of collaborative online tools during the educational process. Although teachers have certain objections on integrating LMSs, which stem mainly from the current status of the Greek educational system, they accept relative advantages of integrating online collaborative approaches over the traditional face-to-face approach. Well-organized and carefully implemented tutorial workshops can spark teachers' interest and bring about change in the educational process. Small scale interventions such as these can prove to foster dialogue among teachers of various backgrounds and set the foundations to create online communities of practice for innovative teachers.

During the process of developing a learning technology integration framework for the School of Continuing Teacher Education at North-West University, South Africa, an initial exploratory survey identified issues and themes for systemic inquiry, in order to provide substance to the integration framework. The purposive sample related to a criterion-based selection of N=338 teacher-students attending supplementary computer literacy training sessions. Queues from the Technology Acceptance Model supplemented the questions intended to investigate enablers and barriers to learning technology adoption. The pragmatic approach was towards discovering which possible interventions could be introduced to enable adoption of technology in interaction and learning. Descriptive statistics and structural equation modelling produce a suggested parsimonious model relating to self-confidence, trust and perseverance in acquiring computer literacy.

        "description":"An area that has recently attracted increasing attention is providing feedback on learners' writing accuracy through the Internet. However, research in this area has largely focused on synchronous communication, i.e., chatting, with fewer studies assessing asynchronous technologies, i.e., e-mailing. Therefore, this study investigates the effectiveness of asynchronous computer-mediated corrective feedback-explicit and implicit, on increasing the correct use of prepositions. Forty-five Iranian elementary EFL learners at the ILI in Tehran were randomly assigned to two experimental groups, receiving explicit and implicit corrective feedback respectively, and one control group receiving no corrective feedback. Each group included 15 participants. After the treatment, a post-test was administered to assess the probable increase in the correct use of prepositions for the experimental groups compared to the control group. Analysis of the results through a one-way ANOVA revealed that the experimental group 1 who received explicit corrective feedback significantly outperformed the experimental group 2 and the control group. The experimental group 2 who received implicit corrective feedback showed no significant improvement over the experimental group 1 and the control group. Although the findings support the current view on feedback through technology, due to the scarcity of research, more investigation is merited as there is much to gain regarding this burgeoning field.

Seventeen managed to participate willingly by filling in the in-depth questionnaire. The study cited lack of literature as one of its limitations. Data were gathered and analyzed thematically. The study found out lack of training and expertise in ICT by ZOU Academic staff of the studied Faculties topping among ICT implementation challenges. The study concluded that training and development of personnel is a fundamental concept that keeps staff abreast with evolving technological changes. The study recommended the need for ZOU to mount regular academic staff focused training workshops that equip them with functional knowledge on computers and computer software applications. It also recommended the need for ZOU to carry out Faculty wide research in the same area using either quantitative or triangulation methodologies. (Contains 6 tables.)",

As the online dimension of the blended learning model, Moodle, a Learning Management System (LMS), was used. The application lasted 10 weeks. The scale of learners' views on blended learning was applied and interviews were held to determine the views. As a result of the analysis of the scale, it was seen that their views were &quot;highly&quot; positive. The interviews held with the students revealed that the blended learning model provided students with various opportunities such as getting prepared for the lessons, reviewing the lessons as many times as wanted, reaching the subject-related materials without being dependent on time and place, testing oneself and communicating with the teacher and other students out of the school. The interviews also revealed that there were various problems though such as lack of Internet connection at home and problems experienced while playing the videos. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Today, teaching and learning are made easy through the use of computer technologies and/or the electronic and other multi-media elements. It is widely accepted that electronic learning naturally leads to electronic assessments or examinations. e-assessments and e-examinations are widely used all over the world in the Open and Distance Learning institutions and some conventional face to face institutions. We are thus, moving from the pen and paper assessments to a paperless e-platform and e-assessments, which are necessary constants in the Open and Distance Learning (ODL) system. e-assessments tend to eliminate the limitations and give answers to many questions emanating from the traditional assessments/examinations. Higher institutions in Nigeria are therefore advised to embrace it.

        "description":"The present study, aimed at revealing the views of elementary school gifted students about the roles and behaviors of their teachers in class as well as about the in-class roles and behaviors that they expect from an ideal teacher with respect to different variables. Another question in the study was directed to determine students' views about learning academic subjects via e-learning applications instead of at teachers. The participants of the study were 46 gifted students identified with the diagnosis system of &quot;Education program for the gifted&quot; executed in the Department of Gifted Education at the Education Faculty of Anadolu University. The research data were collected via a five-point Likert-type scale developed and tested by the researcher for its validity and reliability. For the analysis of the research data, paired sample t-test, one of descriptive parametrical statistical techniques, was applied. The findings obtained in the study revealed that according to gifted students, the in-class behaviors demonstrated by the course teachers were mostly those related to their roles of guidance for students. The behaviors of the course teachers within the scope of this role were followed by those related to providing information and maintaining the discipline, respectively. The behaviors least demonstrated by the teachers were those related to the role of supporting the students and those related to being a model for them. According to the students, an ideal teacher should at most demonstrate behaviors in class regarding the role of guiding the students and those regarding the role of providing information. According to the gifted students, the roles and behaviors of their teachers in class are quite different from the behaviors expected from an ideal teacher. Students do not regard e-learning applications as an alternative to learning from teachers. Rather, they prefer learning from their teachers to technology-aided learning environments. According to students, compared to structure academic learning, technology is a better environment to make good use of their time, to satisfy their curiosity about certain subjects, to establish communication with others and to play games.

        "description":"Although the use of physical manipulatives, which have been emphasized to use in preschool education program and primary and secondary mathematics curriculum, in classroom environments is old, it is very new to use virtual manipulatives in classroom environments. The selection, preparation, and the integration to learning environments of both types of manipulatives are the most basic duties of teachers. However, the experiences, of using the physical and virtual manipulatives in course environments, of teachers and pre-service teachers are influenced by beliefs about the nature, teaching and learning of mathematics. The aim of this study is to determine and compare the beliefs of teachers and pre-service teachers in different branches for the use of virtual and physical manipulatives in mathematics education. For this purpose, 148 teachers, in the provinces of Trabzon, Kars and Gumushane, and 228 pre-service teachers, in the Education Faculties of Karadeniz Technical University and Kafkas University, have been applied two types of scales and interviews have been conducted with 40 teachers and pre-service teachers selected from that sample. Frequencies, percentages and arithmetic averages have been used to analyze the data. As a result, the majority of teachers and pre-service teachers have been identified to carry positive beliefs for the use of virtual and physical manipulatives in mathematics education and they have expressed that they desire to use both types of manipulatives more in the future.

The research design is a kind of one group pretest posttest. Participants were 33 first-year students who studied EN 011 course (English in Action) in the first semester of the academic year 2012 at Bangkok University. They were divided into six groups. Five or six students in each group created a blog; www.blogger.com, and they worked together for fourteen weeks to produce six pieces of summary written work. Each member in the group worked through providing comments, editing and revising on the blog until the group got a final summary paper and submitted that to the teacher for grading. The instruments used in this study were (1) two summary writing tests (2) a questionnaire surveying students' attitude toward learning through blogs, and (3) postings on blogs to reflect their learning experience. The results revealed that after the students worked together on weblogs, their English summary writing mean score of the posttest was higher than that of the pretest, and they had positive attitudes towards using weblogs in learning. Regarding cooperative learning experiences through using weblogs, most students thought that it was interesting, a new experience to work with their friends on the weblogs. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Web-based education is facing a paradigm shift under the rapid development of information and communication technology. The new paradigm of learning requires special techniques of course design, special instructional models, and special methods of evaluation. This paper investigates the effectiveness of an adaptive instructional strategy for teaching and learning through the Web and blended learning environments. The central theme of this strategy is that instructional strategies give instructors and students a conceptual as well as a practical mode of delivery from which to teach and learn. Considering and applying new instructional strategy can help instructors to understand the uses of pedagogical content knowledge, as well as to reflect the role of technological content knowledge that can be adapted and/or adopted in teaching in all educational levels and environments. The main objective of this paper was to develop a holonomic instructional strategy for Web-based and blended learning. This strategy is guided by the non-linear and interactive features of learning environments. The strategy is consisted of four dimensions: designing, developing, delving and distributing. In this new instructional strategy, learning is holonomic and adaptive. Learning occurs in an open learning environment, in which instructors are designing a shared vision, developing a sharable e-learning task, delving students' learning through scaffolding and salvaging students' knowledge. The expected outcome of this instructional strategy is that each learner will develop a cognitive schema to be used to organize and construct knowledge and meaning in similar context of learning which may increase the generalizability, trustworthiness and transferability of learning. The results of applying this new strategy showed that this strategy is effective on developing both achievement and deep learning levels among a sample of graduate students.

        "description":"It is imperative for countries to provide quality education that would empower their people to compete and benefit from the growing socio-cultural global exchanges of the 21[superscript st] century. The Internet is expanding the global village, thereby, enhancing communication, collaboration and the cooperation of peoples with each other across the world. As a result, cross-border education is growing worldwide and creating greater access to education in developing countries including Nigeria. Therefore, the concerns of a potential online student among others should include the state of ICT infrastructure, student's computer skills, financial implications, and socio-cultural issues in distance education among others. This article is a narrative of the lived experience of a Nigerian student who has undertaken cross-border distance education in a wired world-an age of the Internet.",

        "author":["Ulvydiene, Loreta"],
        "description":"Since May of 1999, 46 European countries have been engaged in reconstructing their higher education systems to bring about a greater degree of &quot;convergence,&quot; i.e. a move toward common reference points and operating procedures to create a European Higher Education Area. Education has always played an important role in the development of Lithuania, with long and strong traditions as a country with highly educated scientists and cutting-edge research in various fields. In April 2009, the Seimas passed a new Law on Science and Studies, which provides for a major reform of higher education. In recent years there has been an increasing focus on the role universities play in the economy and impact they make in promoting innovation and raising international competitiveness. But until recently there has been a prescriptive view of university-business interactions with a narrow focus on technology transfer. Although technology transfer may be important, it is also necessary to focus on the more diverse and varied impacts of business-university knowledge exchange relations. Thus, I discuss changes in higher education that were implemented in Lithuania during the period of 1992-2012, i. e. Student baskets, notorious optimization of university network in Lithuania, the development of Lithuanian science valleys, etc. In my survey I rely upon an IHEP (Institute for Higher Education Policy) expert Cliff Adelman's idea that the Bologna Process is an analogue to the macroeconomic theory of convergence, the ways in which nations move from different stages of development to a more-or-less common platform of performance. Macroeconomic historians have demonstrated time-and-again: nations that learn from other nations grow; those that do not learn do not. Ultimately, I arrive at a conclusion that reforms are essential and indispensable but answer the purpose only when higher quality in education is achieved. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)",

In the study, affects of the students' gender and computer experience on their attitudes were also examined. A total of 626 subjects participated in the study and &quot;Online Communication Attitude Scale&quot;, developed by Ledbetter, was adapted as the data collection instrument. Mean, standard deviation, independent t-test, one-way analysis of variance and Tukey HSD tests were used to analyze the data gathered. The results of the study indicated that students have in general positive attitudes toward online communication in ODL. Also, it showed that there is a significant difference in &quot;miscommunication&quot;, &quot;social connection&quot; and &quot;ease&quot; dimensions of online communication between the males and the female students. The female students see online environments as open to communication errors. On the other hand, the study supported the literature about the affect of the students' computer experience and their attitudes toward online communication in ODL. (Contains 3 tables.)",

The expectation for quality has promoted broad range of products and systems, including in education. These factors include the increased diversity in the student body, which requires greater emphasis that allows a simple and dynamic model in the provision of education. For this reason, a formalized methodology known as systems theory is often applied in the industry as a management instrument, or in other words, known as systems management. The management of educational systems would be adherent to ally in reducing failure rates and quality improvement. This is possible in complex learning systems scale.

Gagne's Theory of Instruction was utilized during this research. Knowledge of the efficient use of the blackboard and the efficient viewing on the television screen is required. The results of the research show that the frequency of use of blackboards in the Open Classroom is low. It has been determined that information that could be written on the board is instead spoken by the television teacher. The 3-8 seconds of silence required for thought while writing on the blackboard is to a large extent achieved. The information written on the blackboard was found to be partially legible. This shows that the blackboard is not being efficiently utilized during teaching. When it comes to whether off-topic writing on the board is the cause of a distraction, it was found that a distraction was caused even though the information on the board was not used. When the board was erased to continue with another subject, it was found that the board was generally not erased entirely. The legibility of the writing written over the partially erased board was found to be insufficient and therefore showed that the blackboard was not being used efficiently. (Contains 7 figures.)",

        "description":"Educational systems worldwide are being challenged to respond effectively to the digital revolution and its implications for learning in the 21st century. In the present new media age, educational reforms are desperately needed to support more open and flexible structures of on-demand learning that equip students with competencies required in a globalized and multicultural world. Game-based learning represents one pathway to educational reform through its emphasis on performance. In this paper we describe the Statecraft X game-based learning program that blends performative game-based learning with dialogic pedagogy in the context of citizenship education. The Statecraft X curriculum was designed with the understanding that a digital game on its own does not necessarily lead to meaningful student learning. Rather, it is the students together with their peers and aided by their teacher who must work together to make meaning of their in-game experiences and connect these experiences to real-world events and issues through thoughtful reflection. With a view to addressing widespread shortcomings of citizenship education that reduce the curriculum to learning &quot;about&quot; citizenship, the Statecraft X game, played on Apple iPhones, provides students with a first person experience of governance by allowing them to take on the role of governors and thus to enact governance. Central to the SCX program is its dialogic pedagogy where teachers facilitate meaningful conversations among students and advance their understanding of citizenship and governance. In this paper, we report an implementation of the Statecraft X curriculum in a Social Studies class attended by 42 15-year-olds attending a secondary school in Singapore. Students' understanding of governance and citizenship was assessed by means of an essay that students attempted at the end of the program. Students' performance in the essay was compared with a comparable control group taught the same topic by traditional method. The results indicate that students of the intervention \nclass outperformed the control class students. Our findings suggest that the Statecraft X curriculum has efficacy in achieving the desired curricular learning outcomes. These findings have implications for school leaders, \nteachers, and students with respect to introducing and integrating game-based learning in regular classrooms.

        "description":"The emergence of social media has forced educators to think differently about the way learning occurs. Students and practitioners alike are using new technologies to connect with peers/colleagues, share ideas, resources and experiences for extracurricular activities. The social business gaming platform considered in this study leverages the social networking concept (an activity that all students actively participate in) in an academic environment. The primary objective of this technology is to foster a sense of &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; and analytical ability through a medium that is widely accepted by students and graduates who have entered the workplace. Both the environment and problems are developed to adapt to suit any academic course from conducting research to proposing business solutions. This study was undertaken in order to develop information systems security (ISS) skillsets through the creation and facilitation of social business gaming, which allowed students to measure their performances of understanding as part of their on-going learning. The online business game required students to apply what they have learned to problem situations and to further develop their understanding of ISS topics. The problems posed required that the learners had to prove that they understood the material being taught in the traditional lecture and could apply what they had learned in an online environment. The on-going assessment component of the gaming network was used not just as an assessment for grades but also as a learning tool. This research focuses on a group of final year undergraduate students completing Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (IS). The online social game was utilised as part of the continual assessment process to evaluate group interaction, role-playing, competition and learning in an ISS assignment.

        "description":"During the last decade there has been a growing focus on preschool learning within education, especially with regard to the learning of basic literacies such as reading and writing. In addition to this many nation states increasingly focus on the basic literacy competences of the information society, ICT and English. This has, as suggested by for instance Scanlon and Buckingham (2007) boosted opportunities for the sale of educational material and hardware to children for home learning, but also for learning material that links content directly to the curriculum, to school work and to assessment. This paper will focus on the design of learning material for pre-school teaching and learning through the example of a game-based platform for learning English called Mingoville.com. Mingoville has been studied in connection with the project Serious Games on a Global Market Place (2007-11), where a number of games were followed into classroom environments across nations. Currently, the developers of Mingoville are working on a platform version that targets preschool learners and works on tablets as well as pcs and smartboards. The paper will discuss the implications of redesigning the platform for pre-school teaching and learning and how this affects game-based language teaching and learning with Mingoville.

        "description":"For a child to learn through Problem-Solving in Serious games, the game scaffolding mechanism has to be effective. Scaffolding is based on the Vygotzkian Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) concept which refers to the distance between the actual development level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers. Scaffolds in serious games are learning stimulators. The effectiveness of these learning stimulators lies in the way they are managed or regulated. Scaffolds that are not regulated could lead to expertise-reversal effect or redundancy effect which inhibits learning. In the current classroom application of serious games, the game-based learning stimulators remain the same for everyone (&quot;blanket scaffolding&quot;)--the learning stimulators are not managed or regulated. In order to make scaffolding in serious games more effective for classroom use, the calibration of the game&apos;s learning stimulators has to be enabled--this would help in meeting the changing needs of the learners. The concept of fading which is critical to scaffolding is introduced to serious games, to facilitate the fine-tuning of the learning stimulators to the changing needs of the learners. This paper seeks to address the issues in the design and implementation of a Fine-Tuning System for serious games based on the fading concept. Also discussed in this paper are the factors to be considered in the implementation of the Fine-Tuning System in serious games. These include fading decisions; fading and learning rates; optimal scaffolding distance; classroom culture and collaborative learning. The adverse effects of neglecting fading such as expertise-reversal effect and redundancy effect are also discussed. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)",

However, this approach is impeded by the limited availability of suitable &quot;serious&quot; games and high-level design tools to enable domain experts to develop or customise serious games. Model Driven Engineering (MDE) goes some way to provide the techniques required to generate a wide variety of interoperable serious games software solutions whilst encapsulating and shielding the technicality of the full software development process. In this paper, we present our Game Technology Model (GTM) which models serious game software in a manner independent of any hardware or operating platform specifications for use in our Model Driven Serious Game Development Framework.

        "description":"This study explores the acceptance of online learning (OL) for continuous professional development among lecturers at Kenya Medical Training College in 2009. The large and multi-campus College faces logistical and cost challenges in ensuring that its 700 lecturing staff have access to continuous professional development. Online learning potentially provides an effective and efficient solution to this problem. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of the lecturers to assess the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of online learning, taking into account lecturers' experiences. Two focus group discussions were also held to assess the lecturers' views on issues relating to OL. We find that there is a high level of acceptability of the idea of undertaking further training using OL as user attitudes towards web-based training were positive. The benefits of OL over face-to-face learning for clinical training and the accreditation of OL courses are issues of ongoing concern to lecturers. Successful and large scale adoption of OL course requires promotion of their benefits in addition to clarification of the accreditation of the available courses. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"This paper reports on research that took place at Nottingham Trent University (NTU) and Sheffield Hallam University (SHU), United Kingdom, over two years. The project formed the basis of an iterative, interpretive, action research study focussing on a particular set of participants--trainee teachers. The insights gained from the initial cycle fed into planning the second cycle, for which the action plan was modified and the research process repeated (Zuber-Skerritt 1992). The research project focuses on the use of Web 2.0 technology, specifically web logs, (or blogs) with trainee \nteachers, both during their university programme and during the first year of teaching as full-time newly qualified teachers. The purpose of this research was to add to a developing body of knowledge identifying whether technology used by trainee teachers during their training course can be cascaded into their practice once qualified. Participants from the two \ncollaborating universities were introduced to blogs and blogging during their time at university, and encouraged to use it for themselves, and to also think about how it could be used in their own classrooms when they were teaching. Questionnaires were used to ascertain their thoughts on the use of blogs during training, and these were followed up with interviews with a number of the trainees to determine the cascading of this technology, once they had become newly qualified teachers (NQTs) and were teaching in schools. These interviews explored the reasons for enabling or inhibiting \nthe use of blogs in their teaching in school. This paper presents the findings of the research and discusses the enablers and inhibitors that were identified in the light of current research findings. The research supports the view that developing innovative use of technology in the classroom is complex and experiences during training are not always transferred into \npractice.

        "author":["Xanthou, Maria"],
        "description":"The scope of this paper is to present the development of a web-based evaluation system that adjusts to the level of knowledge of each student. The underlying concept is to split the questions into pools (bins) of distinct difficulty at the same time assigning a different level of accuracy to each possible answer that the student may select. Given the weighted success score computed at each round, the system raises or lowers the level of the questions asked in the following round, thus adjusting the difficulty of the test according to the students' performance. Once the score of the student improves or declines, the system again adjusts the difficulty of the questions accordingly until convergence is achieved and the students' performance becomes stable. It is believed that the proposed evaluation system predicts the level of knowledge of the students in more correct ways compared with the traditional (non-adaptive) questionnaires, while giving the students the motivation to rerun the test until they become familiar with the course content. To illustrate the evaluation methodology proposed, an online system was developed and implemented for the evaluation of sixty-eight undergraduates attending a Greek Lyric Poetry course at the Department of Classics in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. The results of the evaluation process, with the observations made, both about the operation of the system in real conditions and the performance of the students, are also discussed in the paper.

        "description":"This article outlines the first cycle of an Action Research (AR) investigation into why professional learners are not using the Social Networking Technologies (SNTs) of their bespoke website. It presents the rationale of how this study came about, the ontological and epistemological stance of the authors and how this led to the particular choice of contextual based AR enquiry. This article includes reference to some of the most salient literature on AR and discusses the ethical and practical constraints that surround this type of research. The first cycle of AR findings are presented and identify a number of key areas where the website is failing; including a lack of speed in responding to learner queries, negative user perceptions of not &quot;owning&quot; the website, a lack of synchronous private chat rooms, user time constraints, negative user experiences of not being online simultaneously and of a broader failure in unifying school and university websites to promote wider social networking opportunities. In response to these findings, this article puts forward a table which includes an identification of the issues and themes, the methods utilised and how the findings were derived, reflections upon what they indicate, and an action strategy for implementation alongside questions for future research. This article concludes by stating that the action plan will be implemented and assessed in the next cycle of AR which is viewed by the authors as being part of a contextually valid, lifelong AR spiral process.

The research questions are 1) What factors and features influence faculty adoption of the Wimba Virtual Classroom? 2) How do faculty rate the Wimba Virtual Classroom using the characteristics of innovation? 3) How do faculty classify themselves using Roger's model of diffusion of innovation? 4) How do faculty use the Wimba Virtual Classroom in their teaching? Roger's diffusion of innovation was used as the theoretical framework for faculty adoption of virtual classroom. In the Fall of 2010, faculty were surveyed and interviewed about their decision to adopt and use Wimba.

While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.

Web-based Learning Management Systems (LMS) have transformed the way that education is conducted nowadays. At the same time, the adoption of Virtual Worlds in the educational process is of great importance, not only for the researchers in the field of Web-based Education, but also for the educational community that is interested in applying ICT in education. The main motivation for studying the potential of Virtual Worlds applications in education stems from the capabilities they offer to create a cyberspace where users can interact with other participants (through their avatars) or objects, creating new experiences that are not often feasible in the real world. Within this context, the fundamentals of learning theories have to be analyzed, in order to study their impact on e-learning and Virtual Learning Environments design. The currently available Virtual-World platforms are being presented and qualitatively assessed. Subsequently we focus on Sloodle, which bridges the characteristics of the Moodle LMS with the Open Simulator 3D virtual world functionality. (Contains 2 tables and 16 figures.)",

        "description":"The term &quot;scaffolding&quot; is often used loosely to describe a broad range of interventions or devices for learners and in many instances the actual nature of the scaffold is unclear. In the true sense, for &quot;scaffolding&quot; to take place the activity needs to be for the learner&apos;s own intentions, i.e. a task that he or she sets for themselves. The scaffold must also operate within the learner&apos;s Zone of Proximal Development, working at the learner&apos;s level of comprehension and drawing the learning into new areas of exploration. A final characteristic of scaffolding is that the scaffold is gradually withdrawn as the learner becomes more competent. The study described in this paper draws on concepts of scaffolding to support beginning pre-service teachers to establish an eportfolio for their course. The students use the eportfolio  environment &quot;PebblePad&quot; to store resources and reflect on experiences as they journey through their course. This paper describes and reflects on the processes and artefacts used to scaffold the first year pre-service teachers as they conceptualise and frame their learning journey eportfolios.

        "author":["Schultz, Madeleine"],
        "description":"In spite of increasing attention devoted to the importance of embedding sustainability in university curricula, few Australian universities include specific green chemistry units, and there is no mention of green or sustainable chemistry concepts in the majority of units. In this paper, an argument is posited that all universities should embed sustainable chemistry within all Chemistry courses because it is the morally correct stance to minimise the harm of climate change. Attitudes of chemistry lecturers towards integrating sustainability into their teaching have been probed and it was found, using an established model, that personal environmental perspectives are critical to their attitude. Importantly, academic staff whose research has an environmental component were more likely to incorporate sustainability into their teaching while others struggled to find ways to do so even when they believed it to be important. This paper will recommend that resources are required to assist academic staff without a green chemistry research program to incorporate sustainability into their teaching and several suggestions are provided.

        "description":"University learning increasingly includes online learning experiences embedded within teaching with the dual policy intentions of increasing flexibility and learner engagement. In this research project, three university lecturers from different teaching contexts selected technologies for online learning to enhance learner engagement by encouraging peer learning. A sociocultural view of learning was used to conceptualise the technological and social affordances that might enable student peer participation and engagement. The research explored the question: &quot;What are the benefits and barriers experienced by students engaging in online peer collaboration?&quot; Students reported benefits including a sense of belonging that enhanced motivation, and professional identity. This article also reports on some of the challenges for students and University academics when engaging in online learning communities. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)",

Individual differences, perceptions and preferences that apparently promoted rapid and productive development included: design efficacy, mastery goals, preference for cognitive challenge and tolerance for risk-taking. Novice learners benefited from content and context familiarity, but as they developed competence, they gained from choosing less familiar tasks and content. Features of the learning environment identified as contributing to novice designers&apos; knowledge and skill development were: authentic projects, detailed assignment specifications, multiple types and levels of feedback, and clear alignment with professional performance standards. These findings inform the strategic design of instructional opportunities for novice designers and similarly complex applied professional fields. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "author":["Swann, William"],
        "description":"Since the emergence of eLearning in the 1990s, the craft of designing and developing online courseware has evolved alongside theoretical advances in the field. A variety of media combinations have been applied to course pages by eLearning practitioners, making it possible to examine learning concepts emerging from the research in the light of responses from learners. This study explores learner perceptions of engagement following completion of 393 courses developed by a commercial eLearning provider. Three media combinations are examined. Each course selected for the sample applies one of the three combinations on the majority of content pages. Responses from the 22,959 learners who completed post-training surveys are evaluated, with the goal of determining how learner engagement is influenced by the application of two cognitive learning principles--the multiple representation principle and the split-attention principle. Both principles are found to have limited impact on narrow audiences of intrinsically motivated learners, but significant impact on engagement with broader audiences of learners who are assigned or required to take the training. When applied in the field, these two cognitive learning principles dramatically broaden the audience of learners who feel engaged with the learning experience. (Contains 9 tables.)",

In this narrative I share my foibles as a young, over-confident, and naive music instructor who, through a great amount of error, eventually learned the value of letting a child lead his own music learning. Throughout this narrative I highlight excerpts from teaching and parent journals that I collected and analyzed during a twelve-month period in which I taught Danny--a four-year-old cello student whose already refined sense of musicianship and innate desire to\nlearn rarely meshed with my efforts to teach certain skills and repertoire that I thought would be &quot;best for him.&quot; I candidly share my arrogance, mistakes, and personal learning experiences while also revealing tensions that emerged through various parent-child-teacher interactions (manifested in shades of perfectionism and the clash between expressiveness and technique). In contrast, other stories reveal spontaneous and tender music-making moments at times when Danny, Mother, and I would just simply &quot;play.&quot;",

Barone and Eisner (2012) posed such an open question, asking: How may we employ &quot;the arts methodologically to reveal what the arts make possible in various situations?&quot; (p. xii). This paper engages with their provocative question by exploring the spaces between my research interest and the methodology constructed to pursue it. Further, I consider the expansion that blooms out of the multiplicity of engagement that arts based research inspires and \ncommands--an expansion that illuminates my research process as an &quot;unfolding&quot; methodology in the afterglow.

As before, the classroom teacher and music teacher planned and taught together through two years, crossing the traditional borders that usually keep music and the \ngeneral classroom course of study separated. Teacher journaling and classroom videotaping showed improved student behavior and work ethic as the study progressed.

We ask what this increase in activity might mean for the nature of arts education subjects in schools, in particular music, what kind of rationale and philosophy the national art event programs bring to schooling and what challenges this new situation represent for the artists as well as teachers involved. We argue that the lack of school ownership of these practices can be understood in view of a dominating rationale based on romantic aesthetic theories. We also argue that neither education nor the visiting arts programs seem to have adjusted their practices to recent trends in western performance practices and aesthetics and to an educational practice building sufficiently on a pedagogy of relations. We propose then to actively embrace, but also to adapt, the relational turn in both fields, but not uncritically and not in a way that might reduce the meaning and importance of great art, nor the quality of educational learning and Bildung. We think art and aesthetics as well as education has something to offer in the construction of a new relational arts based pedagogy.",

The study presented discusses teachers' experiences with and space for action within The Cultural Rucksack; a national program for arts and culture in Norwegian schools. Observations and qualitative interviews show, on one hand, that teachers are pleased that students and teachers are able to enjoy professional arts and culture at school. On the other hand, a series of dilemmas, challenges and tensions are evident in the \nteachers' statements and actions. The teachers' statements about the programme are characterized by a positive attitude, still, the teachers state that they lack of influence over the programme. A perceived twosomeness between artists and students makes the teachers almost redundant as teachers. As a result, teachers have to position themselves in other ways to regain a place within the programme; as artists' helpers, students' guards, or as mediators between artists and students. The study presented is part of a three-year national and interdisciplinary research project on The Cultural \nRucksack that was commissioned by the Norwegian Ministry of Culture.

Five concepts organize our investigations into museum interpretation--framing, mapping, shifting, in-between, and potentiality. We employ a conceptual fold by bringing our individual research narratives into contiguity, continually seeking for resonances and dissonances in our studies that point to meaningful understandings about art museum interpretation.

The participants were 130 preservice primary mathematics teachers in their fourth year of university education. The data were collected through a questionnaire consisting of open-ended questions and clinical interviews and analysed qualitatively. The results showed that, in general, the preservice teachers were inadequate in terms of knowledge of students about algebraic concepts, they had insufficient subject-matter knowledge and they had misconceptions.

Respondents to the present study placed high importance on rapport attributes such as friendliness, care, and patience; and delivery attributes which included the provision of clear explanations, error correction, and a participatory mode of instruction. Impartiality, target language knowledge, and good preparation were attributes also rated highly. The results also provided insights into student opinions about various instructional issues, such as the selective use of the students' first language, explicit grammar instruction, and particular questioning techniques. This knowledge can be used by foreign language teachers and student teachers to improve the efficacy of their instruction. (Contains 8 tables.)",

Since the teachers in their first year in the profession do not have any experience, they have to pursue the educational tasks based on the knowledge and skills they acquired in their faculties. The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the views of the teacher trainees on the process of teacher training in Turkey. Being qualitative in nature, the current research was a descriptive study. The study group involved 58 newly-appointed teacher trainees from different branches who began their teaching profession in Kastamonu in 2010. An &quot;Interview Form&quot; was used for data collection. The data collected from the participants were analysed through Nvivo 9 software package. As a result of the study, the teacher trainees indicated that they felt insufficient especially related to curriculum and content knowledge and that teaching practice and school experience courses do not adequately contribute to their profession.

Three hundred and seventy-one kindergarten teachers voluntarily responded to the MBTI. Findings showed that Hong Kong kindergarten teachers were predominantly of the sensing-feeling-judging personality types, characterized by being realistic, conventional, and considerate to others' feelings. In addition, principals and head teachers in kindergartens tended to be extraverted. Results also suggested a very low percentage of intuitive kindergarten teachers, indicating that teachers' personality types might be field-bound.

        "description":"Graduate teachers in Australia are expected to engage with their peers to expand their professional learning. Learning to use protocols--or structured professional conversations--provides pre-service teachers with opportunities to achieve this expectation. In this paper we explain how pre-service teachers during an extended practicum used protocols to participate in synchronous online discussions using the Blackboard Collaborate learning platform. The pre-service teachers were surveyed about aspects of the protocols and the platform on which the interactions occurred. Protocols appear to be well-suited to assisting synchronous discussions using Web 2 technologies as they ensure everyone has equal time to discuss, present and receive feedback about their work in respectful and efficient ways. This preliminary research provides opportunities for further investigation of pedagogical approaches to use with pre-service teachers when they are required to utilise online platforms when they are away from the university for extended periods of time.

Data were collected through observing and audio-recording the participants' teaching, aiming to capture the actual features of their English use in class. The data were structurally-coded employing the ELM categories. Discourse analysis was employed to interpret and understand the language use of the bilingual student teachers and also their supervising teachers. The bilingual student-teachers in this research, whose English proficiency was at IELTS 7.5, and who had experienced six months of intensive teaching practicum, were found able to demonstrate grammatically and discursively acceptable expressions throughout their teaching. The difficulties experienced by this cohort were more due to their lack of skills and flexibilities in teaching and classroom management rather than their inappropriate use of instructional English.

The enactment of Indigenous ethics of care between ACEOs and Indigenous students will be explored, with a particular focus on the use of the Nunga room (Blanch, 2009, p. 66) as a &quot;safe-house&quot; (Pratt, 1991). The paucity of Indigenous ethics of care theory and the role of ACEOs' work in the Nunga room in education literature is problematic, as many non-Indigenous teachers continue to racialise Indigenous students through negative stereotypes.

Their research experiences were shaped not only by their classroom concerns but also by expectations and larger social narratives that lived beyond their classroom doors.

        "description":"This paper discusses the primacy of communities of practice within learning contexts at university and during practicum for culturally and linguistically diverse preservice teachers. The study illustrates that learning occurs when there are adequate opportunities for participation and practice. Data from interviews with 28 culturally and linguistically diverse preservice teachers illustrate that tensions created by social, cultural differences impact upon modes of identification and dimensions of practice (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998). The study concludes by reiterating the importance of establishing proactive communities of practice to ensure success in learning and practice for this group of preservice teachers.",

        "description":"In the age of educational accountability, national and statewide measures are assumed to secure and improve the educational quality. However, educators often wonder how much a new accountability measure may improve the actual teaching and learning practices when the agents of change (teachers) are not active participants of such educational reform. Nevertheless, in Australia, the National Curriculum is rolling in for the first time for K-10 school education in 2012-13. In Western Australia, the new Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE) system with new compulsory exit examination requirements has been implemented recently for Years 11-12. In this study, using the contextual curriculum theory (Cornbleth, 1990) and the levels of curriculum (van den Akker, 1998, 2003) as our theoretical framework, we investigated how experienced Biology teachers are making sense of the recent changes in the curriculum and the exit examination requirements: what they perceive as the major changes in the new WACE system; and how they implement the changes in their teaching practice. We discuss how the teachers' teaching philosophy, their school environments, and the new curriculum interact to create a spectrum of the implemented curriculum. (Contains 1 table.)",

The study was carried out on one group using both pre-and post-test experimental studies. The findings of the study were obtained through quantitative approaches. The sample of the study was 70 &quot;first-year undergraduate students&quot; at a state university in Turkey taking General Chemistry/General Chemistry-II classes. The study was implemented during the spring semester of the 2011-2012 academic years and for a period of 20 hours. Quantitative data was obtained using the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory and the Chemistry Attitude Scale. Two dependent sample t-tests were used for the pre-and post-test comparisons. The findings showed that PBL was more effective in developing metacognitive awareness levels of students with weak science background knowledge compared to those with strong science backgrounds. In addition, the findings showed that PBL was effective in increasing the attitudes positively toward chemistry of students with weak scientific backgrounds. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"This study investigates the challenges sixteen non-native preservice ESL teachers in a Bachelor of Education (English Language) (BEdEL) programme from Hong Kong experienced in an eight-week teaching practicum. Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews and reflective journals were collected from all 16 participants to obtain a detailed description of the participants' perceptions of their field-based practicum experiences. Results indicate that the preservice teachers' practicum was characterized by a reality shock due to difficulties in experimenting with pedagogical practices they were taught in the BEdEL programme, and a lack of sense of control in class. This reality shock could destabilize the already anxious student teachers and have adverse effects well beyond the eight-week teaching practicum. Inadequacy in English language competence also appeared to affect not only these student teachers' teaching performance but also how they established and maintained their teacher role and relationship with their students. Implications of the results for strengthening current ESL teacher preparation programmes in non-native English speaking contexts are discussed.",

Moreover, teacher attrition is costly to the profession, to the community and to those teachers who leave feeling disillusioned. There is a need to investigate the experiences of early career teachers to consider how these issues contribute to decisions about staying in or leaving the profession. This paper reports on an aspect of a larger study on teacher retention. It describes and analyses the experiences of teachers participating in the study and highlights implications for teacher retention. The study proposes the notion of &quot;resilient stayers&quot;, and how beginning teachers' resilience might be strengthened and supported. It asks what combination of circumstances in the school and the system, and individual resources of resilience on the part of early career teachers, might maximise the chances of teachers choosing to remain in the profession.",

However, there appears to be a common gap between the research evidence and instructional practices. It has been argued that teachers have insufficient information to enable them to implement effective literacy instruction with children with Down syndrome. This has important implications for teacher education. The current paper draws on past and current research evidence to consider five common misunderstandings or &quot;myths&quot; that exist in regards to reading development in children with Down syndrome regarding (1) receptive and expressive language, (2) phonological awareness and phonic decoding, (3) &quot;reading readiness&quot; or (non)linear development, (4) optimal learning age and, (5) reading comprehension.

In terms of the weaknesses, we argue that the success of teacher mentoring in Shanghai is inhibited by a performative culture that emphasises examination scores and an instrumental view of education.

The PRN is a principal preparation program of the non-profit organization, the Center for \nLeadership and Educational Equity. This sequential explanatory mixed methods study explored PRN graduates' outcomes and perceptions of the program, with an overarching purpose of creating a coherent data collection \nand inquiry process to be used by program staff on an ongoing basis. Following the development of an evaluation framework, Phase I of the study consisted of collecting assessment data and feedback from current \nPRN participants, as well as administering a survey questionnaire to recent graduates of the program (N = 14), previously administered in 2005 (N = 21) and 2009 (N = 6). Phase II of this evaluation was designed to further \nexplore recent graduates' perceptions of the nature and relevancy of the program in developing their commitment and skill to lead for equity in order to recommend program improvements; N = 7 participated in a 90 minute focus group. Findings indicated four conclusions from which recommendations were drawn: the program is achieving strong results, participants perceive the program to have an interconnected and coherent focus on preparing them to be equity-oriented leaders, the mentor is a critical component, and modeling the cycle of inquiry created through this evaluative study is important.

        "description":"In July 2008, Riverbend Public Schools (RPS) in Western Michigan and Grand Valley State University (GVSU) received a grant from the Wallace Foundation that supported the development of a specialized educational\nleadership program. The project was designed to customize an existing degree program in the university's College of Education, focusing on leadership skill sets for urban school leaders. The project, titled the &quot;Aspiring Leaders Program,&quot; allowed 34 urban teachers and new principals to obtain a master's degree in educational leadership or an educational specialist degree in educational leadership with special expertise in urban schools.\nThe program ran from November 2008 through the fall semester of 2009. In the late fall of 2009 and again in 2012, follow-up studies were conducted to determine if this customized program had benefited the participants and if they continued to use the skill sets they had been taught. This study describes the 2012 three-year followup study and discusses its results. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Most university leaders have been promoted into leadership roles without experience and training to enable them to foresee and address unintended outcomes of their decision making; \noften, the culture in higher education institutions promotes continuation of the status quo. However, in times of crisis, such as those related to reductions in budgets, many unintended consequences develop as leaders attempt to address change. Unintended consequences have implications related to the success or failure of planned change and higher education \nadministrators must address such outcomes appropriately.

        "description":"The article presents the evaluation of the training programme for secondary school principals conducted in the period between 2006 and 2009. A mixed method approach was used to conduct the summative evaluation with 28 graduate participants. For the impact evaluation, 15 of the graduates were interviewed three years after the programme was completed. The \nquantitative data was analyzed using means and standard deviation. The findings revealed that participants gained technical and relational skills but responses were less favourable in relation to cognitive or conceptual skills, while the support from lecturers and workplaces was strong but less favourable from the central ministry. There was a positive impact on \nparticipants' performance during the period of training, especially in the areas of confidence, collegiality and overall leadership. For the impact evaluation, graduates credited the programme for their promotion to become principals, vice principals, senior teachers or give added responsibilities. They identified areas to be enhanced for any further programme to include school law, financial management, policy development and interpretation, and conflict management and relational skills. The main recommendation is that for any further programme for the training of principals should be guided by the findings of the evaluation. (Contains 7 tables and 1 figure.)",

An exploratory, ex-post-facto research design used both quantitative and qualitative approaches. A survey of 101 randomly selected urban school principals from 25 of America&apos;s largest metropolitan school districts was given, followed by telephone interviews with a subset of 20 randomly selected survey participants. Data were analyzed through the use of inferential and descriptive statistics and descriptive narratives. On-the-job experiences were significantly more important in developing leadership expertise than college credential programs on each of 41 ISLLC-based learning tasks. However, college credential programs are also important sources of leadership development. Several significant differences were found between comparative ratings of learning tasks by subgroups (experience, gender, school type). Respondents ranked 78% of the ISLLC Standards as very important to the field of school leadership. Interview subjects expressed concern about lack of preparation in budgeting, data analysis, teacher evaluation, and change management. (Contains 8 tables and 3 footnotes)",

What appears to be a logical conclusion that this experience would enhance the \ntraining of aspiring building leaders defies the gathering of definitive empirical evidence. The quest to validate what constitutes a successful internship experience intensified in the 1980s when research affirmed the positive relationship between effective school leadership and school performance. The research results contained in this study attempt to provide information that will lead to the improvement of internship experiences for aspiring school administrators. In order to accomplish this purpose, current building principals in Indiana were surveyed regarding their internship experiences in the areas of program structure, components of the internship, \ntime requirements, and recommendations for improvement. This research is a replication of a 2009 study, &quot;Improving Administrative Internship Programs: Perceptions of Illinois Principals,&quot; authored by Thomas Kersten, Margaret Trybus, and Daniel White.

The findings revealed that the school-level variables were stronger predictors of student achievement than principal-level variables. However, for both grade 3 and grade 5, principal tenure was a significant predictor across subject areas tested. As the length of a principal's tenure at a school increased, the schools mean scale scores increased. Findings also revealed that schools with greater principal stability had higher school mean scale scores.

        "description":"Formal and informal partnerships between rural schools and their communities can provide a wide range of supports for all students, but particularly those from low-income families. In this analysis of six small rural school districts in Virginia we show how the broad participation of community groups and individuals supports academic achievement as well as preparation and aspirations for postsecondary education. Results demonstrate that school-community partnerships provide multiple points of contact for students that buttress the efforts of school personnel by extended educational opportunities outside the classroom and by meeting the needs of low-income students when parents and teachers are unable to do so.",

        "description":"Special education teachers, through a national survey conducted in 55 rural districts, provided information on the positive and negative aspects of teaching in rural schools. The 203 special educators were asked what they liked best about their position and what they found challenging. Some of the themes identified in the analysis centered on positive features of working in rural areas. Characteristics of the rural community fostered family-like relationships with others in their school and in-depth relationships with parents and students. Half of the teachers also reported they shared the responsibility or took a team approach to delivering special education services, a factor related to teacher satisfaction. The majority of teachers were satisfied with the instructional aspects of their position but \ndissatisfied with non-instructional role responsibilities. Challenges of the position also included role confusion and a lack of resources. Related implications for rural administrators interested in the satisfaction of special education teachers are provided. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Advocates of rural education emphasize the need to examine supports which may promote rural educators given the challenging contexts of which they face. Teacher visioning has been conceptualized as a navigational tool to help sustain and promote teachers given high-challenging contexts. The current study explored 10 public school teachers from rural areas in the Pacific Northwest, and their visions and challenges to practicing their visions in their respective school environments. Findings suggest that visions were described in three domains: visions of students, visions of self as teacher, and visions of school. Teachers expressed visions of self as &quot;change agents,&quot; and often expressed a sense of responsibility and vulnerability as they worked to weave knowledge of effective pedagogy, teacher leadership principles, and self-reflection to implement change in their individual schools.

The leadership of the principal is known to be a key factor in supporting student achievement; however, recruitment and retention of administrators in rural areas of the Midwest is very difficult. This survey research study explored the recruitment and retention strategies, as well as factors influencing the loss or retention of quality administrators reported by Midwest superintendents. The themes that emerged as successful recruitment strategies included &quot;growing your own&quot; as the number one method of recruiting and retaining rural school administrators, salaries/benefits depending on location, emphasizing positive working conditions and climate/culture, and providing quality professional development. Retention strategies that worked well for rural schools were an emphasis on a positive school culture and climate, investment in professional development, and use of technology for mentoring along with increased benefits.

Committee or Board structure varies widely; regulations determining minimum size and membership differ between countries. Issues such as the effectiveness of committee management, consumption of paper, timelines for review, and causes of delay were key issues for improvement. Several new practices were adopted, the first being a subcommittee to manage the review of low or minimal risk projects, successfully relieving the workload of the main committee. Adoption of electronic processes and documentation resulted in less paper, more streamlined review and sharing of applications. Effective time management for meeting schedules, electronic coordination of meeting agenda items and protocol distribution for review successfully reduced delays in reviews. Assigning lead members for all ethical reviews strengthened committee function by sharing out agenda items, allowing committee members to focus on specific protocols. Ready communication with researchers is an intrinsic and highly successful part of committee practice. There appears to be advantage in central allocation of projects for review, but the local input from boards or committees brings great value. The rebuilding of the ACT committee has improved both process efficiency and relationships with researchers.",

        "description":"Independent academic medical centers (IAMC) are challenged to develop and support a research enterprise and maintain primary goals of healthcare delivery and financial solvency. Strategies for promoting translational research have been shown to be effective at institutions in the top level of federal funding, but not for smaller IAMCs. The research program developed at Maricopa Integrated Health System (MIHS), an IAMC, focused on identifying research enterprise drivers which have an impact on core missions for MIHS and encompassed three domains: (1) Commercial ventures; (2) Clinical practice; and (3) Civic and Community relationships. Specific mechanisms were implemented to promote research, which had an impact on each enterprise driver. Case examples in 2 clinical arenas are described in detail, Pediatrics and Obstetrics/Gynecology, to demonstrate how the strategies were applied to increase translational research and influence the research enterprise drivers. These strategies included: reducing barriers within MIHS and with partner institutions, increasing revenue generated from grants and contracts, providing grant development support, and developing sustainable collaborations with partner institutions. The value in identifying and utilizing external resources is reciprocal as ongoing research collaborations have resulted in more contract and grant awards for both MIHS and partner institutions.

        "description":"Students entering Tulane University in 2006, 2007, and 2008, the years following Hurricane Katrina, were surveyed soon after arriving on campus and again after they had been at the university for two years. Attitudes toward a new public service graduation requirement, established after the storm, remained positive after students had completed two years of study. Measures of civic attitudes, knowledge, and skills were stable over two years, as well, but, at the same time, students showed increases in their valuing of community engagement and in several self-reports of civic knowledge. Comparisons involving additional groups showed the importance of the college experience in accounting for these changes. Interests in civic engagement expressed at college entry were correlated with and appear to be important predictors of later civic attitudes. (Contains 11 tables.)",

These dimensions include: course/placement integration, critical pedagogy in practice, the intricacies of recruiting and supporting activist placements, and ethical considerations.

We take up this call by turning our attention to one particular dimension of our ISL course: our relationship with our host partner. Our analysis is grounded in our experience as ISL practitioners, and we use our own &quot;points of discomfort&quot;--the moments in which our relationship with our host partner was unsettling or agitating--as our starting point. Throughout, we show how these &quot;agitated interactions&quot; suggested contradictions between the rhetoric and the reality of ISL and led us to question the distinctiveness of the ISL identity, the practicality of reciprocity as a guiding framework, and where ISL fits within the ongoing colonialist project. We have emerged from this reflective process with a more &quot;encumbered&quot; view of ISL practice, yet have found many ways to move forward from this new perspective.",

        "description":"The past several decades have witnessed increasing efforts to advance universities as institutions supporting democratic civic education in the United States. Unfortunately, civic engagement initiatives frequently are framed as apolitical, which I argue is either under-theorized or disingenuous. In this article, I first review perceptions of values, partisanship, and political agendas in the contemporary university. Second, I turn to the historic role of democratic values within the American educational system. Third, I provide a conception of civil society useful for considering the ways in which democratic values must be continuously nurtured in the face of countervailing pressures from the market and the state. Fourth, I employ that lens to consider national trends in understanding of and support for education and related issues. Fifth, I move on to assert, drawing on Rorty (1998) and Schwartz (2008), that universities have surrendered their historic roles as civil society supporters of democratic values. Sixth, I consider implications for service-learning and community engagement before demonstrating how the human rights scholarly community offers a helpful model of continuously critical values commitment. And finally, I close with a vision of universities taking clear positions in support of democratic values. (Contains 4 notes.)",

        "description":"Hosting international students has long been admired as one of the hallmarks of internationalization. The two major formative strands of internationalization in Canadian universities are development cooperation and international students. With reduced public funding for higher education, institutions are aggressively recruiting international students to generate additional revenue. Canada is equally interested in offering incentives for international students to stay in the country as immigrants after completing their studies. In its 2011 budget, the Canadian federal government earmarked funding for an international education strategy and, in 2010, funded Edu-Canada--the marketing unit within the Department of Education and Foreign Affairs (DFAIT)--to develop an official Canadian brand to boost educational marketing, IMAGINE: Education in/au Canada. This model emulates the Australian one, which rapidly capitalized on the recruitment of international students and became an international success story. Given current Canadian higher education policy trends, this paper will address the cautionary lessons that can be drawn from the Australian case. (Contains 3 figures and 1 note.)",

Drawing on the entire population of doctoral students in the province of Quebec, this pa- per analyzes three distinct sources of data: students, excellence scholarships, and scientific publications. It shows that funded students publish more papers than their unfunded colleagues, but that there is only a slight difference between funded and unfunded PhD students in terms of scientific impact. Funded students, especially those funded by the federal government, are also more likely to graduate. Finally, although funding is clearly linked to higher degree completion for students who did not publish, this is not true of those who managed to publish at least one paper during the course of their PhD. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implication of the findings for Canadian science policy. (Contains 1 table, 5 figures, and 5 notes.)",

In an acknowledgement that the search for creative and innovative solutions to complex problems is best addressed through interdisciplinary collaborations, research-intensive universities are increasingly encouraging interdisciplinary projects and programs. The expansion of interdisciplinary research to the context of doctoral research may impact several core components of the doctorate: the enactment of the student-supervisor relationship, the process of forming and working with a supervisory committee, and the process and outcomes of doctoral research. In order to ensure that interdisciplinary doctoral supervision occurs in a positive and effective way, it is necessary to understand the distinct needs and challenges of interdisciplinary students and their supervisors, through scholarship about this phenomenon.

Beginning with an overview of academic freedom within universities, we then examine the development and evolution of colleges and institutes and discuss how or if academic freedom applies to them. We consider issues of collegiality, faculty engagement, and governance as they impact the concept and practice of academic freedom within these institutions.

        "description":"This study compared the academic achievement between undergraduate students taking an introductory managerial accounting course online (N = 104) and students who took the same course in a hybrid classroom setting (N = 203). Student achievement was measured using scores from twelve weekly online assignments, two major online assignments, a final examination held on campus, and overall course performance. This study found that students receiving only online instruction were as successful as students receiving hybrid classroom instruction. These findings suggest that course instruction and pedagogy are more important for student learning than the type of media delivery, and online instructors should focus their effort on quality in developing &quot;online courses.&quot; (Contains 1 table.)",

Although past research has identified areas typically associated with the student affairs and services portfolio and factors that influence the organizational structure, little is known about how staff perceive their institutions' organizational structures relative to supporting student success. The purpose of this study was to understand student affairs and services staff members' perceptions of the role organizational structure plays in their day-to-day work supporting student success in colleges and universities in Ontario. Although staff commented on their institutions' formal organizational structures (referring to titles, reporting lines, and breadth of portfolio), their comments focused more specifically on how they saw the nature of their work and changes they have experienced in supporting student success as student bodies become more diverse.",

In this study we explored the potential benefits of the availability of water for undergraduates. The exam performance of students who brought drinks in to exams was compared with those that did not for three cohorts of undergraduates (N = 447). We employed earlier coursework marks as a measure of underlying ability. Students who brought water to the exam achieved better grades than students who did not. When coursework marks were covaried, this effect remained statistically significant, suggesting that this finding was not simply due to more able students being more likely to bring in water. This implies that water consumption may facilitate performance in real-world settings, and, therefore, have specific implications for the assessment of undergraduate learners under examination conditions, but further research is required to evaluate this hypothesis.

        "description":"The challenges facing UK higher education are both well documented and controversial; however, pitted against this context is the requirement for psychology departments to provide an increasingly rich and diverse university experience for students, whilst ensuring progression and retention remain central to undergraduate provision. Despite the recognition that induction is of upmost importance in ensuring a successful transition from pretertiary to higher education, many universities are faced with changing budgets in the post-Browne era (Browne, 2010) across all aspects of academic life. Such a challenge presents departments with a unique paradox since student expectations continue to rise as the dominance of consumerism reaches fruition, whilst budgets continue to decrease. In acknowledging the importance of induction for both the overall student experience and for retention, the University of Worcester designed and successfully implemented an induction programme on a considerably reduced budget. A satisfaction questionnaire was completed by 136 undergraduate students inducted in 2011 and the results compared to those of 87 students from 2010 (where the induction budget was considerably higher). The results indicate similar levels of satisfaction and engagement with induction activities and whilst an off-site activity remains key to the success of induction, such an activity doesn't have to present considerable expense. This paper provides an overview of designing an induction programme on a reduced budget, presents satisfaction results from undergraduate students who completed induction in both 2010 and 2011, and presents suggestions for best practice in the design of induction events for psychology undergraduates.",

The present study employed focus groups with 35 pre-tertiary males (some of whom were studying psychology and some of whom were not) to discuss their perceptions of the discipline in terms of its scientific status and gendered associations with females. A thematic analysis revealed that participants positioned psychology as 'a sort' of science, with a diverse subject base, much of which was not considered appropriate or relevant for males to study. The implications of this are discussed in terms of the inherent challenges it reveals in attracting men to study psychology, debating what could be done to make the discipline more appealing to males.",

        "description":"In recent times the Australian Government has become increasingly concerned with the challenge to the dominant culture by humanitarian immigrants entering the country. As a part of a complex strategy, emerging from the events of 9/11 and the perceived changing face of multiculturalism in Australia, the Attorney-General Robert McClelland announced in 2011 more than $1.1 million in funding for projects to mentor and support young people to stay disengaged from intolerant and radical ideologies. The grants have been awarded under the &quot;Building Community Resilience-Youth Mentoring Grants Program (2010)&quot; and are designed to promote a tolerant, safe and inclusive society. As a result of that funding a northern suburbs Council Youth Services in Victoria established a project to work with young people 12-17 years who have been identified by Victoria Police, the education sector, and welfare agencies as individuals who have or are exhibiting signs of fostering hatred and intolerance either through the spoken word, written messages, graffiti, the media or the internet that live within this local government area. This paper discusses the results of the evaluation of a multicultural leadership program that was delivered using an adult learning framework in which 16 young people attended and how such programs can continue to build the capacity of communities to build scaffolds of support that ensure the inclusion of young people and not their marginalization.

Each took part in an audio-taped semi-structured interview which explored the impact that university study had on their lives. Their responses suggest that Clemente Ballarat was life-giving. The student insights identified the critical importance of: providing a supportive learning environment for people lacking life opportunities and routine; students feeling better and happier with themselves resultant from personal learning  achievements; doing something that was about &quot;me&quot;; support from others including Learning Partners and the programs counsellor; students appreciating their academic and inner strengths; rekindling dreams and hope; seeking ways out of poverty for their family; finding friendship and connection; appreciating the academic disciplines; improvements in well-being and mental health; and pride in achievements. Students also were apprehensive about what the future may hold after completion and graduation. These insights highlight the treasures that students found when engaged in humanities education based upon community embedded socially supported structures that enable learning. Further, these insights provide contextual outcomes for the Clemente program, which could be implemented across regional and rural Australia for people experiencing multiple disadvantages or social exclusion.",

        "description":"This study examines the attrition and achievement of a sample of 295 students in an on-campus tertiary bridging program at a regional university. A logistic regression analysis using enrolment status, age and the number of absences from scheduled classes at week three of the semester as predictor variables correctly predicted 92.8 percent of participant attrition. It was concluded that attrition is largely a phenomenon associated with younger students between 18 and 24. While the quality of academic staff support was found to be strongly positively associated with the emotional commitment and academic identity of the participant, it was also negatively associated with scheduled class absence for those participants who dropped out. Intervention to address attrition of these young students is recommended to involve the selection of appropriate academic staff and a comprehensive orientation process which allows the development of supportive peer and staff relationships. The purpose of the orientation would be to facilitate the development of a robust sense of emotional commitment to a positive academic identity prior to the completion of the initial assessment tasks.

In Australia, pathways to university provided by Credit Transfer have increased student mobility; the dichotomy however, is that alongside discourses of inclusivity is the need for students to adjust to the often rigorous academic demands of higher education. This paper examines the Bachelor of Communication and Media at the University of Wollongong (UOW), and the Diploma of Communication &amp; Media Studies at the Illawarra Institute of Technical and Further Education (TAFE). Some of the common challenges transitioning students face in their first year at UOW are discussed, including; adapting to different workloads and the demands of self-directed, independent learning. A potential solution is a pre- university entry induction program for TAFE students.",

The study explored the connection between &quot;students' challenging behaviours&quot; and &quot;teachers' occupational stress&quot; in a sample of Italian inservice primary teachers (N = 306). Data from the Italian version of the &quot;Challenging Students Standard Questionnaire&quot; were analysed to understand the impact of six different categories of &quot;challenging students' behaviours&quot; on eliciting &quot;occupational stress&quot; responses in SETs and GETs. Descriptive, comparative t-test analyses and effect sizes for all measures were reported. Results were consistent with the idea that SETs and GETs experience different degrees of occupational stress as a result of experiencing different &quot;challenging students' behaviours.&quot; Recommendations for planning more targeted in-service training for primary teachers are discussed.

Teachers also were asked complete the Curriculum Indicators Survey (CIS) which provided information about their student's curriculum and instructional\nexperiences. Ratings from the IEP analysis tool developed for and used in this study suggest that students' IEP goals were of variable quality across grade bands. Academic-focused IEP goals were more likely to include sufficient information about links to the curriculum standards and progress monitoring strategies, but less frequently included sufficient information about students' present levels of performance (PLOP) and the relevance of IEP goals to the students' educational needs. Additionally, the quality of progress monitoring information in academic-focused IEP goals demonstrated a negative association with student achievement. IEP\nquality demonstrated no significant relationship to inclusion in general education classrooms or two measures of curricular access. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Depression is a common stress-related response for hearing parents of children with hearing loss. Evidence suggests that mothers are more inclined than fathers to experience depression in response to their child's hearing loss (Mavrolas, 1990; Meadow-Orleans, 1995; Prior, Glazner, Sanson &amp; Debelle, 1988)\nand mothers with depression have been found to be less effective at nurturing language and psychosocial development in their children. The aim of the study was to compare the levels of stress and depression in mothers of children using hearing aids and children who had cochlear implants. 50 mothers of children with bilateral profound hearing loss were divided into two groups according to the rehabilitation option used. Two self reporting scales Parental Stress Index (PSI) &amp; Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) duly translated into Telugu were used for the study. The results revealed that mothers in both the groups have high stress levels. On\ncomparison the mothers of children who had cochlear implant obtained significantly higher scores than mothers of children using hearing aid on PSI. The results on CESD revealed high depression levels in both groups with no significant difference in the mean scores between groups. Hence, the present study highlights the need for the rehabilitative professionals to focus on family-based intervention for children with hearing impairment. (Contains 4 tables and 3 figures.)",

Discrepancies were also analyzed relative to service delivery in three levels of prevention (primary, secondary, and tertiary). Results indicate that practicing school psychologists experience significant discrepancies between actual and preferred practices in all discrete practices, with the largest discrepancies by hours noted in the discrete practices of report writing, prevention screening, CBA/CBM administration, IQ testing, and conducting research. Respondents also indicated a clear preference for participating in significantly more primary-level and secondary-level prevention efforts. Barriers to preferred practices were analyzed with the most commonly reported barriers being time and administrative expectations.

It was predicted that injury severity, gender and attributional style would account for a significant amount of the variance in post-traumatic stress symptoms and emotional and behavioral difficulties in those siblings. The sample consisted of 406 siblings of both genders with a mean age of 12.50 years. The results indicated that injury severity, gender and attributional style were related to emotional\nand behavioral difficulties and symptoms of post-traumatic stress, except for gender and post-traumatic stress .Siblings of children with severe injury appeared to be at greater risk for intrusive thoughts and avoidance as well as emotional and behavioral difficulties. Females exhibited more emotional and behavioral problems than did males. Siblings with more maladaptive attributional styles endorsed more emotional-behavioral problems and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Techniques for strengthening coping abilities designed to enhance cognitive control may be used with siblings at risk, particularly females and siblings of children who sustained a severe\ninjury. Treatments such as trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy may incur positive results. (Contains 3 tables.)",

However, current research efforts on effective preparation in the area of ASD are only emerging and have not included targeted collaboration with state departments of education. In this study, a statewide survey of special education directors in the southwest United States was conducted to determine which competencies and licensure requirements would be necessary to prepare educators teaching students with ASD. Findings suggest that the majority of the 124 respondents indicated a preference for an autism endorsement added on to a special education certificate and described knowledge of characteristics of ASD, behavior management, and communication skills development as competencies as most essential for teachers working with students on the autism spectrum. As a model for university and state collaboration, implications for teacher preparation programs are described. (Contains 6 tables.)",

A total of 223 primary school teachers and 130 secondary school teachers were surveyed using a two-part questionnaire. Part-one of the questionnaire collected background information of the respondents. Part-two was a Likert scale which required the teachers to indicate their perceived current skill levels on a list of competencies needed to implement inclusion. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and t-tests. The major findings were that nearly 70% of the regular school\nteachers had neither received training in special education nor had any experience teaching students with disabilities. Further, 87% of the teachers did not have access to support services in their classrooms. Finally, although both primary and secondary school teachers rated themselves as having limited or low competence for working with students with disabilities, there was no statistically significant difference between their perceived skill levels. The implications for teacher training in India are discussed in terms of the different models that can improve teacher quality for inclusive education. (Contains 7 tables.)",

In the USA where the history of inclusion is over three decades old, current special educator's professional standards clearly expect that certified special educators will enter the field with adept collaboration and co-teaching skills in order to optimize services for students with disabilities in inclusive settings. Coursework in collaboration for pre-service special educators is a common mechanism for providing this training within the United States (McKenzie, 2009). This qualitative case study (n = 12) conducted over a semester of coursework on collaboration in a distance education format utilized grounded theory, through document analysis and interviewing (n = 5), to build a better understanding of pre-service special educators' perceptions and beliefs about collaborating with general educator partners in school settings. Five themes emerged from over 300 participant quotations: 1) definitions of collaboration, 2) outcomes of collaboration, 3) collaborative behaviors between teachers, 4) challenges to collaboration, and 5) preparedness to collaborate. These pre-service special educators most often commented on the challenges they experienced in school settings.

        "description":"In the Academy, faculty and institutional leaders traditionally have been white, male, and heterosexual. Of the 173,395 Full Professors identified in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) of the U.S. Department of Education in 2007, women represented almost 46,000, and Latinas held only 1,254 of those positions (U.S. Department of Education, 2010). Slow improvements (Valian, 1999) in institutions' structural diversity vis-a-vis Latina faculty means that they find themselves in alien territory, i.e., in contexts that do not readily understand or accept their difference, such that Latinas find it challenging to become incorporated into and legitimated within academe. Latinos of both genders in the faculty ranks experience subtle racism and hostility from students and peers (Solorzano, 1998) while Latina faculty members report feeling that their credibility as scholars or faculty members is challenged, and that White colleagues underestimate their abilities and discount the value they place on community advocacy. In response to experiences like these, researchers in a range of disciplines have focused on the need to be more welcoming and culturally responsive to communities of difference. Whether the focus is categorical difference associated with race and gender, or identity, scholars and practitioners have come to accept that traditional practices and conceptualizations in education tend to marginalize diverse or non-normative individuals and group members. This article contends with Latina faculty members' questions of identity and agency in the largely male and largely white world of academe. Grounded in a multi-year engagement and dialogue involving eight female Latina faculty members in a southwest urban city, authors opened up their experience as Latina faculty members and their struggles to maintain authenticity in the face of cultural, gender, and institutional pressure for conformity to existing institutional norms. The intent in doing was to foreground the complex experience of Latina faculty, and to encourage a reconsideration of institutional practices and norms--many with a deficit orientation--that inhibit Latina faculty authenticity and identity within academe.

We analyse 853 submissions made by two groups of graduate students and their teacher (N1 = 629 &amp; N2 = 224) involved in the collaborative development of a rubric for evaluating teaching skills using the Knowledge Forum platform. The results show that the feedback is distributed among participants (a teacher and her students), although there are important differences in the way in which this distribution occurs. The results also show that both the teacher and some of the students are able to provide verification and elaboration feedback on the learning content, the academic task at hand, and social participation. This feedback is useful for processes of knowledge construction, though significant differences are observed in the ways in which it is provided. Finally, the results show the importance of the temporal dimension for understanding how, when and for what purpose the teacher and students provide feedback to the other participants.

        "description":"For a variety of reasons, online education is an increasingly viable option for many students seeking to further their education. Because of this, the demand for online instructors continues to increase. Instructors transitioning to the online environment from the traditional classroom may find teaching online overwhelming. While some practices from the traditional classroom may apply in the new environment, there are many strategies that are unique to online learning. Additionally, the field of online instruction is changing so rapidly that the techniques for teaching online must be revisited regularly as well. This paper explores research regarding some current strategies for teaching online for both new and current online instructors. The practices examined include training, organizing the course, remaining proactive, providing regular and timely communication, maintaining a presence in the classroom, facilitating effective discussion boards, scaffolding, and desiring to improve one&apos;s online instruction. By utilizing these techniques in one&apos;s courses, online instructors are several steps closer to successful and satisfied students excited to continue learning in the online environment.",

        "description":"This paper describes the interactive tutoring feedback model (ITF-model; Narciss, 2006; 2008), and how it can be applied to the design and evaluation of feedback strategies for digital learning environments. The ITF-model conceptualizes formative tutoring feedback as a multidimensional instructional activity that aims at contributing to the regulation of a learning process in order to help learners acquire or improve the competencies needed to master learning tasks. It integrates findings from systems theory with recommendations of prior research on interactive instruction and elaborated feedback, on task analyses, on error analyses, and on tutoring techniques. Based on this multi-dimensional view of formative tutoring feedback methodological implications for designing and investigating multiple effects of feedback under multiple individual and situational conditions are described. Furthermore, the paper outlines how the implications of the ITF-model have been applied in several studies to the design and evaluation\nof tutoring feedback strategies for digital learning environments (e.g., Narciss, 2004; Narciss &amp; Huth, 2006; Narciss, Schnaubert, Andres, Eichelmann, Goguadze, &amp; Sosnovsky, 2013).

        "author":["Rodriguez, C. Osvaldo"],
        "description":"Massive Open Online Courses based on the principles of connectivist educational pedagogy known as connectivist MOOCs (c-MOOCs) have been carried out with great success during the last years with hundreds of registered participants. Examples are CCK08 (2008), PLENK2010 (2010), MobiMOOC (2011), EduMOOC (2011), Change11 (2011/12), and LAK12 (2012). Their implementation required conceptual changes in perspective from both &quot;facilitators&quot; (tutors) and learners. They are so novel that much research needs to be done for their understanding and improvement. Basically two very distinct delivery formats have been used: (1) Those that use what&apos;s referred to as an aggregator, an emailed daily newsletter, called &quot;The Daily&quot; that captures contributions from tutors and participants mainly from their blogs: Format A; and (2) Those where all events go through a &quot;centralizing&quot; web page or wiki and discussions happen with the use of a mailing list, in most cases using Google Groups: Format B. In this paper we study in detail representative courses. From their comparison we establish that connectivist MOOCs delivered with formats A and B share many common features but that their differences are such that the learner&apos;s experience and the outcome of the courses are very different depending on the format used.

In these environments teacher and student scaffolds for discussion are essential to promote interaction. One of these scaffolds can be the feedback. Research on feedback processes has predominantly focused on feedback design rather than on how students utilize feedback to improve learning. This methodological model fills this gap contributing to analyse the implementation of the feedback processes while students discuss collaboratively in a specific case of writing assignments. A review of different methodological models was carried out to define a framework adjusted to the analysis of the relationship of written and asynchronous group interaction, and students' activity and changes incorporated into the final text. The model proposed includes the following dimensions: 1) student participation 2) nature of student learning and 3) quality of student learning. The main contribution of this article is to present the methodological model and also to ascertain the model's operativity regarding how students incorporate such feedback into their essays.

The IT field has also been introduced in the field of governance called &quot;E Governance&quot;. This IT based E governance has also been introduced in the field of education. The implementation of e governance in education has led to new broader innovations. E governance has enabled universities to expand their current geographical reach, to interact to prospective students all around the world and to establish themselves as global education providers. This paper examines the need for implementation of e governance in education sector and its possible advantages. The paper also proposes a framework to measure the success of an e governance initiative in an educational organisation. The aim of this paper is to examine the nature of change in Education with respect to the introduction and growth of IT based e governance. (Contains 1 table.)",

The implementation has been performed with 4 teachers and 59 students in 10th grade in an Anatolian High School in Trabzon. Many institutions and organizations in the world approach seriously to distance education besides traditional education. It is inevitable to use the distance education in teaching the problem solving skills in this different dimension of the education. In the studies in Turkey and abroad in the field of mathematics teaching, problem solving skills are generally stated not to be at the desired level and often expressed to have difficulty in teaching. For this reason, difficulties of the students in problem solving have initially been evaluated and the system has been prepared utilizing artificial intelligence algorithms according to the obtained results. In the evaluation of the findings obtained from the application, it has been concluded that the system is responsive to the needs of the students and is successful in general, but that conceptual changes should be made in order that students adapt to the system quickly.

The suggested model is guided by learning principles of cognitivism, constructivism, and connectivism learning theories in order to help online learners to build and acquire meaningful knowledge and experiences. The proposed model consists of four dynamic dimensions: (1) Cognitive presence activities; (2) Psychological presence activities; (3) Social presence activities; and (4) Mental presence activities. Cognitive presence activities refer to learner&apos;s ability to emerge a cognitive vision regarding the content of learning. The cognitive vision will be the starting point to construct meaningful understanding. Psychological presence activities refer to the learner&apos;s ability to construct self awareness and trustworthiness. It will work as psychological schema to decrease the load of learning at distance. Social presence activities refer to the learner&apos;s ability to share knowledge with others in a way to construct a community of practice and assure global understanding of learning. Finally, mental presence activities refer to learners&apos; ability to construct mental models that represent knowledge creation. It will help learners to make learning outcomes and experiences transferable. Applying the proposed model will improve the process of developing e-based activities throughout a set of adaptive and dynamic frameworks and guidelines to meet online learners&apos; cognitive, psychological, social and mental presence.

        "description":"Aside from &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the current age, technology enhanced language learning is still in its infancy for the less commonly taught languages. Hacettepe TOMER has been teaching Turkish as a foreign/second language to the exchange students for several years though; technology related expectations of the language learners have never been precisely determined. The current study, as an action research of which the institution would benefit from, aimed to explore the language learners' technology related expectations. The sample of the study is 17 foreigner students attending Turkish as a second language programs with different native languages. The data were gathered through a questionnaire form developed by the researchers and a thorough literature review. The results revealed that HUTOMER should enhance their technologic facilities and improve the quality of the language education provided at the institution because participants do expect more multimedia resources during their language education. Suggestions were made for further research. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"If a few decades ago, &quot;the education received in school could be in most of the cases enough to go with for the rest of one&apos;s entire life,&quot; today the situation has changed dramatically. The individual has to be prepared for a new type of life and training, namely lifelong learning. The individual&apos;s survival in society could depend on his capacity to learn, to re-qualify, to forget what he once learned and to train for the future in an entirely different manner. Within this context, e-learning and distance education can be viable alternatives for the necessary and imperative adaptation process. Modern man&apos;s education has to go beyond the stage of level oriented education (limited in terms of trainee number and training duration) and advance towards continuous education, which is able to train the individual irrespective of his location and with no limitations in terms of time. The passage towards the information society involves mutations in the object of the activities, mainly in terms of selecting, storing, preserving, managing and protecting information. Against this extremely fluctuant background, a relevant question rises: is the adult capable of coping, both individually and socially, with the challenge of e-learning? (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Social networks and mobile technologies are transforming learning ecology. In this changing learning environment, we find a variety of new learner needs. The aim of this study is to investigate how to provide scaffolding to the learners in connectivist mobile learning environment: (1) to learn in a networked environment; (2) to manage their networked learning process; (3) to interact in a networked society; and (4) to use the tools belonging to the network society. The researcher described how Vygotsky's &quot;scaffolding&quot; concept, Berge's &quot;learner support&quot; strategies, and Siemens' &quot;connectivism&quot; approach can be used together to satisfy mobile learners' needs. A connectivist mobile learning environment was designed for the research, and the research was executed as a mixed-method study. Data collection tools were Facebook wall entries, personal messages, chat records; Twitter, Diigo, blog entries; emails, mobile learning management system statistics, perceived learning survey and demographic information survey. Results showed that there were four major aspects of scaffolding in connectivist mobile learning environment as type of it, provider of it, and timing of it and strategies of it. Participants preferred mostly social scaffolding, and then preferred respectively, managerial, instructional and technical scaffolding. Social scaffolding was mostly provided by peers, and managerial scaffolding was mostly provided by instructor. Use of mobile devices increased the learner motivation and interest. Some participants stated that learning was more permanent by using mobile technologies. Social networks and mobile technologies made it easier to manage the learning process and expressed a positive impact on perceived learning. (Contains 4 figures and 7 tables.)",

Its purpose is to uncover students' perception about the platform used by International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) which is the Learning Management System (LMS). LMS is a vital instructional medium especially for the varsity distant learners. Michael Moore's &quot;Theory of Transactional Distance&quot; is used as the guiding framework to gain insights on learning and interactions in this e-learning setting. Teacher-student interactions are analyzed for better understanding of the phenomena under study. The findings indicate that in terms of usability LMS is perceived as a good platform to acquire information on content and to receive feedback from instructors. However, IIUM learners hope for more interactivity where learners can communicate amongst themselves beside engaging with the instructor-learner-content interactions that they currently experience via the system. This study aspires to provide insights on the significance of interactions from distance learners' perception. (Contains 3 figures.)",

        "description":"It might be said that attitudes impact success directly in web-based teaching and timely and appropriate fulfillment of learners' expectations bear utmost significance for their success. From this perspective a properly designed web supported teaching application can provide positive contribution as well to learners' attitudes towards web supported teaching and internet. Based on this premise, the objective of present research is to explore the effects of different interaction types in web-based teaching setting on the attitudes of learners towards web-based teaching and internet. An experimental pattern with pretest-posttest control group was used in the study. Study group of research consists of 77 students. Research data have been compiled via Attitude towards Internet Scale (alpha = 0,77) and Attitude towards Web-based Learning Scale (alpha = 0,86). In one of the experimental groups, synchronous web-based training interaction and in the other group asynchronous web-based training interaction and in the control group learner-content only interaction has been provided. In data analysis; standard deviation, arithmetical means, one-way variance analysis and LSD tests have been employed. As a result: Web-based training applications with synchronous interaction, compared to web-based training application with learner-content only interaction, have significantly higher contribution on learners' attitudes towards web-based teaching. In Web-based teaching settings different types of interaction have no effect on learners' attitudes towards internet which may be attributed to the fact that learners' attitudes towards internet were already in quite high levels prior to the procedure.

In 1873, Anna Eliot Ticknor founded the Society to Encourage Studies at Home. Ticknor's Society established one of America's first correspondence schools, a distance learning option conducted through the mail. This Society was aimed at the education of women and enrolled more than seven thousand women. Education by mail was a quality approach to provide education for all because it allowed universities to access an infinite number of potential students. Today there are institutions that offer only online courses. At the same time, brick and mortar or traditional institutions offer online courses in addition to their face-to-face courses. A review of the literature suggests that as indicated by enrollment figures, the number of students taking online courses is growing and continued growth can be expected in the future.",

This article describes the course design, which was grounded in design thinking, and provides an overview of the pilot implementation of the course. The course achieved its goals to a great extent in that learners felt that they were beginning to help build a better college community by sharing stories of their learning experience and their insights about the essential question they chose with other students and with other teachers. The course also helped the students discover the use of English as they found ways to reach out to the broader college community and held meaningful conversations with teachers, librarians, managers, and staff from different departments and other students. The course transformed the teacher/researcher into an observer of learning and a guide, thus flipping the classroom and allowing the learners to take responsibility and steer their own learning experiences. Further development is needed in the areas of CBL assessment rubric development in English Language Teaching (ELT) and the analysis of student generated content through iPad applications.

This study is descriptive in nature. Survey study design was implemented to examine the relationships among variables. The study was implemented at Afyon Kocatepe University Faculty of Education in Turkey. The study group consists of 114 students from different departments including primary school education, social studies education and preschool education. 84 (73.7%) were females and 30 (26.3%) were males. Ages of the group ranged between 18 and 28 with a mean of 19.42 (SD: 1.30). In Afyon Kocatepe University some courses named &quot;Computer II&quot; and &quot;Principles of Ataturk and the History of Revolution&quot; are presented by using computer based online distance education. We selected &quot;Computer II&quot; as data collection medium. The course was introduced to students for one semester. Online self-regulated learning scale ([alpha]=0.948) and attitude scale towards distance learning ([alpha]=0.835) are used as data instruments. Students' final grades were taken into account as achievement scores to examine the relationship between achievement attitude and self-regulated learning. Pearson's correlation coefficient, multiple regression analysis, independent samples t-test and one-way ANOVA are conducted to analyze collected data. The results showed that online self-regulated learning strategies and attitude towards distance education accounted for 15% of variation of students' achievement. Attitude made a significant contribution to the prediction of achievement while the sub factors of self-regulated learning did not make a significant contribution to achievement.

In particular, we investigate how their perceptions of digital games have evolved through the process of designing and building their own educational games. We are also concerned with the knowledge and reasoning skills that preservice teachers incorporate into their games. Further, we investigate the 21st century skills involved in the game design and implementation process. In this case study, the participants are first-year students at a university in Western Canada enrolled in a secondary mathematics methods course. A total of 21 preservice teachers (10 males and 11 females) in the class participated, ranging from ages 20 to 45 years old. We collected three sets of data: open-ended pre- and post-surveys, games created by preservice teachers, and follow-up interviews with selected participants. The analysis of the data shows that the game-building experience impacted preservice teachers' perceptions related to challenges, problems solving, and attitudes toward gaming and design. Further, their games demonstrated these preservice teachers' fair understanding of pedagogical and cognitive components. (Contains 7 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"This study examined the construct validity of the Survey of Preservice Teachers' Knowledge of Teaching and Technology through an exploratory factor analysis using responses from 365 preservice teachers enrolled in an educational technology course in the United States. The participants were completing methods courses and field experience concurrent to the educational technology course, allowing them to contextualize the content they learned during the semester. The survey, grounded in the framework of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), is designed to measure seven domains associated with technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge. Although the influence of the TPACK framework on teacher education programs continues to grow, research indicates the need for clearer distinctions between the domains. Results from this study revealed that participants did not always make conceptual distinctions between the TPACK domains. Specifically, factors were congruent across only technological knowledge (TK) and content knowledge (CK) and not congruent across pedagogical knowledge (PK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), technological content knowledge (TCK), and TPACK. Additionally, PK and PCK loaded together, indicating the participants did not distinguish PK from PCK. Overall, this study confirms the need to provide more clarity about the TPACK framework and to revisit survey instruments built directly around the framework. (Contains 6 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"State frameworks and national standards are explicit about the mathematics content that students must master at each grade level. Although the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act mandate that students who are deaf or hard of hearing and communicate in sign language have access to this content, evidence suggests that it remains out of reach for many in this group. The purpose of the implementation research described in this article was to examine use of a Signing Math Dictionary (SMD) to help students who are members of this population access the vocabulary required to master the mathematics content that underlies the topics they are studying. The study included eight separate classes and a total of 39 participants--8 teachers and 31 students--representing grades 4-8. The research design incorporated a descriptive case study methodology that involved observing (a) teaching mathematics without the SMD, (b) preparing students to use the SMD, (c) teaching mathematics with the SMD. The results suggest that, when used in actual classroom settings, the SMD may be a resource that supplements effective teaching and learning of the vocabulary of mathematics. However, further research is needed to study its use by both experienced and inexperienced teachers working with students in schools for the deaf and in inclusion settings, across math topics and grades.

        "description":"This study examined the technology use of beginning secondary science teachers and explored factors facilitating or inhibiting their use of technology. The researchers collected and analyzed interviews and observational data from 95 teachers over a 5-year period. The results show that teachers used PowerPoint the most and other software the least over time. This pattern was consistent over the 5 years of observation, increasing in frequency of usage only slightly each year. The use of PowerPoint was statistically significant when compared to the use of lecture and procedural laboratories. One-way ANOVAs yielded several statistically significant results, in that induction treatments, teacher's gender, and SES populations were significantly correlated to the use of technology. This study urges that the value of technology used in science classrooms should be redefined to enhance inquiry-based science teaching and learning. (Contains 3 tables.)",

The authors accomplish this by identifying common themes and knowledge domains in 15 reports, books, and articles that describe the kinds of knowledge that researchers state are integral and important for success in the 21st century. The authors argue that seemingly disparate frameworks converge on three types of knowledge, as necessary for the 21st century: foundational, meta, and humanistic. Although 21st century frameworks are thought to advocate new types of knowledge, little has actually changed in the new century with respect to the overall goals of education. Despite this sense of continuity, significant changes related to how technologies change all three types of knowledge need to be conveyed. The article ends with specific conclusions and recommendations for teacher education. (Contains 1 figure and 10 tables.)",

        "description":"This article presents the sociometric analysis of the interactions in a forum of a social network created for the professional development of Portuguese-speaking teachers. The main goal of the forum, which was titled Stricto Sensu, was to discuss the educational value of programmes that joined the distance learning model in Brazil. The empirical study focused on the sociometric analysis of the social interactions that take place in asynchronous online environments. This approach, according to literature, allows for new means to observe, analyse, and interpret the reality of a new social paradigm. This type of analysis tries to understand the relationship established between the different actors, seeking to verify if the roles they play in both the access to information and the construction of shared knowledge. The data collected allow the researchers to deduce that the indicators used in the analysis are important for understanding and intervening in the dynamics and functioning of the network to propose improvements in its structure and organisation. In the specific case of the aforementioned discussion forum, the results of the sociometric analysis of the perceived interactions were not surprising, considering that the nature of the topic did not demand deep reflection to contribute to the debate.

        "description":"Distance online learning has been regarded as a useful learning method, especially when we faced the big flood crisis in Thailand. To solve the lack of classrooms, our university administrators decided to implement WebEx system as an alternative to continue teaching. And, there were some relevant aspects that we needed to consider. Therefore, this study investigated students' attitude toward WebEx system. It aimed to examine students' attitudes toward using WebEx for an online English class, compare students' attitudes toward WebEx system with their background and investigate the relationship between students' computer aptitude and their attitudes towards WebEx system. The samples were 211 undergraduate students enrolled in Fundamental English course. The instrument in this study was a questionnaire. Results indicated that the levels of computer aptitude and attitudes towards WebEx system in general were moderate. There were no statistically significant differences at 0.05 level found in students' attitudes toward WebEx system as classified by gender, computer ownership, and monthly allowance. As hypothesised, there was a positive relationship between students' computer aptitude and their attitudes toward WebEx at 0.01 levels. Students with high computer aptitude were found to have more positive attitudes toward WebEx system than those with low computer aptitude. The research was done during the flood crisis.\nThus, it is interesting to find out whether an English online class through WebEx system will be more accepted by users in the future, especially in a normal circumstance after the flood crisis. Nevertheless, the results of this study will give some ideas to institutions that plan to use online learning technologies. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Online teaching has long been a key area of interest recently in every field of education as well as English language teaching. Numerous hardware tools, such as, mp3 players, mobile devices, and so on; and software applications, such as, podcasts, wikis, learning management systems, and so on, have been used in distance and online instruction and they have proved to be useful in facilitating learning individually (Finger, Sun, &amp; Jamieson-Proctor, 2010). Learning management systems (LMS) provide a virtual environment and various tools to support learning. The current institution where the researchers work deliver two 2-credit online English courses for a specific group of learners at a state university in south-eastern Turkey by using Modular Object Oriented Distance Learning Environment (MOODLE). Moodle is an open code LMS which provides teachers and course developers with numerous online tools to enhance distance learning/teaching environment. The course has both a synchronous and asynchronous instruction. Synchronous and asynchronous instructions are associated with the delivery of content in campus-based environments; however, their role differs in off the campus environments as they solve the problems of distance learners. Universities, colleges, and other education institutions are integrating online learning into every aspect of higher education. Many teachers and faculty members at higher education institutions who already run face-to-face courses have a website to post lecture notes or slide presentations as well as other course material. There is no doubt that these are effective strategies to expand teaching efforts. Still, there are other educators who design and teach totally online classes. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate learners' attitudes towards these online language courses, and there are two objectives of this research. The first one is to discover learners' attitudes towards the online English course; and the second purpose is to evaluate and correlate learners' attitudes with their success determined with their end-of-the-year grades. For the unique purpose of this study, an Online Language Learning Attitude Test (OLLAT) has been constructed and distributed to about 7000 learners who were invited to complete this task online. 3,516 of these learners took the OLLAT voluntarily and 1,783 were successfully completed the test and were included in this study. The findings showed that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between learners' OLLAT scores and their course success. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Specifically, the study explored on how HYCU uses ICT in DE and the challenges that they encounter in the course of using ICT in DE. Both structured and unstructured interviews were used for data collection. Findings showed that HYCU use various ICTs such as Learning Management System and online interaction assessment methods to enhance DE. Challenges such as difficulties in meeting online teaching and learning requirements and lack of human and material resource to undertake DE courses were identified to constrain effective use of ICTs in DE at HYCU. It is recommended that IAE should consider contextualization of the Learning Management System that is currently used at HYCU when establishing online study programme to ensure quality DE in the Institute.",

        "description":"The constructivist form of learning creates such an environment where the learners are not only active but they become actors' i.e members and contributors of the social and information space without taking into consideration the geographic boundaries. Such an innovative form of distance education was initiated in India in the year 2007 and it was meant to be offered as cross-border tele-education to the states of the African Union. The objective was two-fold: first to benefit the disadvantaged African learners who missed out opportunities to attend regular universities and earn degrees or seek employment. Secondly it was to promote the educational service of India under the umbrella of GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services) which was operational since 1996. Initiatives were taken by the Government of India and the African Union to boost the usage of the available resources in IT, medical sciences etc. for the growth of the people of the African countries so that they could compete with the rest of the world. African learners can access higher education with the usage of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) which is considered to be the demand of the coming generation. The tele-education concept employs sophisticated technology, state of the art studio and the best of the class facility. The mode of this tele-education is made feasible through a virtual platform where education is imparted through a two way audio and two way video communications spreading over multiple countries of Africa in a single session. This paper is in attempt to describe this innovative form of virtual education and look into its impact on the African learning community. The general feedback is that the students have been greatly benefitted and the demand for such form of education has also increased multi fold with the students' enrolment having increased manifold, especially for the management programme.

        "description":"In recent times Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been able to make inroads into the ways information is disseminated among those involved in direct farming and farming related enterprises. This paper arose from a two-year study of the KissanKerala, the e-learning project underway in Kerala, a small state in India. It is more conspicuous when we learn that the KissanKerala project is able to disseminate agricultural information also among digital immigrants. Since 2003, the KissanKerala has been providing advisory services to the farming community in Kerala using a combination of technologies. Salient features of the project are discussed. Noteworthy are its interactive web portal and the online agri-video channel that uses the video sharing platform of YouTube. In this paper, we look at the e-learning strategies adopted; virtual learning environments created and also discuss participative tools used for communication. We have also made an impact-study of the project with a large number of beneficiaries. We learn that the Kissan Kerala is one of the most successful learning projects undertaken in distance mode in India. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "author":["Sarigoz, Iskender Hakki"],
        "description":"Foreign language teacher education requires microteaching practices carried out by teacher trainees for learning and assessment purposes. During microteachings, teacher trainees operate many teaching skills concurrently. Interlanguage compatible teacher-talk in the target language is essential for the production of student talk at elementary and intermediate levels in English language teaching (ELT). It is a demanding task for ELT trainees to adjust the language level according to the given interlanguage level. Nevertheless, during the microteaching sessions observed by the author and other teacher trainers attributed whose impressions are disclosed below, critical unintended flaws in teacher-talk adjustment in reference to the predetermined interlanguage levels were observed. Such a mismatch causes critical problems in the comprehension of the lesson. The recognition and discussion of the matter and the search for ways of teaching at the appropriate level play a big part in foreign language teacher education. In the first part of the study, the pre-service teaching performance from this perspective is being explored in a two-part questionnaire administered subsequent to language-skills microteachings carried out by the trainees attending the third year of college with maximum attention on language level adjustment. A parallel questionnaire was administered to the teacher trainers who observed and evaluated similar microteachings. The second part of the study argues the skill of language level adjustment from the perspective of distant foreign language teacher training. It suggests a set of pre, while, and, post microteaching adjustment strategies primarily for distance training.",

Research in virtual worlds on collaborative learners is gradually emerging and will gain in significance, particularly in online and distance education environments. It will be argued that the design and functionality of virtual worlds provides a platform for collaboration, particularly for learners that have grown up with digitalized learning environments and may have developed a preference for them. The paper starts with a clarification of terms, a description of the various categories and a chronological overview of the emergence and development of these environments. The familiarisation with the subject matter continues through a discussion of the significance, opportunities and barriers that this medium offers and is followed by an examination of learners&apos; characteristics and their implications for teaching and learning in virtual worlds. Drawing on recent examples of virtual worlds in education and some current statistics, the paper strives to meet the continuing education needs of practitioners and educator using virtual worlds. It concludes with an examination of the challenges and perspectives on collaborative learning in these environments and the trends in virtual worlds that impact the delivery of student learning.",

To deal with the resistance effectively university administrators must understand the nature and causes of resistance to change. Only by dealing effectively with resistance to change can organizational change be implemented successfully. This paper explores organizational change and the challenge it poses for universities. Because universities are slow to change due to maintaining a balance of tradition and change successful implementation of change will continue to be a challenge both now and in the future. The challenge of change is real but the task is not impossible. Historically, universities have met the challenges that faced them; they must be prepared to confront this challenge too.",

        "description":"This study explores the discourse generated by English as a foreign language (EFL) learners using synchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC) as an approach to help English language learners to create social interaction in the classroom. It investigates the impact of synchronous CMC mode on the quantity of total words, lexical range and discourse functions of EFL learners' writing from different genders (males vs. females). Thirty-two intermediate EFL students discussed four topics in four CMC sessions. The findings reveal that gender plays a major role in shaping the quantity of discourse (total words), lexical range (variety), and linguistic output (i.e., the quantity and type of discourse functions) the participants' generated using synchronous CMC mode. Generally, the female participants produced more words, complex lexical range and output discourse functions than males in CMC setting. In addition, the study showed that the participants produced discourse functions shaped by the particularities of local social arrangements. Users found opportunities in the virtual world of CMC which enable them to blind their identities, so people in subordinate conditions such as females in certain conservative societies, EFL learners, and shy students may find CMC useful for fostering their communicative competence.

Scholars and practitioners of this emerging field are called to address this gap with related and applied scholarship and programming in the &quot;global north.&quot; Thus, the purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate the perceived impact of the U.S.-based Street Soccer USA Cup on its homeless participants and identify the event&apos;s structures and processes that can facilitate  positive outcomes. Data collection consisted of conducting focus group interviews with 11 players and six coaches, and engaging in direct observations. Data were analyzed through the process of open, axial, and selective coding. Results indicated positive perceived impact on participants through building a sense of community, creating hope, cultivating an outward focus, fostering goal achievement, and enhancing personal development. The Cup was effective in achieving positive impact through creating a celebratory and festive space for social interaction, and by creating an inclusive climate where achievement was celebrated. Findings derived from this research provide intriguing foundations for further research and development of the SFD field.",

Results from the analyses indicated that the twelve-factor ATM model fit the data from collegiate athletic events well, explaining the various impact factors that lead to purchase intention of athletic team merchandise among sports consumers. Based on values theory, identity theory, attitude theory, and satisfaction theory that influence product consumption, this study suggests that consumer intentions to purchase athletic team merchandise are significantly associated with personal values, team identification, brand/product attitude, product attributes, expectancy, previous purchase, and satisfaction. Given the finding that team identification had marginal impact on attitude toward brand and/or product in general, it is suggested that sport marketers should select appropriate brands for the products that represent their team or athletic department. Fitness of brand image may suggest an alternative explanation for future studies. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Research studies have found that an integral part of being a tenure-track faculty member is the relationship between the higher education institution and individual faculty members (Mawdsley, 1999). Tenure-track positions are competitive spaces that demand and expect assistant professors to excel in publishing, teaching, and scholarly activity. The expectations and the daunting demands often lead the faculty member to feel isolated and to fear not getting promoted or tenured. Mentoring allows new faculty members to assuage feelings of isolation and emotional trauma (Lang, 2002). Mentoring can also help in the promotion and tenure process; oftentimes faculty members who are not awarded tenure claim that they were insufficiently mentored (Fish, 2002). This article explores the experiences of two Latina first-year tenure-track faculty who, while navigating and negotiating their new roles as assistant professors, joined a support group, Research for the Educational Advancement of Latinas (REAL). Further, the article chronicles and reflects on the challenges faced by these two Latinas during their first-year as assistant professors at a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Moreover, this article examines the role of REAL in their professional development and motivation to stay in the academy as Latina faculty working in a research-oriented HSI.",

        "description":"This special issue of the &quot;Journal of Educational Foundations&quot; explores the struggles faced by Latina faculty. These struggles became evident through an examination of Latina faculty members at a specific Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). The essays in this special issue examine the experiences and trajectory of several Latina faculty members during their time in the academy. A great deal of research has been conducted on the need to support Latina/o faculty during the early years of their career (Delgado Bernal &amp; Villalpando, 2002; Gonzales, 2013; Murakami-Ramalho, Nunez, &amp; Cuero, 2010; Nieman, 1999; Turner, Gonzalez, &amp; Wood, 2008; Turner, Gonzalez, &amp; Wong, 2011), but few have looked at programs that have been created to specifically mentor Latina faculty. In the quest to illuminate the types of programs that work to support Latina faculty in academia, this special issue examines the role of an organization called the Research for the Educational Advancement of Latinas (REAL). This university-wide collaborative among junior and senior female professors was established to aid in the development and retention of new tenure-track professors in academia. Additionally, this special issue reflects on the impact that collaborating with REAL had, not only on its members' academic trajectory, but also on their personal lives as well. This issue chronicles the experiences of Latina professors with the hope that other faculty members of color (who might be engaged in similar struggles) may discover that they are not alone and that collectives can be created to provide support systems to help navigate their way in the academy. Furthermore, this special issue explores how creating and working with support groups such as REAL can serve as a platform for building community and avoiding the academic, social, and emotional isolation that is often experienced by Latinas in tenure-track positions. Finally, it explores the importance of the experiences and &quot;consejos&quot; (words of wisdom/advice) of Latina and faculty of color who &quot;have been there, and done that&quot; in the development and retention of new Latina faculty in academia.",

        "description":"An increasing worldwide concern about a decline in the quality of the motor ability of children was the motivation for this exploratory comparative study. It involves a comparison of the motor ability of children aged 8 and 9 years from Hamburg (n = 774), Melbourne (n = 141) and Cape Town (n = 81). Since each of these global cities represents a typically culturally diverse modern center of population, data were also tentatively analyzed according to ethno-cultural background, as a potential contributing variable to better understand the results of studies such as these. The children's motor abilities were tested by five items from the &quot;Allgemeiner Sportmotorischer Test fur Kinder&quot; or AST 6-11 (Bos, Opper, Woll, Liebisch, Breithecker, &amp; Kremer, 2001). Results were analyzed in terms of city and sex by means of a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). A composite motor profile was also constructed using all five items. This was then used in a further comparison of major ethno-cultural groups within each of the three cities. Differences in motor ability were evident between the children of the three cities. The children from Hamburg demonstrated the highest levels of performance overall and those of Melbourne the lowest. Both sex and ethno-cultural background were significant mediating variables in all contexts. Boys scored higher than girls on the AST 6-11 at all locations. For children of a European\nbackground in both Hamburg and Melbourne, a higher performance was identified when compared with their same city peers of Asian origins. The best performing cultural group overall were the Black African (Xhosa) children of Cape Town. The limitations of the study were identified and some suggestions for future comparative studies of motor ability were made. (Contains 8 tables and 2 figures.)",

Participants (n = 107) included women athletes who were members of the following sport federations: soccer, volleyball, basketball, table tennis, and track and field. The athletes were asked to\ncomplete the following surveys: 1) Sport Motivation Scale, 2) the Perceived Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire-2, 3) the Parent-Initiated Motivational Climate Questionnaire, and, 4) the Sport Commitment Model Scale. T-test and multiple regression analysis were utilized between the variables in the study as well as descriptive statistics. The results indicated women athletes in Palestine reported more intrinsic motivation to play sport\nthan extrinsic motivation. Also, motivational climate created by the coach was the only factor to predict women's motivation to play their sport. Finally, women athletes in Palestine are highly committed to their sport.

Two hundred and fifty-six coaches participated in this study with comparisons drawn by gender, highest level of participation, formal coaching training, years of experience, and officiating experience. Participants completed a 25-statement survey. The survey consisted of 25 gamesmanship statements that asked subjects to indicate if an action was clearly acceptable (1), acceptable (2), unacceptable (3), or clearly unacceptable (4). Chronbach's Alpha measure (a=0.938) indicated a high consistency and reliability for the statements on the survey instrument. A crosstabs analysis provided Pearson Chi-Square or Fischer Exact tests to identify statistical significance within the variables. For all of the statements, a majority of respondents identified the statements as either unacceptable or clearly unacceptable. In addition, there were very few significant differences based on gender, highest level of participation, years\nof coaching experience, formal coaching education, or officiating experience.

Components of an effective worksite health program include stress management, exercise and nutrition and/or weight management classes or counseling. Few studies have documented correlates of health behaviors in school-based employees. A multi-component survey was used to examine relationships among stress, physical activity and specific food choices among employees in a southeastern\nLouisiana school district. Significant differences were found in coping styles by gender and employee status. Findings also indicated that employees who selected healthful foods were more likely to use task-oriented coping, considered an effective coping style. Further those employees who engaged in vigorous physical activity on a regular basis reported less perceived stress as well as more effective coping strategies. Since these behaviors appear to\nbe interrelated, those conducting health promotion programs may consider a multi-dimensional approach when planning programs for employees. Intervention studies in a school-based population are needed to examine specific effects of different coping styles and healthy behaviors on employee productivity. (Contains 5 tables.)",

        "description":"This article is a report of the findings from a sample of approximately 2,700 students and 1,000 faculty in the first 50 Teacher Education Accreditation\tCouncil (TEAC)-accredited programs for which the online surveys were used. The sample represents nearly all the full-time faculty members surveyed and approximately 30% of the students. On the common questions in the surveys, the findings from all the cooperating teachers' surveys are indistinguishable from those of the sample (Murray, 2011b). The student sample also is representative of all those surveyed, as their grade point averages (GPAs) were insignificantly different from the GPAs of those reported by the programs about all of their students (as verified by the TEAC auditors on site (Murray, 2010). The results show that students and faculty rated all aspects of their programs in the more than adequate to excellent range (4.00-5.00). These results contrast with those of the prevailing narratives that teacher education is broken and that today's new teachers are unprepared for their roles. (Contains 3 tables.)",

This new Draw-a-Teacher Checklist instrument was modeled after the Draw-a-Science-Teacher-Test Checklist (DASTT-C) developed by Thomas, Pedersen, and Finson (2001). A scoring checklist was created using 150 pictures drawn by the participants. The data showed that the checklist did accurately measure the content of the drawing on the continuum from teacher-centered to student-centered. In addition, the study found that the majority of the undergraduate and graduate participants drew teacher-centered pictures while the interns, who were undergraduate students working in their first semester of student teaching, recognized the importance of teaching with a more balanced approach.

This article adds to the literature on learning environments in mathematics by presenting a case study of one fifth-grade mathematics teacher and her classroom through the lens of a hybrid space. The framework developed in Barton and Tan's (2009) work is applied to a mathematics classroom to investigate the use of funds of knowledge and Discourses. The researchers conclude that this teacher's instructional practices allowed for the creation of a hybrid space in her classroom. Evidence from this case study found that two constructs were present in the classroom (a) family funds of knowledge and Discourse, and (b) peer funds of knowledge and Discourse. Results from this study could help teachers and researchers better understand how to create a meaningful learning environment for students in the context of a mathematics classroom.",

A sample consisting of 193 pre-service secondary teachers enrolled in secondary education courses at an Australian university were surveyed to determine their attitudes towards inclusive education, with a particular focus on attitudinal changes across the years of study. Results indicated that pre-service secondary teachers held positive attitudes towards inclusive\neducation; however there was a significant decline in positive attitudes through the years of study. Pre-service secondary teachers enrolled in postgraduate programs were more inclusive than those enrolled in undergraduate courses. Attitudes towards training and perceived competence were less positive than other attitude scales for all participants, suggesting a concern regarding training effectiveness. Replication of the study is recommended across additional Australian and international universities to determine differences in training content and experiences which may impact on attitudes towards training and perceived competence.

In Western countries we know that between 25% and 40% of beginning teachers are likely to leave the teaching profession in the first 5 years (Ewing &amp; Smith, 2003; Day &amp; Gu, 2010). Clearly, there is a need to better understand the experiences of early career teachers and to investigate, in new ways, how the problem of teacher attrition can be addressed. This paper is based on a collaborative qualitative\nresearch project funded by the Australian Research Council that aimed to investigate the dynamic and complex interplay among individual, relational and contextual conditions that operate over time to promote early career teacher resilience. The methodology for the study was a critical enquiry. The data for the study came from interviews with 60 beginning teachers and their\nprincipals. Five main &quot;Conditions for Resilience&quot; emerged from the analysis: relationships; school culture; teacher identity; teachers' work; and policies and practices (Johnson, Down, Le Cornu, Peters, Sullivan, Pearce &amp; Hunter, 2010). This article focuses on the first theme--relationships. It illuminates the role that sustainable and mutually sustaining relationships play in the development of early career teachers. Jordan's (2006) model of relational resilience--with its characteristics of mutuality, empowerment and the development of courage--is used as a conceptual framework for discussing the insights from the study.",

        "description":"Early career teaching is a difficult phase to navigate with many newly qualified teachers choosing to leave the profession within the first few years. The professional identities of these and other teachers are shaped by challenging and unanticipated experiences. The schools where this teaching takes place also have profound influence on these teachers' individual responses to their new roles. This paper reports on how the contexts and professional environments of fourteen early career teachers contributed to the establishment of three distinct trajectories of teacher identity: the\nemergent, tenuous and distressed. An examination of their developing\nidentities revealed the influential experiences and individual responses that were connected to how the novice teachers understood and explained themselves with and through influential others. These descriptions and representations of themselves shaped their future actions and evolving beliefs. These were then implicated in their identity trajectories, which in turn contributed to their professional traction or early exit from the profession. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Nonetheless, teachers with less math background had higher levels of teacher self-efficacy although this gap was closed by the last measurement.

In this study, scores from written instruments used to assess students' fractions schemes and operations were examined for validity and reliability. Scores from the written assessments were correlated with scores from clinical interviews of 33 sixth graders. Results suggest that the written instruments provide reliable and valid measures for assessing the partitive unit fraction scheme and the splitting operation. However, there is no such evidence regarding the partitive fraction scheme. Implications for teachers and researchers are considered, and possible explanations for the scores from the written assessments related to the partitive fraction scheme are discussed.

        "description":"The purpose of this article is to examine the potential risks of bringing social networking sites (SNS) into the classroom through the lens of Moor's (1999) just-consequentialist theory. Moor compares the setting of ethical policies in the fast-changing world of technology to a sailor trying to set a course while sailing. His analogy could not be more appropriate for educators' attempts to cope with the question of online social networking in schools. Educators must weigh the potential advantages of using SNSs in educational settings against the risks that such inclusion would entail. If the proper precautions are not taken, student safety, privacy, and psychological well-being are at risk. Additionally, administrators risk school reputation and legal liability. Teacher education programs must accept the responsibility of ensuring that teachers enter their classrooms with an understanding of both the transformative capabilities of new technologies and the risks that they may present. By highlighting the advantages of education-specific platforms in terms of controlling potential risks, teacher educators will likely facilitate increased teacher competence and confidence in incorporating the technology that is vital for student learning in the 21st century.",

Pre-service teachers in education foundations classes responded to a survey in which they marked whether they perceived that the actions of an educator in evaluation scenario were ethical or unethical. Respondents had high agreement on the ethicality of 53% of the scenarios and had high disagreement on 17% of the scenarios. In a separate analysis, the results of chi-square tests that compared the responses of elementary and middle/secondary program pre-service teachers found significantly different responses on the ethicality of 17% of the scenarios. A higher percentage of elementary pre-service teachers deemed a scenario as ethical than did pre-service teachers in the middle/secondary group. The survey instrument served as both a data collection tool and a catalyst for learning about and teaching ethicality. The findings suggest the need for teacher preparation programs to explicitly address ethical conduct with pre-service teachers, including the provision of ongoing discussion and reflection throughout and beyond the programs.

These guidelines are: (1) Providing English Language Development (ELD) instruction is better than not providing it; (2) ELD instruction should continue at least until ELs attain advanced English language ability; (3) The likelihood of establishing and sustaining an effective ELD instructional program increases when schools and districts make it a priority; (4) A separate, daily block of time should be devoted to ELD instruction; (5) English learners should be carefully grouped by language proficiency for ELD instruction, but they should not be segregated by language proficiency throughout the rest of the day; (6) ELD instruction should explicitly teach forms of English (e.g., vocabulary, syntax, morphology, functions, and conventions); (7) ELD instruction should emphasize academic language as well as conversational language; (8) ELD instruction should incorporate reading and writing, but should emphasize listening and speaking; (9) ELD instruction should integrate meaning and communication to support explicit teaching of language; (10) ELD instruction should be planned and delivered with specific language objectives in mind; (11) Use of English during ELD instruction should be maximized; the primary language should be used strategically; (12) ELD instruction should include interactive activities among students, but they must be carefully planned and carried out; (13) ELD instruction should provide students with corrective feedback on form. (Based on hypotheses emerging from recent EL research); and (14) Teachers should attend to communication and language-learning strategies and incorporate them into ELD instruction.

Examination of the question ''How do we better prepare teachers'' led to the formation of a university-district-association (teacher union) partnership, which led to a new question: How do the roles of principal and liaison in a Professional Development School affect pre-service and tenured teacher learning? The school-university partnerships' mission was to design a mutually beneficial program of teacher preparation and tenured teacher professional development. Findings determined that there were significant perceived mutual benefits; notable benefits for the school partner appeared in the unexpected roles of tenured teacher, principal, and liaison. The study's finding have implications for the universities that prepare teachers, teaching practitioners, school and district leaders, and even state and national policy makers. (Contains 1 table.)",

Collective discovery methods, syntheses, and validation of ethical dimensions, which produced qualitative and quantitative data, resulted in the construction of a commonly acknowledged framework of ethical standards and ethical practice for educators by both the teaching profession and the public. Based on the data, the author identified four core ethical standards: care, integrity, respect, and trust, with each ethical standard's having an array of associated ethical principles.

Those teachers who reflect on their practice, particularly while they are teaching (what Schon terms reflection-in-action), are best able to do so. It is the intent of this article to investigate the role of teacher reflection in professional practice. A number of activities commonly found in teacher education programs facilitate the development of reflective behavior and include composing journal entries, audio- or videotaping lessons for the purpose of analysis, and interacting with supervisors and mentor teachers. There are, however, certain barriers to reflection related to the personal characteristics of the teacher and to faults in the structure of school systems. Of greatest concern is whether reflective practices result in better teaching and improved educational outcomes. This issue has not yet been resolved and further research is necessary.",

        "author":["Martin, Peter Clyde"],
        "description":"One of the major hurdles in preparing preservice teachers to differentiate instruction has been that they tend not to see much differentiated instruction in actual classrooms (Benjamin, 2002; Tomlinson, 1999). There always may be a contradiction in wanting to promote change in instructional practices while, at the same time, relying on a teacher education concept that is based on modeling by established teachers. The problem is especially obvious in the area of differentiated instruction because the practice is embedded in the contextual factors and dynamics of a classroom (Lawrence-Brown, 2004). As teacher educators, we rely on students to learn how to differentiate instruction through observation, mentoring, trial-and-error, and even differentiation that is inconsistently practiced in the schools where we place them (McBride, 2004). It is an important contradiction to resolve, as there is ample evidence to suggest that differentiating instruction allows us to better address the needs of our students, especially in the context of universal standards (Anderson, 2007; McTighe &amp; Brown, 2005; Subban, 2006). Given the demographic trends in our public schools, our increasingly explicit focus on addressing student diversity, the strict legal mandates to properly serve students considered to have special needs, the ongoing drive toward inclusion, and efforts to hold teachers responsible for the test scores of individual children, the lesson, &quot;mostly, differentiating means ignoring,&quot; is troubling and runs counter to everything that we want our future teachers to learn. While, as teacher educators, we may speak to our students about the need to differentiate, this is not followed up in actual instruction, which is not differentiated in the ways that we propose. Thus, the concern is what we can do to ensure a focus on differentiated instruction in practice without relying entirely on actual classroom settings. This article provides a review of the literature on differentiated instruction and describes interventions that have been implemented in the context of the author's two intensive one-year master's programs that lead to teacher certification in elementary and secondary education.

Research has supported the view that there is an inextricable connection between student outcomes, quality of teaching and teachers, and teacher preparation (Darling-Hammond 2005; Grover 2002). Similarly, theories about students' self efficacy beliefs (e.g. Bandura, 1977; Dweck, 2000) and Institutional Habitus (Bourdieu,1977) have been advanced in relation to students' study experience, motivation and coping mechanisms. Using data from a focus group comprising 30 third year students enrolled in a four year teacher training programme in Jamaica, this paper discusses student-teachers' concerns about their training. The main findings from this small scale exploratory study indicated that student teachers' concerns were about the quality of teaching and teachers, curriculum organisation, content and delivery, and resources.

        "description":"In 2010, the Australian Commonwealth government initiated an $8m project called Teaching Teachers for the Future. The aim of the project was to engage teacher educators in a professional learning network which focused on optimising exemplary use of information and communications technologies in teacher education. By taking part in this network, participants were afforded opportunities to transform their practice through a range of localised initiatives that applied information and communications technologies to the art and science of teaching and learning. One of these initiatives involved reengineering a university mathematics unit targeted at pre-service teachers. Information and communications technologies were\npurposefully embedded using Mishra and Koehler's (2006) Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge model as a conceptual framework. This paper discusses the outcomes of the initiative. Pre-service teachers and staff involved in the unit shared their stories about the changes they had noticed in both their thinking and practice. The results of the initiative were heartening, and it is hoped that the constructs used will translate into other learning areas. (Contains 4 figures and 5 tables.)",

        "description":"This study investigated the relationships between knowledge and efficacy for teaching sustainability in a sample of 266 pre-service primary teachers at a large, metropolitan university in Australia. A survey gathered information about the participant's attitudes and self-efficacy for education for sustainability, along with their perceived and actual knowledge of environmental sustainability issues. The participants typically believed they\nwere confident in their abilities to engage with education for sustainability with self-efficacy increasing with increased levels of perceived knowledge.\nHowever no relationship was found between perceived knowledge and\nactual knowledge which suggests that the participants either do not feel\nconstrained by their lack of knowledge, or are perhaps unaware of their\nactual knowledge of sustainability issues. This lack of relationship may have\nimplications for the development of pedagogical content knowledge with\npre-service teachers potentially developing shallow, tokenistic approaches\nto Education for Sustainability.

Three hundred and fifteen primary school teachers completed a questionnaire exploring their definitions of anxiety and the indications they associated with excessive anxiety in primary school children. Results showed that teachers had an understanding of what anxiety was in general but did not consistently distinguish normal anxiety from excessive anxiety, often defining all anxiety as a negative experience.\nTeachers were able to identify symptoms of excessive anxiety in children by recognizing anxiety-specific and general problem indications. The results provided preliminary evidence that teachers' knowledge of anxiety and anxiety disorders does not appear to be a barrier in preventing children's referrals for mental health treatment.

The successful recruitment and retention of teachers to rural and remote schools Australia-wide has been problematic for all states and territories (Vinson, 2002). Education departments have implemented a number of immersion programs with success (Halsey, 2005) in order to empower new teachers with the cultural and classroom awareness necessary for teaching in Indigenous communities. In 2006, the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Education and Training (DET) implemented the Enhanced Teacher Training (ETT) scholarship program.

This paper reports the difficulties and benefits of a recent inter-university project requiring preservice primary teachers to construct professional digital portfolios using the support of ICT. Challenges with regard to communication and learning were numerous as 34 preservice\nteachers (PSTs) from three universities in NSW (situated in country towns, and in Sydney) worked together as a collaborative learning community. Meeting regularly face-to-face during the 12-month process was not always possible and so ICT resources were employed to facilitate instruction and communication. An action research methodology generated a data set of surveys, observational field notes, and student assessment artefacts. We share the findings in this paper so that others may learn from our experiences in using free access software and commonplace hardware when constructing digital portfolios with students who are some distance from campus.

        "description":"Although preparing teachers to be leaders is a common goal of teacher education programs, often &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;leading&quot; are located in separate departments&quot; (Mangin &amp; Stoelinga, 2009, p. 56). Recently, however, the assessment of teacher leadership has become important in preservice teacher education. This importance is partially related to the use of the outcomes model of teacher education, in particular, &quot;outcomes as professional performance&quot; (Cochran-Smith, 2001, p. 529). In the conversations about the standardization of teacher education programs, there remains tension about what should be the outcomes of teacher education and whether these types of performances can truly capture the complex character of teaching (Cochran-Smith, 2001; Feuerstein, 2011). Despite these lingering tensions, the &quot;outcomes&quot; issue in teacher education is currently the driving force in college and university compliance with state and national accreditation (Cochran-Smith, 2001). In 2008, the authors' state board of education declared that a new process that &quot;focuses on outcomes, rather than inputs, eliminates barriers and obstacles that do not ensure quality, and allows greater institutional flexibility based on increased rigor and accountability&quot; would be the model for granting teacher licensure (North Carolina State Board of Education, 2008, para. 1). The Teacher Leader Essays that they examine in this study are a mandated professional performance task required for licensure in their state. As part of their program's licensure requirements, preservice teachers are required to complete an online portfolio to demonstrate content and pedagogical knowledge as well as teacher leadership. The Teacher Leader Essay component requires preservice teachers to engage in a minimum of 10 hours of leadership activities during their student teaching semester. The directions for this component suggest that preservice teachers develop and engage in activities that focus on community and family relations, collaboration, and professional development. The preservice teachers in this study were required to document and reflect on their leadership activities through the use of essays. Other key elements of this requirement included the documentation of their growth and learning during the activities and how their courses and extracurricular activities assisted them with these undertakings of teacher leadership. Hence, this component of their licensure portfolio was a way for preservice teachers to synthesize their undergraduate experience with leadership. This inquiry into the content of the authors' institution's first year of Teacher Leader Essays was undertaken to understand what their preservice teachers in elementary and middle grades education perceived as teacher leadership as well as whether a mandated task constrained preservice teachers' experiences and perceptions of teacher leadership. Based on results of this analysis, they offer the notion that engaging in teacher leadership, while a valuable goal for teacher candidates, needs to be reframed in a developmentally appropriate and meaningful way for preservice teachers.

        "description":"Schools across the United States are confronted with the critical demand for highly effective teachers to address the needs of the increasing numbers of diverse learners in their classrooms. In response, school systems are looking beyond the traditional four-year degree student to individuals who are entering the teaching field from other professions--career changers in education. These career changers are nontraditional teacher candidates who have a desire to help students and the motivation to teach (Chambers, 2002; Feistrizer, 2005; Salyer, 2003). Those who enter teaching from other professional careers want to contribute their life experiences to the classroom as a form of giving back, and this motivation is seen especially in career changers who choose to be special education teachers (Kurtts, Cooper, &amp; Boyles, 2007). Over the last five years, there have been changes in federal funding opportunities designed to prepare career changers in special education (Pugach &amp; Blanton, 2009). These teachers, who have rich life experiences, yet are novice teachers, with novice teachers' needs, need mentoring and support to achieve their goals as teachers. Nevertheless, there is limited research on their needs and how to support them. Such research is warranted, as teacher preparation programs, at all levels, will need to implement best practices to ensure that these career changers become effective teachers in special education (Cooper, Kurtts, Vallecorsa, &amp; Baber, 2008).",

However, at a time when interest in RTI is high, the extent to which it is being implemented effectively in rural schools is largely unknown. Teachers and administrators in two rural elementary schools in the Southeastern United States who were part of a state-wide RTI pilot project participated in this study. Interviews were conducted along with field observations of classroom instruction and team problem-solving meetings. Using a multi-step process for data analysis, various implementation themes emerged related to tiered instruction, data-based decision making, support for model implementation, and collaboration. Findings in these areas support issues raised in the literature regarding factors in rural schools that may impede or enhance fidelity of model implementation. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.",

The pedagogy of place is disappearing from rural communities because of declining enrollments, lack of support, and federal mandates to focus more on basic academic skills. However, PBE does not stand in opposition to standards-based instruction and academic achievement; rather, it enhances instructional strategies for getting at these aims. We present examples of place that can be used to engage rural students in meaningful mathematics activities to improve their content knowledge and problem-solving ability. Barriers exist to full implementation of this work. Yet, we offer a vision of what is possible through the use of technological tools like GIS for teachers who teach in rural communities. Additional studies regarding the effect of using GIS are needed to bring the vision of situated place-based education closer to fruition. (Contains 2 figures and 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"In this study, the author suggests that the current ELL parental involvement model often overlooks the structural aspects and power asymmetry of parent-teacher relationships that can hinder productive collaboration. In doing so, the author uses postcolonial theory as a conceptual lens to investigate the dynamics of ELL parent-teacher interactions from rural ELL parent perspectives by looking at those interactions as intercultural relations. The study uses a general qualitative methodology to explore the dynamics of ELL parent-teacher interactions. Three broad themes that emerged as obstacles that inhibit productive ELL parent-teacher interactions were (1) teachers' judgments toward ELL students and their parents, (2) ELL parents' frustration about their inability to influence a teacher's decision making, and (3) ELL parents' fear of repercussions for speaking up. The paper concludes with important implications for teachers working with ELL students in rural areas.",

What is the meaning of rural, and how do educators define their teaching praxes? This study explores how one music teacher negotiates her role identity in a rural setting through the conceptual framework of sense of place, and how &quot;place&quot; influences her education praxis. Grounded in the narrative methodological perspectives of Connelly and Clandinin (2006), this study investigates the lived experiences of one educator from a place-based lens.

Two schools in the Rowan's network--Holly Glen Elementary and Edward R.

The vision for these partners encompasses a fierce dedication to an essential question that goes to the heart of the Rowan PDSNetwork's mission: How can universities and school districts align their concurrent and mutual goals to increase student achievement by preparing and developing better teachers in their K-12 schools? The work conducted as PDS partners has answered this essential question. This was evident when the partners applied and were awarded the 2013 National Association for Professional Development Schools (NAPDS) Award for ExemplaryProfessional Development School Achievement. This article focuses on the partnership of Holly Glen Elementary and Edward R. Johnstone Elementary Schools. It begins with a description of the resources available from theAssociation and how these resources were used to guide the writing of the proposal. This description is then followed by a summary of how each of the application's elements were completed.

These teachers were selected from a group of 65 teachers who had participated in the online mentoring program. In this program of two time periods lasting two months each, teachers were given opportunities to participate in discussions with university-based mentors on various topics via the web portal. Additionally, each teacher also had a school- or district-level mentor. This study explored why some first year teachers participated frequently in the web portal while others did not. Obstacles and supports associated with the web portal were identified. Obstacles included technology, time, directions, surviving, and subject specific needs. Supports included camaraderie, sharing strategies, and feedback. Recommendations included providing more support for technology, face-to-face professional development along with online mentoring support, and more time for reflection and participation in mentoring activities.

A systematic review of the published literature from 2001 to 2011 was conducted and nineteen (N = 19) research-based repeated reading studies were identified. Based on the criteria for inclusion, repeated reading research has been conducted using four main approaches: (a) repeated reading as the primary intervention, (b) repeated reading compared to other reading interventions, (c) repeated reading in combination with other reading interventions, and (d) repeated reading as part of a reading program. Overall, the results suggest that repeated reading is an effective strategy to increase students' reading fluency and comprehension skills. Findings indicated moderate to large gains in reading fluency and comprehension on practiced passages. However, these gains showed only minor to moderate transfer to novel passages. Implications for classroom practice, limitations, and future research directions are presented. (Contains 4 tables and 1 footnote.)",

Quantitative analysis reveals that both LD and LA students raised their writing and spelling self-efficacy considerably, although they did not seem to enhance their writing and spelling performance during their school attendance. The qualitative analysis reveals that the disproportional increase in efficacy beliefs of adult LD and LA students could be attributed to the writing practices followed in the SCSs.

SAAS was implemented by a special education teacher and two educational assistants in three separate classes, and this study examined implementation and efficacy using direct observation of student self-regulatory behaviors. Utilizing a multiple baseline, across-participants research design, the study revealed positive effects of SAAS on &quot;assignment attack&quot; and teacher-reported student behavior during resource support classes. The results demonstrated that the effect was maintained after external supports were faded and suggest improved assignment attack behavior may have contributed to improved assignment completion.

        "title":"The Pitfalls of Focusing on Instructional Strategies in Professional Development for Teachers of English Learners",
        "author":["Molle, Daniella"],
        "description":"For more than a decade, the professional development literature has shown that most teachers are not adequately prepared to teach English learners (ELs)--that holds true for both specialist and mainstream teachers (see, for example, August &amp; Hakuta, 1997; Beykont, 2002). Research that focuses on professional development for teachers of ELs, however, is rare (Genesee, Lindholm-Leary, Saunders, &amp; Christian, 2006). The need for such research has, however, never been more urgent. Federal mandates for disaggregated data by native language have helped show that the education that linguistically and culturally diverse students receive is far from equitable. Indeed, the 2007 National Assessment of Educational Progress revealed that fourth-grade ELs are more than twice as likely as non-ELs to score below basic in reading and mathematics (Lee, Grigg, &amp; Donahue, 2007), a gap that widens in eighth grade. ELs also have higher dropout rates and more frequent placement in lower academic tracks than non-ELs (Genesee et al., 2006). These findings suggest that many schools are unable to fulfill their obligation to provide an equitable education for all their students, and their EL students in particular. In addition, the population of ELs is the fastest growing in the country and many regions of the United States are coming into contact with non-native English speaking immigrants for the first time. The present article responds to the urgent need for research on professional learning opportunities specifically designed for teachers of ELs. Existing educational research that offers in-depth discussion of the learning processes in which educators engage during such professional development is still rather limited (though see, for example, Gebhard, Demers, &amp; Castillo-Rosenthal, 2008; Gonzalez, Moll, &amp; Amanti, 2005; Musanti &amp; Pence, 2010). In the analysis included here, the author applies a type of discourse analysis (microethnography) to examine the opportunities for learning that group interactional norms foster and foreclose. She uses excerpts of social interaction during a professional development initiative to illustrate how the deficit views of students perpetuated by dominant discourses (Popkewitz, 2007; Swartz, 2009) become reaffirmed when educators are not provided with opportunities to analyze whether and how their instructional practices take into account the specific characteristics that set apart ELs, heterogeneous as they are, from other students.

        "description":"This study focuses on the learning of a small group of pre-service teachers in a literacy methods course and their instructor, Cindy, a literacy methods professor. The pre-service teachers in Cindy's literacy methods courses conduct literacy practicum experiences at a local city school that is populated by children from non-dominant backgrounds. When a colleague recently learned of Cindy's work with her students at the practicum site, she declared that teacher-educators are wrong to let pre-service teachers teach in those schools. Novice teachers, she insisted, must first learn to teach literacy in less complex settings. That declaration exemplifies several documented concerns in education. The first problem relates to the misconception that methods, strategies, and instructional frameworks can be adequately learned and taught in a disembodied and decontextualized manner apart from real children abiding in actual classrooms (Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2005; Johnson, 2007). The second problem relates to educators who perpetuate (perhaps unwittingly?) deficit views of children from non-dominant backgrounds (Connell, 1994; Frank, 1999; Gutierrez, 2008). These problems merit attention because they relate to broader concerns about relationships between theory and practice with which individual educators must grapple (Gee, 2012). The purpose of this qualitative investigation is to explore and describe one small group of pre-service teachers' reflections on their literacy instruction to children from non-dominant backgrounds, and to use this as a backdrop to sort out, and sort through, Cindy's work as a teacher educator. The pre-service teachers in the three-credit upper-level literacy methods course conducted their practicum at an elementary school (pseudonym, Evergreen Elementary) where approximately four-fifths of the children speak a language other than English as their first language. The pre-service teachers worked in small teacher-research teams of four people, designing and implementing a seven-lesson, literacy-related thematic unit that they taught to the children in one classroom. There were six teaching teams in the undergraduate methods class. Following each lesson taught at Evergreen Elementary the pre-service teachers met with their fellow teaching team members to debrief about and reflect upon their teaching each day. The research questions guiding this investigation were: (1) When did the pre-service teachers discuss diversity-related issues relative to their practicum experience? and (2) What did their discussions reveal about their attitudes towards children from non-dominant backgrounds?

          "Blevins, Brooke"],
        "description":"Teacher knowledge, the sources of that knowledge, and the day-to-day use of that knowledge have become focal points of contemporary research on teacher education. As this body of research has found, a teacher's knowledge base and her subsequent practice is a composite of her beliefs and identities (Britzman, 2003), experiences (Lortie, 1975), knowledge of content (Wineburg &amp; Wilson, 2001), knowledge of pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman, 1986b), and interpretation of education course work field experiences (Adler, 2008; Borko &amp; Mayfield, 1995), all of which depicts the complexity of teaching. In this qualitative analysis, the authors explore how purposefully challenging the official curriculum and its dominant, hegemonic ideologies and worldviews provides preservice social studies teachers with vital opportunities to confront and challenge K-12 schooling practices that create inequities. They argue that teachers' deviation from the traditional canon is not simply an act of intellectual defiance but rather an understanding of how &quot;to think critically about and challenge the universality of that knowledge&quot; (Cochran-Smith et al., 2009, p. 635). The knowledge pre-service teachers use to mediate and transform the curriculum ought to be examined as an &quot;interpretation of their experiences [as] embedded in social and cultural contexts&quot; (Cochran-Smith &amp; Fries, 2005, p. 86). In sum, what teachers know, how they know what they know, and how they use what they know to engage in the critical teaching of the curriculum is essential in adding to our understanding of how to construct a more social justice and critical pedagogy oriented teacher education program. The purpose of this article is to investigate how pre-service social studies teachers come to understand their disciplines as a way to challenge the power structures and institutional practice which inhibit the realization of democratic ideals. Certainly, this investigation may be an endeavor within any discipline taught in schools; however, the authors specifically contextualize this research within the field of social studies education. In this article, they first situate the research within existing literature, then they establish their conceptual framework using the notion of intellectual biography, and then move on to explore how this framework can be used to better understand how pre-service social studies teachers understand and use their disciplinary knowledge to challenge the traditional curriculum.",

        "author":["Williams, Sharon Vegh"],
        "description":"Research has suggested that mainstream teachers, and the institutions they work for, are often disconnected from the language, culture, and approaches to learning that facilitate Native students' achievement in school (Deyhle &amp; Swisher, 1997; Klug &amp; Hall, 2002; Lomawaima, 2001; Pewewardy, 2002; Reyhner &amp; Jacobs, 2002; Tharp, 2006). Yet, while the overall Native population has increased over the past few decades, the number of Native teachers has decreased (Writer &amp; Chavez, 2002). As a result, many Native students will be taught by non-Native teachers with limited training in cultural competency. Cultural competency in this context refers to teachers' knowledge of and ability to incorporate their students' cultural, social, and linguistic backgrounds into curriculum and instruction (Banks et al., 2005). Similar to other school districts serving Native students, all of the classroom teachers and administrators in this study in Farmingdale, New York are non-Native. Farmingdale is a reservation border town district with a rapidly growing Mohawk student population. Despite this growth and the persistent cultural divide between faculty and students, Farmingdale has provided limited professional development opportunities on Mohawk cultural competency for the non-Native staff. The primary goal of this research was to study the interactions between Native and non-Native participants as they worked to create a professional development program for the district. The points of conflict and contention were then used as a platform for addressing the issues through teacher education. By uncovering Native and non-Native stakeholders' perspectives, four general areas of conflict between the communities were found including: contrasting conceptions of cultural competency, cultural disconnect, intercultural miscommunication, and issues of trust. Through uncovering and analyzing these areas of conflict, a model of cultural competency professional development intended for the Farmingdale District with implications for other schools serving Native students was developed.

        "description":"Minority teacher candidates' capacity to connect with diverse students in preK-12 settings is a driving force behind the demographic imperative to diversify the teaching professions (Achinstein, Ogawa, Sexton, &amp; Freitas, 2010; Banks et al., 2005). Teacher candidates of color have great confidence in their abilities to relate to students of color and to serve as role models (Weisman &amp; Hansen, 2008; Williams, Graham, McCary-Henderson, &amp; Floyd, 2009). The possible connections fostered by a diversified teaching force are offset by the reality of classroom demographics. Recognizing the importance of increasing the number of minorities in teacher education programs and subsequently increasing the number of minority teachers in the field, this article is written by five self-identified minorities in teacher education. The authors view their experiences through the lens of connecting to others as they explore their decisions to enter teaching, their experiences in a teacher preparation program, and their professional goals. Four questions frame their research: (1) What does it mean to identify as the &quot;other&quot; in a teacher education program? (2) What obstacles have they encountered as a result of being the &quot;other&quot;? (3) How do they, as teacher candidates and a teacher educator, believe their &quot;otherness&quot; will impact their teaching? and (4) In what ways do they perceive their &quot;otherness&quot; as a benefit to education programs and education as a whole?

        "description":"One of the goals of successful teacher preparation is to develop professionals who are cognizant of their own backgrounds and who critically reflect on those experiences for future practice (Darling-Hammond, 2006). Overall, this study seeks to explore the ways in which blogging provides a space for reflection, interaction, and development of teacher practice within a teacher education program. Building upon the previous work with in-service teachers of Luehmann (2008), the authors examined preservice teacher (PST) participation in an online community of practice where teacher candidates, over the course of their elementary education program, reflect on their own educational backgrounds and mediate those ideas with course readings and exposure to a variety of pedagogical practices. Preservice teachers took these various components and spoke in terms of either mixing past experience and present exposure, retaining the qualities of each, or of deconstructing their prior experience as they assembled plans for the future. For this article, the authors focused on the autobiographical experiences of the PSTs to answer the following research questions: (1) How does autobiographical reflection through blogging provide a space for students to recognize their apprenticeship of observation? and (2) In what ways do PSTs negotiate these apprenticeships of observation?

However, as Lortie (1975) suggests, experience is more powerful than theory and changing beliefs of students entering pre-service teaching programs is challenging and will require a focused effort throughout the program for misconceptions to be addressed. The purpose of this study was to investigate the process of conceptual change as related to the PETE program experience and student teaching practicum. Two physical education student teachers participated during an eight-week long elementary practicum experience. Interviews were conducted with student teachers, their cooperating teachers, the university supervisor, and the program coordinator. The data from this survey or tool\tcould be used to diagnose specific origins of misconceptions in order to allow PETE programs to develop curricula that may encourage conceptual change.",

        "description":"Encouraged in large part by the work of Schon (1983), teacher education programs have spent the last two decades providing preservice teachers with experiences designed to help them examine their beliefs and develop reflective habits (Roskos et al., 2001; Tsangaridou &amp; Siedentop, 1995; Zeichner &amp; Liston, 1987). The present study investigated participants' reflective practices throughout their teacher education program, from coursework through student teaching. An interview and eight post-observation conferences were conducted with each participant during student teaching, and the results derived from constant comparative analysis (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) present intriguing patterns in terms of factors facilitating participants' reflection. Though the results of the present study provide interesting insights into participants' reflection, they also raise intriguing questions. Preservice teachers frequently experience a disconnect between the values espoused by their education program and practices taught regarding reflection (O'Donoghue &amp; Brooker, 1996). Therefore, it seems important to ask, &quot;As most teacher education programs address reflection in their mission, how do they ensure that all educators in their program (e.g., professors, supervisors, and cooperating teachers) have a consistent and well-articulated understanding of reflection and how to foster it?&quot; It may also be intriguing to investigate traits of cooperating teachers that actively and regularly encourage reflective practices and whether this population shares any common traits.",

        "description":"This article investigates one small aspect of the work of secondary social studies teacher preparation at Michigan State University (and, of course, the surrounding public schools where so much of this preparation actually takes place). The authors have come to see that there cannot be a successful program without having close, warm, collegial relationships between mentor teachers and university course and field instructors. The teachers that society wishes to have cannot be prepared absent a shared identity--one rooted in both teacher education and the education of public school children. Or, as Bullough (2005) has written, as long as mentor teachers' main identification is with &quot;teachers and school children, not university-based teacher educators and beginning teachers, it is highly likely that teacher education will remain little more than a weak exercise in vocational socialisation&quot; (p. 144). In this article, the authors first lay out the framework for making sense of this shared identity--a framework borrowed from scholarship in social studies education. After briefly talking about the sources and nature of the data, they present examples of the way in which the framework for shared identity allows the authors to make sense of the lived experiences of both mentor teachers and field instructors in the program. The article concludes by turning to the voice of Ben--who as both a committed middle school teacher and teacher educator offers both a warning and a sense of hope for the work of mutually-shared teacher preparation.

These stories are rendered in detail to underscore the obstacles student teachers face regularly in becoming multicultural educators, as well as the various and subtle ways supervisors can help them advance their skills by giving them the opportunity to revisit, rethink, and re-see their day to day failed attempts in the field. The three stories highlight three of the five Banks and Banks' (2010) criteria for preparing multicultural educators at work. These are: grappling with disempowering institutional power structures (see &quot;There Are Cockroaches in the Classroom&quot;), reflecting on personal prejudice and bias (see &quot;Her Mother Doesn't Care&quot;), and evaluating ineffective lesson plans and delivery (see &quot;The Subway Outside the Window Goes There&quot;). Analysis suggests the virtue of engaging student teachers in narrative, story, or eco-narrative construction for the purposes of preparing multicultural educators in that it allows the field supervisor to problematize student teachers' limitations, not as something blameworthy or lamentable, but as something to be expected and, potentially, remediated through scaffolded assistance with everyday challenges. Counter-evidence for the two remaining criteria in Banks and Banks' (2010) typology, content integration and knowledge construction, is also presented. (Contains 1 note.)",

To beginto address these deficits, we focus on the need to close the opportunity gap by providing access to multi-tiered systems of academic prevention, maximizing academic learning time, and providing explicit instruction for youth with E/BD. We offer recommended positive behavior interventions and supports necessary to improve engagement in instruction. Closing the achievement gap using multi-tiered academic supports requires best practices for universal screening and diagnostic assessment to understand youth academic needs. We detail the key elements of explicit instruction directly linked to improved academic performance. We conclude with alterable instruction factors for intensifying instruction and emphasize the need for intensive language instruction for the majority of youth with E/BD.",

The teachers spent a month embedded in local primary and secondary schools, working collaboratively with their Tanzanian counterparts. As a strategy for making sense of their experiences, each teacher was asked to maintain a reflective journal, using the Harvard Visible Thinking Routine of &quot;see, think, wonder&quot; as a critical structure for guiding their journal writing. The purpose of this article is to discuss the effectiveness of journaling for teachers in challenging teaching \nsituations, and the usefulness of the Harvard approach in structuring the reflective process as part of an action-based reflective model. As such, the article examines not just the role of critical journaling in helping the participating teachers make sense of their African experience, but the potential of this approach in general in helping teachers faced with challenging or confronting teaching contexts.

        "description":"An increasing number of teaching qualifications are underpinned by the concept of clinical practice (Alter &amp; Coggshall, 2009; McLean Davies et al., 2013) and draw on clinical education research in the health professions. Teaching as a clinical practice profession is an emergent approach in teacher education. Clinical practice is not a wholesale shift in approach; rather it is a change in perspective that has the capacity to create changes in thinking about learning and teaching. The concept of clinical reasoning presented in this paper is offered as a key element in teacher education that requires greater emphasis. By moving away from apprenticeship and craft frameworks of teaching that were prevalent in teacher education (Hoffman-Kipp, Artiles, &amp; Lopez-Torres, 2003), this approach to clinical reasoning can produce teachers who are better able to articulate their reasoning for pedagogical choices drawing on both school-based and research-based evidence so as to improve their own teaching and improve the teaching of others.

        "description":"Forty per cent of new teachers in Australia leave the profession in \nthe first five years (Ingersoll, 2012; Watt &amp; Richardson, 2011; Hartsuyker, \n2007). Stress, induction failure and professional isolation have been \nidentified as key attrition factors. Mentoring has been used both \ninternationally and in Australia to enhance induction and reduce \nprofessional isolation; however, these mentoring relationships are often \nfragile and there is a need to establish more effective mentoring models \n(Paris, 2010; Hartsuyker, 2007). Reciprocal Mentoring (RM) pairs two \nequal, though differently skilled, experts who act in the role of mentor and \nmentee to each other for mutual benefit. The RM approach is designed to \nsupport beginning teachers as they transition to the profession and to \nfacilitate improved retention. The &quot;Better Transition to Teaching&quot; inquiry \nwas initiated by Edith Cowan University in 2011. It investigated the impact \nof RM on the first year experience of 11 (visual arts) Western Australian \nbeginning teachers, following their participation in an RM residency in \n2010. A major outcome of the research was that at the end of the first year \nall beginning teacher participants were still working in the profession. All \nreported experiencing personal/professional challenges during their first \nyear and, importantly, the support of mentors appeared to make a significant and positive difference to the participants' transition experience and their first year of teaching.

Digital technologies in schools, such as electronic methods of record-keeping, offer enhanced opportunities for teachers to perform this skill, and its application has been growing steadily in education. The aim of this exploratory study was to examine fourth-year pre-service teachers' behaviour in record-keeping whilst on their final professional experience placement. Using Ajzen's (1992) theory of planned behavior, this study found that most pre-service teachers exhibited positive attitudes toward the behaviour of recording, using, and analysing classroom data. Despite this positive attitude, many pre-service teachers were unable to maintain any system of record-keeping whilst on placement. For many, this was due to a number of external influences or perceived external influences, which acted as a constraint to their behaviour. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

An important aspect of the teachers' perspectives of their professional development, which connects up to the early childhood environment in ChangChun, is the view that professional development was oriented to their own employment continuity.

This particular study purposefully grapples with visual and performing arts, in an elementary teacher education program, as teacher candidates &quot;learn to learn&quot; how to inquire through their disciplinary and interdisciplinary frames of mind. We take the position that arts-based research adds to the diversity and complexity inherent in understandings about education and pedagogy. This research was infused through principles of teaching, music and movement, and visual arts education classes at The University of British Columbia. To learn about adopting an a/r/tographic stance in their journeys of becoming teachers, teacher candidates were actively involved in arts-based research workshops, the development of an art exhibition, learning to infuse creative pedagogies across the curriculum, and sharing their arts-based research projects. Their art took the form of public performances with artistic (music, dance, drama, visual) representations of curriculum. Featured in this essay are the stories of &quot;becoming&quot; of two pre-service teachers whose learning interwove basic notions of a/r/tography. Their work subsequently influenced \nthe projects of hundreds of pre-service teachers since their experiences as teacher candidates. Through examining this form of praxis, we learned that pre-service teachers who embrace an a/r/tography project--as a mode of artistic expression, as the creation of mature works of art, and as reflective-reflexive inquiry--experience the most success during coursework, during practicum, and into their teaching careers. They possess an ongoing commitment to becoming a/r/tographers and expanding their careers and career paths through artistic inquiry. They are more open to change and \nprofessional growth. Moreover, artistry--in the form of visual arts, music, dance, and drama--continues, being and becoming a strong influence in the identities of those individuals. The significance of this work expresses what happens when projects in university coursework shift to a professional perspective and to an embodiment of becoming a/r/tographic. The significance of enabling teacher candidates opportunities to work, both &quot;with&quot; and &quot;as&quot; teacher researchers--to create alongside others who are questioning ways of learning, knowing, and doing research; to engage with reflection in a deeply compelling manner--reaches beyond current, traditional conceptions of teacher education to a place of a community of learners engaged in artistic, creative inquiry. We suggest a substantial, artistic, creative shift in the conceptualization and practice of teacher education. (Contains 10 footnotes.)",

Emphasizing the significance of one&apos;s personal biography and experiences as a researcher, I discuss how my background as an artist and art therapist influenced the development of this approach. I propose several pedagogical applications of &quot;bead collage,&quot; offer questions for consideration, and suggest future directions for this method. I invite others to explore this, or similar approaches drawn from their own experiences, to develop what Eisner (1995) and Bresler (2006) describe as &quot;artistically-crafted&quot; and &quot;aesthetically based&quot; research.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to examine children&apos;s spirituality from the \nperspective of music learning, using arts based research as a mode of \ninquiry. Six interrelated themes are chosen to explore the landscape of \nmusic and children&apos;s spirituality and to evaluate the potential of arts \nbased research to inform the intersections between them: a landscape of \nrelational consciousness, soft boundaries and transitional spaces, pilgrims on a journey, telling stories along the way, stories form a collage, and transforming the self in/and the landscape. Resonances between music learning, children&apos;s spirituality and arts based research are strong, both in premise and possibility. Among them, the epistemological scope of arts based research is broad and accommodates non-verbal and non-dualistic ways of knowing that are fundamental to spiritual and musical experience. Children&apos;s spirituality is presented as centered in relational consciousness, musical meanings are embodied in a set of relationships, and arts based research, with its focus on reflection, multiple forms of representation and process, is well suited to probing those relationships. The sensory and embodied nature of musical experience juxtaposed with the contemplative and sacred nature of spiritual experience can be captured within the realm \nof arts based research.

        "description":"Mobile devices and applications are expected to have a significant impact on teaching and learning in the near future. Yet colleges and universities are currently facing severe budget constraints and discretionary funding is restricted for new initiatives. The question addressed in this paper is: &quot;What strategy should an institution of higher learning with limited resources use in adapting the capabilities of mobile devices to benefit its academic programs?&quot; To help answer this question, students were surveyed to identify their perceptions on the importance of a selected set of mobile learning functions, their experience with using those functions, their recommendation for a mobile learning adoption strategy, and information on the particular mobile devices they possess. The recommended strategy was &quot;pick and choose special capabilities to develop&quot; with the selected functions being (1) Receive alerts and reminders about assignments and appointments concerning the course being taken; (2) Communicate individually with\nfaculty, an advisor, or other students using voice, email, or text messaging; (3) Post or reply to items in a poll, discussion board, or other application; and (4) Download and review lesson materials from a course being taken. Other recommendations included techniques for faculty and student support services as well as institutional policies for limiting models of mobile devices for use in courses, making online courseware for laptops and desktops the same as mobile learning courseware, and making the opportunity for mobile learning optional.

        "description":"This research was designed to explore the learning experiences of state college students using mobile electronic textbook (e-book) readers. The purpose of the study was to build a rich description of how students used e-books delivered on mobile computing devices for college-level, introductory\nsociology courses at a public state college in the southeastern United States. This research employed a multiple case study design that investigated and documented student experiences with this instructional technology. The bounding frame was comprised of the literature on mobile technology, mobile learning theories, and e-books. A theoretical lens of learning theories commonly found in the literature on mobile learning (constructivism, social cognitive theory, self-efficacy theory, expectancy x value theory, self-determination theory, and situated cognition) was situated within the mobile learning framework. The theoretical lens was used to provide insight to the student's learning experiences. Six conclusions were drawn from the study: (1) students expressed competence in their use of the\nmobile e-books, (2) students expressed feelings of high self-efficacy when using the mobile e-books, (3) students valued the use of the mobile e-books for their learning, (4) students were individualized and metacognitive in their learning with the mobile e-books, (5) students enhanced their learning\nsocially and within situated learning opportunities, and (6) the students and the instructor had divergent views on the value and utility of social, interactive textbooks.

        "description":"The Professional Science Master's Biotechnology program at the University of Maryland University College developed and implemented a novel online mentoring program to increase synergy with the biotechnology industry. In this program, Master's students are paired with mentors from the\nbiotechnology industry. A mentor assistant, who is a graduate of the degree program, assists each pair. Utilizing an open source platform and web-based technologies, each pair interacts on a regular basis to formulate and/or revise the students' professional goals and action plans. Each pair continues their interaction until the student graduates. The impact of the mentoring program is assessed through several measures including feedback on surveys and academic performance. The program grew from 19 mentor-mentee pairs in fall 2009 to 46 pairs in fall 2011. This trend and the current student retention rate of 79% suggest increasing student interest. Among the students who joined the mentoring program, those who continued participating had completed more courses/credit hours at the time of joining than the students who dropped from the program. The end-of-semester questionnaires showed generally positive student satisfaction and provided specific examples of gains in the students' ability to identify and pursue their\ncareer goals. The number of courses completed by the mentees was significantly higher than the number of courses completed by a comparison group of non-participants, indicating a possible effect of their participation in the mentoring program. So far, more mentees graduated than the comparison group of non-participants, and in less overall time. As the program progresses, possible effects on students' academic achievement and time-to-graduation will be reevaluated. The effectiveness of the mentoring program on improving the participants' career prospects after graduation will also be examined. The benefit of such a novel program is the ease with which it bridges the gap between industry and academia, providing a remarkable career development opportunity for students while building a strong community of professionals.

Based on survey data from teaching artists working in Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, United Kingdom, and the United States (n = 172), the paper illuminates participants' perspectives on preparation, practice and professional identity. Emergent themes include: (1) teaching artist training and preparation, (2) work contexts and populations served, and (3) work challenges and obstacles. Following discussion of key survey findings, three case studies based in higher education settings in the USA, UK and Southeast Asia are presented. Hagman's (2005) framework for multiple fields of subjectivity at work in aesthetic experience is employed to illustrate the ways in which the intrasubjective, the intersubjective, and the metasubjective fields of subjectivity inform each teaching artist's practice and professional identity. The paper concludes with an analysis of themes in light of current discussions on reflective practice and implications for teaching artist &quot;praxis&quot;. (Contains 7 footnotes.)",

The connection to an adviser is critical for all students, but for online students it can serve as their primary connection to the institution. In Fall 2011 a pilot study was\nconducted at the Community College of Vermont (CCV) to examine online advising through a Moodle course site. Although this pilot study represented a small online advising cohort, 56 of the total 155 online students, it illustrates implications for practice and research. The advising cohort showed a slightly higher retention rate than the overall online population. Based on survey results students reported a strong desire for an adviser who stays with them throughout their educational career at the college. In\nFall 2012, CCV institutionalized online advising and began a systematic approach to assisting online students. Five advisers added online students to their work assignments and all CCV advisers were informed of what services CCV would be offering online. When students applied to CCV and selected online (ONL) as a home location, they were contacted via email with an explanation of the online services available to them so that students could make a more informed decision about their home location. In Fall 2012, 286 students selected ONL as their home location and were contacted by staff; 256 students chose to remain online. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)",

This is done by introducing a narrative \nbased on a dance pedagogy student's writings. They contain observations of her experiences on being the facilitating choreographer in a dance-making process involving a cross-artistic group of students in the performing arts. The narrative we constructed highlights especially the emotional challenges and insights that the student wrote about. In discussing the narrative, we underline that creating collaboratively can be an emotionally and personally deeply meaningful process--involving the construction of subjectivities, relationships, ideas and outcomes. Emotions play an important part in social communication but they likewise have a part to play in making aesthetic and artistic judgments. As a conclusion, we argue that emotional literacy plays an important part in artistic collaboration as does understanding the diverse roles one assumes and relates to the other artistic collaborators with. Owing to the open-ended nature of artistic work, in collaboration, understanding the significance of enacted emotions entails a process of learning, as well. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"Over the last two decades, students and teachers, across educational levels and disciplines, have been subject to a variety of school reform efforts. Nevertheless, some instructional practices, such as portfolio assessment, persist and grow in popularity even in the midst of changing educational reform goals and shifting priorities. Teacher education programs have used paper-based portfolios for more than three decades. Recently, institutions have migrated to electronic portfolios since these provide several advantages. Early models of these systems required special technical skills, hardware, or fee-based contracts with service providers. The newest iteration of portfolio platforms are based on social media applications, which are easy to use, free, and customizable. However, the accelerated adoption of social media applications as repositories for student portfolio content has produced several gaps in the literature. Three of these include steps for implementing electronic portfolios in social media platforms, instructional methods for soliciting quality entries from students through questions and prompts, and student perceptions about using social media as a repository for electronic portfolio content. Results from a case study identifying student perceptions of combining social media and electronic portfolios are examined. Future lines of inquiry are discussed.",

        "author":["Fetzner, Marie"],
        "description":"Over the past twelve years, Monroe Community College (MCC), in Rochester, NY, has administered three surveys to non-successful online students to ask about their perceptions of online learning and to learn about student perceived barriers in the online environment. For these surveys, non-successful students were defined as those students who received a grade of F or W in an MCC online course. Typically, these particular students do not share their perceptions of online learning with the college because they rarely participate in end of the year student satisfaction surveys. Thus, their perceptions are often invisible and unknown to institutions. In the MCC surveys, students were asked to: share their perspectives on why they felt that were not successful in their online class; comment on their expectations for online classes; and share the advice that they would give to a student who was considering taking an online MCC class. The students' responses to these questions were fairly consistent over the course of time that the surveys were conducted, 2000-2001, 2005-2006, and 2009-2010. The combined responses for the three surveys indicated that the number one reason why students felt that they were not successful in their online course was because they &quot;got behind and couldn't catch up.&quot; Although online student satisfaction surveys provide insights into the perceptions of online students, the voluntary respondents to these surveys are those students who typically did well in the course. A review of the results of the responses from unsuccessful online students broadens the scope of the voice of the students and brings to the forefront the perspectives of students who were not successful. These data can help to inform the types of student services support that unsuccessful online MCC students feel are needed. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"&quot;U-Pace,&quot; an instructional intervention, has potential for widespread implementation because student behavior recorded in any learning management system is used by &quot;U-Pace&quot; instructors to tailor coaching of student learning based on students' strengths and motivations. &quot;U-Pace&quot; utilizes an online learning environment to integrate content mastery with Amplified Assistance (instructor-initiated, individually tailored feedback on concepts not yet mastered and constructive support that every student receives via email weekly or more often as needed). Evaluation findings for &quot;U-Pace&quot; instruction revealed that compared to conventional, face-to-face instruction, &quot;U-Pace&quot; instruction was associated with greater academic success for all students and reductions in the achievement gap for &quot;disadvantaged&quot; students. Additionally, &quot;disadvantaged&quot; &quot;U-Pace&quot; students showed improvements in the rate of content mastery and intrinsic motivation.  Consistent with these indicators of improvement in self-regulated learning skills, &quot;U-Pace&quot; students reported greater improvements in their time management and study skills, greater control over their learning and a greater sense of achievement than conventionally-taught students. The convergence of findings from student reports, performance measures recorded within the learning management system, and objectively determined grades suggests &quot;U-Pace&quot; instruction holds promise for higher education.

        "description":"Because students spontaneously exhibit aesthetic and rhythmic acts in the \nclassroom and human beings across the world have engaged in the arts for \nthousands of years, this study argues that artful behavior represents an inherent and significant human proclivity. Exploring the tension between the human predisposition and the physical and mental limitations of traditional formal education, this cross-disciplinary study seeks to understand how artful behaviors might represent an intrinsic part of human nature and how such proclivities might inform educational policy and practice. Based on an \nethological understanding of art (that is, as a behavior rather than an object), this research employs an interpretivist lens and phenomenological design. Data collection methods include observation, participant observation, and teacher interviews in a pre-kindergarten and third grade classroom of an urban public school system. Ultimately, this study aims to understand artful behaviors as they are embedded in educational contexts with the intent of bridging the gap between our natural inclinations for learning and the methods utilized in mainstream education.

        "author":["Dobson, Emma"],
        "description":"It has been 20 years since the Rainbow Reading programme was developed and trialled by its New Zealand creator, Meryl-Lynn Pluck. Rainbow Reading is an audio-facilitated reading programme, and is based on the method of assisted repeated reading. The programme is designed to provide older students reading below their chronological age with the opportunity to practise their fluency and comprehension at their instructional reading level. This article sets out to review the programme, drawing on the research evidence to evaluate Rainbow Reading's validity and reliability as a reading intervention for use by educational practitioners in the New Zealand education context. Possible strengths and limitations of the programme are identified, and future directions for the programme are put forward. While the article concludes by suggesting some caution with regard to its use, it is evident that the effectiveness of an intervention such as Rainbow Reading is underpinned by practitioners taking an evidence-based approach in their professional practice.

Culturally-responsive approaches to education accept diversity and enable students to draw on their unique cultural capital as a learning resource. The aim of this study was to contribute to the literature in this area by finding out what Somali students in a New Zealand primary school think about their schooling: the aspects of school which challenge or support their cultural identities. Three nine and ten year-old Somali students attending a primary school in the Greater Wellington region participated in focus groups. Open-ended questions were used to elicit their perspectives on pedagogical approaches and their interactions with their peers and teachers. The students identified numerous positive aspects of their school lives, including \nstrong friendships and autonomy in the classroom, yet revealed that bullying is an ongoing issue, for themselves and other students, in and out of school.

While this case study describes an Australian first year Business Law unit, the findings presented in this paper would be relevant to a wide range of teachers faced with large enrollments in first year higher education courses. In the present case, the teacher had the challenge of teaching very large first year classes comprising students from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds, many of whom were enrolled in the course not from choice but because it was compulsory for their degree. In this paper the authors describe how the teaching of the course was designed to enhance and encourage student learning. The authors' focus is on implementation of first year curriculum design principles; use of computer based tutorials and audience response systems; and a team approach to teaching. The teaching practices discussed in this paper are underpinned by references to relevant literature and contextualized within an ethics approved research project. The findings presented in this paper are likely to be of interest to teachers of law, teachers of large classes, and to curriculum and academic developers. (Contains 4 tables.)",

In general, the future communication faculty reported that most had participated in teaching preparation activities. Few reported participating or having access to preparation in other academic areas. In hindsight, most respondents would have liked more preparation opportunities in all areas. Even though they did not have extensive preparation in any area, except for teaching, most reported they were confident in their ability to perform the skills of a future faculty member.

Each score represents a student&apos;s mastery of that learning objective, and may change over time in response to evidence that her level of understanding has changed. SBG is increasingly popular in K-12 education, but has been poorly documented and studied in a university context. I explored the practicality and effects of using SBG in a moderately large university class by incorporating it into the two successive courses of an introductory physics sequence. Although design flaws and logistical difficulties plagued these attempts, most students responded positively to the basic intent and elements of the approach. Our experiences revealed likely implementation errors and suggested some wise design choices. More interestingly, I found that SBG foregrounds and forces us to confront some fundamental tensions present but latent within most or all teaching. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Today's students are exposed to world events that require considerable \ncross cultural understanding and recognition that education is far more than \nlearning facts about specific disciplines and diverse groups while sitting in a \nclassroom. For the past several decades, research in education has repeatedly demonstrated that adults learn effectively through experience. However, does experiential learning, when designed specifically to heighten awareness of a significant social problem, evoke socially responsible behavior specific to that problem in the long run? Employing a qualitative longitudinal research design involving 25 graduate students as participants, this study explored that question. Findings indicated that 94.7% of participants who reported a high impact learning experience when participating in experiential learning while enrolled in a graduate class also reported engaging in socially responsible behavior because of that learning experience. In some instances, the socially responsible behavior continued for as long as three years after the class had ended. (Contains 4 tables.)",

This novel twist on a traditional assignment yielded surprisingly robust benefits. Across four samples from two universities and two instructors, students indicated that the assignment furthered their learning beyond other aspects of the course by helping them apply social psychology to &quot;real life&quot; situations that were beyond their own particular experiences. The results suggested that allowing students to choose the book that they would read promoted enjoyment of the assignment. Informal discussion with students, including those who rarely read books for pleasure, indicated that many students took pride in reading a book of their own choosing that they actually enjoyed. Almost all students recommended the continued use of the assignment for future courses. Variations on the assignment that could be utilized by instructors in other psychology courses and other academic disciplines are discussed. (Contains 3 tables and 8 footnotes.)",

We incorporated service learning projects (SLP) into three Social Determinants of Health courses (2008-2010) to promote: experiential learning; undergraduate scholarship; faculty career development through the scholarship of teaching and learning; and collaborative university-community research to reduce social inequalities in health. We examined whether SLP facilitated student learning of course concepts. We used mixed methods analyzing students' (n = 25) pre-/post-test surveys, research papers, and site supervisors' (n = 17) interviews. Despite positive survey ratings, results showed decreased student agreement about SLP facilitating student learning. Content analysis revealed specific student themes: finding SLP rewarding for future public health careers; aligning student interests with community-based organizations (CBOs)' goals; and valuing \ninteractive experiences with CBOs' clients. Students gained beneficial career development skills with CBOs but needed better preparation for their SLP by increased discussion of their and CBOs' expectations. (Contains 5 tables.)",

An emerging body of research connects social presence with learning outcomes in online coursework. Social presence is the &quot;degree to which a person is perceived as a &apos;real person&apos; in mediated communication&quot; (Gunwardena &amp; Zittle, 1997, p.9). The study of 121 student participants addresses the following questions: (1) What is the evidence of social presence in students&apos; communication in an online discussion forum and in an attitudinal survey? (2) What pedagogical methods affect students&apos; perceptions of social presence?  (3) What is the relationship between social presence and students&apos; learning outcomes? The regression model revealed that students with higher demonstrations of social presence in discussion forum posts had statistically significantly higher ratings on the CAT. This seems to indicate that social presence influences student outcomes on written assignments. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)",

This paper \ngrounds the case-based pedagogy in three learning theories: behaviorism, \ncognitivism, and constructivism. The three theories are described and situated in relation to the case study method. An in-depth exploration of the assumptions of each theory helped to identify and analyze several issues that emerged upon the implementation of the case-based pedagogy in a nursing curriculum. In line with the three pedagogical standpoints, and after an extensive literature review, measures are proposed to improve the quality of student learning in a case-based curriculum, and principles are derived to support educators in their teaching with case studies. The application of the three learning theories may be especially useful to educators and instructional leaders when shifting paradigms. By describing the key challenges that educators may face with instructional innovation and the usefulness of the cognitivist, behaviorist, and constructivist perspectives in providing explanations and recommendations, provides a beginning research base for improving pedagogies. Failure to employ theories of \nlearning in similar educational shifts may hinder the progress of any intended curriculum transformation. (Contains 2 tables.)",

However, assigning grades equitably to all team members in a way that rewards them for their contributions remains challenging. In this paper, we ask whether having free riders on a team lowers the quality of submitted work, and whether students' course performance correlates with peer evaluations. In an introductory sociology course, 101 students were organized into 20 teams; each team completed a set of three papers. Students were evaluated by the quality of work submitted and peer evaluations. For statistical analysis, we organized the teams into one of three groups, among which we compared average paper grades: group one contained teams with free riders, group two contained teams that may have free riders, and group three contained teams with no free riders. We found that teams with free riders did not submit significantly lower quality work than teams without free riders. We also statistically analyzed the relationship between student course performance and their peer evaluation, and found that students' performance in the course showed little correlation with their peer evaluations. Our results indicate that free riders do not depress the grades of non-free rider students. We also found that students' peer evaluations do not correlate with their course performance, a finding which warrants further research. (Contains 3 tables, 3 footnotes, and 3 figures.)",

Results suggest that students participating in the learning community program acquired significantly greater content mastery in statistics when compared to non-participating peers.

What better opportunity for reflection and critical engagement, he thought, than to investigate the enterprise to which the students and he had each made some serious commitments: for the author, all his professional energy, and for them, four years of their lives and up to a quarter of a million dollars? In this article, the author addresses three questions: (1) Can a college balance access and quality? (2) Can a market-based education system provide society a level playing field? and (3) Will liberal arts colleges continue to exist in recognizable forms?",

The author, is a doctoral student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where she researches ethical issues in higher education, and she argues that tertiary institutions must reevaluate their responsibility for creating a marketplace where fraud is allowed to flourish and that system-level changes must be made to streamline the process for international students. Ms. Redding takes the position that taking action to reduce these discrepancies and providing adequate information is the only way to regain control of the admission process and genuinely support students applying from abroad.",

        "description":"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are courses offered for free for any students with an internet connection. Many institutions now offer \nfree MOOCs, including prestigious state universities and private schools. MOOCs are differentiated from ordinary online classes in several ways. Some MOOCs may have as many 50,000 students enrolled in a course at the same time. Most courses are tuition-free. Most MOOCs do not count for college credit, except in California. Successful MOOC students do receive a certificate of completion from the hosting institution. This article presents tips on how enrollment professionals in the U.S. can encourage students and parents to enroll in massive open online courses. It describes how MOOC's are being used today, such as in interactive textbooks for flipped classrooms and in corporate training. Several tips are presented to show how students, parents, faculty, and enrollment and admission professionals can benefit from using MOOC's. For the enrollment professional, enrolling in a MOOC is an opportunity not only to learn something new, but also to gain an intimate understanding of how MOOCs work. Thus, the author describes her impressions of three courses she took as a &quot;lurker&quot; at the University of Michigan, hosted at Coursera.org, in order to see the techniques, content, technology and pedagogy being used. The author concludes that she found the MOOC to be very positive and suggests that institutions can use this exciting new technology to assist students in their search for the college or university of their dreams.",

Upon investigation,\nwhat I observed raised more questions than answers, and the essence of my confusion springs from a single college applicant's story.

Results suggest the competition favors males due to their higher mean score on the mathematics section and greater variability on all sections of the PSAT, which shares differential validity concerns with the SAT in terms of gender. These instruments are designed to predict first-year college success, but have historically under-predicted the abilities of girls compared to boys. Reasons for this disparity are explored and through a\nstatistical analysis utilizing data provided by the College Board, it is predicted that most National Merit semifinalists and finalists are male despite the fact that the majority of participants in the competition are female. This study underscores the problematic practice of using PSAT cutoff scores as the sole measure of merit in the first two phases and SAT scores in the final stage of the National Merit Scholarship Competition, a selection process that runs contrary to best practices in the use of standardized tests.

        "description":"Online learning is revolutionizing the way colleges do business. Study via the Internet makes more knowledge more easily obtainable for more students than ever before. Along with expanded access to higher education, many people are optimistic about an accompanying benefit--a lower price tag. Basic economic factors make the prospect appear promising. The availability of the desired product is growing rapidly. Students no longer need to travel to a special location to obtain it. Colleges no longer need classroom space to provide it, only the amount used by computing facilities and faculty offices. Moving information from experts to learners is easy. The hope is that the core cost of higher education can be offered through technology for far less. This article discusses Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which have taken higher education by storm. This article concludes that optimism about online learning reducing the price of college is premature. So far, the charge for most virtual courses equals or exceeds the charge for traditional ones.(Contains 19 endnotes.)",

One student seemingly glibly dismissed the questions, saying, &quot;It's only technology if it happens after you are born.&quot; In this regard, traditional undergraduates (18--25 years of age who largely attend college full time) and nontraditional students (older and more likely to be working full-time while attending college parttime) pose dramatically different challenges for colleges and universities. To benchmark the digital habits of today's traditional and non-traditional students, the author's conducted a study of undergraduates between the 2006 and 2012 academic years, including a survey of a nationally representative sample of 5,000 undergraduates, two national surveys of chief student affairs officers and focus group interviews on 33 campuses with diverse student groups, as well as meetings with student affairs staff and student leaders (modeled on similar studies from the late 1970s and early 1990s).(Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"At many of the colleges and universities that attract the most applicants, the high-school course of study is a critical component of the evaluation. Many schools advise their candidates that they must take the most difficult course of study available at their high schools to have a chance of earning admission. Students can feel intense pressure to take more Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB) and dual enrollment (DE) courses than they can handle, sometimes even more during their senior year of high school than they will take at any one time in the elite colleges to which they seek admission. As a result, many students engage in the practice of extreme programming--taking 10, 15 and sometimes as many as 20 college-level courses during their high-school careers. To maximize the number of college-level courses they take, these students sometimes sacrifice other activities that might arguably make them better students and their lives more enjoyable and fulfilling. They can also come to their colleges and universities exhausted. In response, students, parents and counselors are asking: How much is enough? The Office of Undergraduate Admissions at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill recently attempted to answer this question by examining the relationship between the number of college-level courses taken during high school by the enrolling first year students and the cumulative grade-point average earned by these students after their first year of study at the university.

In this paper we explore the concept of curation as a student- and creation-driven pedagogical tool to enhance digital and media literacy education. We present a theoretical justification for curation and present six key ways that curation can be used to teach about critical thinking, analysis and expression online. We utilize a case study of the digital curation platform \"Storify\" to explore how curation works in the classroom, and present a framework that integrates curation pedagogy into core media literacy education learning outcomes.

In order to address these concerns, teacher educators have explored alternative pedagogical approaches, including computer based simulations and immersion in virtual worlds. This paper reports on the results of a pilot study conducted with eight pre-service teachers who operated avatars in a virtual classroom created within Second Life (SL)[TM]. The pre-service teachers were able to role-play students with a diverse range of behaviours and engage in reflective discussion about their experiences. The results showed that the pre-service teachers appreciated the opportunity to engage in an authentic classroom experience without impacting on &quot;real&quot; students, but that the platform of SL proved limiting in enacting certain aspects of desired teaching pedagogy. The findings of this pilot study are discussed in relation to improving the preparation of pre-service teachers for practicum. (Contains 2 figures, 1 table and 1 footnote.)",

Teachers and students involved in a large-scale OER initiative at eight community colleges across the United States were given a detailed questionnaire aimed at uncovering their perceptions of the cost, outcomes, uses and perceptions of quality of the OER used in their courses. Teachers and students alike reported significant cost savings and various pedagogical and learning impacts due to the implementation of OER in the classroom. In addition, most students and teachers perceived their OER to be at least equal in quality to traditional textbooks they had used in the past. Implications for further research are discussed.

        "description":"One of the most taxing duties of a writing program administrator (WPA), and one that is likely to cause the most burnout, is initiating curricular reform, an initiative often met with pushback and resistance. Within the literature on curriculum reform in first-year composition, this resistance seems to arise from a complex web of issues related to institutional power, status, and collaboration. However, curricular reform need not be an exercise in futility or insurmountable frustration. Weaving her own recent experience--the good, the bad, and the ugly--with existing literature on the topic, the author will offer WPAs some advice for navigating that often tricky terrain between getting buy-in and getting burned out when launching curricular change.",

        "author":["Dunbar, Ann-Marie"],
        "description":"This essay seeks to explore some of the common challenges facing teachers of multicultural American literature, particularly in the general education classroom. More specifically, the author addresses two typical student responses to this body of literature: the tendency to see the literature as entirely foreign and the tendency to universalize or to identify in a facile way with the text. Drawing on recent pedagogy theory, she argues that teachers of multicultural American literature need to be much more deliberate in their efforts to help students develop other, more productive ways of engaging multiethnic texts. In particular, the author explores the implications of whiteness studies and what Tina Chen has called an \"ethics of knowledge\" for the multicultural American literature classroom. Finally, she discusses several specific texts with an eye to pedagogical strategies that help students both to see and to avoid the twin pitfalls of universalizing and othering. In her experience, she has found that foregrounding some of the theoretical and ethical questions raised by the study of multicultural American literature in a (predominantly white) university classroom can help to make students more self-conscious, ethical readers, with a much clearer sense of their own positionality in relation to textual others.

        "author":["Haugen, Hayley Mitchell"],
        "description":"Knoblauch and Brannon might suggest I pry loose the grip that ancient rhetorical tradition has on my modern classroom, but I'm not convinced I can so easily abandon the ancient rhetoricians. Learning to embrace the different, more creative, and less frequently acknowledged elements of this tradition may be the way for me to go instead. The ancient art of rhetoric recognizes and celebrates the ambiguity of language; rhetoric speculates about the world and invites others to make their own speculations. The essays we assign our students to write, such as the narrative essay, however, discourage ambiguity and speculation. They force students to write about what they already know about their lives or the world around them. Composition instructors should turn, instead, to the personal essay via the father of the form, Michel de Montaigne. Montaigne's example encourages students to explore their lives and only attempt to make sense of them. Unlike the stiff narrative essay encouraged by modes-based readers, the personal essay is invigorated by creativity, spontaneity, and personal discovery. If we yearn for our students to experience writing in this light, we need to create a space in our classrooms that allows for Aristotle's art of wondering and encourages Plato's motley of ideas. We need to promote students' ruminations about life, rather than privilege their explaining of it, in a space that allows for vulnerability and contradictions along their paths to discovery.",

        "author":["Isaacson, Emily Ruth"],
        "description":"Given what seems a constant barrage of criticism aimed at the academy from politicians and the public--and the great concern for buzz words like accountability and transparency--it has become fairly routine to see a defense of the humanities in opinion pieces in &quot;Inside Higher Education,&quot; &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education,&quot; &quot;The New York Times,&quot; and even CNN.com. The pieces range from defending the intrinsic worth of the humanities to defending the concrete skills that teachers teach, like critical thinking and writing. Most of these arguments seem to imply that it is one way or the other; the defenders who argue for the former tend to see the pragmatic conversation as sullying the aesthetics of the disciplines, while the defenders arguing for the latter see the lack of discussion of anything other than marketable skills as pie-in-the-sky idealism. The author is certainly not the first to make this observation--and she hopes that she is not the last--but she thinks it is possible to make both arguments. In this article, the author first considers the role the humanities play in the teaching of those core skills of critical thinking, one of the more practical aspects of the humanities. Though, of course, she hopes that she also conveys to her students her own love of literary studies, with the focus on the beauty of the art and the intellectual stimulation of literary criticism. From there, the author will present her own experience of teaching Renaissance Literature as a case study in the ways that teachers can teach critical thinking in their literature classrooms.",

        "author":["Lear, Ashley"],
        "description":"Supplementing classroom instruction with online materials and learning activities is becoming less avant-garde and more of an expectation for faculty members in higher education. The use of Blackboard, WebCT, or proprietary software, like Georgia Institute of Technology's Sakai installation (T-Square), has become a requirement, rather than an option. Citing both Project Tomorrow's &quot;Speak Up 2008&quot; report and &quot;Visions 2020.2,&quot; a report based on a survey sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Department of Education, and NetDay, a nonprofit organization in California, the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; concluded in their &quot;The College of 2020: Students&quot; report that the students of 2020 &quot;are restless with the traditional forms of learning and eager to incorporate into their educations the electronic tools that have become omnipresent in their lives: their smartphones, laptop computers, iPods, and MP3 players&quot; (Van Der Werf and Sabatier 7). Faculty intent on reaching such students must devise nuanced methods of course delivery and revise course assignments to more comprehensively account for these shifting paradigms. As these alterations are made, faculty must also devise new systems of evaluating student work when it reaches beyond the discipline-specific learning outcomes to include technical writing and digital design components. In constructing an interdisciplinary course on the intersections between science and science fiction at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, one of my goals was to create assignments that challenged students' technical prowess, as well as their skills with writing and critical analysis. Requiring students to learn or improve upon their HTML skills by developing webpages, rather than traditional essay assignments, allowed me to more easily convey the idea of technical languages as having their own rhetorical principles. The complexity of the projects required a staged evaluation process that ultimately challenged students to work far beyond the assignment &quot;requirements,&quot; as they began to truly explore the boundaries between different modes of discourse.

The following discussion does not claim to offer examples of cutting-edge methodological work. That is not our goal here; rather, the purpose of this article is to further Rebecca Rickly's call for increased curricular attention to empirical field research (\"Messy Contexts: Research as a Rhetorical Situation\") by offering three case studies--micro studies. Completed as part of a graduate methods class, the studies illustrate the emerging researchers' research experiences with conducting small-scale, \"practice\" observational inquiry. Our claim, then, is simple: we tend to forget how thoroughly we have already been enculturated as rhetoric and composition researchers--we tend, that is, to be unaware of the depth and complexity of our own literacies once they become second nature to us. But what may very well seem obvious to established researchers, whether it be the questions posed, the methods used, or the findings reported, are only obvious to those of us who have already had at least one (and likely many) such enculturating experiences. The authors--three student participants and the course instructor of the same graduate methods seminar--narrate critical, self-reflective, self-selected micro studies in order to examine how students of writing researchers came to identify and employ methods and methodologies as a way of \"learning and using\" writing studies research. The studies, which include a survey of first-year college students on their transition from high school to college; an examination of the actions, sounds, and voices the researcher observed in the hallway of a researcher's office building in her participant observation of \"work in action;\" and a textual analysis of Works Cited pages of College Composition and Communication serve as examples of the very real benefits of--and the need for--practical, hands-on experience enacting observational research methods and methodologies.

My teaching philosophy is informed by the indigenous-centered, decolonial methodologies as defined by Devon Mihesuah who calls for &quot;indigenizing&quot; the academy by challenging the status quo and debating the controversial issues that adversely affect the lives and representations of Native Americans (&quot;Indigenizing the Academy&quot;, 2004). I argue that an indigenous-centered pedagogy and multidisciplinary approach gives students the opportunity to critically examine those instances of cultural tourism and popular media stereotypes that continue to perpetuate gross misconceptions about American Indian identity and culture. In addition, I highlight the ongoing challenges that instructors face when teaching students to &quot;unlearn&quot; Eurocentric histories and dominant national narratives. I have taught Native American Studies courses to a wide range of students from multiple backgrounds and thus, this essay will be based on the various experiences I have had in the classroom at five different institutions in the past eight years (i.e. Ivy League, small liberal arts college, state college, and university).

        "description":"Teaching service courses such as the first year composition courses and an introduction to literature is often a primary mission for English departments on campuses in the United States. Sometimes specific departments request specialized additional English classes such as Writing for Business, basic grammar courses, composition courses focused for specific colleges such as, on the author's campus at West Virginia State University (WVSU), English 202: Writing for the Sciences (West Virginia Catalog 132), and Media Studies 502: Graduate Research and Writing (West Virginia Catalog 165). All of these courses mentioned above are written and taught by WVSU English department faculty. Demonstrating the value of material taught in these service courses is an essential step for active learning. Students often resist instruction in service courses simply because these students do not understand the need for and the benefits of courses not in their major subjects. Instead of perceiving the benefits of courses such as a First Year/Freshmen Experience course and service course requirements for a basic foundation in, typically, math and English students often just see added costs and delays toward the day they graduate from college and begin living the lives they have imagined through all the years of their educations.

        "description":"Though many teachers have adopted collaborative models for teaching writing and literature, much of classroom discussion, in small or large groups, is driven by the assumption that arguing ideas is a competitive exercise. Generally, essays written in this context are &quot;counter-positional&quot; and &quot;agonistic,&quot; supporting points by eliminating/discrediting others and shaped by either/or extremes. Such extreme views create false dichotomies rather than thought-out perspectives, a reflection of the often counter-productive argument students see most in the media. Such argumentation actually polarizes people and shuts down dialogue. To adopt other models, it is important to look across the borders of argumentative discussion. This essay offers two alternative models of collaboration and essay construction, one from India, based in an approach to argument known as &quot;Nyaya,&quot; the other based on feminist perspectives based in the ideas of Sonja Foss and Cynthia Griffin.",

        "description":"For the author, the key analytic question about a popular song is not \"What does it mean?\" or \"What hidden or coded meaning does it express?\" but \"What does its popularity tell us about the cultural moment when it resonated with its public?\" How did the song \"create its audience,\" so to speak? Obviously, a 1973 hit song, if it could time-travel, would meet with a different fate in 1943 or 2013. It's not in a vacuum that a song makes a splash, pushes psychic buttons, rings a bell, creates good vibrations, or bangs a gong in the public mind. It is a hit in the sense that contact is made with the hearts and minds of particular people at a particular moment in their history. It is the reception of a song that can be most productively analyzed--not timeless meanings. Songs are cultural artifacts that are uniquely and especially of their moment. For that reason, the author has been experimenting with a Popular Song Analysis assignment in advanced composition courses--an assignment in which he tries to steer students away from limiting their analysis strictly to lyrics. What kind of student writing, then, can be elicited by an assignment such as this? In this article the author discusses the outcome of this assignment.",

        "description":"The author created and has been teaching a first-year seminar (FYS) called &quot;Food for Thought: Rhetoric of the Edible&quot; for the past three years. Sustainability and ethics in the production and consumption of food have been tangential topics that have arisen in the course. While her academic background is composition and rhetoric, food has become a research interest in recent years as she has learned alongside her students in this course. The interdisciplinary aspects of the course have changed significantly each time she has taught the course. Here, she focuses on connections with political science, sociology, and chemistry faculty. The aforementioned Food Politics serves as a framework for the political science connections as teachers discuss how politics influence food sustainability. In her partnership with a sociology course, she and the teachers examine how social and cultural customs affect sustainability, specifically how adherence (or lack of adherence) to social codes impacts the ethics of sustainability. In addition to her teaching partnership with political science and sociology, she has also integrated course content with an introductory chemistry class, examining how genetically modifying the chemical composition of food affects sustainability as well as the benefits and drawbacks of chemical-free farms.",

The literature on language teacher supervision from the past few decades consists largely of descriptions of supervisory approaches (Bailey, 2009) and analysis of the supervisory discourse (Hooton, 2008; Wajnryb, 1994; 1995; 1998; Wallace &amp; Woolger, 1991). This study makes a unique contribution to this field, as it offers a detailed account of what happened before, during, and after a supervisor visited her native-English-speaking (NES) supervisee who co-taught with a non-native-English-speaking (NNES) teacher in an elementary school English classroom in Taiwan. Data suggest that the supervisor's comments were a wake-up call for the NNES teacher, who therefore started to play a more active role in team teaching. However, the supervisor's visits and suggestions did not create a lasting impact on helping her NES supervisee to improve her teaching. Practical implications as well as future research directions are offered to conclude the paper. (Contains 1 table and 6 notes.)",

        "author":["Kao, Chian-Wen"],
        "description":"It has been debated whether teachers should treat students' grammatical errors in second language writing instruction (Truscott, 1996, 1999, 2010; Ferris, 1999, 2004, 2010). Several meta-analyses have investigated correction effects (e.g. Russell & Spada, 2006; Truscott, 2007). Their findings, however, have been conflicting. A recent trend to distinguish specific grammar error types from one another to evaluate correction effects has attracted much attention in written feedback literature (Bitchener & Knoch, 2010ab; Sheen, Wright & Moldawa, 2009). The present meta-analysis, following the recent trend, attempts to assess different types of focused direct correction effects on learners' acquisition of the English article system. Based on Truscott's (2007) inclusion and exclusion criteria, six and five effect sizes are extracted for direct correction type and metalinguistic explanation type separately from seven focused feedback studies. Both direct correction and metalinguistic explanation have large positive effects on learners' ability to accurately use English articles in their writings in terms of long-term learning. This suggests that direct correction may be sufficient for students' acquisition of English articles. Studies to correct other error types should be conducted in the future.

The results showed that learner-instructor interaction, learner-content interaction, and Internet self-efficacy were good predictors of student satisfaction while interactions among students and self-regulated learning did not contribute to student satisfaction. Learner-content interaction explained the largest unique variance in student satisfaction. Additionally, gender, class level, and time spent online per week seemed to have influence on learner-learner interaction, Internet self-efficacy, and self-regulation. (Contains 8 tables.)",

        "description":"The use of e-learning for on-the-job training has grown exponentially in the last decade due to it being accepted by people in charge of businesses. Few papers have explored virtual training from the workers' standpoint, that is, the perception they have about the different training methodologies (face-to-face vs. virtual) and the attitudes they have towards on-the-job learning. Training, in this context, is an investment for both the two participating agents: businesses and workers. It seems logical that knowing the perceptions and attitudes shown by the targets of the training is, at least, as important as knowing the advantages for the companies. To analyse workers' perceptions and attitudes we conducted an online survey of 2,000 employees of the leading European savings bank, CaixaBank (http://www.caixabank.com/index_en.html), on training habits, perceptions, motivations, and disincentives of undertaking face-to-face or online instruction. The results reveal that workers perceive e-learning as a more flexible and up-to-date training methodology. On the other hand, face-to-face training continues to be perceived as a more motivating methodology compared to virtuality and with better explanations from the course trainers. As regards motivations given by the workers when it comes to training, there are three main groups of attitudes: those which are more affective and social, those which reveal poor adaptability or fear of the new training requirements, and, finally, those linked to the knowledge society. Such results state that while the benefits of distance methodology can be clearly identified from the company's point of view (i.e., as a flexible and efficient methodology to develop the employees' skills and knowledge), from the employees' standpoint, the advantages of virtual training are not so clear and depend to a great extent on their attitude towards the use of virtuality.

The OER architecture framework is articulated with six dimensions: pedagogical, technological, managerial, academic, financial, and ethical. These dimensions are structured with the component areas of relevance: IT infrastructure services, management support systems, open content development and maintenance, online teaching-learning, and learner assessment and evaluation of the OER architecture framework. An OER knowledge and information base, including a web portal, is proposed in the form of a series of knowledge repositories. This system would not only streamline the delivery of distance education but also would enhance the quality of distance learning through the development of high quality e-content, instructional processes, course/programme content development, IT infrastructure, and network systems. Thus the proposed OER architecture framework when implemented in the distance education system (DES) of India would improve the quality of distance education and also increase its accessibility in a well-organised and structured way.

Open and distance learning (ODL) provides an innovative strategy and praxis for developing and newly industrialized countries to reach their educational and socio-economical objectives through professional development and training. In order to examine factors which affect the success of ODL offered by the North-West University in South Africa, a qualitative and quantitative research approach is used. Factors examined include face-to-face classroom contact, the implementation and use of ICTs, and e-readiness. The relationships between these factors are also discussed. A questionnaire was administered to 87 teacher-students in four Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) programs to collect quantitative data regarding aspects of their classes and the e-readiness of students. This data was qualitatively elaborated upon by three semi-structured, open-ended focus-group interviews. Besides descriptive statistics, Spearman's rank-order correlations (r) were determined between variables pertaining to negative feelings towards face-to-face classroom contact, ODL as students' choice of delivery mode, and students' positive attitude towards information and communication technology (ICT). Combined quantitative and qualitative findings were used to evaluate the effectiveness of contact classes as well as the e-readiness of students towards the attainment of ODL development Phase D. This phase refers to UNESCO's description of ICT implementation, integration, and use. Relationships (Spearman's rank-order correlations) between ODL, as teacher-students' choice of educational delivery mode, and aspects of their e-readiness suggest that the e-readiness of teacher-students is implicit to their choice of ODL as educational delivery mode for professional development.

In fact, the choice of skills that are important to learning communities and the labour market has been the subject of controversy because it involves heterogeneous motives among different groups. This paper compares the perceptions of employability skills in a sample of teachers from the Universidade Aberta and a sample of students who attend a local learning centre at this University. The research focused on the following dimensions: a) the most important employability skills, and b) the employability skills to be developed in online undergraduate degrees. To collect the required data, a questionnaire was prepared and applied to students and teachers, taking the theoretical model of Knight and Yorke (2006) as its main reference. In spite of the specificity of each group, the results revealed some similarities between students and teachers with regard to employability. The conclusions also highlighted the need to promote research on this matter in online education. (Contains 6 figures, 4 tables and 4 footnotes.)",

        "description":"Remix is touted as one of the most important practices within the field of open educational resources (OER). But remixing is still not mainstream practice in education and the barriers and limitations to remix are not well known. In this article we discuss the design and development of a print and web-based booklet created to introduce the topic of OER to schoolteachers. The guide, the first of its kind available in Portuguese, was created through the remix and translation of existing resources available in English. Choosing design-as-remix raised a series of concerns related to licensing, attribution, context, and technical standards. In this article we review the concerns related to culture and inequity within the OER movement, followed by the design choices and procedures, and finally the implications of these issues for the open educational resources movement.

There are various reasons: Researchers know that conclusions may eventually be proved wrong; publications are sometimes retracted; effects may decline when studied later; researchers occasionally don't seem to know about papers they have allegedly authored; there are even accusations of fraud (Cohen, 2011). In this exploratory case study, 10 papers were examined to determine the various ways they were used by others, whether there were cases of reported effects declining, and whether, among those who referenced the papers, there were suggestions that anything in the papers ought to be retracted. Findings showed that all the papers had been referenced by others (337 user publications were found, containing a total of 868 references). Other findings include the following: \"Single references\" were far more common than \"multiple references\"; \"applications/replications\" were the least common type of usage (23 occurrences), followed by \"contrasts/elaborations\" (34), and \"quotations\" (65); unlike reports regarding publications in the sciences, whether the paper was \"solo-\" or \"co-authored\" did not affect usage; appearance in a \"non-prestige journal\" was actually associated with more usage of some kinds; and well over 80% of uses were in heavily scrutinized sources (\"journal articles\" or \"theses/dissertations\"). The paper concludes with recommendations to writers about how to avoid producing publications that are ignored. (Contains 5 tables.)",

        "description":"Many open universities and distance education institutions have shifted from a predominantly print-based mode of delivery to an online mode characterised by the use of virtual learning environments and various web technologies. This paper describes the impact of the shift to open and distance e-learning (ODeL), as this trend might be called, on the course design practices of faculty members at a small single-mode distance education university in the Philippines. Specifically, the paper presents and analyses the faculty's perspectives on how their course design practices have changed and issues and challenges arising from these changes. The findings suggest that faculty training programs in ODeL should aim to develop a comprehensive range of ODeL competencies in a systematic and coherent way. Based on the findings, as well as research on practitioner development in teaching effectively with technology, a framework for developing ODeL competencies among faculty is proposed. Aside from covering the four areas of change in course design practice identified in the study, the framework also specifies levels of expertise (basic, intermediate, and advanced), indicating degrees of complexity of the knowledge and skills required for each area at each level. All of the competencies listed for all four areas at the basic level comprise the minimum competencies for teaching an online distance education course.

        "description":"This paper describes a specially developed online peer-review system, the Peer Portal, and the first results of its use for quality enhancement of bachelor's and master's thesis manuscripts. The peer-review system is completely student driven and therefore saves time for supervisors and creates a direct interaction between students without interference from supervisors. The purpose is to improve thesis manuscript quality, and thereby use supervisor time more efficiently, since peers review basic aspects of the manuscripts and give constructive suggestions for improvements. The process was initiated in 2012, and, in total, 260 peer reviews were completed between 1st January and 15th May, 2012. All peer reviews for this period have been analyzed with the help of content analysis. The purpose of analysis is to assess the quality of the students work. The results are categorized in four groups: 1) excellent (18.1%), 2) good (22.7%), 3) fragmented (18.5%), and 4) poor (40.7%). The overall result shows that almost 40% of the students produced excellent or good peer reviews and almost as many produced poor peer reviews. The result shows that the quality varies considerably. Explanations of these quality variations need further study. However, alternative hypotheses followed by some strategic suggestions are discussed in this study. Finally, a way forward in terms of improving peer reviews is outlined: 1) development of a peer wizard system and 2) rating of received peer reviews based on the quality categories created in this study. A Peer Portal version 2.0 is suggested, which will eliminate the fragmented and poor quality peer reviews, but still keep this review system student driven and ensure autonomous learning.

Individuals belong to multiple communities connected though complex relationships consisting of people, resources, rituals, and ties.

This paper explores the question of how learning occurs in compound communities from the perspective of &quot;knowledge capital,&quot; that is, the communities' collective knowledge, skill, and perspective, as well as relationships and connections among members. Through interviews conducted with postgraduate students belonging to multiple communities, we identified issues related to conflict between communities, closed-congregation communities, privacy, and reputation.

        "description":"Open distance learning (ODL) has long been an important option for formal and non-formal education (NFE) in most developed and developing countries, but less so in post-conflict countries, including Cambodia. However, in Cambodia there is now greater awareness that ODL can complement traditional face-to-face educational approaches, particularly as there is a shortage of teachers in the country. Thus, understanding how ODL can achieve learning and other objectives has important implications for both formal education and NFE. If it can be found to be effective, ODL has the potential of reaching a large number of people at comparatively lower average costs. This paper reports on a project where the same content was taught to farmers in Cambodia via traditional face-to-face and via ODL and compares outcomes between the different training methods. Exploring the extent to which farmers had adopted new farm practices taught in the course, our results indicate that the outcomes did not vary considerably between those trained using the different approaches.

Interest has grown steadily over the past decade in making a university-level education openly available to students around the globe who would otherwise be overlooked, and recommendations for how to do this are well documented (e.g., UNESCO, 2002; OECD, 2007). Initiatives in the United States (Thille, 2012), Canada (Stacey, 2011b), Africa (OER Africa, n.d.), and the United Kingdom (JISC, 2012) are easily accessed and case studies abound (e.g., Barrett, Grover, Janowski, van Lavieren, Ojo, &amp; Schmidt, 2009). Supporting the widespread availability of OER is a goal that Athabasca University (AU) has embraced through association with the Commonwealth of Learning and by becoming a charter member of the OER University (OERu, 2011). The use of OER in AU programs has strategic local implications that go beyond the five reasons for institutions to engage in OER projects described by Hylen (2006).

        "description":"As the world becomes more digitized, there will be an increasing need to make available learning resources in electronic format for access by information and communication technologies. The question education will face is whether these learning resources will be available for learners to access at no cost or affordable cost so that there will be equity in access by anyone regardless of location, status, or background. With initiatives such as the Millennium Development Goals and Education For All by the United Nations (United Nations, 2011) learning materials must be available as open education resources to achieve the goals. Currently, most learning materials are available at a cost for people to purchase to learn, or they have to travel to a specific location (school or library) to access learning materials. In some parts of the world, especially in developing countries, these costs are prohibitive, preventing learners from achieving a basic level of education so that they can be productive in society and improve their quality of life (Bhavnani et al., 2008). Some would say that people in remote locations and developing countries do not have computers to access learning materials. It is true that many do not have desktop or laptop computers to access learning materials, but they have mobile devices and are now obtaining tablets with wireless capability to allow them to access learning materials from anywhere and at any time. These countries are bypassing the wired desktop stage and moving directly to wireless mobile technology (Bhavnani et al., 2008). Storing open education resources (OER) in electronic repositories will allow learners to access the resources using mobile technology. With mobile technologies, learners can complete coursework and assessments from anywhere and send their work to their tutors electronically and receive feedback (GSMA, 2011).",

        "description":"E-learning technologies have allowed authoring and playback of standardized reusable learning objects (RLO) for several years. Effective mobile learning requires similar functionality at both design time and runtime. Mobile devices can play RLO using applications like SMILE, mobile access to a learning management system (LMS), or other systems which deploy content to mobile learners (Castillo &amp; Ayala, 2008; Chu, Hwang, &amp; Tseng, 2010; Hsu &amp; Chen, 2010; Nakabayashi, 2009; Zualkernan, Nikkhah, &amp; Al-Sabah, 2009). However, implementations which author content in a mobile context do not typically permit reuse across multiple contexts due to a lack of standardization. Standards based (IMS and SCORM) authoring implementations exist for non-mobile platforms (Gonzalez-Barbone &amp; Anido-Rifon, 2008; Griffiths, Beauvoir, Liber, &amp; Barrett-Baxendale, 2009; Tellez, 2010; Yang, Chiu, Tsai, &amp; Wu, 2004). However, this paradigm precludes capturing learning where and when it occurs. Consequently, RLO authored for e-learning lack learner generated content, especially with timely, relevant, and location aware examples. (Contains 6 figures.)",

        "description":"For several years, the importance of continuous education has been stressed by several governmental and non-governmental institutions (Janssen &amp; Schuwer, 2012; Marshall &amp; Casserly, 2006). Education is seen as important both for personal growth and empowerment for one's personal wellbeing and for developing the professional capabilities needed in today's society. In his 2011 State of the Union address President Obama put emphasis on the government's ambitions to &quot;out-innovate and out-educate&quot; the rest of the world. Almost at the same time, at the Davos World Economic Forum (2011), the urgency of appropriate education was stressed, observing that the current lack of adequately educated people hinders prosperity and economic growth in the near future. The OECD is preparing a proposal to translate these intentions into a concrete policy. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)",

        "description":"This paper presents the rationale, common practices, challenges, and some personal anecdotes from a journal editor on the production, use, and re-use of peer-reviewed scholarly articles as open educational resources (OER). The scholarly and professional discourse related to open educational resources has largely focused on open learning objects, courseware, and textbooks. However, especially in graduate education, articles published in scholarly journals are often a major component of the course content in formal education. In addition, open access journal articles are critical to expanding access to knowledge by scholars in the developing world and in fostering citizen science, by which everyone has access to the latest academic information and research results. In this article, I highlight some of the challenges, economic models, and evidence for quality of open access journal content and look at new affordances provided by the Net for enhanced functionality, access, and distribution. In the 17 years since I graduated with a doctorate degree, the climate and acceptance of open access publishing has almost reversed itself. I recall a conversation with my PhD supervisor in which he argued that publishing online was not a viable option as the product would not have permanency, scholarly recognition, or the prestige of a paper publication. His comments reflect the confusion between online resources and those described as open access, but as well illustrate the change in academic acceptance and use of open access products during the past decade. The evolution from paper to online production and consumption is a disruptive technology in which much lower cost and increased accessibility of online work opens the product to a completely new group of potential users. In the case of OER these consumers are primarily students, but certainly access to scholars from all parts of the globe and the availability to support citizen science (Silvertown, 2009) should not be underestimated.

These were sometimes large-scale but more often not, and they were primarily initiated by innovating educational institutions and explorative individual experts. What has remained, however, is the quest for a sustainable perspective, in spite of the many attempts in the OER community for clear-cut solutions to the problem of sustainability. This is a major barrier for mainstreaming the OER approach in national educational systems. At the end of the first decade, and more so at the beginning of the second decade (2011-2020), we are witnessing in a few countries emerging efforts to develop and establish a national OER approach. That is required in order to break down the barrier for mainstreaming OER. Making the OER approach sustainable cannot be left to the educational institutions only, but should be facilitated in a national setting. (Contains 2 figures and 15 online resources.)",

This study analysed English, Spanish, and Portuguese OER queries over a long-term period (2007-2011). The data retrieval was conducted using four online platforms: two academic journal databases (Web of Knowledge and Scopus), one video-sharing Web site (YouTube), and one document-sharing Web site (Scribd). The number (more than 32,860) of search results collected indicate an increasing interest in online OER discussion across languages, particularly outside academic journal databases. Additionally, a widening \"language gap\" between OER discussions in English and other languages was identified in several platforms. This research reports some of the cultural and language challenges caused by the expansion of the OER discussion and highlights relevant findings in this field. (Contains 4 figures and 3 tables.)",

First, Vygotsky's cultural heritage as a Jew during the transformation from Tsarist Russia to the Soviet Union is considered as a factor in his views on defectology and inclusion. The review then outlines his perspective on the \"defect,\" including his definition of \"defect,\" his view of the generative potential of overcoming the obstacles of biological difference, and his consideration of the secondary defect of low self-worth that follows from being treated as different and defective. Finally, the review considers his defectological writing as part of his broader effort to formulate a theory of situated, mediated human development. This section includes attention to how cultures provide developmental contours within which to promote both individual and collective development toward particular ends; how collective activity provides the socialization through which those developing outside the diagnostic norm may proceed toward such collective ends; and how Vygotsky conceived of education in order to address the developmental needs of evolutionarily different children. The paper concludes with the implications of Vygotsky's work for the education of children of difference. (Contains 7 footnotes.)",

It investigated how the social context of the program influenced the writing of the focal students, the ways that they identified themselves as writers, and the risks that they took in their works. It also examined if the participants' experiences at the program were influenced by their gender. The study used a cross-case analysis to explore in-common and unique themes in the students' experiences. The findings address three themes: community, risk-taking, and the perceived influence of gender, indicating the participants experienced these themes in ways that were common in some ways, but also distinct based on the participants' individual characteristics and the aspects of the Workshop each identified as most significant.",

        "description":"Current research suggests that it is imperative for researchers and educators to pay more attention to the needs of African American adolescent girls and how their race and gender affect schooling (Fordham, 1993; Morris, 2007). The purpose of this study was to highlight the lived experiences of two African American adolescent girls when they used the African American women's speech practice, \"Talking with an Attitude\" (TWA), with their teachers. Using phenomenology and Afrocentric feminist epistemology as methodological and theoretical approaches, interviews were used to collect and analyze data that revealed the nature of their lived experiences. Van Manen's description of selective highlighting of statements that point to themes was used as a means of analysis. The findings indicate that the girls reappropriated the use of TWA to resist what they perceived to be hostility and disrespect on the part of their teachers. (Contains 2 footnotes.)",

        "author":["Nieto, Sonia"],
        "description":"This article focuses on the intersections among language, literacy, and culture, and what these intersections have meant for the author personally, and what they can mean for students who have been marginalized, neglected, or made invisible by traditional understandings of the role of education. Although not linked conceptually in the past, the more recent tendency to connect language, literacy, and culture gives a richer picture of learning, especially for students whose identities are related to language, race, ethnicity, and immigrant status have traditionally had a low status in many societies. One result of this reconceptualization is that more education programs are reflecting and promoting a sociocultural perspective in language and literacy. Such a perspective is firmly rooted in an anthropological and sociological understanding of culture, a view of learning as socially constructed, and an understanding of how students from diverse segments of society experience schooling, due to differential access to literacy specifically, and to education more broadly. The context the author discusses in this article is grounded in her own experience as a Puerto Rican second-generation immigrant--also called &quot;Nuyorican&quot; or, more recently, &quot;Diasporican&quot;--in the United States, although the implications for teaching and learning go beyond her own limited experience. She is aware that multiple and conflicting ideas exist about these theoretical perspectives, but some basic tenets of sociocultural theory can serve as a platform for this article. Here, the author explores a number of these tenets, illustrating them with examples from her own experiences to demonstrate why a sociocultural perspective is invaluable in uncovering some of the tensions and dilemmas of schooling and diversity.",

        "description":"Teacher/practitioner research, with its emphasis on the intimate relationship between knowledge and teaching, can be a methodological basis for developing rich conceptions of literacy and alternative practices. Teacher researchers theorize from the thick of things, from actual educational contexts that they shape daily. This informs new practices and educational possibilities for students. Like disability studies, activist teacher research is concerned with the relationship between the built world and social identity and agency. Both frameworks challenge medical models for diagnosing and individuating identities, and emphasize how material structures and social practices stigmatize differences and curtail access to fuller human flourishing. These perspectives also suggest alternatives. As a methodological stance on classroom practice, practitioner research provides a framework for working against deficit notions of students' identities and literacy practices, and working toward re-envisioning the &quot;normal&quot; in classrooms as intersections of students' multiple worlds of culture, language, experience, and potential. In this article, the authors draw on their own work and the work of other literacy teacher researchers to describe three ways educators resist the normal curve through what they characterize as counter-practices. Drawing on disability studies, the authors analyze how these kinds of resistances characterize different but overlapping understandings of educational access with their own contradictions and possibilities. In their conclusion, the authors look across the examples to suggest how activist literacies involve challenging the ideological foundations of institutions and practices.",

The authors describe the aspects of curriculum and pedagogy common across the AfC programs and analyze the specific contribution of multimodal arts production to the benefits that participants identify from the AfC programs.

As such, the article invites the readers to view imagination and aesthetic education as active steps in creating awareness toward empathy and promoting socially just classrooms and practices. In addition, this article describes the implementation of one graduate in-service teacher's learned knowledge of aesthetic education into her own high school English classroom in an attempt to raise awareness for social justice.

Dialoguing about students' visual and literary identity texts proved to be an innovative and engaging way to explore what it means to place Aboriginal students' identities at the center of the curriculum.

        "description":"Recent Australian government initiatives in the early childhood education and care sector are placing demands for an increase in the number of degree qualified early childhood teachers. Many universities are now offering courses with dual qualifications as a way to provide alternate career opportunities for pre-service teachers; however it cannot be assumed that an equal number of graduates will filter into both primary school and early childhood education jobs. This paper presents a study which examined the expected career choices of pre-service teachers from two Victorian universities who were undertaking a dual early childhood/primary qualification. The findings of the study have implications for teacher education curriculum design in relation to the practical components of courses. The authors therefore argue that more attention needs to be focused on the practical components of teacher training courses considering issues of quality and timing.",

        "author":["Kim, Minkang"],
        "description":"Teachers are expected to act ethically and provide moral role models in performing their duties, even though teacher education has often relegated the cultivation of teachers' ethical awareness and moral development to the margins. When it is addressed, the main theoretical assumptions have relied heavily on the cognitivist developmental theories of Piaget and Kohlberg. A major pedagogical problem in adopting these theories of moral reasoning is that they may not help teachers to act as moral agents in real-life classrooms. This paper argues that one underlying difficulty is the insufficient attention given to the role of emotion in moral reasoning, even though it is increasingly accepted that rationality is laced with emotions and, moreover, emotions are crucial in brain functioning. This paper presents recent empirical findings, viewing them through the lens of dynamic systems theory, and discusses how they may help to inform and strengthen the cultivation of teachers' moral/ethical literacy in teacher education.",

The study builds on earlier work by this research team on attitudes towards inclusion and offers a more comprehensive picture of pre-service teachers' preparedness to teach in inclusive classrooms. Data were collected from 380 pre-service teachers in four countries. Results indicated that strong international differences existed. Other factors impacting responses regarding teaching self-efficacy for inclusion include the type of teacher preparation program offered by the institution; variations in the level of knowledge about inclusion law and policy; previous interactions with people with disabilities; confidence levels in teaching people with disabilities; and, prior teaching experience and training in working with students with disabilities. Implications for ongoing development of international teacher preparation programs are discussed within the context of improving self-efficacy. (Contains 6 tables.)",

The aim of this literature review is to remind readers of this important period on the lives of young people and the diverse range of issues which they face. There is general consensus in the literature that well-designed and implemented transition approaches can assist in the process of supporting students, their families and school staff. Teachers are crucial in supporting children and young people moving in, between and out of school and making these transitions positive experiences. Therefore, pre-service teacher education needs to include awareness and understanding of the main issues in relation to transition. Teacher educators need to consider how they can incorporate transition programs and strategies in their courses to ensure that graduate teachers have the skills and knowledge to mediate some of the pressures that their students are facing when dealing with transitions.

The study was conducted on 561 Turkish preservice classroom teachers at the end of the 2011-2012 Fall Semester. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to ascertain the validity of the scale. For the reliability of the scale Cronbach Alpha reliability, Spearman Brown split-half test and item-total test correlations were calculated. Reexamination of the scale led to a new scale structure comprised of a single factor with ten items. The altered version of the scale proved psychometrically stronger. Based on the results of the study, it can be suggested that the PEAS-PCT is a valid and reliable scale. (Contains 2 figures and 3 tables.)",

Data in the form of an assemblage of pre service teachers' narratives are presented to show how both the lived and living body contributes to thoughts and ideas about HPE. Discussion also reflects on the pedagogical merits of using narrative in pre service teacher education. We contend that narrative has a potentially important role to play in pre service teachers coming to better understand their bodies and can assist in moving them beyond what they experienced as HPE as school students.

        "description":"Achieving a sustainable future requires that individuals adopt sustainable behaviors, which are often learned and cemented at a young age. Yet, traditional education efforts have been inadequate in fostering transformative change, in part because many programs focus on fact-heavy, teacher-centered techniques while neglecting the practices that behavioral and sustainability scholars highlight as central to creating change. To address this gap, the pre-sent research integrates three critical yet mostly disparate bodies of research--educational pedagogy, behavior change, and sustainability competencies. This interdisciplinary approach to education was implemented and evaluated with a small group of students during an intensive summer program and year-long case study. The curriculum focused on food and waste behaviors and utilized experiential, real-world, problem-based methods in order to increase competence in sustainability and promote pro-environmental actions. The impact of the program was assessed through surveys, interviews, videos, and participant observations. The data showed that significant changes in knowledge and behaviors were achieved, while suggesting that social knowledge in terms of food is more resistant to change as compared to that of waste. Throughout the year, students maintained significant behavior changes in terms of their waste decisions; however, sustainable food behaviors were more resistant to long-term change due to the students' social and cultural environment. This article will detail the education program and assessment techniques while highlighting each student's unique characteristics, barriers to change, and motivations for action.

Field trips, ecology-based nature education programs, nature camps and science education instruction in non-traditional settings were used as educational intervention in the selected studies. Later, these studies were subjected to content analysis to present the trends and to synthesize the common findings of the selected studies. The techniques and instructions used as the intervention in these selected studies were observed to contribute to development of participants' gains associated with knowledge of the environment and nature, perception of nature, environmental affect, responsible environment behaviors and conception and understanding of science.

        "description":"The present study explores the use of a conventional school ground of a primary school and its potential as a space for creative play and environmental learning. Children's play behavior and views of the school ground are explored, as well as their vision for its improvement. The research constitutes part of a wider school ground project and was carried out in a primary school in Volos city, Greece, during the 2010-2011 schoolyear. Geographical and participatory design methods were used that capture children's experience of space and their will for participation in redesigning their school ground. They included mapping of the physical features of the school ground, children's drawings, interviews with children, and observation and mapping of children's behavior in the school ground. Results indicate that children primarily view their school ground as a space for recreation, play, relaxation, and communication with peers. They mainly emphasize structured, pre-constructed elements, such as the football and basketball grounds, or the kiosk, which they use in both conventional and unconventional ways. However, the participants do not seem to have developed an adequate sense of place and belonging in their school ground environment. The paper presents insights on children's play behavior and views for their school ground, the role of children as participants in the school ground design, and design principles for the improvement of the school ground as they have emerged from the research.

        "description":"Science teachers frequently select science news articles as supplementary teaching materials; however, the literature indicates that students encounter difficulties in examining and evaluating the news content and textual elements. This paper reports an instructional strategy of utilizing science news articles and investigates its effectiveness in enhancing students' cognitive learning outcomes. In this quasi-experimental study, 118 seventh graders from four classes in one secondary school in Taiwan took part in the Science News Instruction (SNI). After eight weeks of instruction about Genetics and Reproduction, all students were requested to present their written arguments to the selected science news article. Two of the classes were prompted to link to their science content knowledge (the CK-SNI group, n = 56), whereas their counterpart peers were not instructed to link to their science content knowledge (the SNI group, n = 62). The analysis of students' written artifacts revealed that the CK-SNI group performed significantly better on examining the data and claims made in the science news, producing warrants of higher quality to support their reasoning about the relationship between data and claims, and providing better reasons to refute the identified causal textual elements. Furthermore, the results of ANCOVA indicate that the CK-SNI group outperformed the SNI group on the cognitive test, with the largest improvement at Apply level (eta[subscript p][superscript 2] = 0.10). We conclude that prompting students to examine news content based on the content knowledge they learned is effective in fostering students to evaluate the science news critically, and thus make a positive impact on students' cognitive learning.

The one-group pre, post, and delayed posttest design was used, and participants' understandings before, immediately after, and months after the instruction were assessed using the same \"three part particulate drawing\" classification question constructed by Sanger (2000). Collected data were analyzed according to both the number of scientifically appropriate classifications, and the types and nature of scientifically inappropriate classifications made by preservice teachers. The results of these two analyses were quite parallel to each other and showed that this specific instruction promoted the development of participants' scientific understandings of the structure of matter. It should be noticed that while the effect of the instruction appeared extremely positive based on the results of the statistical analyses which solely compared the number of scientifically appropriate classifications, it was reflected more accurately after the participants' scientifically inappropriate classifications of the structure of matter were analyzed more thoroughly. It was also found that although some scientifically inappropriate classifications were changed to scientifically appropriate ones following the instruction, some of them reverted back to their initial status months after the instruction.

Activity theory was used as a theoretical and methodological framework to analyze the development of the activity and revealed to be a fruitful approach to better understand real-life and complex situations within a school community. Special attention was given to dynamic relations and changes that took place as the activity was unfolding. The contribution of the nine classes in the analyzed activity was possible due to the collaboration of several members of the school community who shared the same goals and who sought to transform the learning environment.

The data in relation to the students' mental models of hailstone formation were collected from the administration of a structured interview consisting of open-ended questions. The students' responses were scrutinised and categorised to gather similar mental models into a group. The choice of categories was based on the students' responses. Four groups mental models have been determined, one is scientifically acceptable and the others scientifically unacceptable. The prevalence of scientifically unacceptable mental models was attributed to the students' lack of pre-knowledge of hailstone formation. Considering the results of the study, recommendations for the teaching of hailstone formation have been made to teachers, textbook authors and programme developers. (Contains 4 tables.)",

In particular, we tried to investigate what students living near a protected area in Greece (Dadia forest) knew about the phenomenon of decomposition. Decomposition was chosen as a stimulus word because it represents a complex issue and was therefore suitable given the primary methodological objectives of this article. Specifically, we tried to develop a complete theoretical scheme for grasping aspects of complexity concerning the learning of biological concepts. Perhaps most importantly, we made an effort to introduce network analysis within the field of science education and evaluate its usefulness in assessing students' knowledge structures. Network analysis was used to manage the data from the word association test and proved to be quite efficient. It became clear that such analysis may help researchers to relate cognitive structures with underlying patterns, including misconceptions. In our case study, such misconceptions stem from students' knowledge gaps, mainly concerning holistic aspects of understanding decomposition. (Contains 4 tables, 2 figures, and 2 notes.)",

Here, we describe and evaluate a unique professional development program for science teachers in Hawai'i that integrates the traditional approach of providing training to improve content knowledge, with the overarching theme of scientific inquiry and investigation through short duration research experiences. Ten middle and high school teachers primarily from Hawai'i public high schools participated in the four week, full time professional development course, producing novel place-based lesson plans to execute in their home classrooms. Pre and post analyses of teacher reported confidence levels in teaching ten environmental and marine science topics showed significant improvements after the course. In addition, teachers continued professional relationships with scientists and instructors of the program through synergistic activities including partnering in grant proposal submissions, participating in related university offered programs for K-12 audiences, and facilitating student research internships with university scientists. Despite the overwhelming positive evaluations by teachers of the value and efficacy of the program, lack of funding and access to equipment were reported as anticipated limitations to implementing their newly gained knowledge in the classroom. Nonetheless, the program's success demonstrates that both teachers and scientists can benefit from a course of this nature, and using this framework, other organizations might adapt elements of the course to provide a similar place-based program in their respective back yards.

In extracting scales for deep and surface approaches to learning, we have excised several items, retaining an adequate subset. Reflecting trends in literature, our deep scale is very reliable while the surface scale is not so reliable. Our results show that the behaviour of the mean scale scores for students in different streams in first year physics is in agreement with expectations. Furthermore, different year cohort performance on the scales reflects changes in senior high school syllabus. Our experiences in adaptation, validation and checking for reliability is of potential use for others engaged in contextualising the Study Processes Questionnaire, and adds value to the use of the questionnaire for improving student learning in specific discipline areas.

For this reason, after discussions with biology educators, two tests consisting of open-ended questions were developed by the researcher and administered to students in four different grade levels. The first test was administered to 319 5th and 7th grade students in elementary school and the second one was administered to 400 1st and 4th year university students studying in the departments of elementary school teaching, science education and biology education. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods and a number of misconceptions were detected in different grade levels. According to the results of the study, the distributions of the percentages of students' misconceptions demonstrate a decreasing trend from elementary school students to university students without totally disappearing. The reason of this situation might be the persistence of misconceptions that are difficult to overcome. Due to their functionality, students continue to possess certain misconceptions. Hence, this characteristic of misconceptions should be considered while planning teaching activities in teacher education programs. (Contains 3 tables and 6 figures.)",

Participants in this study were 512 students at Faculty of Education from two public universities in Turkey. Of the 512 students, 35.5% were enrolled in the early childhood education program, 30.9% were in the elementary science education program, and 27.7% were in the elementary mathematics education program. The rest of the participants were pursuing a graduate program under the department of elementary education. The results of multiple linear regression analysis reflected that VBN Theory could successfully explain the participants' energy conservation behaviors. The teacher candidates' reduction in energy consumption could be accounted by personal norms, egoistic and biospheric value orientations. However, rather than personal norms, egoistic and biospheric value orientations made greater unique contribution to explain the criterion variable. Furthermore, each predictor variable in the causal model of VBN Theory was found to be significantly associated with the next variable, but value orientations deserved more attention than VBN Theory places on them within the study context.

        "description":"The use of the web in teaching and learning and research studies on this issue are increasingly common in science education. In most of these studies, teachers' and students' perceptions of and their attitudes toward the specific web-assisted/based learning activities and the effects of these activities on their achievement and attitudes have been investigated. In the current study, the researcher placed emphasis on the perceptions about physics education related websites on the Internet among users of these sites using a causal-comparative research design. The purpose of the current study was to have detailed information on web users' preferences and perceptions on the use of the web and to see if demographics are responsible for differences on web users' perceptions on the use of web in physics education. In order to achieve this aim, an online instrument, &quot;Perceptions of the Internet and Education Scale,&quot; was developed by the author and the data collected using this instrument. The statistical analyses were carried out with the data from 340 web-users of a physics education related website. The results of the study showed that web users' gender, occupation, and time spent on the Internet were factors that explained the changes in the perceptions of physics education web users. However, web users' age and past experiences with the Internet were not causes of that difference. (Contains 10 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Human negativity toward arthropods has been well documented but the factors that contribute to this negativity have been elusive. This study explored knowledge of arthropod carnivory and herbivory as possible casual factors that contribute to the negative tendencies preservice elementary teachers have toward most arthropods. Specifically, this study investigated the effect knowledge of arthropod carnivory and herbivory had on United States kindergarten through sixth grade preservice elementary teacher attitude toward that arthropod and belief concerning the likelihood of incorporating information about that specific arthropod into their future science classroom. A cluster randomized design with a control group was used for the study. The treatment group consisted of 147 preservice elementary teachers and the control group consisted of 151. Unique to this study is the finding that arthropod carnivory and herbivory are causal factors that strongly affect preservice elementary teacher attitude and belief toward arthropods. When the participants of the study were made aware that an arthropod they thought was a herbivore was actually a carnivore, their attitude and likelihood of incorporation significantly declined. When the participants of the study were made aware that an arthropod they thought was a carnivore was actually a herbivore, their attitude and likelihood of incorporation significantly increased. Implications and future research are discussed. (Contains 5 tables and 4 figures.)",

        "description":"School is assumed to equip students with subject knowledge and contribute to their development as human beings and democratic citizens as well. In this article, the democratic dimension of the teaching assignment is brought to the fore, and an analysis tool for investigating students' conversations on socioscientific issues that emphasises democratic aspects is presented. The DEQUAL-tool, where the acronyms stand for DEliberative QUALities, comprises both the content-related and formal aspects of the conversations, with a specific emphasis on the collective expressions of democratic qualities like questioning, consideration for others and conveying different dimensions and arguments. DEQUAL is based on an intersubjective and communicative understanding of democracy and meaning-making, and is theoretically inspired by John Dewey's and Jurgen Habermas' views on these matters. The development and function of DEQUAL is clarified using excerpts from upper secondary school students talking about how living in a certain place influences the greenhouse effect. By pointing out characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of students' group-conversations, this methodological proposal can provide further guidance for an integrative understanding of the teacher's assignment in science education.

        "description":"In this study, we investigated the ways in which university students connected with science through the use of photovoice (Wang &amp; Burris, 1994) as a pedagogical tool. Results indicated that students came to appreciate their connections to the science that operates in their lives as they reflected on and became empowered with regard to the science content behind environmental issues of interest to them on campus. Photovoice allowed students to authentically inquire about local science, as well as the potential to generate change in their own community. This understanding is significant to science educators because first, it empowers learners to connect with science and provides a way to deepen that connection with science; and second, it provides a pedagogical tool for science educators to use with their students to engage them in the science in their community. Finally, it has the potential to improve science teaching by creating students that are more connected to science and the world around them. (Contains 6 figures.)",

The present study addresses the question of reciprocity in such partnerships, by comparing the sustainability agendas underlying schools' educational programs to the sustainability agendas of the students' parents. The study was conducted among four urban school-community systems in Israel, implementing sustainability education. The results revealed a lack of reciprocity. Schools and parents belong to two different populations, with different sources of influence. Schools' agenda seems to be mostly influenced by ministerial centralization. Schools' and parents' sustainability agendas were compared against the 15 perspectives of the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development International Implementation Scheme. Parents' agendas were highly compatible with the perspectives, whereas schools' educational programs, focusing mainly on environmental science, lacked compatibility with the perspectives. The suitability of the perspectives to school settings is questioned. (Contains 5 tables and 2 figures.)",

Inquiry is difficult to incorporate in both cultures because proficient performance on national tests is a priority. As a result, teachers must cover the curriculum via transmission of knowledge rather than its discovery. In order to capture an early understanding of the effects of this program on its participants, focus groups and ethnographic interviews were conducted with ten participating teachers from both countries. Using a grounded theory approach on the data sets, three themes emerged that describe conditions required for replicating this program: structural, cross-curricular, and cultural disconnections, technological needs, and environmental and sociocultural knowledge gains. The findings indicate that cultural factors had a significant impact on how Trinidadian and American teachers and administrators perceived, valued, and reacted to the concrete experiences they had in the course of their participation in the STE situated professional development program.

Many view teacher leadership as specific administrative roles while others view it as any opportunity in which teachers contribute to the decision-making process. Whichever way it is defined, it is commonly accepted that teacher leadership capacity, though a highly desirable trait, is underdeveloped. This article shares the perceptions of 22 veteran teachers working at two Professional Development Schools (PDSs). It will identify their perceptions about whether the PDS model contributes to leadership development and which specific roles within the partnership are responsible. Though several themes emerged, the collaborative and mentoring components of the PDS were reported as primary factors for increased teacher leadership. These findings are further evidence that can be used by PDS advocates to promote the PDS model as standard method for teacher education programs. (Contains 2 tables.)",

This article provides a case &quot;illustration&quot; of a fictitious, exemplary PDS and a &quot;protocol&quot; that in combination can be used by PDSs interested in generating possibilities for their partnership development. As PDSs enter their second and third decades of existence, sustainability and accountability for authentic and deep partnership activities becomes increasingly complex to initiate and sustain. Given the importance of understanding the key features of PDS work, PDS educators benefit by using tools that help partnerships continually build important structures and roles as well as the &quot;signature pedagogy&quot; that often sets PDSs apart from traditional clinical placements and reflects the full mission of PDS work. This paper provides a pair of tools designed to generate discussion about PDS structures, roles, and &quot;signature pedagogy&quot; for PDSs interested in revitalizing or strengthening their partnership work.

The Partnership includes five school districts, BYU's David O. McKay School of Education, and the seven arts and sciences colleges at BYU that participate in preparing teachers. This article describes the structure of the Partnership and explains how the nine essential elements of Professional Development Schools (PDS) are implemented within this partnership agreement. The BYU-PSP is unusual among PDS partnerships due to its size, scope, and longevity. All schools within the BYU-PSP districts are considered Partnership schools, but some participate more fully in the preparation of teachers, school psychologists, and administrators than others. One of the strengths of the Partnership is that it provides over 40 pre-service and in-service professional development programs. Insights and lessons learned are shared, with a particular focus on long-term sustainability of school-university partnerships. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"The integration of information and communication technology into early year's classrooms is increasingly important for engaging and motivating digital learners. One of the more promising recent revolutions in educational technology that encourages learner's involvement is interactive whiteboard (IWB). Many schools have accepted IWB as core teaching technology for teaching young children. Yet there has been little research that looks into it especially for teaching science in early year's education. This paper reports on selected preliminary findings from a recent study which highlighted a number of affordances, practices and challenges related to teaching science for children aged five to six years using IWBs. A phenomenological perspective was adopted in this study. In-depth interviews with teachers to explore their individual experiences and perspectives about the uses of IWBs were recorded. Data were collected and analysed according to a qualitative approach. The preliminary analysis of the data summary across the seven case studies revealed that the teachers used IWBs in a wide range of ways with the intention of bringing contemporary content into the classroom and leading to the learning of investigative science. Promoting authenticity and connectedness, multimodality and versatility, and efficiency were the most frequently mentioned by participating teachers. This study also illustrates the disruptive effects of conventional classrooms setting, low technical support and insufficient training towards the process of implementation of IWBs.",

Studies have found that learning robotics or integrating programming bricks into courses can help to develop students' problem-solving abilities and enhance their learning performance. This study attempted to develop a one-to-one Topobo robotics course for kindergarten children and to explore teacher-student interaction patterns. This study used a creative thinking spiral as the framework for the Topobo robotics course. The research sample included a five-year-old child and a preschool teacher. Topobo, the programmable bricks, was the main learning tool in this course, and the sequential analysis method was used to identify teacher-student interaction patterns. Based on the frequency of the teacher-student interactions, this study found that two behaviors, the student's \"play\" and the teacher's \"guidance,\" appeared most frequently. Moreover, the results of sequential analysis and content analysis of the videotaped learning process indicated that the teacher's guidance helped the student to assemble or play with the Topobo bricks. The teacher's questions encouraged the student to express and share his ideas or identify and solve problems. This study proposes suggestions for future studies on this issue.

        "description":"An electronic textbook (e-Textbook) is a digitized (or electronic) form of textbook, which normally needs an endorsement by the national or state government when it is used in the K-12 education system. E-Textbooks have been envisioned to replace existing paper-based textbooks due to its educational advantages. Hence, it is of paramount importance for the relevant parties (i.e. national and state governments, or school districts) to draw a comprehensive roadmap of technologies necessary for the successful adoption of e-Textbooks nationwide. This paper provides a brief overview of e-Textbooks and subsequently an extensive discussion on challenges associated with e-Textbooks in the pursuit of replacing traditional textbooks with e-Textbooks. This paper further provides an extensive review on how the challenges have been approached using existing e-Textbook technologies, such as multi-touch technology, e-Paper, Web 2.0 and cloud computing. Literature review and interview have been conducted to identify the challenges of e-Textbooks implementation in terms of e-Textbook usage levels and the reasons of its refusal. There were 180 students and 20 academic staff participated as a sample for interviews. Eight categories of key challenges were identified. Subsequently, assessment was performed on how the evolving e-Textbook technology has been applied to address the key challenges and problems. This article aims to provide a strong foundation for further investigations in e-Textbooks for successful adoption of e-Textbooks in school education. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

This study empirically investigated the necessary conditions for using mobile devices as an educational tool for ubiquitous learning in higher education by a conjoint method. The results show that respondents want to use Window-based large-screen devices for their educational purposes; thus, current tablet PCs might not be suitable in terms of screen size and type of platform. The findings also implied that potential users want to receive ubiquitous access by using advanced cellular networks, but they do not need comprehensive functions related to office documentation on their mobile devices. Therefore, this study suggests that both policy makers and business players consider developing the optimal educational mobile device as soon as possible for the successful dissemination of ubiquitous learning.

A mixed method consisting of qualitative and quantitative approaches was employed to analyze the collected data, including the pre- and post-tests, qualitative data of peer assessment on Facebook sites, interview, a student self-efficacy scale, and a self-developed satisfaction survey questionnaire. The findings of this study indicate that incorporating Facebook in the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) course can effectively assist college students in learning business communication English. Students can improve their professional knowledge not only from the in-class instruction but also through peer assessing on Facebook. Additionally, the blended learning approach can significantly enhance the students' learning motivation and interest. Finally, some useful instructional strategies are provided to educators and practitioners in the English education field. (Contains 3 figures and 3 tables.)",

It describes the design process by employing the Isman Instructional Design Model. A quantitative study was carried out using experimental method and background survey. The instruments used were questionnaire and creativity test form for student's creativity measurement. The treatment group consists of 40 participants randomly selected among students, while the control group of 40 participants was drawn from existing classes. This study was conducted over 14 weeks. Statistical analysis in the form t-test was used to compare the dependent variables between the two groups. The findings show that the difference in mean score between pre-test and post-test for the treatment group was 27.50 while the mean score difference between treatment and control groups to the post test of: i) creativity in writing is 4.90; ii) creativity in problem solving is 5.68, and iii) creativity in creating a missionary motto is 4.93. One way ANOVA analysis of the treatment group showed significant differences in student achievement based on creativity indicators. The findings from this study suggest that the Isman Instructional Design Model which pays attention to instruction from the learner perspective than from content perspective is suitable in designing and developing Facebook based learning to enhance creativity among Islamic Studies students in the secondary educational setting in Malaysia. The findings of this study are expected to provide insights in promoting Facebook based learning. (Contains 1 figure and 5 tables.)",

The subjects consisted of 96 primary school students from 4th to 6th grade in South Korea. The major findings of the study are as follows. First, the students preferred CHLS-VC over CHLS and showed positive perspectives toward CHLS-VC. Second, the students preferred the combination of voice and text chat over using voice or text chat, and the frequency of students' questions was higher in online than in offline classes. Finally, the students' perspectives on the effectiveness of CHLS-VC were positive in comprehension and increase in score. They thought that scores have increased in the respective academic subjects as well. Based on the results, it is concluded that CHLS-VC can fortify the learning process and foster student to teacher interaction. It seems that CHLS-VC is a useful supplementary online learning system for the formal curriculum, and implications based on pedagogical consideration, and suggestions for further studies are provided.

Traditional models of educational supervision do not guarantee adequate supervision of the teaching models based on Web 2.0 as well as the digital learning environments supporting classical lectures. The study has been approached from a quantitative perspective, in which we examined the practices and perceptions of 278 local supervisors in three different regions of Spain when supervising the 2.0 teaching model promoted by the Ministry of Education in 5th primary grade through a model &quot;one laptop per student.&quot; The analysis in this context led us to postulate that a supervision model that complements the techniques and strategies of traditional supervision and incorporates new ways of addressing the educational processes based on Web 2.0 is needed. This model may be called &quot;virtual supervision&quot; and it must be oriented towards an intervention to analyze, improve, and substantially transform schools and the teaching-learning processes.

        "description":"Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has become an indispensable part of the 21st century. Having basic ICT skills is now seen as an important attribute that members of the young cohort should possess in order to be successful in life. Thus, countries all over the world, including Turkey, have attempted to adjust their educational policies to this new phenomenon of ICT. In this context, this study aims to investigate the impact of both household- and school-level factors on the ICT usage of students in Turkey. Given the  multilevel structure of the data, the hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) method was used for statistical analyses. The results of the analyses show that there are significant differences between schools in terms of students' ICT usage, both for entertainment and school-related tasks. These differences, however, are mostly explained by the household-level factors. The only school-related factor that seems to be important for students' ICT usage is the student's involvement in ICT-related tasks at school. (Contains 3 tables.)",

The main objective of this article is to contribute to an understanding of the value of blended learning within the scope of the Bologna Process which began in 2006 in this University. We consider blended learning as a flexible and integrated approach that combines different forms of communication in synchronous and asynchronous moments. To gather data, we conducted survey questionnaires among teachers and students as well as semistructured interviews and document analysis in a cyclical and interactive process of data collection, data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing/verifying. The research results highlight the importance of teacher intervention to create an environment that stimulates processes of cooperation, autonomy, social integration and the development of learning communities, important in this competitive world.

The participants of the main study were 88 preservice science teachers for attitude assessment and 82 preservice science teachers for achievement test. Survey of Attitudes toward Astronomy was used for attitudes assessment. In addition, the researcher developed the Astronomy Concept Test (AstroCoT) to test preservice science teachers' astronomy achievement. Pre-post design was used in the current study. The results showed no significant differences between groups for attitudes and achievement. There were no means effects of media on preservice science teachers' attitudes toward astronomy and achievement in astronomy class. However, preservice science teachers' attitudes toward astronomy and achievement in astronomy both improved significantly within each group (with or without media). Even though media was not apparently the reason for the significant changes, it is notable that the preservice science teachers did develop positive attitudes toward astronomy and also increased their achievement in astronomy.

        "description":"In order to facilitate students' understanding in introductory programming courses, different types of teaching approaches were conducted. In this study, a hybrid approach including comment first coding (CFC), analogy and template approaches were used. The goal was to investigate the effect of such a hybrid approach on students' understanding in introductory programming A quasi-experimental design and one control group (CG, N = 38) and one experimental group (EG, N = 38) were used. While the control group was taught in the traditional way, the experimental group received another instructional package which included the hybrid approach. Three open ended questions were administered as a pretest and a Programming Knowledge Test (ProKT) was administered as a posttest. The Posttest results were examined in two domains (conceptual understanding and problem solving). In addition, the observations made in the EG classroom were interpreted as qualitative data. While there was no statistically significant difference between two groups in the pretest scores, EG students performed better than the CG students in problem solving domain of posttest. Observations and posttest results showed that the EG students were better in remediating the deficiencies especially in problem solving, in addition to basic programming concepts and language features. Based on these results; it was concluded that integrating three different approaches together has positive effects on facilitating students' development of introductory programming knowledge.

It attempts to answer the following questions: What is the potential contribution of mobile-based email exchanged to writing skills? What is the potential contribution of mobile-based email exchanged to vocabulary acquisition? To answer these questions, the researchers carried out a project based on Mobile-based Email for the experimental groups. Thirty students were purposefully chosen from two universities (Al-Balqa Applied University and Jerash University) in the first semester of the academic year 2011. The instrument of the study was a survey. To establish the validity for the instrument, the method of content validity was used by giving it to a jury of specialists. Means scores and standard deviations of the participants' responses on writing and vocabulary were used to examine the significance of the treatment on the dependent variables. The results revealed that the writing skills and vocabulary of the students in the experimental groups significantly improved. On the basis of the results of the present study, the researchers propose a number of recommendations and makes suggestions for future research. (Contains 3 tables.)",

We recruited twelve graduate students enrolled in a course entitled, Statistics in Education and Psychology, at a university in northern Taiwan. Researchers adopted the case study method, and the course lasted for ten weeks. Students were first required to learn the content and complete homework assignments through online peer assessment activities. Data were collected from interviews and student journals for content analysis. The results demonstrate that the quality of feedback improved from the first peer assessment to the second; however, the amount of advanced feedback decreased. Although students adjusted their homework according to the feedback provided by their classmates, they did not fully accept this criticism. Students valued specific feedback more highly than scores; however, the desire to obtain high scores motivated many students to modify their papers. When students discovered that peer reviewers were unable to understand their work, they would rewrite it with more extensive explanations and adopt feedback to generate new ideas or research directions. Finally, the students made valuable modifications to their work with the help of feedback from others, and most of the students had a positive impression of peer observation after participating in online peer assessment activities.

The &quot;New School&quot;, an innovative new curriculum applied experimentally in Greek schools, introduces the full and effective use of ICT in all aspects of school reality. Prominent in this effort is the role of ICT teachers. Given the vague framework which describes the integration of ICT in primary schools with reformed curriculum, it is important to investigate the views of ICT teachers in relation to the aims of the Ministry of Education and the obstacles they encounter in their teaching process. The research results reveal that on one hand, there is a considerable confusion among teachers with regard to their role and on the other hand, there are several external and internal barriers to effective teaching.

        "description":"The University of Sydney has offered some form of organised adult education since the late 19th century. In 1914, that provision was formalised through the establishment of a Department of Tutorial Classes, the appointment of a Director, and a partnership with the Workers' Educational Association (WEA). Right from that time, however, there was ambivalence and sometimes direct opposition to the role and sometimes to the existence of the department. As a result, successive directors of the department had to tread a fine line in balancing the expectations of the university with their passion for extending the academy into the adult community, while also satisfying the demands of the WEA. This paper reviews the period of three directorships of the Department of Tutorial Classes, between 1919 and 1963, and argues that the liberal adult education approach adopted by the university from its earliest days was sustained over those 45 years mainly because ongoing disagreement within the university about the purpose of the department and the status of the director, as well as continuing external pressure from the WEA, ensured that the status quo prevailed, even when there were innovative adult education developments elsewhere, and opportunities for change presented themselves.",

This is also true for students studying in vocational education and training (VET) who face increasing pressure to combine study and work. The intersecting commitments of work, life and study create a range of demands for individuals, which, in turn, impede work-life satisfaction. Time and money have been shown to be the biggest factors affecting people who combine work and VET--particularly for workers in low-income jobs, which constitute the biggest employment source for VET students. Data from a research project at TAFESA indicates that working students experience high levels of stress, time strain and interference with activities outside work/TAFE. The work life outcomes for full-time students are significantly worse than outcomes for workers in the general population. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Yet, changing work, new work requirements, an ageing workforce and the ongoing need for employability across lengthening working lives make it imperative that this educational focus be broadened to include continuing education and training provisions for those already in the workforce. To address this refocusing of the education and training effort, this paper proposes that learning at work, encompassing practice-based experiences supported by both formal and informal workplace arrangements, constitute an effective continuing education and training model for worker-learners in the aged care industry. It draws on data from semi-structured interviews and written responses from 51 workers who show preferences for such a model. Not only do aged care workers like engaging in learning independently and with co-workers and workplace facilitators, they prefer a larger component of courses to be delivered at the work site. The implications of these findings are summarised in this article. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Other studies have questioned the suitability of the adult learning environment for some students. This study explores how students and teachers in five foundation TAFE courses view the adult learning environment, and how they respond to this environment.

Vocational guidance, therefore, is needed in order to reintegrate them into the labour force and manage their careers effectively.

        "description":"In recent years, major universities and governmental and nongovernmental organizations around the world have been engaged in discussions about implementing the principles of lifelong learning as fundamental principles of individual education. Until about a decade ago, adult education in Montenegro (whose development resembled that of adult education in the other republics of the former Yugoslavia) was characterized by the founding of workers' or people's universities; establishment of training centers at major companies and factories; and continued professional training, which included part-time enrollment in traditional universities. In other words, adult education was treated as an integral part of the formal education system but was not included in the state budget for education. Over the course of the last ten years, Montenegro has lost its old system of adult education, but it is still quite far from establishing a new one. Tellingly, no strategic document pertaining to adult education in the country recognizes the University of Montenegro as having a major role in lifelong learning. This essay problematizes the place and role of the university within the system of adult education and offers a comparative analysis of the development of the concept of lifelong learning at the university level in Europe.",

Even now, at the beginning of the 21st century and 20 years after his death, it is worthwhile to explore his understanding of tradition and innovation, with attention to how it related to the Catholic intellectual culture of his own time and, more importantly, how it might contribute to an understanding of the identity of Catholic educational institutions in today's period of great transition. In recent years, faculty members and administrators at Catholic universities have been engaged in many discussions about the Catholic intellectual tradition and Catholic higher education. Most of the attention in these conversations has gone to the issue of what it means to be Catholic. The next step is to explore what it means to have a tradition. Thus, this essay examines the usefulness of one leading 20th century Catholic intellectual's approach to tradition as it relates to Catholic education in general and to Catholic universities in particular.",

In order to justify the distinctiveness of a traditional Catholic identity and educational project, the paper offers an outline of a distinctively Thomistic educational philosophy. Its defense of the (re)affirmation of the ideal of traditional Catholic education and schooling in secularized society is neither ultra-conservative nor romantic.",

        "description":"This study analyzes qualitative data on student perceptions and curriculum transformation from a schoolwide culminating portfolio program of a small, urban, archdiocesan Catholic high school located on the West Coast. Over 4 years, all graduating students (n = 102) developed culminating portfolios, evidencing their accomplishment of specific learning outcomes and presented those portfolios to panels of educators, parents, and community representatives. Students, teachers, and panelists were surveyed to determine their perceptions about the benefits and challenges of this process. The study found that (1) students' perceptions of the portfolio and panel processes were very positive, including the belief that the portfolios helped students determine for themselves the extent and quality of their learning; (2) panelists and school faculty reported the belief that the portfolio process better prepared students for college and helped students reflect upon and assume personal responsibility for their learning; and (3) significant curricular transformations had taken place in what was being taught at the school, how it was being taught, and how it was being assessed. Teachers, students, and panelists identified the benefits of the process for students as well as suggestions to increase the impact of the process on classroom teaching and learning. Challenges in the process included logistics of portfolio management, the amount of time required to develop and continue the process, and the development of methodologies for continued refinement of the program.

Spirituality on this scale is conceptualized as a composite of life scheme (having meaning in one's life) and generalized self-efficacy. Construct-based validity evidence was produced through factor analysis and examination of correlations between the spirituality scale and subscale scores with scale and subscale scores on the \"Children's Hope Scale,\" a well-being indicator previously used for this population. In addition, differences between male and female students were found, with females producing higher scores on the life scheme subscale, suggesting a greater sense of meaning in their lives. The \"Spirituality Index of Well-Being\" also demonstrated high internal reliability in this sample. It is argued that the goal of Catholic education is education of the whole person and that this conceptualization of spirituality is consistent with that goal. The Spirituality Index of Well-Being appears to be a valid and reliable measure of cognitive spirituality for this population and a useful indicator of student well-being.

Previous research suggests that parental decisions are affected by demographic, financial, and value-related factors. This study investigated variables including: demographic and socio-economic background, motivation, quality of school curriculum, quality of school life, and classroom environment as factors contributing to secondary students' choice of schools for their own children. The sample comprised 8,265 secondary students from 70 Catholic schools in New South Wales, Australia. Analysis of variance and logistic regression were used to identify contributing factors of school choice. Findings suggested that students' expectations of schools, quality of school curriculum, quality of school life, and the classroom environments they experienced all contributed to their intention to send their own children to the same schools, after controlling for their background differences. On the other hand, students' intentions were not affected by their gender, socio-economic backgrounds, or country of birth. (Contains 5 figures and 6 tables.)",

        "description":"In the past 2 years, the United States Supreme Court has decided two important cases that will bear directly on legislation and litigation involving school choice programs that provide financial aid to parents of children attending religious schools. Those cases are &quot;Zelman v. Simmons-Harris&quot; (2002) and &quot;Locke v. Davey&quot; (2004). The reasoning in &quot;Zelman,&quot; along with the litigation in the lower courts leading up to that decision, provide useful insights that should prove helpful in drafting school choice legislation and successfully defending it in court when challenged. The decision in &quot;Locke&quot; may have implications for litigation involving challenges to state laws and constitutional provisions limiting aid to religious institutions and to students attending religious schools. Both cases are discussed below.",

Although many aspects of this finding have been examined in subsequent research, little attention has been paid to the issue of how ability grouping affects achievement across school sectors. A nearly universal practice in middle and secondary schools, ability grouping works to channel learning opportunities to students. The authors trace the history of ability grouping and review the findings regarding ability group effects, the assignment process, and mobility across groups in each school sector. Their analyses suggest that the way ability grouping is implemented in Catholic schools contributes to the Catholic school advantage in achievement. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Policy discussions on how to improve educational outcomes have traditionally focused on schools and teachers. While schools and teachers have measurable effects on educational outcomes, reforms aimed at only improving schools and teachers have failed to eliminate persistent achievement gaps. Thus, some scholars have argued for a broader, bolder approach to education. These scholars have investigated the effect of nonschool factors, such as health and early childhood care, on educational outcomes. The present study is intended to add to this growing body of literature. Two analyses that were conducted to examine the effect of student mobility on achievement are discussed. The first uses a multi-level analysis to investigate the relationship between student mobility and reading achievement of students. The second analysis uses aggregate school-level data to investigate if student mobility mediates the relationship between a school's socioeconomic status and its academic achievement levels. The results suggest that student mobility is indeed a predictor of academic struggles--at the individual student level as well as the school level--and should be included in the increasing number of conversations aimed at changing social policies to improve student outcomes.

Yet little is known regarding supports needed to significantly increase such options. This study obtained input from 411 stakeholders in one Midwestern state, including 201 district superintendents, 181 high school principals, and 23 college dual enrollment officers regarding their use of these options, their perceptions of barriers to program expansion, and their ranking of possible solutions to overcome the barriers. Findings demonstrate that all parties find postsecondary options of value, with traditional dual enrollment the most used option. Although all groups identified funding as a primary barrier, other systemic barriers were of great concern. Participants suggest that expansion of Advanced Placement and early and middle college programs, financial assistance for dually enrolled students, and increased program availability for career and technical options would be beneficial.

        "description":"This study is a snapshot of how Ontario universities are currently promoting academic integrity (AI) online. Rather than concentrating on policies, this paper uses a semiotic methodology to consider how the websites of Ontario's publicly funded universities present AI through language and image. The paper begins by surveying each website and documenting emerging language-based trends like interpellating different audiences, inducting students into a larger scholarly community, and appealing to peer disapproval. The paper also records how these websites visually communicate AI through images and video, arguing that image and text inform one another in a two-way relationship: for example, a punitive image may undermine an otherwise textually pedagogical website. Overall, the majority of Ontario websites have a decidedly educative mandate in their online AI resources, aligning with current AI scholarship that lauds education rather than after-the-fact punishment.

The purpose of the research was to determine whether liberatory learning (Chambers, 2009) occurred for those students during a four-week service learning placement in organizations other than schools. Liberatory learning involves transformational shifts in social consciousness and provides service of benefit to both the participant and the host organization. Seventeen pre-service teachers and service learning supervisors completed questionnaires. Results suggest that service learning has the potential to be liberatory for pre-service teachers, but learning may remain tacit rather than explicit unless substantial opportunities for reflection are included in the service learning experience. Debriefing activities following the experience may be a critical contributor to helping participants realize the nature and extent of their learning. (Contains 2 tables.)",

In classes in good condition, results showed a significant decrease in students' stress, and it was considered that an effect similar to the group approach took place through life and activity experiences in the Japanese class group.

        "description":"There has been no shortage in calls for interdisciplinary enquiry. Yet it is often difficult to know exactly what is intended by this in the fullest sense. What is interdisciplinary enquiry in its totality? If we do not know precisely what it is, how do we bring this kind of enterprise to fruition? The study of education, while being already interdisciplinary in some sense, is far from ideal. Whereas the sociology of education and educational psychology that are somehow \"scientific\" in character have retained widespread appeal, the history and philosophy of education, which are not necessarily scientific, have lost much of their appeal. This indicates that something has been left out of the development and expansion of the study of education. What has been left out, this paper asserts, is a broader reconsideration of the normative character of our knowing something in particular and of our lives in general. This paper draws on the combined conceptions of \"the space of reasons\" and \"second nature\" to fully acknowledge the need for an interdisciplinary perspective on the study of education and on the role of education itself in a broader context of human living. To develop an appreciation of these notions suggests that philosophical thinking should be open to, rather than proffered in intrinsic opposition to, empirical or \"scientific\" investigations. The happy consequence of such a position is that this would open up a far more inclusive terrain on which educational issues can be addressed. (Contains 17 notes.)",

        "description":"The content of school education has always been at the center of modern school reforms. At the end of Edo period and during the early Meiji period, Fukui domain (han) and later Fukui prefecture took the initiative in modernizing their school system. The program of &quot;futsu no gaku&quot; (&quot;general education&quot; for the samurai class in Fukui domain) established at middle schools in the Fukui domain provided its students with basic learning that widely incorporated civilian and military knowledge and can be regarded as a program for the cultivation of a civil-military elite. While the initial intention was the creation of modern schools that combined civilian and military education, this later changed to creating &quot;civilian&quot; (bun) schools dedicated to the cultivation of a new &quot;citizenry&quot; (shimin) following the dissolution of the occupational monopoly held by the samurai class over administrative and military posts. In 1871, the Fukui domain opened its schools to the general public, and common people were allowed to enter elementary school alongside members of the former samurai class. Disciples of the reformer Yokoi Shonan has already implemented education that focused on public debate (koron) at the local schools (gogakusho). After the abolition of the domains and the establishment of prefectures, they promoted a process in which decisions were reached through public debate in the prefectural assembly. What set Fukui apart and ahead of the central government and other prefectures was that its &quot;Regulations for Public Schools&quot; provided severe penalties for those depriving others of their &quot;right to attend school.&quot; This kind of education through regional reform seen in Fukui came under increasing government control after 1881 and was completely contained by 1886. As the country became more centralized, a shift from the regionalized cultivation of citizens to the creation of national subjects (kokumin) occurred in the education system.

While he contends that learning competencies are &quot;the core engine that structures and runs the accumulation and distribution of this new form of human capital&quot; (AM), his study does not show if students differently engage in learning activities because of their level of learning competencies. ALSO, he does not address any relationship between school characteristics and learning competencies. Thus, this study is designed to investigate whether students' current learning competencies, under the influence of the school system, shape their attempts in improving academic and learning skills that likely lead to the accumulation of human capital, revealing how learning-competencies function in action. By employing a nationally representative data called the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009, four multilevel logistic regression analyses were carried out to test how school and student-level variables are related to four types of students' learning activities: attending additional lessons in mathematics outside regular lessons for enrichment and remedial purposes. studying mathematics (as opposed to not studying at all), and studying for improving their academic skills. Findings of this study show that tenth grade students' learning competencies and school's ranking shape their engagement in the learning activities. As students from high socioeconomic families are more likely to have higher learning competencies and to attend competitive schools, the Japanese high school ranking system, known as school-based tracking, functions to differentiate students' degree of engagement in learning, contributing to the unequal distribution of learning opportunities.

There are few case studies of generalization. This is because theoretical inclination is weak in the field of education, and the binary framework of quantitative versus qualitative research is strong. Thus, individual case studies are not linked to systematic theory construction. In the present paper, from the findings of social science methodology, a methodology of ease studies that goes back to the basics of rotation of abstract (theory) and specific (experience) is presented.

However, test data have shown no significant difference in performance between high school chemistry students who created games and students who did not (Siko, Barbour, &amp; Toker, 2011). One of the justifications for the use of the games is that students will, with practice, write higher-order questions when constructing the games. Two subject matter experts rated over 2,500 questions from games created by students in an environmental chemistry class through thematic analysis using Bloom's taxonomy as a coding scheme. The students wrote primarily recall questions, and students who created games on two occasions did not write more questions than students who only created games once. This suggests that changes to the question-writing aspect of the game project may be necessary in order to see improvements in achievement when compared to control groups.

The design studio approach is based on the idea of working and learning in a shared space. Offering a course that employs a studio design model provides the opportunity for exchanging ideas, sharing artifacts, and developing community more deeply and more quickly. What makes this course offering different is the combination of authentic tasks incorporating both online and face-to-face design studio environments.

These perspectives either imbue technologies with inalienable qualities (essentialism) or posit technology as a neutral means for realizing goals defined by their users (instrumentalism). Such approaches reflect the reigning common sense around the relation of technology and social practice, but they have also been resoundingly critiqued from within the philosophy, history and sociology of technology. It is our argument that the development of more nuanced philosophical perspectives on technology derived from contemporary technology studies can provide fruitful new directions for online education research. After briefly outlining how essentialist and instrumentalist perspectives operate in such research, we overview the key contributions developed in technology studies, suggesting how the latter might enhance research into online education.

In order for students with limited or no background with ICT to achieve their academic goals, a central part of their adaptation involves an intensive period of ICT help seeking. Using anecdotes from phenomenological research, this paper explores what we can learn about our practice as help givers through reflecting upon the lived experience of cross-cultural ICT help seeking and giving on diverse, post-secondary campuses. What surfaces from this investigation is the importance of developing an ICT support and training structure that appreciates the inter-subjective, activity-embedded nature of ICT help seeking and giving. An phenomenological educational approach to ICT help giving would be thoughtfully interwoven into a post-secondary learning environment, not as a remedial construct, but as an integral part of the learning, and help seeking, experience itself.

This perspective piece critically appraises the linguistic laboratory of thought such representation reveals and its destabilized rhetoric of technology and educational practice.

The results of this exploratory study provide us with insights on how educational technologists construe their philosophical orientations of teaching and technology.

When measuring technological literacy as an outcome of education, the attitudinal dimension has to be taken into account. This requires a valid, reliable instrument that should be as concise as possible, in order to use it in correlation with other instruments. The PATT instrument as developed in the nineties is an extensive survey that hasn't been revalidated over the last three decades. The Pupils' Attitudes Towards Technology (PATT) instrument was reconstructed and revalidated. The validation study was done in two major steps. First a pilot study with 250 students, followed by a main study with 3000 students. Different factors of the instrument were analysed on their internal consistency. Also the goodness of fit indices of the complete model were checked in a confirmatory factor analysis. This resulted in an instrument with six sub-factors and 24 items of attitude towards technology. The six factors are Career Aspirations, Interest in Technology, Tediousness of Technology, Positive Perception of Effects of Technology, Perception of Difficulty and Perception of Technology as a Subject for Boys or for Boys and Girls. The instrument is easy to use, reliable and validated. It opens a door to further research and evaluation of technology education. (Contains 8 tables and 3 figures.)",

        "description":"A common perception of designing is that it represents a highly complex activity that is manageable by only a few. However it has also been argued that all individuals are innately capable of designing. Taking up this latter view, we explored the processes behind student designing in the context of Design and Technology (D&amp;T), a subject taught at the Secondary school level in Singapore. We examined the design journey undertaken by two students to understand what designing is like at their level. Case study methodology was adopted to develop a rich data set emerging from the students' design journals, maps of the students' design process, and interviews with the students and supervising teachers. The findings revealed that these students had innate capacities to design. Although the approach taken by each student differed, as reflected in visual representations reflecting the design process as well as their commentary, each displayed similar forms of design thinking. That is, both students proposed a novel and innovative solution to their design problem and were able to articulate sound reasoning of their design decisions throughout the entire design process. The supervising teachers enacted a more facilitative pedagogy that supported each student's design process; this approach differs from traditional pedagogical practices in Singaporean D&amp;T that can be characterised as model-focused and &quot;top down&quot; in nature.

The aim of the present study was to unfold the collaborative design process of one team of elementary students, in order to understand their multimodal ways of design thinking. The videotaped design episodes of the team constitute the data source of the study. CORDTRA diagrams were used for opening up the design process, providing means to analyse the complex and iterative process in a structured manner. The results indicate that the students' design thinking was collaborative, materially mediated, and embodied in nature. Engaging in various concrete and material, as well as epistemic and conceptual activities provided the students with opportunities to learn the foundational design skills. Further, the multifaceted design process integrated skills needed for learning also something other than design. (Contains 1 table and 11 figures.)",

        "description":"This exploratory study evaluated self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies of 27 students in grades 9-12 during an engineering design project. The specific focus of the study was on student task interpretation and its relation to planning and cognitive strategies in design activities. Two research questions guided the study: (1) To what degree was students' task interpretation reflected in their working plans and SRL strategies use across the design process?; and (2) How did relatively lower- and higher-achieving design-performing students differ in interpreting tasks and deploying SRL strategies? Survey instruments and Web-based design notebook writing were used to capture students' reported use of SRL strategies. On the survey, students reported use of SRL strategies at the early, middle, and final stages of the design task, with a focus on task interpretation, planning, cognitive, monitoring/fix-up strategies, and performance criteria. The findings suggested that students scored higher on task interpretation than on planning, cognitive, and monitoring/fix-up strategies. Students' relatively high awareness of task interpretation-related-issues was also reflected in what they considered to be good design performance. Our findings were suggestive that higher performing students scored significantly higher than their lower-performing peer on cognitive and monitoring and fix-up strategies. On the other hand, lower-performing students reported greater use of planning strategies. Moreover, higher-performing students seemed to be able to convey more detailed and specific descriptions than did their relatively-lower performing peers. This article discusses potential implications for design instruction in grades 9-12. (Contains 4 tables and 3 figures.)",

        "description":"This paper provides education-based researchers and practitioners with the preferred research and design methods used by Higher Education Institute (HEI) students and Key Stage 3 (KS3) pupils applied within a participatory approach to a design activity. The outcomes were that both pupils and students found informal (unstructured) interview to be effective in creating dialogue alongside meeting in person. Students commented on the friendly environment created by staff within which the pupils felt safe to express themselves. They found the co-design activity in some cases difficult due to communication issues. Recommendations are that the HEI students would benefit from a thorough literature review of the medical conditions associated with the pupils and their school activities; an initial informal meeting or group activity involving students and pupils would reduce shyness and perform an icebreaking role prior to the initial interview; the use of drawing templates or low resolution sketch models for pupils to draw on or handle and modify to help define a product specification; and, role playing alongside other visual prompts that enable the pupils to visualise the function of the student-proposed designs. Pupils benefited through seeing professional techniques of visual communication and design practices being applied during the collaboration. (Contains 8 tables and 3 figures.)",

        "description":"It has been found that the implementation of Human-centred Design (HCD) methods in the Fuzzy Front-End is not likely to lead to diversification in educational product planning exercises, where time lines are short and executors lack experience. Companies, interested to collaborate with Master-level Industrial Design students on strategic design projects, should have realistic ambitions with respect to innovation and value creation. Moreover, diversification is not the only generic growth strategy to gain competitive advantage. Value can also be created from developing new products for existing markets, or creating new markets for existing products. On the contrary, companies who aim for diversification in their generic growth strategies, may not always end up with a complementary &quot;high valued&quot; design outcome. From a learning perspective, the understanding of HCD methods created awareness among students and companies that respect and empathy for the end-user are important for enriching their design processes, and as such increasing the chances for diversification in subsequent projects with clients. This study also compares the implementation of Human-Centred Design (HCD) methods in a &quot;professional/collaborative&quot; and an &quot;educational/collaborative&quot; strategic design project.

While the ASCA Student Standards are comprehensive, little attention is given to stress. Adolescents are experiencing greater stress associated with academic performance, extracurricular activities and worry about the future. The utilization of a well-being model and the integration of the ASCA Student Standards into school counseling programs for middle and high students can create a more holistic approach to providing stress education and stress reduction techniques.

MCC were measured with a self-report inventory, and with ratings of responses to short vignettes, designed to assess &quot;demonstrated&quot; competency. Results indicated that school counselor self-ratings did not predict demonstrated ratings of MCC. People of color self-reported higher MCC. A significant effect for age and teaching experience \nwas found with two of the four vignettes, with younger counselors and those with less teaching experience having more highly rated responses. Years of counseling experience was also significantly related to responses on one vignette, with less experienced counselors receiving higher ratings.",

Scarcely studied are ways that school library programs (SLPs) empower students in schools serving only students with a specific disability (vision impaired, autism, etc.), the challenges SLPs face in these schools, nor the specialized training made available to these librarians to ensure the delivery of efficient services. We formulated this study to determine: 1) the types of facilities, services, and resources SLPs provide to students with specific disabilities in these SPED schools; 2) the technologies that facilitate physical and intellectual access for these students within the school library; 3) the extent to which federal disability guidelines are implemented in the design and delivery of these SLPs; and 4) the specialized training that enables school librarians to better support students with special needs. Our findings suggest that, if adequate pre-service and in-service training is provided and pertinent support is received from outside and inside of school, school librarians, as ambassadors of accessibility, can and do play a highly influential role in empowering students and staff in SPED schools.

Results indicate the study participants were able to use library resources to locate and use information, that they used a variety of resources, and that they considered themselves successful library users. However, participants voiced a need for help in deciding which resources are best to use and how to identify important information from those resources. These high school seniors also wanted to learn more about how to use books for research.

Researchers used a case-study approach to investigate and compare the views and experiences of LIS faculty and education faculty at a research institution. Participants indicated their sense of which skills were taught in each discipline. In addition, they described their own experiences in collaborating with teachers and/or librarians, as well as their views on where collaboration was taught in their respective curricula, where it could be taught, and how it might be taught most effectively. Findings indicate that while education faculty members tend to have a broader view of LIS than do LIS faculty and see education and LIS as having largely overlapping concerns, collaboration is more likely to be a topic of discussion in LIS classes than in education classes. Faculty in both disciplines acknowledged that, while collaboration is desirable, it is often difficult to achieve in practice. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Within the school library community, there have been persuasive calls for school librarians to contribute to science learning. We present a conceptual framework that links national standards of science education (&quot;Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas,&quot; referred to as &quot;Framework&quot;) to core elements embedded in &quot;AASL's Standards for the 21st-Century Learner&quot; (referred to as &quot;Standards&quot;), the standard that guides the teaching and learning of multiple literacies for which librarians are responsible in schools. Based on this conceptual framework, we highlight how four middle school librarians in a large school district in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States enact and expand their five roles--information specialist, instructional partner, teacher, program administrator, and leader--while they participate in Sci-Dentity, a science-infused after-school program. We observed clear links between skills, dispositions, and responsibilities from the &quot;Standards.&quot; taught and facilitated by these school librarians, to principles in the Framework. We contend that the learning of the Standards is crucial to creating and sustaining science-learning environments as envisioned in the &quot;Framework&quot; and argue that school librarians' role in science learning is more vital than it has ever been.

        "description":"Joseph Campbell's Monomyth not only provides a well-proven pattern for successful storytelling, it may also help to guide teams and team leaders through the challenges of change and innovation processes. In project &quot;HELD: Innovationsdramaturgie nach dem Heldenprinzip&quot; researchers of the University of the Arts Berlin and the Berlin Gameslab, part of the University of Applied Sciences HTW-Berlin, team up to examine the applicability of the Hero's Journey to change management using an adaptation of Campbell's pattern called &quot;Heldenprinzip [R]&quot;. The project's goal is not to teach the stages of the Monomyth as mere facts but to enable participants of training courses and interventions to actually experience its concepts using a portfolio of creative and aesthetic methods. While a pool of aesthetic methods--like drawing, performing or role-playing--is already being used, the Gameslab subproject qualitatively researches the potentials for enriching and complementing these methods with interactive digital media and games. This paper discusses three types of game based learning treatments to be used in training and intervention sessions as well as teaching the Monomyth in a game based learning university course. The first option is providing participants with a game that follows the Hero's Journey and inducing them to reflect on the experience and its relation to the learning goal. An alternative strategy is to make participants go through a game sequence broaching issues that are relevant for a stage or the journey of change in general. Last but not least, digital equivalents of the non-digital aesthetic methods can be constructed using digital games or digitally enhanced set-ups for playful interactions. All three treatments have their merits and pitfalls, which are discussed in relation to the identified game-based learning scenarios: self-study, blended game-based learning and face-to-face sessions. Furthermore, these scenarios are compared while specific techniques boundary conditions are highlighted. (Contains 1 table and 6 figures.)",

One dimension of this effort has been the development of predicted or &quot;adjusted&quot; scores. These scores compare a school to other similar schools rather than simply to the state average. Using complex statistical techniques, the Florida Statewide Assessment Program developed and released predicted test scores for each school which participated in the 1974-75 assessment of communication skills and mathematics in grades 3, 6, and 9. The predicted scores were based on several factors which are related to achievement: Spanish native language, family income, white collar occupation,  college education, and minority enrollment. This document is a guide to the predicted scores calculated from the 1975-76 assessment of communication skills and mathematics in grades 3 and 6. (Author/MV)",

Two children were observed at the same time; groups included opposite sex and same sex pairs. A 41-item social behavior scale used by the investigator to tally specific behaviors was also used by three teachers in the school to anonymously rate each child's behavior. A questionnaire employing the same 41 behaviors and asking for judgements regarding the behaviors of &quot;most kindergarten girls/boys&quot; was completed by the three teachers and 34 parents from a  third school. According to the adults most kindergarten boys and girls differed reliably on 18 out of the 41 social behaviors presented; boys more often disobeyed adults, showed off with adults, argued with peers, hit and fought, shouted, played roughly, quarreled, showed off with peers, and teased. Of these nine differences, only four were the same as those which emerged from direct observation: playing roughly, teasing, showing off with peers, and being noisy. (MV)",

        "description":"Professors at a large, northwest, state-supported university selected communication between instructor and student as the most important function of grades. Second in importance was the predictive function of grades, i.e., providing the student and others with information for making educational and vocational decisions. Third in importance was the grade as historical record. This student-centered attitude towards evaluation was also reflected in their favorite choice of model for assigning grades, agreeing with Arrington that mastery grading emphasizes communication between teacher and student at the expense of communication with other groups. Seventy percent of this sample of 700 (from 2,200) had adopted the University's new decimal grading system which they overwhelmingly  believed would be better than the previous letter grades. Rather than using letter grades (A=4.0, B=3.0), faculty could choose to assign more precise number grades, to one decimal place (3.7=A-, 3.3=B+, etc.). The fact that 83% of the faculty considered grade inflation a major or somewhat serious problem may be linked with the large percentage opting for the new decimal grading system, but this system should not be construed as an effort to improve the declining predictive power of grades.

        "description":"This report is based on the Community Relations Team of the Southern Regional Council's extensive study of desegregation and racial conflict in Hickory North Carolina's city schools. The views of recognized black and white leaders of the community are presented. Basically, the study indicates that initial desegregation took place in Hickory despite a lack of planning or agreed upon procedures of preparing the overall community, faculty, students, and parents. During the crucial stages of implementing the first court order, the Hickory School System was crippled by ineffective leadership, by the fact that no previous planning had taken place within the city system, and the failure of the North Carolina Office of Public Instruction to provide desegregation assistance to local  systems. The Hickory School System dealt, for the most part, with the physical aspects of desegregation, and failed to develop any comprehensive plan for preparing those who were to be affected directly by the impending changes. Several conclusions are offered in the report: (1) the Hickory school system lacked a trained faculty and a curriculum in race relations, (2) the public school personnel, the students, and the citizens of Hickory lacked an understanding of the civil rights struggle, (3) Hickory hired only nine black teachers between 1966 and 1972 compared to 181 white teachers, (4) the religious, recreational, and planning agencies and institutions of Hickory failed to adequately support school segregation with programs which provide interracial participation for the community,  and (5) there was too little opportunity for widespread community participation in and support of the public schools.

Two hundred ninth and tenth grade Spanish dominant students participated in the program. Students were selected for the program by both referral from guidance counselors and voluntary enrollment. The objectives of the program were to improve language proficiency and academic achievement in mathematics, social studies, and science bilingual curricula. Other program objectives were improvement in school attendance, decline of the number of dropouts, and a  decrease of student referrals to the guidance office for disciplinary problems. Teacher-made tests in mathematics, social studies, and science were administered at the end of the school year. Speaking and comprehension in English, and reading in Spanish were assessed by standardized tests in Spanish. All students in the project demonstrated improvement in these areas. The students also had fewer disciplinary problems and guidance referrals than the school as a whole. Additionally, significant improvement in speaking and English comprehension was achieved by the students. (JP)",

The major dependent variables under study are the following: (1) the characteristics of the schools and the students who receive Title I Money (race, economic status, educational need status, etc.), (2) the amounts and kinds of services delivered to, and received by these schools and students, (3) the administrative costs or efficiencies associated with changed allocation procedures, (4) the response of the community to the new allocation; and (5) the effect on the achievement gains of selected students in selected districts. The major independent variables under study are the district changes in eligibility  criteria and in concentration. The changes in the school eligibility procedures selected by these thirteen districts are of four types: (1) direct allocation to students regardless of the schools they attend, (2) ranking schools by achievement, (3) ranking schools by achievement with poverty held-harmless, and (4) ranking schools by poverty. There are three sets of factors at work in this study which have molded the districts' demonstrations to date and which will continue to influence them as they plan their second year programs. They are: (1) factors that led districts to apply, (2) factors that appear to have influenced the exact shape of the implementation of that policy, and (3) factors which can be expected to affect some of the major outcome variables.

        "description":"This anthropological study reports on some of the activities of daily living (ADL's) of 19 Spanish-speaking families living in a low income suburb of Washington, D.C. ADL's are defined as those functions which are performed on a usual day. Generically they include eating, sleeping, communicating, working, and recreating. In this paper, they include child care patterns, household chores, food preparation, and leisure activities. ADL's illustrate the lifestyle of a group, and provide information as to the roles played by family members, relationships within social networks, customs retained from the country of origin, and adaptation to the host country. Some results of the study included the following observations. Most fathers in the sample had some high school education in their  country of origin and were employed in skilled or semi-skilled occupations in the U.S. Also, while mothers worked, children were usually cared for by neighbors from the same country of origin or by a grandmother. In addition to an eight-hour day of employment, women had various household chores to accomplish. Food preparation was done by working women or by adolescent girls or grandmothers. Because of the heavy work schedule of most families there was little time for leisure. One of the common leisure activities of the families was watching television. Sunday was the leisure day for most families and included activities such as going to church and attending soccer games. This review of activities of Latin American immigrant families indicates that immigration motives (economic reasons)  influenced their work habits, which in turn were related to child care patterns and leisure activities.

        "description":"One hundred and eighty-eight Georgia school system superintendents were polled in the Spring of 1976 as to their perceptions and experiences concerning the effects of school integration. This paper presents the results of this investigation. Three broad areas were selected for analysis: (1) integration outcomes affecting the public schools, (2) community-related integration outcomes, and (3) busing as an educationally justified method for accomplishing integration. An analysis of survey responses suggested that black students were perceived as being the primary recipients of educational benefits since school system integration. Specifically, it was the expressed view of the vast majority of responding superintendents that educational opportunities had increased for black  students. Relatively few superintendents felt that there was a corresponding increase in educational opportunities for white students. Additionally, many superintendents expressed the view that educational opportunities provided for white students had actually decreased. A clear trend was in evidence with respect to black student school attendance. Indications were that black students were attending school more regularly than before school district integration. Superintendents' perceptions of integration outcomes clearly suggest that racial tensions between black and white students existed. Discipline problems also increased in integrated schools. Finally, the vast majority of responding superintendents believed that busing is not educationally justified as a basis for accomplishing  integration. The results of this poll must be viewed with caution since there is the possibility that actual integration outcomes may differ from the perceptions of those held by the superintendents polled.

The NBER-TH data are longitudinal 25-year histories of 5,083 white males and their families. The hypothesis that the effects of more education for women result in smaller families and greater labor force participation is examined. A utility maximization model is employed where education and labor force participation are viewed as affecting both costs and tastes. The effect of education on family size is analyzed in terms of several distinct factors: contraceptive efficiency, age at marriage, tastes toward children and desired  standard of living, opportunity cost and efficiency in raising children. Findings indicate that a combination of the taste and efficiency factors has a positive, though nonlinear, relation to fertility. A cost factor has the expected negative relationship to family size. Since the cost factor has dominated other results, this raises the question of the true impact of increased women's wages on fertility. (Author/AM)",

To compare women's and men's occupational mobility, the report uses data from the 1970 Public Use Sample 1/100 (5 percent) state sample. In the case of intragenerational occupational mobility it is found that much of the association between location within the occupational structure in 1965 and 1970 can be explained by a mobility regime which  differs little by sex. However, patterns of mobility into and out of the labor force do vary by sex, even when differences between men and women in their work patterns are taken into account. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This paper is based on the premise that an evaluation of teacher performance should consist of an evaluation of the teacher's presentation of subject matter and of the teacher's interaction with the students. In order to develop a balanced evaluation methodology, four English as a Second Language (ESL) classes in two schools on the island of Puerto Rico were observed and taped. Three of the classes were composed of adult students while the fourth class consisted of ten bilingual children, ages 6-7. Presentation of ESL material was evaluated by a comparison of the methodology suggested by three prominent contemporary writers on ESL teaching in the U.S.. The methodologies recommended by these three experts were summarized and the teachers were rated according to which techniques  they used frequently. Class interaction was evaluated in terms of a system developed by Gertrude Moskowits who suggested that a language lesson be divided into time intervals of three seconds each. Each interval was then to be coded in terms of ten behavioral categories analyzing the interaction between teacher and students in a classroom milieu. Findings indicated that none of the teachers used the total methodology suggested by any one specialist, but that certain of their recommended techniques were used by each teacher. The teacher who ranked highest in effectiveness used the discovery method. One of the findings of the class interaction analysis was that all of the teachers used more indirect influence than direct in manipulating the class. An observer's ranking of teacher  effectiveness is also presented. Criteria for this ranking included teacher poise and personality, class dynamics, and the teacher's use of vocal qualities.

        "description":"This paper analyzes the properties of the process of social and economic attainments in two contrasting situations: (1) when the process of attainment generates the distribution of attainments, and (2) when the structure of attainments is seen as exogenously determined. It is argued that the neoclassical economic theory of earnings determination corresponds to the first situation, while a model for the matching of persons to jobs (referred to as vacancy competition) corresponds to the second situation. In the neoclassical theory, change over time in a person's level of attainment is produced by changes in productive skills, while in the vacancy competition model change in attainment can only take place when a vacancy is created, irrespective of what other changes may take place  in skill level. It is shown that the two mechanisms cannot be identified in cross-sectional data analysis, nor can they be identified in analysis of over-time change in attainment when time is used as a proxy for change in personal resources or job shifts. It is suggested that the most fruitful direction for research at the present time is one where different substantive implications of the two models are specified and tested. Since the two models describe how labor markets operate, future research should be directed at studying labor markets and their impact on the attainment process. (Author/AM)",

The pilot project was subdivided into two parts: the Camp Learning Center program, and the Cultural Adjustment Program. Among the general goals of the Camp Learning Center were to improve mathematics and reading skills through a relevant and interesting program of outdoor education which included the natural, environmental, and social sciences. The overall objective was to improve cognitive and effective skills and development while further reducing minority isolation. It was predicted that the participating students would make gains in the areas of reading, certain camping content areas, and social development. These objectives were met. The Cultural Adjustment Program extended  the services provided through general funds for non-English speaking pupils and pupils with first language interferences. It also provided special services for native Spanish-speaking pupils. The major purpose of this project was to reduce isolation and educational problems related to non-English speaking pupils and those pupils who have first language interferences. Among the findings of the evaluation include: (1) pupils studying English as a second language increased their profiency in English usage skills, (2) pupils studying Spanish as a native language increased their levels of skills in Spanish usage, and (3) the services provided by this project served a definite need of the school system by extending existing services to immigrant pupils.

The focus of this approach to reading is based on the individual child and his feelings. This model personalizes the child's reading material in the classroom. In personalizing the reading material, the child's attitudes toward himself and others, and toward his learning are held to be important in determining his reading experiences in the first year of school. The model has three parts: the selection of books and sharing of books among the students, the development of abilities, and conferences and evaluation. Teachers who used this model for one year in their classrooms (the field in which the experiment took place included children from all races from  grades one through six from rural and urban areas and from public and private schools) indicated that the model was successful. Comments and suggestions from the teachers and a copy of the questionnaire answered by these teachers are included in the paper. A study of the relationship between this reading model, student achievement, student self concept, and social acceptance was also conducted. Results indicate that the program enhances social acceptance and self concept in the first grade. In the higher grades the program enhances these two variables for white girls in the experimental group, and boys in the control group. (Author/AM)",

Reading/Math Basic Skills Learning Center operating in 14 Atlanta public schools for approximately 1,200 low achieving pupils. The basic concept of the Learning Centers was to provide pupils with the opportunity to improve their basic skills in reading or mathematics through a program of individualized instruction. Through student controlled pacing of instruction, children were to move through the prescribed curriculum at an appropriate pace for maximun comprehension. High support counseling services were designed to assist the child and his/her parents. Through intensive counseling and casework, the family was assisted in the development of a home environment that would be conducive to improved  educational and economic opportunities. The program was developed based on assumptions related to student success, both academically and in terms of adjustment to the educational experience. To determine the effectiveness of the Learning Centers and the High Support counseling program, two evaluation processes were conducted. Throughout the year, the program operations were monitored and reported in quarterly reports. In addition, the research component of the pilot program was conducted through the implementation of behavioral objectives. These measures were specified to provide data related to student achievement, attendance, and attitude towards school. These, as well as recommendations for changes to be made in the administrative assessment procedure are listed. (Author/AM)",

Mr. Jordan notes that for the first time in many years there is a spirit of hope and self-confidence in the black community because of the newly elected national administration. However, the new administration must be sensitive to educational issues affecting blacks. Educational issues resolve themselves into political power issues and the story of black education in America has been a power play between those who deny rights and those who are determined enough to escape the marginal status assigned to them. Conflict centered on educational policy demonstrate two facts: (1) schools are very important, no matter what the experts say, and (2) school systems have as their central function the  three S's; sorting, screening, and selecting, not the education of children. Blacks have not made their presence felt to the degree that is necessary. There are issues that go beyond clear ones like curriculum, staffing, and community involvement to which blacks must direct their attention. School financing and whether the Office of Education should remain in HEW or whether it should be a separate department are two such issues. It is concluded that all blacks should adapt a spirit of cooperation and joint helpfulness in order to survive and overcome adversity. (Author/AM)",

The report also incorporates data on events which occurred subsequent to the hearing and which obtained through followup investigations ending in May of 1977. Among the numerous findings are the following: (1) the Citizens' Advisory Committee on Student Integration, established to prepare coherent approaches to reduce racial isolation received no public support for its efforts from the school board, (2) the Los Angeles Unified School District was  characterized by racially and ethnically isolated students, racially and ethnically identifiable schools, unequal and overcrowded facilities at predominantly minority schools, and low academic achievement by minority children, (3) representatives of business leadership in Los Angeles publicly supported obedience to the law and the concept of integration, and (4) institutions of higher education in the Los Angeles area constituted a largely untapped resource during planning and preparation for school desegregation in the school district. Although the report focuses on Los Angeles, it is not limited to this city only. Many of the findings and recommendations are applicable to other communities which will be involved in school desegregation. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"A discussion of ongoing efforts to identify and analyze city schools which were instructionally effective for poor and/or minority children is presented. The &quot;Search For Effective Schools&quot; project attempted to answer the question: Are there schools that are instructionally effective for poor children? Two thousand five hundred pupils in twenty schools in the model cities' neighborhood were randomly sampled. The mean math and reading scores of these schools were compared with citywide norms. Effective schools were defined as those schools whose pupils were above the city average grade equivalent in reading and mathematics and an ineffective school's pupils were defined as those who scored below the city average. Nine schools were judged effective in teaching reading and five were  judged effective in teaching both reading and math. The results of the study indicated that pupil family background neither caused or precluded elementary school instructional effectiveness. A reanalysis of the 1966 Equal Educational Opportunity Survey (EEOS) indicated that large differences in performance between the effective and ineffective schools could not be attributed to differences in the social class and family background of pupils enrolled in those schools, The report recommended future studies of school and teacher effectiveness which would consider the stratification design as a means for investigating the separate relationship of programs and policies for pupils of differing family and social background.

However, the degree to which various types of credentials (mental ability, class rank, curriculum) were assets or liabilities to students varied by race, sex and social class. For example, blacks were advantaged in terms of class rank performance and enrollment in academic programs while whites were advantaged on tests of mental ability. Females were advantaged on class rank performance while low SES students were disadvantaged in terms of mental ability tests performance and being enrolled in  academic programs. As for the direct influence of ascribed factors on college attendance, the direct effects of race indicated a black advantage while the direct effects of sex varied by race. White males were more likely to attend college than white females, however, no net sex difference in college attendance existed for blacks. Lastly, the direct effect of social class on college attendance was relatively strong for all groups. (Author)",

        "author":["Smith, M. Estellie"],
        "description":"This paper focuses on the migration process, and emphasizes the role of women, focusing on the degree to which marginality is not simply a residual effect of, but is a significant casual force for adaptation, in its successful outcome, however that may be defined in individual cases. The migration process is reviewed using data from working class Azoreans and Azorean immigrants, a segment of those Atlantic islands Portuguese who constitute the American Portuguese. This paper suggests that women are just as important as males but that their importance has been ignored and their roles as humans have been treated as limited, trivial and inconsequential. The paper presents the position that Portuguese immigrant women are marginal but that despite this marginality; in fact, because of  it, she utilizes that position in a positive fashion, especially to improve the economic potential of her family. Positive aspects of marginality especially among Portuguese females are best demonstrated by the institution of &quot;cunha&quot; which occurs when a person goes to someone and asks him/her to &quot;put in a plug for us with so and so&quot;. The process of making a &quot;cunha&quot; leads to the formation of a social network. The important point to note is that marginality of a special kind is required if the adaptive potential of networks and of &quot;cunha&quot; making is to be maximized. In conclusion, it is noted that Portuguese women adapt, except when they must not, she must place the nuclear household first but is prepared to work outside, she should carry an equal share of family burdens but should play  deference to the senior male, she must make new friends but maintain old ties, and she must maintain her position at the core while living constantly on the fringe.

This program, funded by Title IX of the U.S. Office of Education Public Law 92-318 developed materials for use with teachers and students in five ethnic areas: Afro-American, Asian-American, Greek-American, Hispanic-American, and Jewish-American. The overall goals of this project were to prepare for implementation of a course of study concerning ethnic groups' influence on the culture of the U.S.; to identify and assemble materials to implement ethnic heritage studies, and to develop a process for training teachers in the use of these materials. Resource units on each of the identified ethnic groups were written incorporating historical data as well as art,  music, religion, and literature. The units were written to relate specifically to the ethnic group in the Atlanta area. Evaluation procedures were planned in several areas. Teachers' attitudes toward ethnic groups and their attitudes toward teaching ethnic heritage in the classroom were measured. Students' knowledge about ethnic groups were also measured. Further evaluation strategies included evaluation of materials by classroom teachers as part of the staff development component. Findings, indicated that the objectives to develop the resource packets, field test them in local schools, and make them available to other school systems were achieved. Students were tested for their attainment of knowledge after being taught by teachers and project staff members. It was found that their  knowledge achievement was at a significant level. Teacher attitudes were positively changed. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This paper defines bilingual education and notes that because of bilingual education's broad definition, a number of vastly different types of programs and program goals are being pursued. Four broad categories of bilingual education programs based on four different kinds of community and school objectives are discussed in this paper. Each of these is illustrated by an existing or proposed bilingual education program for some Spanish Speaking community. Several rationales advanced for bilingual education are reviewed. Briefly discussed is the issue of how bilingual education might affect the future of language teaching and language learning in the United States. Most American bilingual education programs are viewed as academically compensatory and as socioeconomically  compensatory for disadvantaged minority group children from non-English speaking families. It is noted that if bilingual education is sold as a \"compensatory promissory note\", teachers and citizens will be disappointed. A number of questions about bilingual education are discussed within a comparative and sociolinguistically-oriented framework. Among these are: (1) Must one language always be an \"other\" tongue? (2) Can the school \"go it alone\" for bilingual education? (3) Can community interest be too divisive for the good of bilingual education? (4) Does the world or mankind really need all those ethnic languages?. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This paper describes three models of society: (1) the gemeinschaft, (2) the gesellschaft, and (3) the pseudo-gemeinschaft, and examines the affirmative action process and its relationship to the utopian ideals of equality of opportunity and delivered equality. In a gemeinschaft community, members look out for one another and the community exists for the support of all and to protect itself against outsiders. In a gesellschaft model the purpose of the community is to Provide opportunities for individual material improvement. In the gemeinschaft, individuals have limited access to leave the community but every individual's views are taken into account in community decisions. In the gesellschaft, individuals have complete freedom to leave and the individual's vote depends on his  economic activity. Between gemeinschaft and gesellschaft a model has developed called the pseudo-gemeinschaft. This model is exemplified by those persons who assume that all persons of one race, religion or ethnic group make up an organic community. For instance this view ties middle class and affluent educated blacks with the urban poor. It is suggested that it is this view which forms the basis of much of affirmative action policy. It is indicated that past gemeinschaft patterns imposed a prejudicial exclusion for some ethnic groups at the expense of others. Gesellschaft employment and educational patterns have also not provided equality for all. Moreover, it is concluded that pseudo-gemeinschaft, whether experienced in the form of affirmative action or the \"caring corporation\" is  retrogressive. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This paper provides a state of the art review of intercultural awareness at the elementary and secondary school level. The key assumptions underlying this paper are two: (1) Intercultural awareness education, however many fields or special efforts are included, is increasingly becoming education for interaction in a global society or world community, and (2) the nation's schools bear a major responsibility for preparing children and youth to live in this complex world. An historical perspective on international education indicates that the establishment of UNESCO in 1945 was the most important event in this field during the post World War II era. Current developments include the passage in 1976 of an amendment to Title VI of the National Defense Education Act which authorized  support for the development of international programs at the pre-collegiate level. Although there is a growing feeling that students need to know and understand more about other peoples and cultures and that as members of the human species mankind collectively influences the direction of human affairs, there are few school programs which reflect a comprehensive approach to global problems and issues. Some barriers blocking the development of outstanding school programs are the lack of adequate instructional materials, community pressure or apathy, rigid attitudes, and inadequate motivation.

It was designed to: improve parental knowledge about school reading and mathematics requirements for their children; improve the performance of the parents in reading and mathematics through the evening adult program; and provide parents with school information via family workers. The program served 50 adults and 50 children for 63 days during the 1976 Spring term. On-site observations and questionnaires administered to parents on a pre and post test basis were used to evaluate the program. This evaluation report concluded that the Parent Orientation program did not improve the knowledge of parents concerning school requirements of their children nor did it improve the parents' performance in reading and mathematics.  However, the family workers did provide parents with school information. It was concluded that late funding and the shortened duration of the program diminished the possible results of the program. Sample observation reports, questionnaires, reading and mathematics tests, and a family worker report are included in the appendix. (JP)",

The major goal of the Center was to provide supplementary remedial reading instruction. In addition to the 250 students who were selected as a target group, the Center also served approximately 1000 students from other schools in the district who came to the Center for two day workshops. Approximately 60 students were serviced at the Center each day with the primary activities revolving around learning to read through the study of the Hispanic and African cultures. Four paraprofessionals assisted the teaching staff in instructional activities, management activities, and special enrichment activities  in this multimedia, multicultural project. Materials that emphasized the ethnic and cultural heritage of the black and Puerto Rican students served by the Center, were developed. The major conclusion of this evaluation is that the Center's activities are effective in increasing the reading skills of the participants. It was recommended that the target population for the following year be set at 25-350 students who would visit the Center at least four times per month and that a measure of specific knowledge gained as a result of participation be developed and implemented. It was also suggested that a measure of English language proficiency be used as a pre and post-measure for those participants who have a diagnosed weakness in this area. (Author/AM)",

The purpose of this program was to improve student motivation and interest, and to provide individualization of diagnostic techniques and learning activities through increased acquisition of, and achievement in, basic skills and reading comprehension. The students worked individually or in small groups under the direct supervision of a teacher. They were involved in a wide variety of activities associated with production of a graphic expression  system audiotype, videotape, etc. The instrument used to collect achievement information was teacher-made and criterion-referenced. Findings indicate that there were 68 participating seventh graders, and 29 participating eighth graders. Only 57.3% of the seventh grade students attained a passing score in the criterion-referenced test. The evaluation objective specified that at least 60% attain the passing score. Seventy-two point four percent of the eighth grade students attained a passing score on the teacher-made criterion-referenced test. The criterion that at least 60% should attain the passing score was achieved by this group. The major problem affecting this program's functioning was the unavailability of the specific equipment which formed the essential hardware of the program.  (Author/AM)",

Program goals were (1) to significantly improve students' basic skills in reading and in mathematics and (2) to educate parents and students about social and educational problems and about the use of community and school resources in dealing with these problems. The evaluation objectives for parent workshops were only partially met because evaluation procedures were misunderstood. In reading and mathematics  achievement, only the third and sixth graders and the bilingual group met the objectives. It was concluded that the parent workshops, had little impact on the community, that the tutorial center was effective in increasing the reading and mathematics skills of the participants, and that student workshops appeared to be an effective means of assisting students with their educational and social problems.

The problems confronting the new superintendent are the same as those faced by the previous superintendent except for the decrease in school enrollment and a financial crisis stemming from a depressed economy. Hannan views his role as an expediter and Provider of services and refers to himself as both a reactor and an implementer. He does not embrace the concept of co-superintendent; one an educator, and the other an administrator, but believes there should be only one administrative leader. One of the most pressing tasks facing his administration is to bring about a positive feeling towards the Chicago public schools. A major goal of the Chicago Board of  Education in his view, is administrative reorganization, but his number one priority is in the area of reading improvement and the development of cognitive skills. With regard to desegregation, Hannan believes the critical need lies with the provision of good schools in all neighborhoods and the provision of alternatives so that if parents and children want to go to different locations they can do it.

One hundred and fifty-nine children who had been evaluated by special clinical medical-educational teams and cited as having high potential to benefit from the individualized instruction were served by the program. The instruction, under the supervision of a teacher-coordinator, involved 8 specially selected teachers trained in learning disabilities and special education, utilizing a combination of  teacher-created and commercial learning materials at 16 designated sites which included hospital work areas and clinics as well as special classrooms within schools. The Psychoeducational Evaluation of the Pre-School Child was used as a program evaluation instrument, administered to each child when first admitted to the program and again at the end of program participation. The data indicated that participation in this highly individualized program appeared to significantly foster the development of academic capacities. (Author/AM)",

Its operational model coordinates instructional activities of the Atlanta Public Schools with Social Services of numerous governmental agencies of the Atlanta area, along with business, civic, and religious groups. The learning center provides a referral opportunity for the school districts' high school students who do not function properly in the traditional setting. The Learning Center is separate from the schools, but it provides the basis for an in-school approach. Project Propinquity is an off-shoot of the Learning Center. It applies the concept of integrating educational and social service resources to inner city schools. Students in the program include 120 15-year old  youths identified for the project by the high school administration on the basis of identified needs for social services, chronic absenteeism, and general low achievement levels. The structure of the project provides the opportunity for existing human service resources to come together with educational resources. Results of an evaluation of the project indicate that at the beginning of the project the learners were severely retarded in their achievement. Through project participation, some students improved their attendance markedly and with this improvement came increased passing grades and increased learning of math skills. This pattern occurred with only a part of the total group, and the overall mean attendance did not improve. (Author/AM)",

        "author":["Klein, Marjorie H."],
        "description":"This paper deals with problems, patterns, and phases of adjustment to new environments. It focuses on studies of the adaptation of foreign students and Peace Corps volunteers but the findings can apply to other types of cross-cultural contact. Basically the studies indicate how complex the problem is. Adaptation takes place on different levels; for instance, surface adjustment, achievement of specific goals, and global satisfaction may mask a deeper failure of meaningful interpersonal contact or enduring cognitive and affective change. Adaptation is defined as a process of attitudinal or behavioral change in response to new stimuli. Conflict and stress are key elements of adjustment. The different phases of adjustment are: (1) spectator phase, (2) stress and adaptation phase, (3)  coming-to-terms phase, and (4) decision phase. The four most commonly observed patterns of adaptation, instrumental adaptation, identification, withdrawal and resistance, represent different processes of cross-cultural involvement and attitude change. It is concluded that culture plays an important role in defining the details of role conflict and determines what is stressful, but patterns of adaptive responses to stress are similar across cultures.

        "description":"This program was designed to supplement the New York City tax levy educational program provided for 2128 underachieving socially maladjusted, emotionally disturbed students in grades three through twelve. Most of the students were enrolled in 16 special day schools for the socially maladjusted and emotionally disturbed. The remaining students were enrolled in eight cluster schools with a total of 22 sites in treatment centers, psychiatric hospitals and special classrooms in regular schools. Instruction in reading and mathematics took place in small groups or on an individualized tutorial basis. In some school settings students were tested, diagnosed and instructed in a reading laboratory setting equipped with software and hardware for reading systems such as EDL, SRA, Didactics,  Mind, Auto-Tutor, and Systems 80. Mathematics instruction in schools with laboratories was conducted using calculators, Geo-Boards, SRA Multiplication Kits, puzzle kits and games. The evaluation of this program found that the program improved reading and mathematics skills of students as defined by scores on the Stanford Achievement Tests. It was concluded that a major reason for this success was probably due to the one-to-one and small group instruction. Tables of pre and posttest data are included in the appendices. (Author/PR)",

The program was designed to provide instruction for monolingual and bilingual (English-Spanish) students. Selected students were two or more years retarded in reading and/or mathematics. Spanish speaking students received English as a second language instruction. Nine hundred pregnant school age girls participated in the program. Seven hundred and fifty were involved in reading and mathematics programs. One hundred and fifty were involved in bilingual instruction. Three hundred students were in grades 7, 8, and 9. Six hundred students were in grades 10, 11, and 12. Diagnostic testing using the Individual Pupil Monitoring  System (IPMS) was implemented. As a result of this program more than 80% of the students involved achieved mastery of at least one instructional objective in reading and/or mathematics. Evidence showed, however, that many students had mastered a significant number of objectives prior to instruction. Problems associated with the program included excessive absence and delivery of baby as well as staffing problems, a lack of sufficient materials and equipment and the late arrival of diagnostic materials.

PSC was designed to enable teachers to develop curriculum, establish and maintain a resource file, and utilize audio-visual resources in vitalizing curriculum, as well as in teacher self-evaluation and training. The objectives included improvement in student attendance, achievement, participation in all school activities, and better student-teacher relationships. The evaluation goals were chosen to determine the extent to which the project was implemented and the  reactions of the personnel involved in the project. Interviews with questionnaires were used with key personnel. Interviews with the assistant principals at the school, all of whom had been subject area supervisors revealed that in the transition from their previous, direct supervisory role to one of administration and consultation they were experiencing operational difficulties, tension, and feelings of insecurity. Teachers had mixed reactions to the helpfulness of the newly developed curricula in meeting the needs of students. It was recommended that the program be continued pending the outcome of an evaluation which would incorporate the achievement test results of those students whose teachers were active program participants.

The student population was made up of predominantly black and Puerto Rican youngsters from low socio-economic areas of New York City. Many of these youngsters had been arrested previously. Some of them had a history of drug and sex offenses. The majority of them were school dropouts with a median age of 18. They all needed remedial instruction. The objectives of this program were to improve reading and mathematics scores and the knowledge of English as a second language for students whose first language was not English. In addition, the program was designed to extend awareness of the  effects of drug abuse, extend knowledge about sex and venereal disease, and increase knowledge about family living. As a result of the program, pupils did not make the expected progress in reading and mathematics. Measurement of the English as a second language program effectiveness could not be made because there was not enough time between initial and final ratings of pupils. Short exposure time to the drug, sex education and family living programs also precluded any accurate evaluation of their effectiveness. Problems associated with conducting an educational program in a prison are explored in this evaluation report. Appendices include questionnaires used in the evaluation. (Author/PR)",

This evaluation report is based on two major sources of information. One is a series of over 100 site visits to each Follow Through Program in a public school. Interviews with staff members were an important component of site visits. The second source of information for this evaluation is reading test results from 1975-1976 and previous years for both Follow Through children and a control  group of non-Follow Through children. Major sections of this report include: (1) a description of the characteristics of Follow Through which form the philosophical core of the program, (2) an evaluation of out-of-classroom segments of the program such as health services, (3) an examination of instructional programs, and (4) evaluations of programs at each individual site. Generally it was found that the Follow Through Program met its goals. Reading scores were higher for Follow Through as compared to non-Follow Through students. When the programs were observed individually, it was found that certain models functioned systematically better than other models. The goals of most of the social services were met despite reductions in the number of professional personnel. (Author/AM)",

Standardized test results in reading and in mathematics  indicate that significant growth in these two areas were achieved. The average student attendance amounted to almost seven months for a total of sixty-one days of instruction. One of the aspects of the program which accounted for the significant achievement results in math and reading was the alternative school organizational structure which encouraged self-motivation.

        "description":"The CAPISCO Bilingual Program at New Utrecht High School in New York is designed to offer bilingual instructional and supportive services to predominantly 9th and 10th grade Italian students. The target population consists of approximately 150 Italian language dominant students receiving intensive instruction in English as a second language instruction in their native language in the three content areas of Social Studies, Science and Mathematics. They also receive instruction in native Italian language in order to improve their linguistic skills and to obtain an awareness of their background together with the artistic, scientific, and social contributions made by their people through the ages. These students are integrated with English dominant students in Music, Art, Health  Education, Typing, and Industrial Arts. Objectives of the program are that the students gain in reading, arithmetic, and native language reading achievement. Among the findings are the following: (1) each grade, as well as all grades combined, demonstrated gains in reading achievement beyond normal expectancy on the Stanford Achievement Test, (2) the total group demonstrated significant gains in language reading achievement, (3) each grade, as well as all grades combined, showed significant gains in arithmetic achievement beyond normal expectancy on the Metropolitan Arithmetic Achievement Test, (4) in general the participation of students and teacher-student relationship was good, (5) pupil attendance rates increased, and attitudes toward school and toward self improved.

        "description":"This booklet describes the Comprehensive Child Day Care Program for the Atlanta Public School System, a Title XX Program. This program provided day care services for children of clients in various categories. The program goals for 1975-76 were geared toward providing comprehensive day care to encompass social services to the family and developmental activities for the children. One of the goals was to provide for the social, physical, and cognitive growth of the pupils. This goal was met by an instrument labeled A System for Teacher Evaluation of Prereading Skills (STEPS) and Circus, a series of assessment measures used to identify cognitive developmental needs of preschool students. Results of the Cooperative Preschool Inventory, given to all students entering kindergarten,  indicated that Title XX student performance was higher than that for non-Title XX students in 25 of the 29 Title XX schools for which comparison data were available. A longitudinal study was started using Title XX participants from 1972 and 1973 who were in the first and second grade. Scores from the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills for grades one and two were used for making the comparisons. It was found that those students who were in the Atlanta Public Schools' day care scored as well as or slightly higher than those students who had not been in day care. This fact was especially significant since low socioeconomic status had been considered to have an adverse effect on achievement. Parental involvement continued to be an essential part of the program. (Author/AM)",

This book contains four papers which were presented and discussed at the consultation. The first paper addresses the suburbanization of America. It traces the movement of population from cities to suburbs and places this movement in an historical perspective. The second paper focuses on the court, congress and school desegregation. It examines the role of the Federal courts as instruments of social change and the constitutional issues  involved in any congressional attempt to limit their power to order remedies, including busing. The third paper written by James Coleman, focuses on school desegregation and the loss of whites from large central city school districts. This paper examines trends in school desegregation between 1968 and 1973. Public school desegregation and white flight is also the topic of the last paper. Its analysis of school desegregation and white flight goes into great detail about the differences of various versions of James Coleman's analysis of desegregation and white flight, Coleman's methodology, and assumptions.

Three main types of programs were in operation at the schools. These included: (1) Remediation with emphasis on basic skills in reading, mathematics and English as a Second Language, (2) Full academic education with progress toward accumulation of credits toward a city-wide High School Diploma, and (3) Experiential education at five of the schools. This emphasized external education such as unpaid courses in community organizations and paid cooperative work-study programs as alternate weeks in school and in industry. This evaluation report showed that gains for the program included fairly  strong attendance, some gains in reading for all schools, exposure of several thousand students to the process of course self-selection four times a year, hundreds of others to career exploration and graduation for hundreds more as well as signs of improved attitudes. Appendices include evaluation instruments used in the programs and brief sketches of the independent alternative schools evaluation. (Author/PR)",

Five hundred and fifty-three adults attended classes 2 hours daily for two days a week in an attenuated 10-month school year instructional program, slightly in excess of 103 cumulative hours average with only one third of them (183) going the full year. The curriculum for the Adult Basic English (ABE) component of the Center was based on the Lado Series with supplemental materials, workbooks, projectors and tape recorders. Participants were  appropriately matched to the earlier books of the Lado Series. A second curriculum component was the Comprehensive Consumer Education Program (CCE). In summary the outstanding contributions of the first year were in establishing and implementing a complete program of Adult Basic English instruction to 553 recent adult immigrants of Chinese origin, centering around an audio-active language laboratory facility, and in the designing of unique sets of Criterion Measures in English as a Second Language applicable for Chinese-to-English participants never before attempted in such detail.

The program attempted to assure success in acquiring musical skill by providing portable desk reed organs, programmed music texts, and a highly structured syllabus. The program ran for 5 months, for one period daily. Three classes totalling 92 students participated. A modified Pan-American Musical Aptitude test was used to assess student musical abilities at inception of classes. In the comparative analysis of Metropolitan Reading Achievement test scores for the year before to the semester of the program, the scant data available for retested students  suggested a widening of reading deficit among program participants. It also showed that those students with the lowest reading scores tended to drop out of the program. In summary, the program appeared to sustain highly positive motivation for those who remained in it, and resulted in a significant development of early musical knowledge and performance skills. However, the major goal of generalized transfer of improvement in learning to reading and major skill areas was not achieved. The project also failed to reduce absenteeism and truancy, or to improve significantly attitude toward education and the school as measured. As a result the program has been discontinued.

Generally all students showed extensive retardation in reading and/or mathematics. Evaluation results indicate that the component of mastery of two or more instructional objectives was attained in mathematics but not in reading for selected objectives only. A high degree of pupil post-instruction mastery of selected objectives in reading and in mathematics was evidenced. These positive data attest to the effectiveness of the remedial instructional components. (Author/AM)",

In the 1973-74 year a unit operated in each of the five N.Y. city boroughs. The present study surveyed the centers to determine the number of children processed, the speed of the service, the appropriateness of the recommendations and interrelationships of the units with other departments within the Division of Special Education and Pupil Personnel Services. The Evaluation and Placement Units examined 3520 children from September 1973 through June 1974. Among the findings are the following: In the 1973-1974 year the Evaluation and Placement Units recommended placements in 22 categories. Thirty-nine percent of  their recommendations were for classes for the brain injured; this resulted in tremendous expansion in the number of these classes which are supervised by the Bureau for the Education of the Physically Handicapped. Accompanying expansion of some facilities, and the creation of new types, there was a diminution of services to homebound made possible by the increase in other facilities, as well as ramps and hydraulic lift buses. In addition, keen professional spirit was also observed in the facilities for pre-placement. Whether there is a tendency for children to remain in the replacement center beyond the period needed for diagnosis because of the inadequate number of permanent facilities to absorb particular children is questioned.

Guidance counselors rated poorly the program's ability to identify and develop the special abilities and talents of pupils. All personnel surveyed agreed that the program was effective in identifying children with incipient emotional problems but long-range therapeutic clinical service for individual children was seen to be in critical short supply and referral resources which would provide this were reported as deplorably few.

In addition, the authors sought to determine the effects of the inservice program on teachers and their students and to develop a handbook (available as a separate document) that would include the specific procedures and materials utilized in the inservice programs. Drawn from vocational secondary school programs of Kentucky's region 4, 32 teachers from the areas of business and office, distributive education, and home economics were randomly selected and assigned to experimental and control groups. The inservice program was developed, which consisted of a series  of individualized modules utilizing written materials, worksheets, and films to be used individually or in six evening group sessions. Only the experimental group participated in the inservice program, but both groups received the posttest, which included seven major instruments (examples included in the appendix). Inservice and comprehensive evaluations and collected data from the posttest did reveal significant differences between the experimental and control groups. In all the areas measured, the inservice program appeared to have a definite positive effect upon the participants. (BM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to explore the relationship between the working individual's daily experience on the job (job content) and his leisure activity, political participation, and mental strain after the workday is done. Based on individual level data from a representative national survey (1:1000 random sample) in Sweden in 1968, the study developed a model of social-psychological functioning which was used to test the hypothesis that the noneconomic qualities of work experience affect behavior during leisure. The first hypothesis of the model predicts how &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; patterns of behavior might be socialized on the job. The second hypothesis predicts what combination of job characteristics should lead to mental strain. The model is measured by three broad types of work  environment dimensions: Job demands, job discretion, and job social relationships. Findings indicated that the worker who lacks discretion over the content of his daily work experience is likely to be &quot;passive&quot; in leisure and political participation on the one hand, or to experience mental strain on the other. Findings do not suggest that psychologically demanding work is always accompanied by deleterious effects, although strain does occur when job discretion is simultaneously low. However, psychologically demanding work is associated with more socially active leisure and political participation when job discretion is also high. (Author/TA)",

          "And Others"],
        "description":"The project's purpose of eliminating major obstacles blocking career advancement of human service paraprofessionals was achieved through a developed model allowing new options for upgrading workers in three occupations: Addiction services, child development, and occupational therapy. The policies and practices of educational institutions, employers, unions, professional associations, credentialling bodies, and others hindering the upgrading of low-level employees were investigated and, where possible, altered. The major thrusts were to make credentials more relevant to job duties, give greater credit for work and life experience, foster mobility among human service occupations, and make it possible for paraprofessionals to obtain education and training while fully employed. In  this report, chapter 1 covers the activities involved in the project's development of a model for paraprofessional career advancement, along with methods and processes used in implementing the model. Chapter 2 discusses the following generic items for consideration when implementing an upgrading program: Consortium approach, task analysis for job structuring and curriculum development, preceptors, credentials and career development, program costs, and evaluation. The appendix, covering the major portion of the document, contains detailed descriptions of the project's attempts to implement the model in five occupations--addiction worker, child development worker, occupational therapist, public health nurse, and teacher--two of which were not successful. The description of each model's  process is intended to assist those interested in replicating the model. (SH)",

        "description":"After a brief introduction describing the goals and proposed activities of the 3-year Correctional Education Project (which began in January 1975), 10 studies, pulled together by the project and representing comprehensive research about correctional education and systems, are analyzed. (Correctional education is defined generally as the educational programs and processes available to adult and juvenile offenders after adjudication. The term is also used to refer to institution-based education of inmates.) Two kinds of studies are included: The work of five national commissions that looked at a variety of critical issues in corrections, including correctional education; and five published national studies that specifically address issues in either adult or juvenile correctional  education. The authors note that because the studies are comprehensive in what they attempt to do, they can be considered seriously by policymakers particularly at the national level. Titles of the studies are &quot;Corrections,&quot;&quot;Educational Programs in Adult Correctional Institutions,&quot;&quot;GED Testing in State Penal Institutions,&quot;&quot;An Evaluation of 'New Gate' and Other Prisoner Education Programs,&quot;&quot;School Behind Bars--A Descriptive Overview of Correctional Education in the American Prison System,&quot;&quot;Education for the Youthful Offender in Correctional Institutions,&quot;&quot;The Criminal Offender--What Should Be Done?&quot;&quot;A Time to Act,&quot;&quot;State-Local Relations in the Criminal Justice System,&quot; and &quot;The President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice: Task Force on Corrections.&quot;  (SH)",

        "description":"Based on the first survey of adult education in the public school system to be conducted by the U.S. Office of Education since 1958, the findings reported here show that adult education is growing faster than any other level of education and that there are more students in public adult education (defined here to include elementary and secondary schools and public community and junior colleges) than in higher education. An introductory chapter provides notes on the use of rankings and of rank-difference correlations in the survey in relationship to earlier State-by-State universe studies. Chapter 2 summarizes the findings of past surveys, which were selected to be pertinent to the data collected and to provide a context that would serve as a guide to understanding the current  statistics, particularly in helping to detect trends. Chapter 3 presents description of survey design, administration, and analysis involving statistics on the number of full-time and part-time students and instructors within each State and territory. Chapter 4 presents the data and draws tentative conclusions and hypotheses, noting trends and observations about program sponsors, enrollments, instructional staff, ration of enrollment to staff, and purposes of programs. Chapter 5 summarizes the whole, and chapter 6 presents conclusions on the state of public adult education with thoughts on developments for the future and policy decisions required. (JT)",

        "description":"This review of 17 projects funded during fiscal year 1974 under part C of the Vocational Education Amendments of 1968 for the priority \"Manpower Information and Systems\" (MIS) begins with an examination of the priority statement under section 131 (a) of part C and a classification of projects by the five categories in this statement. (The five categories determined by section 131 (a) were improving manpower projections, matching job requirements to skills of workers, improving the accuracy of manpower projections, translating manpower forecasts into programs/curriculum, and interfacing vocational education with economic development.) Following project classification, a framework (developed from the five categories) for examining the MIS projects is discussed. Elements of this  framework are listed and explained. The major portion of this report is a brief description of each of the projects' accomplishments, highlighting the purpose, source of data, and findings. Conclusions resulting from the review of the final reports comprise the final section of this report. Two of the conclusions presented follow: (1) The manpower information and system priority was stated so broadly that it excluded little in the way of project focus or methodology, consequently, project reports were extremely diverse. (2) In the process of preparing the review and synthesis report, one question was raised several times \"What are the best manpower information and system techniques for the Nation, State, or local level?\" The reports did not provide an answer to this question.

Each of the 22 subunits is organized in four major units: Concept Factors, Personal Factors, World Factors, and Managerial Transition Factors. The subunits are designed to be taught in forty-four 50-minute sessions. However, the authors note that they are flexible to the extent that they can be taught in  40 sessions or spread over 48 or 50 sessions. (A 2-week orientation to the teaching of entrepreneurship is recommended for teachers who intend to use this curriculum.) Each unit begins with a brief introduction describing its major topics. With one exception, each subunit is designed to cover a single topic, which is described in the student objective for that subunit. Each subunit includes overall and enabling objectives, resources, information for the teacher on advance preparation, instructional activities, recommended class time, and a bibliography. (SH)",

The project was divided into two phases and involved the collaborative efforts of the educational, community, and business-industrial sectors of Bridgeport. A checklist based on existent or anticipated training programs in the city was designed asking respondents to check the anticipated number of job openings for July 1, 1977 and July 1, 1979 in 58 vocational specialties. In the first phase, 131 employers with 50 or more employees were surveyed with 120 responding while 31 of the 100 employers of 10 to 49 employees surveyed during the second phase responded. The results of phase 1 suggested that larger  employers do make occupational projections concerning manpower requirements for one and three years hence and are willing to share this information with educational and training programs. Phase 2 results indicated usable projection data for educational or student planning. Twelve recommendations concerning the monitoring system, counseling services, placement services, training programs, and cooperative work experience programs were made, including that the phase one monitoring technique be established as an ongoing system and be implemented on an annual basis.

        "description":"Research was conducted to re-emphasize the importance of functional differences among jobs by showing how they help to better explain the income and status differences that are the main concern of recent stratification research. Status attainment, social class, and vocational psychological approaches to occupational and social differences were integrated into a multiple-market model, which suggests that the value of a determinant varies considerably by kind of work. Also the model's simultaneous use of situs as well as status of work provides a new perspective for developing a more comprehensive theory of social differentiation, for assessing social inequality more accurately, and for reducing inequality more effectively. A subsample of white men (black men, women, and men in  artistic work were excluded) taken from a 1/1000 sample of the 1970 census was used to test the value of the multiple-market model in predicting income as opposed to the traditional one-market model. Results showed that the multiple-market model predicts statistical interactions between situs and other determinants of income. In contrast, the one-market predicts no interactions and no situs differences. (Author/TA)",

In its fifth year of operation (1975-76) an assessment study focused on the basic system. Key objectives of the study were to secure COPES impact data from colleges that had participated in the system, assess the current system and make appropriate revisions, and publish revised system guides. A 12-member revision committee monitored the study and served as the decisionmaking body regarding proposed refinements. Thirty-nine colleges responded to a questionnaire, and two key findings emerged: (1) Oral and written reports of the COPES teams  were highly useful to the colleges in planning for occupational education program changes and (2) many benefits resulted in terms of impact on students and education improvements. (Narrative description of responses to the questionnaire, accompanied by supporting tables, and resultant actions by COPES management make up the bulk of the document, along with 34 pages of appendixes, which contain names of cooperating colleges, COPES project participants, and details on both the impact assessment and system assessment.)

The conditions under, and the extent to which, the therapist provides direct gratification are crucial determinants of the outcome of therapy. While certain amounts and forms of direct gratification are helpful and often necessary, too much and/or certain kinds of gratification may be destructive. The paper presents five rules-of-thumb to help guide therapist decisions about when to gratify what demands. An effort is made to connect the rules to clinical theory and recent research. The rules-of-thumb focus on: (a) differentiating between  patients' wants and needs; (b) a proper therapeutic stance vis-a-vis direct gratification; (c) the use of direct gratification in the early stage of therapy; (d) patient characteristics (severity of disturbance and infantilism of demands) moderating the appropriateness of direct gratification throughout the therapy.

        "description":"The primary focus of this paper is on understanding factors related to sex differences in mathematics achievement with particular attention to course-taking. The perception of the usefulness of mathematics for future educational and career plans and the support or lack of support from significant others appear to be the major factors associated with women's decisions to elect or not elect advanced courses in mathematics. These factors are in turn influenced by the stereotype of mathematics as a male domain. Other factors associated with course-taking and achievement are attitudes towards mathematics, feelings of self-confidence, and values. Certain educational policies and practices tend to reinforce sex-role stereotypes while some practices may promote greater course-taking and  achievement. The organization of the research reported in the body of this paper is as follows: (1) Perceptions of the Career Relevance of Mathematics; (2) Influences of Significant Others; (3) The Perception of Mathematics as a Male Domain; (4) Attitudes, Self-Confidence and Values; and (5) Educational Policies and Practices. The research studies were rather consistent in support of the premise that sex differences in mathematics achievement result, at least in part, from social influences. (Author/JLL)",

Attempts at assessing depression in two psychotherapy studies are presented. This research has been organized around a model which assumes that depressed behavior can be seen as the result of a series of deficits in self-control. A behavioral self-control group therapy program, focusing successively on self-monitoring, self-evaluation and self-reinforcement behavior, was utilized. The studies demonstrate that a self-control program can produce significant improvement on global self-report measures and on certain measures of overt-motor activity level indicative of depression.  There is further need for refinement of precise measures of the many specific behaviors which the term \"depression\" encompasses. (Author/JLL)",

The material should be useful to anyone concerned with coordinating either human services or educational programs. Where appropriate, the articles list goals of the programs, entrance criteria, amounts and sources of funding, and forms of evaluation. In many cases the history of the program is described, including ways to facilitate cooperation among formerly isolated  agencies.

It outlines the structure, function, and some techniques of the study group, including the use of simulations and prototypical situations. In one study, verbal responses of rape victims were classified into seven categories. Actors and actresses were used to videotape samples of each response type. The role-played scenes were shown to a number of groups: convicted rapists, staff members in a sex offender treatment program, and individuals attending a national conference on rape research and prevention. Given no clue about whether or not the victim was actually successful in preventing the rape, the audiences were asked to rate the deterrence  potential of the various strategies. Preliminary results suggest two &quot;types&quot; of rapist: (1) an aggressive, antagonistic one who is best deterred by crying, signs of weakness and bodily difficulties; and (2) a tentative, more polite type who may be actively rejected with verbal or physical attack. A second study, in progress, uses similar techniques to investigate different categories of rapists and changes in citizen attitudes toward sexual assault. Other work in progress includes an annotated bibliography of sexual assault literature (the proposed taxonomy is included) and an attempt to identify psychological and social factors underlying rape.

The survey, containing some items investigating opportunities for companionship with spouses, focused on time to be together without children and the strategies used to obtain these opportunities. On the average, respondents reported less than two hours a day they could count on to be with their spouses without children. A majority of the respondents indicated that the couples' most frequently used strategy to gain time together was to wait until the children were asleep or out of the apartment. Dissatisfaction with opportunities for companionship was associated with lower time estimates and with  having to wait for such opportunities to occur. Other family characteristics did not consistently relate to indices of companionship. (Author)",

Using a 75-year-old target and a 23-year-old target, the experimenter predicted and found support for the idea that personal information contained in a transcript would evoke sympathy, and thereby lead subjects to overcompensate for their biases by rating the 75-year-old target more favorably than the 23-year-old target. The two basic questions are: (1) what effect would the unfavorable stereotype have on subjects when they are responding not to the category \"old people\" but to one specific old person about whom personal information has been provided? and (2) does the sympathy and overcompensation produced by personalization depend on the  information presented about the target?

A content analysis of six widely used reading series (Allyn & Bacon; Macmillan; Ginn 360; Scott, Foresman; Holt; and Ginn 720) and their accompanying workbooks for grades two to six showed that sufficient opportunities for systematic vocabulary development with respect to most prefixes do not exist at many grade levels in these series. The following reasons were offered: (1) a general lack of coordination between what is suggested for  teaching in the teachers' guides and the material in the corresponding reading selections in the readers or workbooks, and (2) a basic misunderstanding of prefixation in all the reading series, according to definition.

Among the topics discussed are considerations in the interpretation of research findings, genetic versus environmental explanations of the relationship between socioeconomic status and reading, and intervention-program evaluations and experimental studies concerning socioeconomic status and differences in reading ability. Attention is given to those experimental studies that evaluate expectations of success and language development factors. In addition, dialect-related problems in reading are discussed as they relate to linguistic and social differences associated with dialect usage, to proposed means of teaching  the speaker of nonstandard English, and to other methods for exploring dialect differences in reading. A list of references completes the booklet. (KS)",

A 2 x 2 factorial design was used with aural-verbal presentation (standard versus elaborated) and visual-pictorial presentation (standard versus elaborated). Subjects for one experiment were 64 second-grade children from a Mexican-American population of low socioeconomic status; those for the second experiment were 64 second-grade children from a white population of middle socioeconomic status. Subjects in both experiments learned 20 word-pairs by the study-test, paired-associate method. Retention was tested after a seven-day interval by the cued-recall method. Analyses of results indicated that aural-verbal and visual-pictorial elaboration facilitated the initial acquisition  of noun pairs but did not influence long-term retention when the degree of original learning was equated.

        "description":"This paper provides a general description of schema-theoretic models of language comprehension and examines some extensions of such models to the study of reading. The goal of schema theory is to specify the interface between the reader and the text: to specify how the reader's knowledge interacts with and shapes the information on the page and to specify how that knowledge must be organized to support the interaction. The general theory is illustrated with an analysis of knowledge and processing at four levels of a good reader's understanding of Aesop's fable, &quot;Stone Soup&quot;: the letter and word level, the syntactic level, the semantic level, and the interpretive level. The analyses illustrate that comprehension depends on the reader's ability to relate knowledge and textual  information, both within and between levels of analysis. The power of schema-theoretic models lies in their capacity to support these interactions through a single, stratified knowledge structure and a few basic processing mechanisms. They provide a way of integrating our understanding of text with our understanding of the world in general. (AA)",

After presenting arguments in favor of formal meaning representation languages, appropriate MRLs are discussed. Minimal requirements include provisions for constructions equivalent to lambda expressions and for the separation of descriptional and assertional information types. A series of examples is discussed, in order to insure that, (1) in cases where the antecedent of an anaphoric expression is not explicitly present, it can often be derived through purely syntactic manipulations of an appropriately structured MRL and (2) the properties proposed for a logical MRL make such manipulations  simple to express and to apply. Given an appropriate representation language, it is possible to deal with a rich class of anaphora. (AA)",

        "description":"College undergraduates read a story about two boys playing hooky from school from the perspective of either a burglar or a person interested in buying a home. After recalling the story once, subjects were directed to shift perspectives and then recall the story again. In two experiments, subjects produced on the second recall significantly more information important to the second perspective that had been unimportant to the first. They also recalled less information unimportant to the second perspective which had been important to the first. These data clearly show the operation of retrieval processes independent from encoding processes. An analysis of interview protocols suggested that the instruction to take a new perspective led subjects to invoke a schema that provided  implicit cues for different categories of story information.

In the example provided of an adult learner, a profile analysis of the adult revealed his motivation for developing reading competence and his perceived reading strengths and needs. After his reading level was determined, the subject orally read a passage at that level and answered factual, vocabulary, inferential, and critical questions pertaining to the passage. From a miscue analysis of the oral reading, the instructor found that the adult learner made errors of substitution and of omission. Therefore, instruction concentrated on identification skills, practice in using context clues, and  practice in using factual information. The teaching strategies included making generalizations for pronouncing words, underlining context clues of words in passages, and using cloze procedures on factual literature. The paper concludes that the diagnostic process used in this example can be modified and applied to other adult learners at varying reading levels. (RL)",

The asymmetry of acquisition of adjectives, \"big\" and \"little,\" was also assessed, as well as differences in the acquisition of the underlying concepts. In Experiment 1, it was demonstrated that the child's ability to understand relative magnitude differences and quantitative equality precedes the comprehension of the words \"big,\"\"little,\" and \"same.\" In Experiment 2, it was demonstrated that verbal cues involving relational terminology did not facilitate problem solving for the three-year-olds but did for four-year-olds. Also, successful problem solution preceded the ability to produce language about  quantity. In general, asymmetries between the adjectives representing positive and negative poles of a dimension were found to be present in linguistic tasks rather than in conceptual ones. The results suggest that, for the quantity concepts, language and thought function independently in the early stages of concept development of the young child, but become increasingly related with development.

The sentences consisted of five examples each of nine features that contrast Standard English and Black English. The group of students that listened to the Standard English tape comprehended significantly more utterances than did the Black English group. Analysis of all errors made on Black English tape transcriptions, however, indicates that most comprehension difficulties were not due to inability  to comprehend the contrastive feature: in 32 out of 37 cases, students who listened to the Black English stimulus tapes transcribed correctly more of the final 15 utterances than they did of the first 15 utterances, indicating an increase in comprehension with an increase in familiarity.

However, in France and in other European countries, the dictation of literary passages is a common activity in the language arts class and appears to be of great interest and benefit to students. Among the values of such dictation are the following: students gain experience in writing more mature thoughts, vocabulary, and sentence structures than they are apt to produce on their own; students acquire a feeling for the language of literature; and students are taught punctuation, spelling, and vocabulary in an interesting context rather than in isolation. Dictation also allows students to experience the writing process in a relatively relaxed way, without most of the possible burdens of  choice inherent in freer kinds of writing activities. Teachers should seriously consider incorporating literary dictation into the language arts class. (GW)",

Separate articles discuss the following topics: various approaches to holistic evaluation, with particular attention to analytic scales; a new holistic scoring procedure, Primary Trait Scoring, developed for use in a nation-wide assessment of writing performance; ways in which the computer can be used to characterize maturity of word choice in students' papers; new and unpublished research that  affirms earlier findings by Kellogg Hunt and Francis Christensen about the development of syntactic fluency in school-age writers; a procedure for identifying the basic intellectual strategies writers use in formulating and presenting their ideas and feelings; and three ways to involve students in evaluation--individualized goal setting, self-evaluation, and peer evaluation.

The method, which features multiple options for both teacher and students, is suited to a developmental, individualized approach. The emphasis is on inductive, dialectical methods in which teacher and students question, probe, debate, evaluate, and refine each idea expressed in writing until it becomes as coherent, organized, logical, and developed as the students are able to make it. The book first outlines a course of study in which teachers can explore new modes of teaching writing. Specific classroom methods and strategies are then discussed, with special attention given to the small-group method and the interview method for teaching writing; examples of teaching  exercises, games, and techniques are provided. The final sections of the book discuss evaluation procedures for the teacher and for the students and demonstrate, through examples and discussions of student writing, how the writing process works. The program is directed to community college teachers, but the authors note that much of what is discussed can be used or adapted at the secondary and university levels. (GW)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the importance of helping college composition students to become stylistically competent and cites a study that examined the essays of 32 college students and 27 skilled adult writers. T-unit measurements revealed that there is little difference between the groups in the number of clauses per T-unit, but the skilled writers used more words per T-unit than did the student writers. To further analyze this difference in T-unit length, measurements were taken of words in \"free modifiers\"--those nonrestrictive modifiers occurring before, within, or after the main clause and set off by punctuation. These measurements revealed that almost all differences in T-unit length result from an increasing number of words in free modifiers. Moreover, the students tended to  place free modifiers before the main clause, while skilled writers used free modifiers more often within and after the main clause. The paper concludes that, since research shows that syntactic maturity correlates with writing quality, teachers should begin a college writing course by emphasizing the development of syntactic skills.

Emphasizing communication behavior forces the researcher to reconceptualize what is meant by structure: structure comes to be viewed as stable patterns of behavior, which characterize social systems. Organizations then come to be viewed as systems of interaction, overlapping networks of communication, influence, status, and friendship.

(2) What appear to be the unanticipated consequences of the creation of alternative schools? (3) Can the creation of alternative schols be considered a change strategy? The authors compare the ideals of alternative education with findings related to alternative schools in operation. An assessment of the characteristics of alternative schools indicates that they are marked by voluntarism, that they are smaller in size, that they tend to be more informal, that they allow for greater participation in decision-making, and that they involve the community more directly. All of these characteristics, however, can be witnessed in some conventional schools. The  authors also discovered that as time passes, participants in alternative schools tend to move back to more traditional teaching styles and more hierarchically arranged structures. They conclude that alternative education can function as a change strategy, although there are certain limitations on its effectiveness. (Author/DS)",

Throughout it is assumed that the school program will conform to the required state curriculum  standards, that space guidelines adopted by the state planning group will be used, that space guidelines should be equitable among schools of varying size and program, and that the delivery system for the buildings has not yet been established.

Limiting it to the arts means the space in which the art activity takes place. Technical assistance can be in the form of information, printed and referral, or consulting and advisory services by professionals. Because most artists and arts organizations operate on low budgets, attention is confined to sources of technical assistance that provide help at little or no cost to the recipient.

        "author":["Masciantonio, Rudolph"],
        "description":"This article examines the linguistic benefits of Latin in light of recent research which seems to document the relevance of Latin in building English vocabulary and reading skills. Evidence is cited from eight educational projects in which an experimental group of students taking Latin, and a control group not taking Latin, were pretested, posttested, and compared with regard to English verbal skills. In each case, the Latin students showed significant gains over the control group. Other studies supporting these findings are cited, as well as projects presently being conducted. These studies yield important pedagogical implications: (1) educational administrators and curriculum specialists should consider the significance of Latin in improving language skills; (2) the language  profession should assume the responsibility of disseminating information about this research; and (3) responsible educators should combat the tendency to ignore research data for budgetary or other reasons.

This interaction is viewed here from the standpoint of educational linguistics, which is the intersection of linguistics and related language sciences with formal and informal education. The issue is the relevant educational problem that knowledge about language acquisition could help solve. To this end, three related questions from the fields of psycholinguistics and language acquisition are investigated: (1) What is the normal course of the development of language in an individual? (2) Given the normal range of individual variability in the development of communicative competence, what factors account for this variation? (3) Which of these factors are susceptible to control  by an educational system? It is felt that the answers to these questions are basic to language education, since they both set its limits and suggest the kind of intervention that might permit helping each individual. (CLK)",

        "description":"An experiment was carried out to determine how the memory search of a two-clause complex sentence in immediate memory is carried out. An item-recognition task was performed with 32 native English-speaking, right-handed adults who listened to eight two-clause complex sentences presented to the left ear, each immediately followed by a probe word presented to the right ear. The subjects indicated whether or not the probe word occurred in the sentence, and their recognition latency was measured. An analysis of variance was performed on recognition latency as a function of the three independent variables: (1) the serial position of the target word, early or late, within (2) a main or subordinate clause, in (3) initial or final clause position. The findings of this experiment were: (1)  a word in the final clause is recognized significantly faster than a word in the initial clause; (2) for subordinate clauses, subjects take longer to respond to a target word occurring late in the clause than to a target word occurring early in the clause; for main clauses, subjects take longer to respond to a target word occurring early in the clause than to a target word occurring late in the clause. Present storage models of sentence processing and memory search models are inadequate to account for all the data. A combined storage-search account is proposed. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"This manual contains rules for playing both training and contest versions of LAG (Language Assistant Game). LAG (Training) is designed to give language assistants practice in the general teaching skill of explaining. One of the many problems that may confront the assistant in the classroom is the situation where, after reading a passage or telling a story, the students ask questions. LAG simulates the situation in which a pupil does not understand a work or phrase. The explainer (teacher) is encouraged to use particular types of explanation. By not allowing the explainer to use the unknown word to be guessed, but if necessary a nonsense word in its place, the game approximates the real situation, in which the class will be unable to understand the unknown word, because it has as  little meaning as a nonsense word. The graduated scores for various types of explanation also encourage the more useful types, in preference to direct translation. LAG (Contest) is a version of the game which may be used as a culmination of collective LAG (Training) with several contestants; it may also be used directly with a class of foreign learners of English. The manual contains rules, examples of LAG words, score cards, technique cards, and word cards. (Author/CFM)",

It is specifically designed for intensive training programs of approximately 4 to 5 hours per day, or 30 hours per week, extending over a period of 10 to 12 weeks. Thirty tape recordings, containing the dialogues and drills of the 30 units, were developed to accompany the text. These should be used regularly by the student in a language laboratory or with a tape recorder for reinforcement of what has been learned in the classroom. In the ideal learning situation, the student will have access to: (1) a native speaker of Djerma who  will act as a teacher and as a model of his language whom the student will imitate in intensive drill sessions; and (2) a linguistic scientist who will answer questions about the structure of the language. The course is, however, to a large degree self-instructional, and the student who lacks the opportunity for formal classroom instruction can make considerable progress by diligent use of text and tapes.

The first three programs in the evaluation cycle were also scheduled for accreditation visits by their respective professional associations. Although the three programs are generally considered to be among the very best in the country, the evaluation teams' reports questioned the quality of and necessity for them, since there was little emphasis placed on research. This experience illustrated the continuing debate over research efforts versus high quality professional training in the university, and the possibility of conflict between program accomplishments and institutional goals. If the experience at the University  of Illinois is not atypical, it may be the case that many universities are losing high quality programs because the programs do not reflect the institution's research priorities. University-level professional preparation programs may devolve to institutions with less background and commitment to research, such as the former normal school. In the last analysis, the role of major research universities in preparing people for professions like teaching and librarianship will be determined by the level of intellectual emphasis desired in these professions by those who control entry.

Conventional personnel data, by contrast, typically consist only of items important in distinguishing between individuals. Effective management of an institution demands that both types of data be maintained. Information needed for the planning and management of manpower resources should be: (1) descriptive of the kinds and amounts of resources available to the institution (analogous to a description of the various fund groups and the dollars available for allocation in each); (2) information about the  allocation of these resources to programs and their use there (the equivalent of budget and expenditure information); and (3) information about the activities conducted by manpower resources (the analog of objects of expenditure). A useful description of the pool of available manpower resources also requires both some way of classifying the resources that will allow differentiation of distinctly different ones; and a way of measuring the amounts of each type of resource available for assignment in the institution.

The Harvester collection, which focuses on British publications, is seen to be the more nearly complete of the two, and it provides more satisfactory external finding aids. However, a subject index to the contents of the publications is not available for either collection, and neither offers individual titles for purchase. A  related study found that only 44% of the publications indexed by Alternative Press Centre were microfilmed leading to the conclusion that libraries may be doing their patrons a disservice if they do not subscribe to all the publications available. Their value for historical research; risk of loss through fire, theft, or deterioration; and the limited number of libraries maintaining such collections are the major reasons cited for the publications to be reproduced and preserved on film. A brief commentary on other micropublishers engaged in filming radical publications and recommendations for future action are included. A bibliography and titles available from Bell and Howell and Alternative Press Centre in microfilm are appended. (Author/JPF)",

The purpose of this project was to identify the kinds of derivative information products needed by users of science information and to delineate characteristics of the user and his work which determine how the products should be designed. Identification of derivative information product needs was accomplished through structured interviews with 14 researchers (from three institutions) and 12 teachers (from two school systems) active in environmental science. Product design criteria were determined through case studies with two researchers and two teachers to develop  products relative to their current work requirements. Researchers shared a need for eight derivative information products which were grouped into: (1) content related products, (2) method related products, and (3) special data storage and retrieval products. Four of the eight information products described by the high school teachers were similar in structure to those identified by the researchers. Specific derivative information products were prepared for the researchers and teachers by information specialists, according to their needs as determined by the case studies. Materials for teachers were selected to assist in lecture and laboratory preparation and to provide audiovisual presentations for the classroom. Results of the research demonstrated a need for derivative information  products which can be prepared by information specialists on the basis of interviews with users. (Author/JAB)",

Empirical evidence in support of these theories and instrumentation limitations are discussed. One such limitation is that students are not given an opportunity to express preferences for instructional styles. Description is given of the content and development of an instrument designed to provide educators with information on how students perceive (1) their own need for structure, and (2) the degree to which teacher-student matches and mismatches cause a fluctuating level of classroom state anxiety affecting student learning. The results of data collection utilizing the instrument in a school setting are reported, with a discussion of  how teachers might use this data to better understand their students. (Author/KP)",

A diagnostic model, based on a \"procedural network\" as opposed to a \"semantic network,\" is presented which provides a technique both for modelling the underlying cognitive processes of a procedural skill and for finding a way to account for manifested errors in the performance of that skill. A technique is described for analyzing the problem solving trace or protocol of a student and then automatically synthesizing a model of the problem solving strategies and motivations which were used to arrive at the solution. The underlying theory captures the reasoning powers of a master tutor and is seen as useful for guiding a  computer-based laboratory tutor and for measuring how problem solving performance is evolving. It differs from classical computer assisted instruction by focusing on techniques for teaching procedural knowledge and reasoning strategies which are best learned through hands-on tasks with the guidance of an automated intelligent tutor.

Conclusions from the pilot study and other studies of the information environment of the general population indicated that the blue collar adult has information needs and patterns of information seeking and media use similar to the general population, except that he or she is less likely to perceive everyday problems as needs for information. Human  beings, television, and newspapers were primary sources of information; radio, magazines, and books were little used; and library use was negligible.

Each city's NIC was evaluated in the areas of service objectives, site, community involvement, publicity, NIC in the context of other library services, staffing, delivery of services, administration, future activities and plans, strengths and areas of  attention, users and resource agencies. The project made visible the libraries' attempts at information and referral services and facilitated exchange of ideas and information. However, more objective measurements and research were needed.

Librarians can team teach courses on technical writing and introduce students to the major information sources in their fields. They can give presentations, publish handbooks, bibliographies, and pathfinders on library resources, and present audiovisual programs for library orientation. Engineering instructors and administrators should realize that library resources are important, and that librarians are willing to work with the instructor in developing instructional programs to improve students' library skills. Advantages of such instruction to students are: (1) they can collect background information more efficiently; and (2) they have the opportunity without undue  dependence on a instructor's guidance.

Data from 1972-73 through 1976-77 indicated that fall to spring attrition (term-to-term) was approximately 34%. Spring to fall averaged 47%, with graduation, successful transfers, and returns of stopouts tending to reduce this to 20%. Within-term withdrawals averaged 8% from 1971 to 1976, with 28% reporting work conflict as their withdrawal reason in 1976. Although course withdrawals decreased when non-punitive grading practices were established in 1974, highs reported in 1976 included 26% in chemistry, 18% in physics, and 17% each in engineering, political science, and  psychology, compared with a college-wide average of 12%. Students not passing the course (course inefficiency) averaged 27% with higher failure rates in developmental studies, English, science-math, social sciences, and business technology. Early warning notices in fall 1976, did not change retention rates. Recommendations included allowing students to drop courses and petition for full or partial credit, based on course objectives being met; developing a student contract system; using continuing education units; and training faculty to identify student objectives. Attrition and grade data and a summary analysis of the spring semester 1977, are appended. (RT)",

To cope with these influences it is proposed that new instructional approaches be encouraged, that organizational structures be examined and redesigned, and that management systems be employed. The latter could include program budgeting, modeling for budget projections, and management by objectives. In addition, the factors  of greater faculty productivity, interinstitutional cooperation, and the restoration of the authority and responsibility of the president are seen as necessary to the survival of the community college as a viable part of higher education.

Students indicated that they had received program information through brochures (317), conversation at work (92), newspapers (83), publicity displays (56), and high school counselors (35). Three out of four preferred instruction at off-campus locations, rather than at the main campus. Interest in possible new off-campus degree and/or certificate programs was indicated by 409 respondents. The  majority preferred registration by mail or advanced computer service. Although many respondents expressed interest in movies, crafts, musical events, etc., there was a notable lack of interest in local student association participation. Most respondents were age 26 or above (63%), and 60% were female. In addition to summary data, the report presents question item totals and general summaries for each center.

Resultant criteria would then be used to place applicants into a &quot;qualified pool&quot; from which individuals would be randomly selected for admission. An analysis was made of the records of 159 nursing graduates of 1976 on demographic variables, SBE sub-test scores, Comparative Guidance and Placement tests (CGP) taken at entry, process variables, grade point average (GPA), and nursing and science course repeats. CGP test scores appeared to discriminate between SBE passes and failures. In a second study, these variables were  submitted to regression analysis, with an established criterion of a midpoint score of 50 on the CGP related to the number of SBE sub-tests passed. Fifty-one subjects with complete variable sets were analyzed, with the criterion variable accounting for 56% of the variance in the number of SBE subsets passed and the CGP reading score alone accounting for 43%. The addition of the other variables explained 69% of the variance, supporting the possible establishment of a score of 50 on the CGP as one requirement for the &quot;qualified applicant&quot; pool.

        "description":"After an examination of societal currents leading up to the student revolution of the sixties, the author develops a theoretical concept of needs assessment. Assuming that effective needs assessment and program planning depends on the success of simulating the &quot;needing&quot; process of constituents, he divides community college clientele into two types: the &quot;idiographic&quot; or individual-centered, and the &quot;nomothetic&quot; or societally centered. These types are then explored along behavioral transaction patterns that result from their identified needs states. The interactive or transactional approach is next applied to needs assessment techniques including the task force approach, the Nominal Group Process, the Delphi Technique, the Transactional Evaluation Model, and the Charette. Omnibus  and targeted surveys are then examined in relation to general and specialized clientele, including the handicapped, senior citizens, Latins, Blacks, and Native Americans. Finally, a strategic planning model is presented which can facilitate program development for new constituencies. (RT)",

Only 68% had met course prerequisites, regardless of the type of registration process (regular, open, late) through which they had been admitted. Sixty-four students successfully completed the course, and of these, students who did not have prerequisites were as likely to be successful as those who did. Of the 16 who failed who did not have prerequisite instruction, 13 were from two of the seven chemistry  sections. Ten out of 11 students enrolling for transfer credit were successful. Of students under age 25, 51% were successful, while 65% of those above 25 received passing grades. Of the latter, 15 or 88% earned A or B grades, while only 50% of the 48 younger successful students received an A or B. Efforts to follow-up students who dropped the course were unsuccessful. The survey and drop-out questionnaires are appended. (RT)",

        "description":"In order to determine the academic success rate of New Jersey community college transfer students at receiving senior institutions in New Jersey, statewide transfer data were examined for 1,523 full-time transfer juniors in the 1974-75 school year. Transfer students earned a grade point average (GPA) of 2.8 prior to transfer, compared with 2.9 for their junior year. By the end of their junior year, transfers had earned a 3.0 GPA at public and a 2.9 GPA at independent colleges, compared with a 2.9 and 2.8, respectively, for non-transfer or &quot;native&quot; students. Three year cumulative GPA averaged 2.8 for both native and transfer students at public and private colleges. Examination of junior year GPA distributions for transfers revealed that l1% earned less than 2.0, 48% earned a GPA  between 2.0 and 2.9, and 41% averaged a 3.0 to 4.0 GPA. In addition, 83% of those transfer students who had been graduated with a two-year college GPA between 2.0 and 2.4, and 98% who averaged between 3.5 and 4.0, earned better than a 2.0 in the receiving institution. Credits attempted during spring 1975 at public four-year colleges averaged 15.4, with an average of 15.0 credits earned, leaving a credit difference of .4; a similar pattern was observed during the second semester of the junior year at independent senior institutions, indicating satisfactory completion of most course work.

A needs assessment identified the following areas which more systematic planning and management might address: a contraction of the college's resource base, a shifting student market, and an increase in the size and complexity of the college. Management objectives were then designed to cope with these needs. Task forces developed institutional goals, defined organizational relationships, and created a planning model, after which the top administrators participated in a pilot planning year. The second year involved middle-level administrators, with a task force established to research and  recommend changes in the budgetary process. The two-year planning process resulted in increased budgetary management and a clarification of areas of administrative responsibility, but did not encompass accountability and student responsiveness. Full implementation of long-range planning is expected to be complete in two additional years. (RT)",

The children were of comparable mean age (4.3 years), school behavioral adjustment and sex distribution (10 boys and 10 girls per group). All children attended federally funded day care. The training involved ICPS training for the mothers themselves and a sequenced set of 20-minute lessons that the mothers administered to their children daily for 3 months. Results showed that relative to controls, trained mothers improved in ICPS ability and mother-trained children improved in both ICPS ability and in  school behaviors. It was concluded that ICPS ability functions as a significant behavioral mediator and that mothers' improved thinking and childrearing style skills contributed significantly to their children's development of that ability.

Procedures were developed for scoring affection and aggression during group play. The context of reading a story was used to facilitate affection. There were four modes of presentation of the story: Control (no reference to affection); Verbal Cuing (verbal stress on affectionate behaviors in the story); Modeling (modeling of affection during presentation); and Modeling/Practice (modeling reinforced with practice of affection). Measures of affection and aggression directed at toys and peers were taken during free play periods before and after story  presentation. The last treatment was the only one to significantly increase affectionate behavior directed at toys in both sexes. In the same group, there was also a decrease in aggressive behavior by boys directed at toys. The results are discussed in terms of strategies for obtaining desired social behavior. (Author/SB)",

        "description":"This discussion of government policy concerning child day care calls for a shift from provider-oriented to consumer-oriented services funded under Title XX of the Social Security Amendments. Three general views of child day care are described: the social services view, the school-oriented view, and a newer, parent-supportive, consumer-oriented view. An extensive discussion focuses on major problems of the Title XX program for child day care, including: restrictive federal requirements, such as the ceiling on state expenditures and the requirement that a single state agency administer the state's entire Title XX program; absence of a preventive and family-supportive approach to day care; limits to eligibility and lack of a sliding fee scale (in 20 states), resulting in segregation  of the poor; faulty payment methods; and inadequate provision of training, particularly for licensing and regulatory personnel. Options for new legislative and administrative solutions to these problems are discussed. Recommendations include: increased citizen-consumer voice in policy-making, a flexible delivery system to match shifting demand patterns, universal accessibility, and a sliding fee scale. (BF)",

        "description":"Elementary school teachers' perceptions of the Technology for Children Program (T4C) were the subject of this dissertation. The T4C program involved a learn-by-doing approach to language arts, science, mathematics and social studies instruction in elementary schools. The program involved the development of &quot;Episodes&quot; or &quot;Unit Kits&quot; for teaching a variety of skills and concepts. Kits dealt with such areas as photography, bottle recycling, rocketry and weaving. The dissertation surveyed teachers' attitudes concerning three goals of the program: improvement in students' level of self-awareness, understanding of technology, and academic skills. A questionnaire was designed to explore attitudes towards these goals and was administered to 24 teachers selected randomly from first  through sixth grade classrooms in the Bayonne, New Jersey, school district. Teacher ratings of 509 students indicated that the teachers perceived significant growth in children's self-awareness and understanding of technology, but not in academic skill development (in comparison with control groups). The dissertation also included an extensive literature review describing the development of the T4C program and surveying related projects in the United States and Great Britain. (BD)",

The aspects of effective parenting discussed include parental sensitivity or empathic understanding of the child, authoritative versus authoritarian and permissive parenting styles, consistency of parental discipline, parents as role models, single-parent families versus intact families, working mothers, and day care. The major problems inherent in drawing inferences about parenting from research on socialization are identified as: (1) the difficulty of determining the direction  of effects in correlational data, (2) the implicit assumption that all children are equally and similarly malleable, (3) the numerous sources of socialization influence other than parents, and (4) the difficulties of investigating the content as well as the style of parental demands.

        "description":"This paper reports on data collected during the 7-month pilot operation of a diagnostic and counseling service for intellectually advanced children and their families established in conjunction with a longitudinal study of such children. A summary of data on the first 24 cases handled by the service (involving children aged 3 to 11 years) indicated that parents of intellectually advanced children are legitimately concerned about the lack of appropriate educational options for their children. In most cases, intelligence and achievement test data confirmed parent perceptions of their children as intellectually advanced. Stanford-Binet IQ's showed a mean score of 138, with individual scores ranging from 108 to above the scale limits. Achievement test scores (Peabody Individual  Achievement Test) showed a mean overall advance of 3.5 years beyond actual grade level. Parents of the preschool children anticipated problems of boredom and maladjustment, while the most common concern reported by parents of the older children was that the child was frustrated by lack of challenge in school work. Follow-up of these cases has indicated that the service's reports to parents had been useful in facilitating changes in the children's school programs. The provision of more readily available counseling services to parents of intellectually advanced children is recommended. (Author/BF)",

Observations of nearly 400 drawings yielded the following generalizations: (1) drawing is symbolic almost from the beginning; (2) appreciation of the representational nature of drawing in the \"scribbling\" stage requires observation of the creative process; (3) the child's drawings were composed of recognizable routines (such as ovals, squares, and sunbursts) and strategies (such as filling in all open forms); (4) the combination of subroutines and strategies created a distinctive \"style\"; and (5) changes were largely attributable to the waxing and waning of specific subroutines and strategies rather than to general cognitive  growth, suggesting that the child's drawing was more reflective of the development of a performance system than of a knowledge system.

The Education Commission of the States (ECS) investigated international need for and interest in the establishment of a common pool of information from international sources, and developed an approach to establishing such a system. Three phases of the study are described. Phase I involved distribution of a questionnaire exploring early childhood needs to communications experts, early childhood agency officials and professionals in 75 nations. Questionnaire responses resulted in the convening of subsequent planning sessions (Phases II and III) during which guidelines were established on systems design and  implementation. It appeared that structuring an information system through informal arrangements with countries and regional organizations, as opposed to working through official government or U.N. agencies, was most feasible. A pilot project was proposed in which the International Children's Centre (with the assistance of ECS) would: (1) create a repository of developmental, program, communications and motivational information, and (2) provide this information to researchers and scholars, decision-makers, and persons who work with young children. Two major products available from the information center would be: knowledge abstracts, and how-to-do-it kits. A meeting was set for the spring of 1977 to review the program's progress. (BF)",

Variables used were: family income, family size, age, sex, education, residence, socioeconomic status, and cultural variation. Sex and residence were dummied in the  regression analysis. Findings included: Chicanos not only underutilized dental services, but the services they did use were primarily those of a &quot;symptomatic&quot; nature; for Chicanos, socioeconomic variables played a negligible role in explaining dental utilization, although they were more important for Anglos; a substantially larger proportion of Chicanos had not seen the dentist in the past year, and of those who had, the pattern of frequency of visitations was a lesser number of visits for Chicanos than Anglos; and Chicanos had a higher proportion of tooth extractions and dentures.

During July and August 1975, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 57 men and 161 women living in Armstrong and Butler Counties, Pennsylvania. The sample included 119 commercial farm households and 99 rural nonfarm households. No significant differences were found between farm and nonfarm adults on preventive health attitudes, beliefs, knowledge or behaviors (e.g., susceptibility, seriousness, knowledge of cancer warning signals, dietary habits). In the case of perceived susceptibility to selected diseases, knowledge of cancer warning signals, and blood pressure checking, males consistently perceived themselves as being less susceptible to the  selected illnesses than did females. Further, men's lower recall of the cancer warning signals (70% able to recall less than two) suggested the need for building a greater knowledge among men of the physiological changes related most closely to cancers having the highest 5-year survival rates. The general orientation of the adults interviewed toward health maintenance was overwhelmingly positive. Approximately 80% engaged in regular activities to maintain their health. Three practices mentioned by those actively seeking to maintain their health (diet, exercise, rest) cost very little. This may suggest that educational programs should make an effort to involve individuals at least initially in activities having a low cost. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"Data derived from the 1970 National Fertility Study (NFS II included post-married women, information on all compositional factors for each respondent, and an 18-item section on sex-role ideology) were used to test the following hypotheses: farm women are more traditional in sex-role ideology than nonfarm women; the higher the sex-role traditionalism, the higher the actual fertility; the higher farm than nonfarm fertility will be sustained after age at first marriage, education, marital instability, labor force participation, religion, race, and duration of marriage have been controlled; the farm-nonfarm fertility differential will disappear after these same variables and sex-role ideology have been controlled. Sex-role ideology included dimensions of captured normative  orientations re: female rights of access to extrafamilial roles; beliefs about the consequences to a woman and her family of procreation that such norms presuppose; and beliefs regarding innate physiological, psychological, or mental capacities conditioned by gender. Results indicated support for hypotheses I and II and lack of support for hypotheses III and IV; however, it was suggested that although residence had the smallest statistically significant regression weight, the very uneven division of the sample between farm and nonfarm categories (6% vs 94%) might account for an underestimation of the effect of residence, particularly since rural nonfarm was subsumed in the nonfarm category.

Reviewing the literature on voluntary associations, this paper considers traditional models of rural education within the context of the literature;  examines the differences between rural and urban voluntary associations; and presents major elements of a rural educational model derived from the literature and the experience of free universities in college communities. By way of example, the University for Man (UFM), a free university located in Manhattan, Kansas, is described in terms of its development (1968-present) and its impact on small rural communities which modeled themselves after UFM in the development of community education programs (emphasis is on the necessity of advisory boards, a thorough needs assessment, and rural control over outside funding and expertise).

Although its primary intent is that of education, the program addresses other areas such as health and social services. In 1976, New York's In-Camp Learning Program served 400 migrant farmworkers in 15 camps in the counties of Livingston, Northern Steuben, and Wyoming. These workers included mainly Southern black migrants as well as Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and whites. The program's major goal was to help these farmworkers master those tools of communication, thinking and self-direction that best help them make those decisions critical to their daily and future lives. This guidebook presents general guidelines for developing an In-Camp Learning Program;  outlines the 1976 In-Camp Learning Program's basic educational needs, objectives, learning experiences, and evaluative procedures; summarizes the activities conducted at the various camps; discusses five teaching strategies used by the in-camp teachers and tutors, giving a sample lesson plan for each; and briefly describes various supportive services and programs. Appendices include a listing of the labor camps in New York, guidelines for personal conduct in working in the camps, listing of audiovisual equipment for in-camp use, a basic math inventory, program policies and procedures, a listing of the College Assistance Migrant Programs and the High School Equivalency Programs in the U.S., and copies of various forms used in the program.

        "description":"This report is an account of the North American Regional Seminar on Environmental Education that was held in St. Louis, Missouri from October 5-8, 1976. The idea for this seminar was developed at the Unesco/UNEP Workshop held in Belgrade in October, 1975. The seminar report details the extensive data gathering and planning efforts, the Seminar itself, and some of the actions that have occurred as a result of the meeting. Central focus of the seminar for most of the participants was regional, national, and/or personal. The seminar process dealt with the important issues related to environment and education in Canada and the United States. Papers presented at the meetings are given in the report. Appendices include the text of the Belgrade Charter, pre-conference papers, and a  listing of seminar sponsors and exhibitors, alliance affiliated organizations, and seminar registrants.

The mathematical theory of probability plays an increasingly important role in science, government, industry, business, and economics. An understanding of the basic concepts of probability is essential for the study of statistical methods that are widely used in the behavioral and social, as well as the biological and physical, sciences.

In particular, the loaded beam experiment introduces negative numbers, opposites, absolute values and addition of signed numbers.

The falling sphere experiment gives the same kind of data but also requires the fitting of a &quot;best&quot; straight line. The quadratic function is  approached through three experiments: the wick, horizontal metronome, and oscillating spring.

It was the first California racial and ethnic survey to be designed and conducted by the Department of Education, Office of Program Evaluation and Research. The survey found that early in the 1973-74 school year more than 30% of the 4.4 million pupils in California public schools were members of racial and ethnic minority groups, compared with 25% in 1967-68. Statistics are presented on the distribution of staff by type of position and sex in each racial and ethnic group and the concentration of minority and majority group personnel by geographic and other classifications. In addition, the report presents a  comparison of fall 1973 with fall 1967 data. In 1973-74, minorities comprised 11.6% of classroom teachers, 12% of total professional school staff, and 9.7% of the professional staff employed in school district and county central office positions. The data indicate an increase in the number of minorities employed when compared with the number reported in the 1966-67 survey. Most of the gain by minorities was in numbers and proportion of classroom teachers. There was a significant growth also in the ranks of minority principals and assistant principals.

        "description":"The report presents survey results about the marital histories of husbands and wives or changes in marital status of mothers and characteristics of their children. Data were collected in June 1975, by the U. S. Bureau of the Census. An introduction summarizes trends which the data suggest. Seven sections discuss number of times husband and wife have been married, age at divorce and number of children, marital history and level of education, living arrangements of children, and age at widowhood and duration of widowhood. About four of every five couples are in their first marriage. College graduates and couples with high income are most likely to have stable marriages. Level of educational attainment has consistently shown an inverse relationship with marital disruption for both  men and women. Divorce usually occurs to women under 30 years of age, and remarriage is more likely when the woman is under 30. Nearly all young childless divorcees eventually remarry. More women 14 to 75 have had their first marriage end in divorce than in widowhood. Women who remarry do so a year sooner after divorce than after widowhood. The bulk of the report contains tables of statistics. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"This book is designed to help educators design and plan curriculum on women's studies. It focuses on the curriculum changes needed to eliminate sex role stereotypes and presents a new model for achieving psychological androgyny--a climate in which men and women will be able to develop freely without the inhibitions and constraints of sex roles. Although women's studies on the college campus are examined, the primary focus is on grades K-12. It is determined that at the pre-college level, students form concepts not only through subject matter, but also through teacher and administrator attitudes, patterns of staffing, and male/female differentation in career counseling and extracurricular activities. Unless direct teaching is accompanied by indirect learning, attempts to change  stereotypes will be futile. Separate chapters examine the needs for a women's studies curriculum, discuss the theory and practice of sex role development, present a new model created to answer these needs, and make suggestions for implementation of the model. Methods for the integration of women's studies within specific subject areas, within the administration, the counseling department, industrial and vocational education, and extracurricular activities form the major portion of the book. The necessity of integrating women's studies into curriculum courses is addressed to schools of education. Definitions of such terms as sex role stereotyping, sexism, and sex role socialization are clarified. (KC)",

The major objectives are to help students understand the science and technology of energy, make informed and fair judgments on energy options, make personal life-style commitments which are morally responsible, and prepare for participation opportunities in setting energy policy. The units contain easy to implement student activities which deal with conservation, fossil sources of energy, generating electric power, and life-styles. Teachers can integrate the activities into many subject areas including social studies, science, earth science, geography, reading, mathematics, and spelling. The activities are varied and  involve students in classroom discussions, making collages, writing pamphlets on ways to conserve energy, drawing cartoons, doing mathematics exercises, constructing a model nuclear power station, and doing scientific experiments.

Planning components include reviewing the institution's legal basis and requirements such as federal environmental impact statements, affirmative action plans, safety requirements, state policies, and local ordinances; clearly articulating the planning philosophy; and systematically reviewing community college planning literature in order to generate a strategy paper. The data base necessary for planning includes information on the service area and the college in  terms of demography, manpower and employment needs, public school enrollments and graduation projections, educational needs, and college history, philosophy and goals, educational programs and fiscal organization. Determination of long-range goals requires establishing committees for program, organization, and facilities assessments, and for reviewing planning assumptions.

The cognitive-affective interaction view is traced from John Dewey and the Progressive Education Movement to the work of Jean Piaget. Among concepts discussed and evaluated from a historical perspective are the significance of self initiated play, the role of education in bringing about social change, and the debate between the behaviorists and the cognitive psychologists.

The paper contends that two types of learning exist: self-initiated learning which is intrinsically motivated, and learning initiated by another person which involves external rewards. The paper suggests that motivation is not unidimensional and that task performance reflects the motivational system involved. The paper reviews early and current research on the effects of rewards on motivation which suggest that, for educational purposes, rewards limit a student's engagement in an activity, affect what is learned, and affect a student's desire to return to the activity involved. It is also suggested that rewards have undesirable effects on the teachers who dispense them. The paper contends  that education should focus more on children's intrinsic motivation for learning. A variety of research is reviewed which highlights the child's intrinsic motivation to pursue questions of patterns and regularities in the world and related causal explanations. Also reviewed are studies which focus on the child's intrinsic desire to explore solutions to new problems and to relate new information to previously acquired knowledge. The paper suggests that education should take advantage of this intrinsic motivation to learn and to understand. (BD)",

Teaching sessions consisted of each parent helping his or her child memorize a 20-item set of pictures of familiar objects for a free-recall task. Verbal communications of each parent were converted into message units, defined as single meaningful statements or questions. Four primary strategies were evident: simple naming, item elaboration, story elaboration, and grouping. Results indicated that the only strategy frequently used by both mothers and fathers was simple naming. Children achieved similar levels of reacall with both mothers and fathers serving as teachers. Recall scores increased with chronological age, and the  number of items recalled at both age levels was substantially higher than the numbers reported previously by Meyers and Permutter for same-age children under self-study instructions. There was no apparent connection between any of the teaching strategies parents used and the children's ability to remember the picture names. Strategy-related message units were recoded on the basis of whether they encouraged or required the child to operate on the items (by grouping, elaborating or naming) and whether the child did so. Results indicated that less than 25% of all strategy-related communications encouraged the child to operate on an item, and of those statements, only 19% were successful. Plans for a survey to study parental emphasis on memory in the home are discussed. (Author/SB)",

Three first grade students were taken out of the classroom individually for a 45-minute training session over three consecutive days. A variety of tasks appropriate for the students' grade level were used in training. The 5-step training procedure included modeling and instruction by an instructor as well as overt and covert self-instruction by the subject as he performed each task.  Positive reinforcement was used in the classroom following training. Results indicate that self-instruction training sessions can be effective in increasing assignment completion in the elementary school, particularly if the student's baseline performance is low.

The five principles of bonding cited include: the role of the senses in the process of bonding experienced by the infant in his interaction with the parent, the long-lasting effects of early events surrounding bonding at birth and infancy, and the traumatic experience of early separation from the parent. School age effects of inadequate bonding are discussed, and a promotion of interaction, or bonding, at the various stages of intellectual development is recommended. The return-to-basics movement is viewed in the light of a return to the  basic needs of the child: a need to learn in a setting that does not do violence to the child's own inner timetable of development, a need to experience the security of a bond, and a need for education which does not emphasize one type of intelligence at the expense of another nor threaten the child's natural wholeness.

        "description":"This study examined the relationship between parents' use of a person oriented disciplinary technique and their children's use of moral intentionality. Person oriented parents were characterized as those who emphasize their children's needs and intentions, in contrast to position oriented parents who expect children to adhere to socially accepted rules and to obey their parents because of the parents' inherent authority. Participants were 43 white, middle-class families: 21 families with a second grade girl and 22 families with a second grade boy. All testing was conducted in the child's home. Each child was given the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and was asked to rate the naughtiness of a story character in a series of story situations. A Moral Judgment Coefficient was then  computed for each child as a quantitative measure of the extent to which the child used intent to evaluate the naughtiness of the story character. Each parent's social code was assessed by asking mothers and fathers to respond to four problem situations as if they were speaking directly to their child. The parents' responses were then recorded, transcribed, and scored for person orientation versus social rule (or position) orientation. Results indicated that the use of a person orientation by mothers was significantly related to the use of moral intentionality by their second grade sons or daughters. No relationship was found between fathers' social code and the type of moral judgment made by their children. (JMB)",

Techniques parents and teachers can use to help children improve recall memory skills are described. Differences between recognition memory and recall memory are discussed and it is suggested that the forgetfulness of young children is due to their inability to recall rather than to their failure to recognize. Children's recall failures are attributed to their lack of planning and preparation for memory. Signs of memory planfulness are said to appear by age 7 or 8, and these signs are reinforced by school related expectations and demands. Requiring children to sort materials into appropriate groupings  and ask meaningful questions about the things they study are cited as ways to improve children's recall memory. (CM)",

        "description":"This paper discusses a survey which was conducted to determine what licensers in different states say to parents who call them seeking help in selecting a day care program for their children, and confirms the assumption that parents have few resources available to help them select good day care. A questionnaire regarding the kinds of information that licensers are able to provide parents was sent to state day care licensing agencies in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Responses to the survey indicate that with a few exceptions, state day care licensing agencies have written or unwritten policies which prevent licensers from providing parents with information on the quality of specific local day care centers or recommending one center over another. In most  cases, then, licensing guidelines do not provide parents with a tool they can use to distinguish those centers that barely meet minimum standards from those that go far beyond minimum standards.

Subjects for the study were 30 nine-year-olds, 39 eleven-year-olds, and 23 thirteen-year-olds who had been classified as reflective or impulsive at ages 7, 9, and 11 and who had been followed longitudinally over a three year period. The Matching Familiar Figures (MFF) test and four problem solving tasks which provided information on problem solving strategies were administered each year during the program. The results of the study suggest that children who were classified as reflective on the MFF were more likely to adopt more systematic and/or mature strategies on tasks which required sequential hypothesis testing and information processing than were impulsive  children of the same age. The longitudinal analysis suggested that reflective children acquired efficient strategies more rapidly over the early elementary years than did impulsive children. At the same time, the relative impact of reflection-impulsivity varied systematically with the developmental level of the subjects, with the relative difficulty of the problem for children at different stages of cognitive development, and with repeated experiences with the problems used in the study.

        "description":"The Education Commission of the States appointed a task force composed of members of Congress, state legislatures, state boards of education, chief state school officers, business, industry and other pertinent service agencies to recommend to the Federal, state and local governments methods whereby interstate and interagency cooperation can provide educational and other services to migrant workers and their families. The task force developed two broad categories of recommendations. The first category consisted of task force position statements that address goals for migrant education, limitations or guidelines in pursuit of cooperation, task force strategy, and the need for more public information concerning migrant students and families. In the second category, critical areas of  change needed at the Federal, state and local levels were addressed. Within this category were such recommendations as assigning coordination responsibility, administrative procedures, interstate planning, and Federal and state program regulations. Suggestions for future project and task force action were included. Among the recommendations were: more emphasis be placed on the economic benefits migrants bring to local communities and school districts; after consultation with the states, separate regulations specifically for migrant students be developed by USOE; funding on a regional, multistate or migrant stream administration basis for planning and implementation strategy be developed by USOE.

        "description":"Adult leaders from 14 counties, divided into matched participating (57) and control (54) groups, were surveyed to evaluate whether Cooperative Extension Service programs on land use planning in Arkansas resulted in increased knowledge and more favorable attitudes toward such planning. Participants filled out attitudinal questionnaires before attending an educational meeting. After two months, questionnaires including attitudinal, factual, and demographic questions were sent to both groups. Results did not substantiate a previous evaluation showing no knowledge increase but greater favorability. In this study, no significant meeting effects were found. Though the participating group was more favorable toward county government control of land use planning, less favorable toward  Federal responsibility, and less likely to think no government level should be involved than the control group, these differences were shown to have existed even before the meeting. Only one factual item was significantly different--meeting participants were more likely to know zoning could protect farm land from urban development. Although this and the earlier evaluation found interest about land use planning high, county leaders preferred data on current land use policies and actual planning processes. Also, newsletters or some other medium might be more effective than public meetings. (RS)",

As representatives of Louisiana's educational system, they deal with problems and situations directly, meeting with the migrant parents and children in their home territory to discuss educational alternatives for the children. Intended to assist recruiters throughout the state as they join together to increase enrollment and  enlarge the migrant programs, this handbook presents information pertaining to (1) the recruiter's responsibility--duties, information collection, forms used in recruiting, reports, and follow-up; and (2) recruiting procedures--recruitment, psychology of recruitment, and techniques of recruitment. Copies of the following forms are included: the survey/eligibility/enrollment form, enrollment procedure form, daily log, special comment sheet, request for special services, and request for supportive services.

The setting of the community is detailed, as well as the workings and philosophy of its rural school. The goal of the program is described as an attempt to make a variety of career alternatives real for students, from the option of staying within the community to leaving. General features of a curriculum for small rural schools are given and four  modern teaching methods as applied in rural areas are described: role-playing, hands-on activities, use of resource persons, and field trips--all used in conjunction with career education. A major portion of the report is devoted to kindergarten through senior high activity oriented, rural-urban, short- and long-term exchange possibilities to reduce rural students' isolation. The report concludes with a section on the hometown option, including teaching community appreciation, (with &quot;Foxfire&quot;-type suggestions) and skills for hometown living.

The effects of urbanization, acculturation, and socioeconomic status on extended family structure among Mexican Americans was also explored. Interviews with a stratified random sample of 666 Mexican Americans in 9 census tracts were conducted in the spring and summer of 1975, and with 340 Anglo Americans from the same census tracts in the spring of 1976. Most respondents were middle aged, female and married. Residential stability was much more characteristic of the Mexican Americans. The majority of  the Mexican American heads of household were blue collar workers, mostly semi-skilled and unskilled, with an average of nine years of education; the majority of Anglos were white collar workers with one or more years of college. Of the Mexican Americans, 40% were first generation (born in Mexico), 35% second generation, and 19% third generation. It was found that Mexican Americans had more kin in town, more frequent interaction with nearby relatives, and more exchange of mutual aid with kin. There was no indication that the traditional Mexican American extended family broke down with urbanization, acculturation or socioeconomic mobility. It was suggested that discrimination by the Anglo majority reinforced kin ties among Mexican Americans. (NQ)",

The stated purpose of the manual is to provide an on-the-job reference for operators of these two types of treatment plants. The overall objective of the manual is to aid the operator in determining what process control and operationsl measures may be most effective in optimizing the performance of his/her particular treatment plant. The manual is presented in three major divisions: (1) activated sludge process, (2) trickling filter process, and (3) appendices. The first two divisions are each divided into four sections: (1) troubleshooting, (2) process control, (3) fundamentals, and (4) laboratory control. Each section  concludes with a list of selected references. This publication assumes familiarity with these two aerobic treatment processes, but it includes fundamentals sections in the first two divisions for those who may be unfamiliar with these processes. The four appendices contain material on operational records, plant visits, laboratory equipment, and a glossary. (MR)",

The students chosen majored in a wide range of environmentally related studies on university and college campuses across the United States. Selected research topics were undertaken to bring fresh, hopefully unbiased, viewpoints on existing environmental problems in the anticipation that their contributions would suggest new avenues for the development of current long-range environmental strategy. The students, composing five investigative teams, concentrated their efforts on: (1) a possible approach toward quantifying the concept &quot;quality-of-life&quot;; (2) development of an accounting system for  allocating pollution produced by industry as a result of consumer demands for goods and the environment; (3) investigating the realm of environmental management; and (4) how the generation of pollution differs as a characteristic of a community's location within large metropolitan areas. This volume, the first in a series, presents a synopsis of the full length reports published as separate reports in this series. (Author/BB)",

An operational definition of a QOL index and discussion of terminology is presented. Thereafter the report discusses the functional relationship between objective and subjective conditions used as a theoretical framework to measure QOL and develop a QOL Index. QOL factors are presented encompassing Economic, Social,  Political, Health, Physical and Natural Environmental Sectors. Each of these factor lists is divided into subfactors and encompasses such things as income distribution, family, electoral participation, nutrition, housing, and air. Objective measures, where they exist, are given for each subfactor, although they are merely examples and by no means an exhaustive listing. The report closes with a discussion of analytical dimensions of QOL Index and the potential uses and misuses of such an Index. (Author/BB)",

The lessons in this unit develop the network idea around a simple electrical distribution system that we depend on and also into further consideration of electrical energy itself. The network idea in the later lessons emphasizes the interdependence of the man-made network for producing and distributing electrical energy and the natural ecological network. In the final lesson, the consuming end of the network is examined and some strategies for consuming electrical energy are examined. Students should learn that energy networks such as the electrical circuits are a necessary part of modern life. They are also  expected to learn about sources, conversions, and uses of electrical energy. There are six lessons in this fourth- and fifth-grade unit.

        "description":"This guide is designed to aid social studies classroom teachers develop and implement programs using the community as a social sciences laboratory. The document describes how to prepare a social profile of the community. Based upon the Colorado System-Based Social Science Project which was sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the study aims to increase the options of youth in their home communities and in communities to which they might migrate. The document is presented in three parts. Part I presents background information on the system-based social science curriculum, stresses the need for a strong community-school relationship, and explains how to generate local curriculum guidelines. Part II outlines strategies for use in preparing a community social profile.  Information is presented on clarifying the purpose of a community profile, specifying format, putting together a research and writing team, selecting research tools, and determining content. Part III, the bulk of the document, suggests a wide variety of learning activities and objectives related to children's awareness of values, social reality, social problems, systems, time and space, work and leisure, the future, and social science knowledge. The activities, which can be used without prior preparation of a profile, involve the students in analyzing historic documents, defining values, discussing parental and community attitudes, surveying class and community members, presenting oral reports on current issues, writing research reports on selected community problems, working with maps,  and participating in the community. The appendix presents an outline of the Community Social Profile. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Offered in response to a request for background information from the Congressional Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Technology, the document presents a report of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) support for social and psychological sciences research. Major objectives of the report are to review the origins of NSF support programs; assess issues of priorities, management, and use; and consider NSF support programs in the context of the total federal research support effort. The document is presented in six chapters. Chapter I offers a summary of the report. Chapter II discusses general trends which characterize NSF funding for psychology and social science programs and examines the need for a balanced perspective on support of quantitative versus nonquantitative  studies. Chapter III describes the origin and evolution of NSF's psychological and social sciences support programs since 1960. Chapters IV and V assess NSF funded programs, including objectives, management, proposal review mechanisms, and relationship of NSF programs to those supported by other agencies. Chapter V offers final observations. These include: (1) many NSF funding problems are typical of any federally supported scientific research program; (2) policymakers are increasingly calling upon social scientists for information; (3) creation of a separate National Social Science Foundation would simplify funding, management, and communication problems.

        "description":"Five units are designed to assist kindergarten teachers in developing and implementing social studies programs which focus on introducing children to the world, its resources, and its peoples. Designed as a readiness program to help prepare kindergarten children for the primary grade social studies program, these units identify instructional activities and resources that correlate basic map and locational skills with global awareness objectives. The five units are: (1) earth as the home of people--the child's immediate physical world; (2) our global earth--distinguishing between land forms; (3) a home of varied resources--diversity and interdependence; (4) people change the earth--human changes in the neighborhood and community environment; and (5) a wohld of many  people--readiness for learning about families around the world. Activities involve the students in discussing stories read by the teacher; taking field trips to supermarkets and hardware stores; working with maps, globes, and compasses; analyzing television weather reports; contemplating family photographs; and modeling representations of topographical phenomena. Each unit contains an introduction, objectives (concepts, generalizations, and skills); a listing of educational media (charts, books, films, sound filmstrips); and suggestions for teaching. Introductory information includes information to classroom teachers about various ways of using the units in kindergarten, availability of materials, and suggestions for responding to questions kindergarten children frequently ask.

Following a brief narrative, the report consists primarily of tables and graphs of the statistical data. Several conclusions are drawn from the data: (1) recent changes in the education benefits of the GI bill lowered the level of college enrollment in the fall of 1976; (2) young adults from high income families are still more likely to attend college than are those from low income families; (3) about 95% of 1975 high school graduates received their diplomas upon graduation  with their high school class; and (4) 10% of undergraduates in the first three years of college were reported to be attending college for purposes other than to obtain a college degree.

        "author":["Ruyle, Eugene E."],
        "description":"This paper attempts to clarify the Marxian concept of socialism and concludes that social evolution will culminate in a world socialist system. By viewing sociocultural systems from an ecological perspective it is argued that individuals tend to maximize their consumption of labor energy, and minimize their own expenditure of labor energy. This minimax principle underlies the succession of human ecosystems: the process of the emergence, development, and overthrow of class rule. The earliest social order was the primitive communism of the hunting and gathering world, marked by an equal obligation of all in labor and consumption. As this classless society became large and sedentary, a ruling class emerged and feudalism followed. However, in developing the productive forces of  society, the feudal rulers generated a new ruling class, the bourgeoisie, and capitalism soon replaced feudalism. According to the Marxian analysis of capitalism, it too will pave the way for a new social order. Unemployment, poverty, crime, racism, freedom of thought, critical social science, free press, and democratic institutions will give the working class both the reason and the power to overthrow capitalism. Finally, because socialism will provide roughly equal levels of consumption and the free development of individual potential, it will become a lasting social order. (Author/JK)",

It is divided into 12 chapters, with the first chapter providing an introduction and overview. Chapter two assesses the dimensions of the ecological stresses being put on the environment, specifically, the world's oceans, forests, grasslands, and croplands. Chapter three points out some of the consequences of these stresses. The fourth chapter considers the trends and dangers of population growth and urges population stabilization. Chapter five discusses the energy situation and the transition from petroleum to nuclear, coal, solar, and other alternative energy sources. Chapter six examines the food economy and what has and can be done to ease world food shortages.  Chapter seven studies the economic stresses of inflation, unemployment, capital scarcity, labor production, and the slowing of economic growth around the world. The eigth and ninth chapters deal with the social and ecological significance of the distribution of wealth both among and within societies. Chapter ten discusses the accommodations to the earth's natural systems and resources that must take place. The last two chapters concentrate on how these accommodations will be accomplished, and who will be involved in the process. (Author/JK)",

The objective is to present a clear, concise picture of Georgia's history during the American Revolution. The first and major part of the text presents an historical summary. It describes how Georgia was an early and strong supporter of the Constitution of the United States because it needed national support to protect its land holdings from the Indians, Spanish, and French. Under the Articles of Confederation, Georgia received little help. Wanting a strong central government, Georgia readily sent four delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787. The four delegates, more interested in dealing with the Indian menace and the security of the state than  with ideas and theories, stayed for the signing of the Constitution in September. One month later, the Georgia state legislature met in special session to prepare for war with the Indians. A bill calling for a convention to ratify the Constitution passed with no dissent. The bill was regarded as a measure to get national help in the fight against the Indians. On January 2, 1788, anxious to get the security a strong national government could provide, Georgia became the fourth state to ratify the Constitution. The second part of the phamphlet provides a teacher's guide for teaching this unit which focuses on Georgia's role in the Constitutional Convention. The guide outlines objectives, suggests a time frame, and lists class activities. (LAA)",

In 1921, when this report was written, the Commission consisted of 16 committees and a reviewing committee. The reviewing committee had a twofold function. The first function was to formulate fundamental principles to guide the reorganization of secondary education. Its conclusions in this field were issued in a bulletin entitled &quot;Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education.&quot; The second function of the reviewing committee was to criticize reports submitted to it by the various  committees. By 1921, the commission had issued 12 reports dating back to 1915. Subject areas dealt with in these reports include: civics, social studies, English, music, physical education, moral values, vocational guidance, business education, the Cardinal Principles Report, mathematics, science, and agriculture. At the time this report was written the commission hoped to issue four reports dealing with part-time education, high school grounds and buildings, classical languages, and the reorganization of home economics. In formulating the aims of secondary education, the commission selected seven objectives: health, command of fundamental processes, worthy home membership, vocation, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical character. The commission also took a position on school  admission, broadened its conceptions of secondary education to include junior high schools, and embraced the comprehensive high school. (Author/JK)",

The sample was 500 men and 500 women representative of the entire population of 15-year-olds in the United States in 1960. Because they had participated in Project TALENT during 1960, files were available on their academic abilities, interests, background, and future plans. At the time of the study in 1975, they were 30 years old and had established adult life styles. In interviews in 1975, 75% of the sample identified nine components that were important to their quality of life. On six of these, 80% were satisfied with their present status. These were: health, spouse, job, children, parents and siblings, and close friends. Respondents indicated  dissatisfaction in areas of intellectual development, developing maturity, and material well-being. In terms of relevance of their educational experiences, most men would have liked more background in industrial arts, mathematics, and science. Women would have liked more background in business education, foreign languages, and fine arts. Comparative analysis of the 1960 Project TALENT files and the 1975 interviews revealed that similar problems were experienced by the participants in secondary school in the form of inadequate vocational guidance, inappropriate curriculum, and minimal individualized instruction.

The summary reviews  the relationship between economics and social studies, which is the class in which most students learn economics. There is a need for educators to translate new economic theories into forms understandable to children. Economic illiteracy may be a significant element in increasing general illiteracy. Research is needed in areas of teacher education, learning models, and role of student reading levels and IQ in economic literacy. More material for middle school grades should be developed, accompanied by greater integration among materials for all levels. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"This study is an attempt to identify social interactions which fit into a Piagetian model for cognitive change, and specifically to examine the degree to which the frequency of those interactions predicts the rate of cognitive development. The subjects were 74 elementary school children enrolled in 19 K-4 classrooms. These children were in the preoperational and transitional stages. In the preoperational stage, the child's thinking is centered about himself and his direct experiences and is geared to manipulate the world through action. In the transitional stage, the child engages in some problem solving rather than direct action. The children were administered a number of tests designed to examine cognitive and academic abilities. Concurrently, the social interactions of all  children were sampled using a classroom observation instrument. The tests were readministered one year later. The results suggest that specific conflict producing interactions facilitate development from the preoperational and transitional levels of thought. Conflict producing interactions are defined as those in which a conversant infers the goal guiding the child's behavior and then challenges that goal by presenting a problem which requires concrete operational reasoning. In school classrooms, children provide virtually no conflict producing interactions for other children. This study has two implications: first, extensions of this approach to defining social interactions may allow for definitions of cultural and subcultural environments which fit with the Piagetian approach; and  second, this approach has hinted as to what sorts of interactions are missing in classrooms. Whether these interactions do promote cognitive development needs further examination. (Author/JK)",

        "description":"This resource paper is designed to supplement undergraduate college geography courses at the introductory and advanced level; it is intended for the use of both the student and instructor. Two perspectives are discussed: the nature of individual movement behavior and the consequences of large numbers of moves for change in neighborhood characteristics. Part I is concerned with the decision-making processes of individual households for which two distinct stages are recognized: the decision to seek a new residence and the search for a new dwelling. In the first stage, factors affecting the decision to move are identified with particular attention focused on movement as a response to stresses of the local environment. In the second stage, the interaction between the household's  awareness of the characteristics of the urban area and the location of available opportunities is stressed. Part II treats aggregate properties of residential mobility with emphasis on the implications of particular patterns of movement for neighborhood change. A model for examining mobility in large North American cities is developed in hopes of answering questions relating to the rate of population turnover and the change in neighborhood population composition. Figures, tables, and sources of the data for mobility studies are included. (Author/JK)",

        "description":"The booklet discusses the concept of environmental psychology and suggests ways of applying environmental psychology principles to education. A new field of study, environmental psychology deals with influences of the physical environment on human attitudes and behavior. Of potential use to educators on all levels as they seek to use the physical environment to enhance educational programs, environmental psychology comprises these key concepts: 1) symbolism, referring to social meaning of objects and their arrangement; 2) territoriality, achieving and exerting control over a particular segment of space; 3) privacy, comprising visual and acoustical separation; 4) nonverbal communication, imparting meaning through facial expressions, gestures, and other body movement; 5) individual  differences regarding high, average, or low sensitivity to the environment; and 6) cultural differences concerning ways in which various nationalities react to the environment. Teachers can introduce environmental psychology into the classroom by asking students to respond to questions concerning seating arrangements, room temperature, and furniture, and by directing students to analyze photographs of classroom and recreational environments. Ways in which teachers can apply principles of environmental psychology in a school setting include changing seating arrangements to suit class activities, providing unobstructed views of the center of activity for all students, using an open education environment to provide a variety of small private spaces, and using the school's heating plant,  water supply system, and cafeteria to study technological and ecological topics. An annotated bibliography concludes the document. (Author/DB)",

        "author":["Rist, Ray C."],
        "description":"This paper examines two programs for the education of immigrant (guestworker) children in Germany. The Bavarian model bases its program upon the assumption that most foreign children remain in Germany for only a short time, eventually returning to their native countries. Evidence largely discredits this assumption, however. Though providing options for those foreign children who speak German, its primary emphasis is upon maintaining skills in the mother tongue. Immigrant children are given their own schools and are encouraged to stay there. By establishing this type of system, Bavaria is perpetuating the isolation and segregation of its minority population. Conversely, the Berlin (West) model is aimed at the integration of the children of the foreign worker as quickly as possible  into the German language classroom. In contrast to the Bavarian program, the Berlin model tends to overemphasize integration. Cultural integration is so strong that no recognition of the national background of students is tolerated. Consequently, the foreign student dropout rate is quite high. Both approaches can be challenged on their basic assumptions and educational practices since neither acknowledges the multicultural nature of German society. (Author/JK)",

Each program description identifies activities, content, and vocabulary, and grade level (ranging from primary through grade seven). For example, the program on map symbols is designated for grades two through seven. Activities for this program involve the students in visualizing symbols by looking at pictures of mountain ranges, islands, and rivers. Activities are also included on group and individual map-making projects and  games for younger, intermediate, and upper-grade children. Program content is concerned with the reasons for using symbols; different types of symbols; reading the legend; meaning of shapes, colors, and lines; distance; and direction. Vocabulary words include \"nonpictorial,\"\"legend,\"\"meridian,\" and \"symbols.\" The pamphlet concludes with descriptions of six short teacher-inservice programs which suggest helpful ways of presenting the material.

        "description":"Strategies are presented for combining academic study with out-of-school learning opportunities for junior high and secondary students. Experience-based learning should combine four elements: community involvement, individualized instruction, guidance, and new learning leadership roles for teachers. Six chapters explain how to accomplish this. Chapter I defines experience-based learning, its origins, and its potential uses. It usually involves individual student participation in unpaid, on-the-job training at selected locations in the community. It can be incorporated into traditional courses, elective courses, occupational exploration classes, or extracurricular activities. Chapter 2 suggests four techniques to help students use community resources: keep a journal, explore  community sites, work on individual projects, and acquire survival skills for living in a changing world. Chapter 3 identifies community resources which can help develop skills in areas such as critical thinking, functional citizenship, and scientific investigation. Chapter 4 describes how to plan community project activities. Chapter 5 explains how to locate community sites appropriate to students' interests and to orient resource people for their roles. Program costs, student transportation, scheduling, and other administrative problems are discussed in chapter 6. Appendices present descriptions of 25 exemplary student projects, 76 resource publications, and a summary of related resources from the publisher. (Author/AV)",

Although the activities were written for junior and senior high school students, most activities are adaptable for use with elementary school students also. The activities attempt to develop skills in three areas: (1) discovery skills (collecting, analyzing, and evaluating data; hypothesizing; and decision making); (2) values and value analysis (assessing, examining, verbalizing, and acting on values); and (3) knowledge about U.S. history. Section I contains lessons designed to interest students by linking their personal and family histories to U.S. history in general. Section II covers topics such a puritanism, nationalism, immigration, imperialism, and the American Revolution. Section III develops basic social  studies skills as interpretation of data, citizenship, and map use. Section IV presents the United States as a multicultural society; students look at different life styles, ethnic groups, and minority groups in the United States. The last section links U.S. and world history with current issues. Issues examined include religion, conflict and power, war and the future of America among nations of the world. Teaching strategies include discovery learning, discussion, data collection, interviews, use of community resources, decision-making games, pictorial-data analysis, role play, and surveys of attitudes about the United States in the community. Teacher instructions and student handouts are included. (Author/JK)",

        "description":"The study of law in the K-12 curriculum can help students develop respect for the law and gain a better understanding of the rationale for various laws. Currently, there are two main approaches to the study of law in public schools. One is to offer a separate course or courses in law; the second is to integrate the concepts of law throughout the curriculum. Law-related activities include involving students in class discussions of topics such as why one needs a license to drive; having persons from the legal community visit and speak to the class; presenting to the students question/answer exercises; having students accompany policemen on their rounds; and engaging students in mock trial simulations. Most law-related education programs probably will continue to grow because (1)  educators have become more sensitive to community needs and resources and have developed community relevant law-related programs; (2) legal education programs are receiving increasing support from members of the justice community; (3) the prospect of funding from government and private sources is good; and (4) public interest in law studies is growing. To introduce law-related education into the classroom, teachers should gather and review law-related materials, request working notes on various legal problems from the American Bar Association, and solicit community and school board support. Particular emphasis should be placed on developing better law-related education programs for elementary school students and for in-service and preservice teachers. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The purpose of multiethnic education is to prepare all students to live harmoniously in a multiethnic society. Multiethnic education pursues these goals by reflecting ethnic diversity in the curriculum, dealing directly with ethnic group similarities and differences, and helping students understand their uniqueness in a pluralistic milieu. Although most teachers do not intentionally discriminate against minority students, they generally reflect majority attitudes as a result of having been reared in middle- or lower-middle-class homes and communities away from concentrations of minority and lower-socioeconomic groups. Also, teachers are generally not prepared professionally to recognize and deal positively with ethnic differences as educational tools. Although great impetus to  equal education was given by the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Topeka Board of Education and by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, progress toward school desegregation has been slow. Teaching and supportive staff practices continue to hinder multiethnic harmony by tracking and ability grouping (which tends to isolate students along cultural, racial, or economic lines), failure to call on minority students in the classroom, labeling minority students as slow learners, and referring to minority students in pejorative terms. The conclusion is that multiethnic education will grow and prosper in the classroom if educators develop programs which reinforce goals of human rights and social harmony. Three effective approaches which have emerged for multiethnic education stress human rights,  intergroup relations, and ethnic studies. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"American economic analysts will better understand current economic trends if they investigate economic problems in light of the expanding global economy. Reasons for the failure of economists to explain the simultaneous existence of rapid inflation and high unemployment include preoccupation with economic indicators, short-term forecasts, and econometric models. Instead of concentrating on symptoms of economic maladies, economists should consider their underlying causes such as the role of biological systems in the economy. The four major biological systems--fisheries, forests, grasslands, and croplands--form the foundation of the global economic system. Economists' general lack of ecological awareness has caused them to ignore the economic impact of practices such as  overgrazing, deforestation, rapid population growth, conversion of grasslands into croplands, encroachment of cities and deserts on croplands, depletion of nonrenewable energy sources, unemployment, capital scarcity, diminishing returns, and rising real costs accompanied by inflationary pressures. Many current economic problems are rooted in the deteriorating relationship between the world's four billion inhabitants and the earth's natural systems and resources. Economists should realize that many economic problems stem from the dependence of the economic system upon the natural environment. (Author/DB)",

One can infer that children attending public school, in whatever permutation, will find that traditional norms form a hidden curriculum to which they must adhere. The study, though limited to intensive research in four elementary classrooms, does suggest that if the constraints outlined in the research are truly functional requisites of the institution, it can be surmised that the degree of change possible in the public schools is limited by institutional needs for order, conformity, time schedules, and work. Teacher behavior will  continue to emphasize these management/control needs so long as schools and the society in which they exist remain so structured. (Author/MJB)",

In Experiment I, fourth-grade children's test performances were measured on a curriculum of history facts, Spanish-English word pairs, and reading comprehension passages for three baseline sessions utilizing feedback (self-assessment and self-recording) and three contingency sessions. Classrooms were randomly assigned to one of five conditions, which included a control condition of noncontingent reinforcement. Three contingency conditions resulted in significant and comparable increases in total test performances over the control: externally determined contingencies set in advance of  performance, self-determined contingencies set in advance of performance when children were trained in contingency selection, and self-determined contingent points, which children awarded themselves after performance. In a condition in which children self-determined contingencies in advance of performance but had no training in how to set contingencies, the results were not significantly greater than the control. In Experiment II, contingencies were introduced for a longer period of time to two fifth-grade classes using a history facts curriculum. The comparable increases in test performance through externally determined and self-determined contingencies set in advance of performance when children were trained in contingency selection maintained over the three weeks. It was suggested that  self-management that includes self-determined contingencies of reinforcement procedures may provide useful techniques for the classroom. (Author)",

        "description":"Two instructional techniques, Teams-Games-Tournament (TGT), and Student Teams-Achievement Divisions (STAD), contain a team component and a comparison-among-equals component. To separate the effects of these two components on academic performance, mutual attraction, and student attitudes, a 2 x 2 factorial design was used, varying reward structure (teams vs. individual) and comparison group (entire class vs. achievement division). The Comparison-among-equals component was operationalized by an achievement division system in which student scores on twice-weekly quizzes were compared to those of other students with similar past performance. The 207 subjects, seventh graders in eight english classes, were assigned to 4-5 member heterogeneous teams, according to students' past  performance and sex. Four categories of dependent variables were measured: behavioral observation, academic achievement, attitudes, and sociometric measures. Results indicated positive team effects on percent of time-on-task, motivation, liking of others, number of classmates named as friends, peer support for academic performance, and students' feelings that their success did not depend on luck. Positive achievement division effects were found on percent of time-on-task, feeling of being liked, liking of others, number of classmates named as friends, and peer support for academic performance. There were no academic achievement effects for either factor. In conclusion, the team component had more or larger effects on mutual attraction and student attitudes than the comparison among  equals; however, it was not possible to determine the relative importance of these components for increasing academic performance.

        "description":"To determine the relative contribution of team competition and peer group practice sessions to the effectiveness of a classroom instructional technique, Teams-Games-Tournament (TGT), 299 seventh grade mathematics students participated in an experiment varying reward system (team vs. individual competition) with practice mode (group vs. individual). An external control group was used. Dependent variables included mathematics achievement on the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) and four student attitude scales. Results indicated that Team Competition students improved significantly more on the SAT, attached more importance to game success, and reported a higher level of peer group interest and peer pressure to do well at the game than did Individual Competition students. Group  Practice students did not differ significantly in their performance on the SAT from Individual Practice students, but did attach less importance to game success than students who practiced individually. When compared to the external control group, Team Competition students (the standard TGT treatment) indicated significantly greater improvement on the SAT, reported a higher expectancy of success at the game, attached more importance to game success, reported more interest by peers in their performance, and were more satisfied with the game task. In conclusion, the team reward structure is more important than group practice sessions; in terms of expectancy value theory, team structure alters students' perceived probability of success without affecting the importance of that success.

It is, therefore, the responsibility of educational psychologists to use standardized intelligence tests appropriately to accurately and objectively assess a childs' intellectual potential and ability. Three general assumptions underlying the measurement of intelligence are discussed: (1) that intelligence is both measurable and quantifiable; (2) that it is distributed according to a normal curve; and (3) that intelligence remains constant over time. The constancy of intelligence level and the stability of its measurement (test reliability) are important issues. Test reliability may be established according to internal consistency;  correlation with equivalent or parallel tests; or, most importantly, consistency of measurement over time. Data on the stability of certain intelligence tests over time are presented. These limited data suggest that the scores of young children are less stable than of older children and adults; that stability decreases as the length of the test-retest interval increases; and that children with various disabilities exhibit more test-retest variation. A formula is presented for estimating an unbiased true score. More research is needed investigating fair methods of placing learning disabled children. (GDC)",

In 1971, 225 learning disabled elementary school students were tested on the WISC and the Bender. The students were between six and seven years old at the time of the first testing. Group IQ, reading and math grade equivalent scores, and educational placement data were collected on 104 of the subjects in 1976. WISC and Bender scores were regressed against math, reading and group IQ data. A discriminant function analysis was conducted to determine the usefulness of the original test score data in predicting present educational placement of the exceptional  students. The results of the analyses were mixed, and suggest that caution should be taken in the use of early test score data to make educational decisions regarding the placement of individual students. The usefulness of the early test scores in making long range educational plans and administrative decisions is discussed. (Author/BW)",

        "description":"Amid the growing concern with accountability of mental health service agencies, increased emphasis is being focused on program self-evaluation. Evaluation criteria involve systems management, client utilization, and outcome of intervention. In designing training for self-evaluation, one must deal with issues raised by the new audience of potential trainees and the new content areas in which skills are needed. Five gaps in current evaluation methods include the need to provide a high volume of training at little cost to participants; the need for individualized, agency-specific assistance; the ability to train persons from greatly diverse roles and background; the need for training in the social skills for managing the human side of evaluation; and the need to integrate the social  interactional component of evaluation with the technical tools that are readily available. The Evaluation Curriculum Development Project developed a model of training in self-evaluation to meet these needs. It contains five basic units: (1) assessing organizational readiness for evaluation; (2) reaching consensus on the definitions of program evaluation; (3) identifying organizational prerequisites to evaluation; (4) developing an overview of the evaluation cycle; and (5) pinpointing evaluative questions to be answered.

The Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills showed that the school with higher SES children had higher scores on all six tests of Reading, Language, Mathematics, Reference Skills, Science, and Social Studies; but the school that emphasized individualized instruction showed a greater  gain from third to fifth grade in reference skills and independent study skills.

        "description":"Recognizing the lack of public confidence in the schools, public officials and educators should discuss the proper use and limitations of competency testing and the implementation of national tests. Competency tests should be used for diagnosis, for certifying that students possess basic skills, and for public awareness. They should not be the sole criterion for assessing competency; furthermore, there are apsects of learning beyond academic achievement which tests do not measure, such as maturity, self-discipline, honesty and judgment. National tests are strongly discouraged for these reasons: they lack local commitment; no test is right for every school; there is no one definition for minimal competency; and they would discourage local experimentation. While each state and  school district should develop a competency program, the federal government should and will take a limited role by supporting the following ventures: (1) The National Academy of Sciences will conduct a major test evaluation and usage study; (2) The Education Commission of the States and similar organizations will run workshops and provide technical assistance; (3) The National Academy of Education will establish an advisory Committee on Testing and Basic Skills; (4) The Office of Education's Project on Fundamental Skills will coordinate 13 different federal programs dealing with basic skills; (5) The National Institute of Education will study student failure; (6) Educational television and video-disk Programs will be developed; (7) The critical role of parents in educating their children  will be strengthened. Finally, public officials and educators should strengthen their commitment to fairness in admitting minorities to professional schools. (CF)",

Federally sponsored tests are not necessary because there are already a number of tests in widespread use; furthermore, cultural bias is a false issue regarding most existing tests and is not a valid argument either for or against a national test. The federal government should instead support a decentralized effort by developing models of what can be done and how, to avoid redundancy in state and local  efforts. Specifics include: defining basic skills, setting standards, test selection and reporting results, program development, and teacher training. The government should also take initiative in providing test comparability information, establishing a clearinghouse on basic skills activities and designing a system to monitor progress achieving basic skills at a minimum competency level is only a starting point--the goal of our educational system is excellence.

Section I describes the background to efforts in compensatory education; a set of nine principles as a means of judging alternative proposals to the current resource allocation system; and a  description of how the Department will proceed in developing specific alternatives, along with recommendations to the Legislature. Section II describes the components of the Educational Needs and Fiscal Data Bases. Section III briefly analyzes how the data bases might be used to examine the major issues involved in developing a new allocation system for the disadvantaged. A second type of analysis employs both data bases to describe the relationship between indicators of need and funding sources. (Author/MC)",

It is a preventative mental health model which focuses on the organization of the school. The hypothesis for this study is that a redeployment of mental health services from a child changing to a school changing focus leads to an improved climate which, in turn, frees energy for more innovative curriculum practices. This evaluation was conducted to assess the impact of the project at King School and to develop evaluation methods which could be useful in future field tests. Four dimensions were assessed: (1) school climate, (2)  student achievement, (3) impact on staff, and (4) impact on parents. Student achievement was significantly higher at King School than in all other New Haven Title I schools. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Racial and ethnic groups often come to play a specialized economic role in the societies in which they live. Race and ethnicity are in themselves of minimal importance. When these boundaries persist, it is because of economic and political reasons. Various examples of subproletariat ethnic groups from societies around the world serve to illustrate this point. The price of labor, a class issue, is one of the major contributing factors to the phenomenon of racial and ethnic specialization. Some causes of world differences in the price of labor are the national level of development, imperialism, migration, and middlemen in the labor market. The phenomenon of displacement works to undermine class struggle between capital and high priced labor. Higher priced labor can respond to  displacement in one of two ways: by blocking capital's access to cheap labor, or by trying to make the labor force homogeneous by raising the price of cheap labor. While the latter is more of an equalizer of human economic conditions, the structure and dynamics of capitalist labor markets make it difficult to achieve. Racially oppressed cheap labor groups will continue to persist as long as there is a split along class lines. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"The relationship of racial factors to recent trends in enrollment of white students in private schools is examined in this paper. Demographic and school enrollment data on 157 U.S. cities were gathered from the 1960 and the 1970 census. In addition, data from a 1968 survey of civil rights and school politics in non Southern cities were used in measuring the racial, educational and political climate in these cities. Because of initial differences, and because of distinct patterns of relationships between private school enrollment and various predictors, the South and the non South are analyzed separately. Race related variables considered in the multiple regression analysis include black and white public school enrollment and changes in the teacher and pupil racial segregation  indices. Non race variables include city size, central city to suburb ratio, and the age of housing. A second set of regression analyses were made. These analyses employed the former variables together with economic data and measures of local immigrant or ethnic populations. It is concluded that racial factors in local demography during the 1960's did affect the level and direction of change occuring in the use of nonpublic schooling by white families. An elaboration of this model is suggested using sociopolitical variables. (Author/GC)",

By engineering technological skills, human beings have altered the environment to suit varied activities. Bioengineering refers to the medical application of engineering to severe human problems of prosthesis. The same concept can be put to use in the larger human environment.

        "description":"In this paper the compatibility of education and school desegregation are examined. The history of mass education in the United States is described as one of conflict over the meaning of integration. Desegregation is said to constitute a challenge to the assimilative logic of public education, charging the schools with accountability for integrating those who have not been assimilated. As such, forced integration is seen as challenging the major social control mechanism of public schooling. In order to demonstrate the incompatibility between desegregation and public education, an investigation was conducted in a desegregated Memphis high school. Using ethnographic data on the administrative, academic and student subsystems in the school, it is shown that student stratification  and resegregation persisted in the newly integrated school. This phenomenon and the types of problems emerging from the desegregation process are offered as proof that goals of desegregation may be incompatible with the goals of the American public educational system as they are now defined.

        "description":"Based on a study by the Department of Community Service Education, Cornell University, to evaluate human service planning (HSP) nationwide, this paper discusses the premises that HSP may be defined as community learning and that the community (according to the Robert Boyd and Jerold Apps model for adult education) is both a beneficiary of and participant in such learning. The function of HSP as stated here is to assist decision-makers responsible for acting in the public interest to perceive and evaluate decision alternatives, i.e., to learn. As illustrations of different learning strategies, the organization of human services planning in three states is examined: Illinois' independent agencies, each of which does its own planning; Kentucky's integrated umbrella agency; and  Massachusetts' coordination of agencies under a secretariat. The limitations and advantages of each strategy are discussed as well as the distribution of learning duties within the organizations. To assess the extent, duration, and applicability of community learning, it is suggested that tangible evidence (such as (1) decisions and plans, (2) changes in services offered, (3) increased predictability in outcomes, (4) greater interagency coordination, (5) improved ratio of benefits to costs, and (6) broader acceptance of involvement in HSP) be analyzed.

        "description":"The validity and dependability of functional competency tests for adults are examined as they relate to the information needs of instructional decision makers. Test data from the Adult Performance Level (APL) Program (funded by the U.S. Office of Education at the University of Texas at Austin) is used to illustrate key points. In the discussion of validity, the importance of a test's demonstrated relevance to functional competency is discussed in terms of the definitions of the competency. Issues of content vs. criterion validity are examined particularly with reference to the APL study. Some of the problems inherent in setting and applying cutoffs (points on a scale of scores which define levels of competence) are then discussed, and the author reviews several procedures to aid  in setting and adjusting cutoffs (those used by Nedelsky and by Emrick, and Bayesian techniques used by Northcutt). In the discussion of dependability (the degree to which scores are replicable) the author reviews briefly the work of Bob Brennan and Mike Kane (based on that of Cronbach and others) in the area of defining and assessing psychometric properties of criterion-referenced tests. In conclusion it is pointed out that the instructional decision maker may raise or lower a cutoff as information justifies such action but that there will be instances in which trade-offs between dependability and validity may become necessary.

Despite the investment of funds, recent studies have found little evidence of impact. Therefore, a project was conducted to identify what administrative techniques or organizational arrangements were likely to result in the continuation of the exemplary project on site when outside funds are no longer available and in the program being implemented in school districts other than the host district. Following the identification of administrative and organization variables and the development of a conceptual framework, two questionnaires were developed for two different populations. These populations were exemplary project directors from  projects funded between July 1, 1970 and June 30, 1978, and replication sites using results from the funded exemplary projects. Eleven findings of the study tended to corroborate findings from other research. Sites most likely to continue the exemplary projects tended to collect evaluation data more frequently than those sites less likely to continue. Continuation was associated with the use of experienced project directors and frequent inservice for staff. Local school districts were the primary source of funds for continuation of demonstration projects. Transportability of project results usually occurred through administrative channels, and technical assistance to replication sites occurred on a limited basis. (JH)",

Interviews were conducted with people familiar with the Agricultural Extension Movement, Health Examination Interview Surveys, and the Consumer Expenditure Survey as well as with people experienced in the dissemination of educational research information. (Five appendixes contain lists of participants in the study and descriptions of the study methods and resources.) Findings and recommendations included the following: (1) Careful planning of research directions to avoid duplicate efforts requires a good communication structure. (2) Thorough planning and  development of methodology and instruments for data collection includes site visits, pretests, and rigorous standards. (3) Positive staff morale needs to be developed; a variety of effective measures are available. (4) Efficient dissemination of research findings involves the use of computer information and retrieval systems, reports, publications, etc.; a model system was found to be the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Current Research Information System. (5) The effective communication of research results to key decisionmakers demands the use of easily comprehensible language and format and the proximity of the researchers to the policy makers to facilitate regular contact and appearances at hearings. The success of adoption of research information depends on linking agents which  assume increasing importance for education since so many innovations are at the local level.

For YEPDA ten principles are specified: knowledge development; work experience; youth involvement; targeting resources on areas of greatest need; substitution prevention; control of overhead; institutional change (improving the linkages between education and employment and training systems); delivery agents; coordination of local and federal planning efforts; and rapid implementation. In the Job Corps'  charter eight missions are identified: expansion of the program; maintaining and improving performance; need for new approaches; recruitment; placement; linkages with community groups and institutions; community involvement; and monitoring and evaluation. Innovations in the Job Corps' program are separated into three types: (1) special efforts devoted to target groups of the greatest need; (2) industry work experience; and (3) alternative delivery agents such as community-based organizations and labor unions. From efforts to fulfill the objectives of the two charters, this report indicates that knowledge of youth problems and programs is being expanded, that many demonstration projects and experiments are being undertaken, that important linkages are being formed, and that, overall, youth  is benefiting from greater employment and improved services.

This work built upon a general design developed in 1976 under part C of Public Law 90-576 for improving planning, management and evaluation of cooperative education programs. The evaluation component of that design was adapted to meet the special needs of post-secondary cooperative education program directors to focus on measures of productivity and impact, and to address the problems of sex and ethnic bias. The project involved the following: review of relevant postsecondary cooperative education documents; studies and interviews with local  directors regarding evaluation needs; a revision of the evaluation design to reflect special needs of postsecondary cooperative education programs and to focus on measuring productivity and impact; the development of specific procedures and checklists to assess existing evaluation procedures and/or to develop new ones in critical checkpoint areas; and a pilot-test of products with post-secondary cooperative education program administrators. A set of procedures and checklists for evaluating the productivity and impact of postsecondary cooperative education programs resulted from this study.

Three objectives are recognized for the local meetings: (1) to identify and assess the employment needs of women offenders both in the institution and the community; (2) to share information with the general public and government and private agencies about these needs and to establish a communication network and closer coordination among these agencies; and (3)  to encourage communities to develop plans to improve services relating to the employment of female offenders. Further, in Part I, the four phases of the program design used at the three sites (assessment, developmental, activity, and followup action) are identified and differences are noted for each city; and in Part II, these four phases are outlined generally to provide a model for community development of similar conferences. Conclusions drawn from the meetings in the three cities show deficiencies in the following areas associated with the vocational education of women offenders: education, job training, resocialization, and job-readiness courses in penal institutions; work in state-use industries; work-release programs; employer and union involvement; long-termers' participation in  vocational programs; linkage between correctional institutions and community and government agencies; and elimination of barriers imposed by state laws.

        "description":"Many academic examinations exhibit sex differences in terms of entry figures and pass rates. This fact is illustrated by a selection of statistics from the British GCE &quot;O&quot; level examination results for June 1976. These results are discussed in terms of three possible causes: innate differences in intellectual functioning, sex role stereotyping, and sex bias in the examinations themselves. The research evidence concerning sex differences in intellectual functioning seems inconclusive, and certainly does not seem to indicate any large and consistent differences. Where differences do exist it is also impossible to assume that they are innate, as the influence of socially defined sex role stereotyping is apparent. The link between sex role stereotyping and sex differences in  attitudes to various academic subjects also seems to be a distinct possibility. In addition to this, the evidence for the effect of attitude on performance makes the sex role stereotyping explanation for these results a most realistic one. The possibility of sex bias in the examinations themselves was not completely ruled out but, like the innate differences hypothesis, this did not seem to be a tenable explanation for the overall size of the differences.

Significant differences also exist between those who seek information from others, use several alternatives, and are ready to take higher risks in their decision making, and those who do not seek information from others. Age, education, income, capability to make decisions, and satisfaction with decisions made are significant variables in perception of life events and decision making. (Author/DOW)",

A positive relationship was expected between FOS and level of career motivation for an androgynous sex role orientation and a negative relationship for H-C conflict and level of career motivation for sextyped women. Subjects were 53 continuing education and 109 college undergraduate females. Analyses included canonical, discriminant, and multiple regression analyses. Measures of community support, community discrimination, self-esteem in relation to home  and family, and early socialization experiences were found to be the salient predictors of high or low career motivation. FOS and H-C were found to be descriptive of highly motivated women, regardless of sex role orientation. The cost of this conflict to the productivity of these women was viewed as an area needing further research. (Author)",

This paper focuses on this issue by examining motivations for eating and dieting in obese and anorexic patients. Measuring the commitment to eating and the commitment to dieting, the study finds that motivations which influence behavior are often not immediately obvious. The dual issues of the motivations underlying a disorder and the motivations connected with seeking treatment, as examined in people with weight control problems, are relevant to most problems treated with psychotherapy. The paper concludes that without greater study of patient motivations, effective treatment of patients will remain a difficult problem. (Author/FC)",

The conference's purpose was to arrive at definitive positions regarding the components of budgets, the methodology of budget construction and the variables which may properly be considered in such construction. Out of 10 working committees, six addressed the problems of defined student types: disadvantaged, nontraditional, graduate and professional, part-time, undergraduate and career school. Within these committees, the conferees developed parameters for the different budget components as those components related to the specific student type under consideration by the committee. Two of the other committees addressed  subjects having direct bearing on student budgets: Economic Standards Within Student Budgets and Methodology for Data Collection. The last two dealt with the administration of financial aid: Budgeting Federal Student Financial Aid Dollars and A Method for Training Personnel in the Preparation of Student Budgets. (Author/BP)",

Data indicate that regardless of their economic situation, the elderly population will not only be growing rapidly in the future but will be changing rapidly as well. The trend toward early retirement coupled with longer life expectancy will mean many more years of retirement. The increasing proportion of elderly who will fall in the over-75 and over-85 age groups will require additional resources to handle the physical and emotional problems which occur more frequently in these age groups. The growing proportion of women, many of whom will be widowed and living alone, will require additional resources to meet their social needs. The rising numbers of  elderly who live alone will require housing alternatives to institutionalization in order that they may continue to live independent lives while learning to cope with physical infirmities. The nation's population as a whole, as it becomes progressively older in composition, must learn to deal with the changing needs of its members. (Author)",

The program is predicated on the hypotheses that: (1) dropouts do not routinely receive counseling and referral services once they leave school; (2) dropouts live in an environment where information and guidance about training and employment opportunities are extremely limited; and (3) systematic and continuous attention to dropouts' employment, education and training needs during late adolescence would enhance their employability and enable them to lead more productive adult lives. The report gives details on available public school and community  resources for dropouts in Baltimore; presents findings from a survey of Baltimore dropouts; and outlines a continuing support and referral system, including a proposed evaluation strategy. After completing their preliminary work, the authors conclude by arguing strongly that a program such as the one proposed is worth testing. (Author)",

        "description":"The individual who is a focus of public attention is an active constructor of outcomes. He attempts to anticipate important characteristics of his observers and modifies his reactions in order to control likely consequences. The nature of the task is also of central importance. For socially relevant responses the individual's behavior is closely linked with these predicted consequences. In many situations, especially those that involve socially inhibiting or embarrassing qualities, the presence of one other person will cause the individual to adopt socially desirable responding, and the presence of more others has little or no additional effect. For drive-sensitive behaviors an individual's responses should reflect the drive-inducing characteristics of the situation. As the  social facilitation literature shows, perhaps the most important factor is others' evaluative capabilities. In the audience situation this factor is of primary importance, and it is this factor to which the performer most likely attends. Audience size, by itself, provides only information about the possibility that an expert may be present. Thus, a performer's reactions are seen as primarily a function of the most expert or consequential observer. Existing theoretical models which attempt to describe these types of group size phenomena must be modified to incorporate such an inferential process. (Author)",

It was prompted by a common concern of high school English teachers: the difficulty experienced by many adolescent readers in responding to the secondary literature curriculum through an interpretive mode. The study hypothesized that adolescent readers operating at the principled level of moral development as tested by James Rest's Determining Issues Test (DIT) would prefer the interpretive mode. Readers at levels below the principled would more frequently choose any of six other modes of response to the same three short stories. Subjects were 74 caucasian, middle-class, adolescent boys from a suburban high school in the San Francisco Bay Area.  They completed Rest's DIT and other tests. Test results and respondents' ages and reading abilities were analyzed statistically. The major hypothesis was borne out at the .05 level of significance. The principled thinkers as defined by the DIT significantly more often chose interpretive responses. (Author)",

These first efforts showed that categorizing phrases by parts of speech did not provide acceptable levels of accuracy. The system that was effective, however, used a computer program that recorded every consecutive two- and three-word sequence in the text sample and determined which of these word strings recurred most frequently. The computer program makes possible samplings of large amounts of text-50,000 words or more-thus eliminating the idiosyncrasies of text sampling. The researchers who developed this system believe that the common phrases it identifies should be taught in much the same manner as common  words are now taught in beginning reading instruction.

        "description":"A sorting-recall procedure was used to examine the relationship between study and recall organization in reflective and impulsive children at the first and fourth grade levels. Data regarding sorting latencies per trial and the number of trials required to achieve stable sorts were provided by two indirect measures of the deliberateness and ease with which children established stable organizations for stimuli while studying. Older and reflective children had longer sorting latencies, derived stable sorting categories in fewer trials, and had higher scores for recall and recall clustering than had younger, more impulsive children. However, within and between age groups, differences in recall organization did not appear when clustering scores were corrected for variations in  children's sorting behavior while studying. It was concluded that the poor recall organization found among younger and impulsive children after a sorting task appears to be associated directly with inefficient study rather than with deficient retrieval monitoring behavior. The present results also contradict the assumption basic to much of the previous research on this topic, which maintains that a sort-to-stable-criterion procedure equates age groups on the degree of study organization.

The relationship of those test scores to other personnel data indicated that a significant proportion of the recruits had reading skills well below the reading levels of the manuals that they would encounter in training, that wide ranges of reading skill levels existed in every occupational rating, and that the Navy's classification process tends to concentrate poorer readers in the nondesignated ratings. As a result of this information, three recommendations were made: to assess the reading skills required in  each of the many different kinds of reading tasks found in the Navy, to determine the effects of the gap between reading skill and reading difficulty on both training and job performance, and to develop and implement a reading skill requirement for naval enlistment.

The proportion of the total word that was necessary to achieve recognition was the basic unit of  analysis; these response data indicate no appreciable differences between older poor readers and the younger good readers.

In the second part of the study, 96 undergraduates read a four paragraph text about imaginary countries that was presented in name or attribute organization. Low ability subjects given an organizer prior to reading performed better on questions that required integrating  across different paragraphs of the presented text, while subjects given the organizer after reading performed relatively better on questions concerning information they had read within the same paragraph. Apparently, advance organizers provide an assimilative context for organizing any incoming information that is awkward or unfamiliar in its presentation order, but they have no positive effect when information is presented in a logical manner and the test questions reflect the organization of the presentation.

A study was then conducted to determine whether or not children of different ages talk differently about literature. A total of 30 children in grades one through four met individually with an investigator and discussed Maurice Sendak's &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; for five-minute periods after hearing the book read aloud. The children's responses were assessed in terms of the following variables: number of interactions, fluency of response, number of volunteered responses, initial reactions to the book, clarification of the initial reactions, categories of responses, and the effect of gender on  responses. Analysis of the findings indicated that a great variety of response patterns existed among the children and that only a few tentative response patterns relating to grade level and sex could be discerned.

This failure is due largely to a prevailing orientation toward the study of language as an object, rather than as a communicative process. An investigation of students' writing competence was conducted through assessing adult readers' ability to respond to clozed samples of the students' writing. The investigation began with an examination of the pieces of writing as objects and the development of an elaborate taxaonomy of textual errors; this approach proved inadequate and indefensible, however, and the investigators shifted to an analysis of  the text as part of a communicative, interactional process with the reader. Basic distortions of the textual space between writer and reader were distinguished, and good written communicaton was defined and assessed as writing that relevant readers can understand. (A clozed student writing sample, adult responses to it, a portion of the \"Taxonomy of Written Communicative Misconstraints,\" and the \"Typology of Textual Space Distortions\" are included.) (GW)",

        "description":"Public opinion polls about freedom of speech issues during a 30-year period (1937-70) were compared with Supreme Court decisions for the same period to determine the effects of public sentiment on judicial decision making. Two-thirds of the decisions conformed to a constitutionality model (that the Court should always uphold the First Amendment regardless of majority public opinion). However, a public opinion model (that the Court should always heed public opinion in its decision making) explained the outcomes one-third of the time when one of two conditions obtained: either when at least 35% to 40% of the population supported free speech for political extremists, or when a low level of public opinion was in favor of free speech. Dominance of the public opinion model was greatly  apparent during two periods of public hostility against Communists and during one period of strong public feeling against antiwar demonstrators. Further support of the public opinion model comes from a graph charting the flow of public opinion and Supreme Court decisions for a 22-year period; the shapes of both variables on the graph are similar, indicating that the direction of public opinion and the direction of Supreme Court decisions are related.

        "description":"Scientific discoveries concerning the bimodal functioning of the human brain have influenced the creation of a visual literacy methodology program at Iowa State University for future art teachers. Student teachers plan and prepare visual lesson plans designed to reverse the traditional pedagogical reliance on faculties dominated by left hemisphere functions--verbal reasoning, logic, analysis--and to explore and promote skills operating in the right hemisphere of the brain--holistic comprehension, simultaneity, intuition, metaphor. Photographic materials assembled to make a well-formed visual statement are given to students, who are told that these materials are the instructions for their next art assignment. Students are faced with the problems of perceiving the general intent of  the visual formation and of constructing a process approach for themselves in response. Mutal satisfaction between teacher and student that the response has been true to the student's unique perception while operating within the visual definition of the lesson plan, along with suggestions from the student that future visual statements may result from the exercise, are regarded as good indications of growth in right hemisphere thinking.

This study examines audience experience in the following ways: the extent to which the television audience chooses, through self-defined goals, the television news broadcast they will watch, the uses and gratification associated with television news, and the implications of this data for broadcast journalism. From tape recorded group discussions with 24 television viewers, a questionnaire was devised which included, along with other measures, an inventory of colloquially worded statements regarding audience experience with television news. The questionnaire was administered to 240 adults chosen from 40 randomly selected housing clusters. Results indicated that for at  least one-half of the sample, viewing was accidental rather than deliberate; viewers tended to watch the news to keep informed about subjective interests and found the news content and format reassuring; and although a large percentage of the audience regarded the news as entertainment, over one-half of the viewers surveyed indicated dissatisfaction with the depth of news coverage.

Program violence raises much criticism; at the same time, the industry recognizes its audience-producing value. An audience production function estimate was derived from a study of seven weeks of television programs recorded between 1971 and 1976. The study measured televised violence according to seriousness, significance, rate, and the number of violent acts. In addition, estimates of audience size for each program were recorded. Industry and network level analyses of the data revealed that while the average viewers do prefer more rather than less violence, audience size depends on which network  airs the program and on what is available during the viewing time. These findings point the way toward improvement of regulatory efforts on the part of goverment agencies that seek to regulate program content. (MAI)",

Thus, their expectations of candidates generally reflect selective reporting and self-aggrandizement. A framework for researching the degree of understanding reached between politicians and the public may be seen through the use of the coorientation model used in interpersonal research. A content analysis was prepared from transcripts of the first of the series of presidential debates in both 1960 and 1976, classified in terms of topics, issues, and other categories relevant to a candidate's political philosophy. A profile of each candidate's philosophy was prepared and compared to his revealed position. Postelection  disillusionment was found to be proportional to the degree of variance between these positions. Such research in conjunction with measures of public perceptions should enable political communication researchers to understand performance in office and subsequent support demonstrated for elected leaders.

This vague phrase, &quot;margin of overlap,&quot; can be clarified and given an empirical base through application of the measure of vagueness developed in Labov's study, &quot;The Boundaries of Words and Their Meanings.&quot; Labov shows that for words that refer to simple objects, the non-simple range of ascription can be described with great accuracy through study of actual speakers' uses of a word. A modal description of an object can be constructed that is linked to a list of key elements affecting ascriptions of the word. For technical discussions, this strict definition (modal with variables) gives an  empirical base on which to ground discussion. Such strict definitions could be immediately useful in discussing terms like &quot;art&quot; and &quot;novel,&quot; where Labov's model for strict definitions could be used to construct empirically valid, verifiable bases for such contested concepts. From these strict definitions it should be possible to construct loose, general definitions that meet speaker intuitions and incorporate all important variables, as is the case with words referring to simple objects. Such intuitively valid, empirically verifiable definitions could ground studies in margin of overlap, thereby grounding empirical rhetoric. (Author/DS)",

        "description":"In &quot;The Uses of Argument&quot; Stephen Toulmin developed a method for analyzing arguments that calls attention to the reasoning processes that undergird a speaker's claims. By changing three terms used in Toulmin's methods it can be applied to interpersonal communication to analyze the speaker's perspective on an issue. The term &quot;argument&quot; is changed to &quot;perspective&quot; in order to accentuate the shared relationship that is involved in interpersonal communication. &quot;It seems to me&quot; is substituted for &quot;presumably&quot; to focus on the individual as having responsibility for his or her own perceptions. &quot;Claim&quot; is changed to &quot;assertion,&quot; which implies a more interpretive response to an individual's perception. A case study of a boy in Florida demonstrates the importance of discovering the values  underlying the assertions the other makes. The boy's family and counselors considered him disturbed since his values differed from theirs. At no time did they seek to discover the boy's values, nor did they ask themselves to evaluate their own judgements. The application of this revised Toulmin model to interpersonal relationships can be a helpful procedure toward achieving understanding and mutual growth. (DF)",

Bacon and Hobbes responded to the problem of eloquence common to scientists in the early seventeenth century, which centered on three major philosophical-rhetorical concerns: an interest in the persuasive as opposed to the communicative aspects of rhetoric, an interest in faculty psychology, and the interpretation of method. Although Bacon and Hobbes addressed similar concerns, their treatments differ in the following ways: Hobbes favored the recording and teaching functions of scientific communication to the persuasive aspects; Hobbes, in his interpretation of faculty psychology shifted the  emphasis from audience centered to speaker/writer centered rhetoric; and Bacon viewed rhetorical method as persuasion following scientific innovation, while Hobbes regarded rhetorical method as scientific invention and demonstration. The problems of the rhetorical dimensions of science and especially of the roles of speaker or writer became lost in the physical sciences after Newton but have reappeared in the twentieth century's interest in the rhetorically concerned history and philosophy of science.

It may also be true that the positive effects attributed to smaller classes are not translatable into testable outcomes. In the end, educational goals, instructional strategies, and related contextual matters may be most important in determining optimum class size. Smaller classes require greater staffing, which could help satisfy teacher associations in a time of declining enrollment, but they also raise costs.

As the community's educational needs change the program changes. Facilities should, therefore, be planned for change as well. While local administrators must be responsible for assessing changes in the community, they often need assistance from state departments of education in adapting their school plants most effectively. North Carolina responded to such needs by providing special funding and requiring that boards of education seeking such funds submit for approval long-range plans for school improvement and construction. A study revealed that the planning procedures prescribed by the state were not followed precisely, though these procedures were  considered adequate by the superintendents who submitted plans. The plans themselves proved helpful in designing facilities, and the state's Division of School Planning served as an important tool in the planning process. (Author/PGD)",

Enthusiasm for the program has been high because each school plans its own strategy for implementation, with local school staff closely involved in the process. Unfortunately, the extensive planning period required prevented timely implementation of the program, and evaluation of the results as of 1976 is therefore not available. The baseline information provided in this report will for that reason be coordinated with information gathered in a forthcoming  report on the 1976-77 year, in order to evaluate program results.

        "description":"The Austin Independent School District received an Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title III grant in 1973 to develop an internal research and evaluation capability. Funding was provided the resulting Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) for three years. The foci of the original grant were (1) to develop a district evaluation model, (2) to evaluate federal and district developmental programs, (3) to coordinate research done in the district by outside researchers, and (4) to develop the Texas Joint Urban Evaluation Council to promote information-sharing among the seven large Texas cities. Of seven objectives for the final year of the project, six were achieved, including refinement and documentation of the evaluation model, planning and refinement of the instructional  program evaluation data base, and dissemination of project information locally and nationally. An evaluation indicates that the project should be continued when federal funding runs out, though some organizational changes may be required. Future goals for ORE include improving the technical quality of evaluations, the internal efficiency of ORE operations, and the understanding in the district of information provided by ORE. A history of the creation of ORE and a description of its organization and functions help document the evaluation of the project. (Author/PGD)",

Evaluation of this program is intended to determine whether the educational design of the school is proving workable. The answer will be sought through an analysis of the educational program's objectives, using standard tests and a locally developed needs assessment instrument.

The evaluation continued to focus this year on the achievement of program inputs, processes, and outcomes in 11 IGE and 11 matched comparison schools. The major emphasis of the evaluation this year was on determining program effects on student outcome behaviors. Utilized in the study were teacher and parent questionnaires; scores from the California Achievement Tests, the Piers Harris Children's Self Concept Scale, the School Sentiment Index, a Reading Attitude Test, a Math Attitude Test, and a student behavior rating scale; and  classroom observations. Despite some positive effects demonstrated on objectives in the affective area, the lack of positive results on achievement lead to the conclusion that the IGE program should be discontinued.

        "description":"In the course of carrying out the technical tasks of the school, teachers encounter common problems that do not impose on those in managerial roles. School organizations are typically structured in such a way as to prevent the information sharing and processing necessary to confront these problems. A collective decision-making structure for teachers is needed to supplement the traditional institutional decision-making structure of the school system. This paper describes and evaluates a survey-feedback-based, problem-solving structural intervention originally conceptualized and tested in an earlier experiment. A three-year project using a refined version of an earlier design and a quasi-experimental research design is reported on in this document. Results of the project were  generally favorable, with teachers taking a greater role in decision-making, but a need was seen for further work to make the system compatible with the existing wide range of school patterns and needs.

The strategies are intended to be usable by other state systems of education. Three characteristics of evaluating social action projects have guided the development of the evaluation methodology. The purpose of evaluation is to make judgments about the role of a program, product, or process. Second, the purpose of evaluation is to provide others with information to make decisions about what to do or not to do. The third characteristic is the combination of looking at the inward processes of a project and assessing the  outward impact of a project. The description of inward processes is referred to as documentation and the assessment of the outward impact as evaluation. The report describes the SEEL project and the combination of documentation and evaluation being used. Then each method is described in detail and it is suggested that WEEA encourage common and systematic procedures for documenting and evaluating large-scale social action projects. (Author/MLF)",

He then outlines several steps school officials can take to provide positive experiences for all citizens: identifying and making use of key communicators (such as doctors, barbers, realtors, and school employees) who have regular contact with large numbers of nonparents; dividing the school district into small areas  served by block workers, who can serve as communication links between the schools and all residents; involving nonparents in parent advisory groups and other school-related organizations; and distributing various school publications to all area residents several times a year.

        "description":"Investigations using English have shown that a number of linguistic constructions associated with reporting verbs, and verbs concerning plans, present comprehension difficulties to children over the age of five. The corresponding constructions in Greek involved ambiguity appreciation, and tests of monoglots and bilinguals indicated that a cognitive developmental stage is implicated in ambiguity appreciation. Striking contrasts between the results from Greek children, who did not appreciate ambiguity, and what would be expected on the basis of English studies forced an appeal to semantics in explaining comprehension difficulty. Testing a wide range of constructions with fewer reporting verbs demonstrated that semantic theories which invoked speakers' intentions could not provide a  general explanation of comprehension difficulties. What seemed to be developing was a gradual mastery of the way reporting verbs gave meaning to, and took meaning from, the constructions in which they can stand. The fact that results from monoglots were language-particular made possible a test of bilingual children to evaluate theories about their development. Existing theories implied that results from bilinguals would be qualitatively different. There was no support for such predictions. What occurred was a greater frequency of the same misapprehensions about the meanings of reporting verbs that had been obtained with monoglots. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"Proponents of the cognitive approach to language teaching list linguistic competence as the primary instructional objective and attribute considerable importance to listening comprehension. For the student, linguistic competence would be knowledge of grammatical components of the language and its vocabulary. Understanding oral messages is an essential prerequisite for effective communication, the goal of foreign language teaching today. Training in aural comprehension is therefore crucial. The listener interprets speech in three interrelated stages: (1) the speech perception stage, (2) the speech comprehension stage, and (3) the memory storage stage. The listener employs these strategies in communication situations in the native language. Instruction in their use can facilitate  the student's acquisition of the listening skill in the foreign language. The following approaches are suggested: presentation of taped listening materials which include normal speech patterns, instruction in general phonological patterns, training in parsing a sentence into constituents and recognition of content words, systematic vocabulary building, development of syntactic strategies, and judicious use of translation. If listening comprehension is a major goal, it should occupy a major part of the testing program. If the teacher devotes more time to the systematic analysis, practice and testing of listening comprehension, the student should acquire the necessary knowledge and skills. (AMH)",

In order not to misuse language assessment tests, a careful distinction must be made between the terms \"language proficiency,\"\"language preference,\" and \"relative language proficiency.\" Differences in the several types of language assessment instruments must also be taken into consideration. These differences include type of data provided, such as information on pronunciation or syntax, and required skill levels for test administrators and evaluators. Questionnaires, story-telling, question-answer format, and combination tests, such as the Language Ability Scales (LAS), are examples of language assessment instruments requiring different skills and measuring different  features. An example is given of a language assessment model that yields only limited information, due to lack of sufficient preparation on the part of the administrators. It is suggested that the following model should be followed: (1) tests must be selected with specific criteria in mind; (2) the test administrators should meet certain qualifications, such as sufficient training; (3) the primary invesstigator should have formal linguistic training; and (4) an in-service course should be given, to those responsible for usage of test results, in the areas of sociolinguistics, structure of Standard American English and dialects tested, and language acquisition.

        "description":"An approach to translation is discussed which takes into account the sociolinguistic factors involved in a translated document designed for use with a linguistically, culturally and educationally heterogeneous population, such as the U.S. Spanish-heritage community. The translation project described resulted in the Spanish-language questionnaire for the Survey of Income and Education (SIE), which was conducted during the spring of 1976. As background, the language and cultural variation among Spanish-speaking groups is discussed. Because of this diversity, it was felt that the questionnaire should evidence sociolinguistic sensitivity. The project itself had two objectives: to make the Spanish both appropriate and acceptable to most of the Spanish-speaking populations in the  United States, and to make the translation as useful as possible to the Bureau of the Census. The consensus translation process, by which these objectives were achieved, is described in detail. It involved: (1) the selection of a team of translators from different U.S. Hispanic communities who were trained linguists experienced in translating; (2) initial translation of the SIE documents into Spanish by one translator; (3) back-translation of the documents into English by all the translators; and (4) a series of meetings of the translation team to develop and refine the translation. Issues and problems concerning format and style are also described, and guidelines used in their resolution are given. The consensus translation process demonstrated in this project is felt to provide a  potential model for all large-scale surveys involving Spanish-speaking groups. It is recommended that several needs discovered during the project (such as specialized glossaries and special training for bilingual interviewers) be explored to make the consensus translation process more effective.

        "description":"This article explains, with specific examples, some of the newer audiolingual and cognitive approaches to the teaching of English as a second language (ESL). It is suggested that several of these methods can be integrated into an eclectic approach. Situational Reinforcement and the Audiovisual-Structural-Global Method are among the audiolingual methods discussed, as are various types of drills and real-life situations. A number of cognitive approaches to ESL instruction are described: the Silent Way (Gattegno), Community Language Learning (Curran), Suggestopedia (Lozanov), Rapid Acquisition (Winitz and Reeds), Total Physical Response (Asher), X-Word Grammar (Allen), Sentence Combining, Basic Composiition, and Error Analysis. One major point of agreement revealed in this survey is  the necessity of providing opportunities for students to think about the language, in order to be able to extend their learning to new language stiuations. There is also a widespread use of real situations and everyday language in the classroom. The use of visual stimuli is recommended, not only to delineate words and actions, but also to trigger responses showing that the students understand what they are saying. It is also recommended that  more attention be given to improving listening comprehension and to the affective aspects of learning. The common goal is to facilitate real communication in English.

        "description":"In the last 15 years or so, Malaysian English has begun to come into its own as a dialect peculiar to its own region and yet intelligible on the whole to English speakers everywhere. There is evidence that English is undergoing a transitional stage in Malaysia; use of English is progressively reduced as use of Bahasa Malaysia is increased. The language of instruction in non-private schools is Malay, with English being learned as a second language. Most English-speaking Malaysians use a local dialect in informal situations and when conversing with Malaysians. A more widely used speech form, modeled on standard British or American, is used on a formal level and with non-natives. There are deviations from standard English structure in both dialects, with the local dialect being less  complex than the more widely used speech form and exhibiting more deviation from standard structure in terms of phonology, grammar, and vocabulary. Although, to a certain degree, adherence to a standard model of English is still demanded on the formal level, particularly with regard to written language and specifically in the area of grammar, there is a trend toward a more widely used speech form that is distinct from educated native-speaker English and that incorporates a number of the features of the local dialect. Accordingly, educational policy in Malaysia now stresses learning English for communicative competence, as a tool. Because there are no materials at present for teaching functional English, standard English is still used as a model. This will ensure mutual intelligibility  between the native speaker and the educated Malaysian. (AM)",

        "description":"Learning to swim and learning a foreign language are analagous activities, in that both are skills learned for different reasons. Few foreign language students will attain \"near-native fluency;\" nor will many of them become interpreters or teachers. Foreign language teachers must therefore revise priorities, restructure courses, adjust methods, and establish realistic goals. There are indirect routes to the goal of appreciating a foreign culture. One might take the students on an imaginary year-long \"trip\" in the foreign country and in areas of the world where the language is spoken. By organizing all learning activities around this theme, students participate in and contribute to the total learning experience. The vocabulary, grammar and structures they use will be examples of  real language. Textbooks become guide books, and only truly useful portions of them are used. Games, conversation activities, visits with native speakers, well-chosen readings -- all of these activities contribute to the student's progress in integrating the four skills. They also take account of affective behavioral objectives and will lead to improved attitudes. A Presidential Commission on Foreign Language and Area Studies is projected; its area of concern reinforce the position taken in this article. (AMH)",

The guidelines define basic competencies in the following areas: practical command of the language, language analysis, culture, the teaching-learning process, and professional awareness. A total of twenty-six competencies are described. Tests and other procedures for assessment of these competencies are outlined; the assessment criteria for each competency are given, and assessors (persons responsible for assessing candidate growth) are specified. It is pointed out that the specific competencies listed are representative of the major competency areas; they are not presumed to be  exhaustive. A working relationship between the staffs of the pertinent agencies -- secondary schools, college foreign language departments, and college departments of education must be developed so as to provide courses and experiences needed for mastery and assessment of the competencies required. The basis for certification should be teacher competence rather than total reliance on college courses. (AMH)",

Most institutions were and are making ends meet, though not without some difficulty; most colleges and universities have had trouble recruiting sufficient numbers of students. As a rule, the institutions that attracted more students increased their expenditures for instruction per student at a slower rate than those that lost students. In both public and private sectors, the institutions that have been losing students most rapidly have raised their tuition most rapidly; this threatens private enrollment more than public. Most savings have been made at the expense of teaching and professional staffs, whose salaries failed to keep  up with the cost of living. Under most circumstances, there is likely to be a hair-breadth balance between expenditures and revenues in both the public and private sectors in 1980. By 1985, unless private enrollment declines, non-state supported schools are likely to face deficits in their instructional account, and the public sector books are likely to balance without any unusual effort. Serious problems are anticipated for some institutions. (Author/MSE)",

These characteristics are defined in 17 institutional variables. The patterns of insti(utional similarity are described by two modeling techniques: cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. Multidimensional scaling confirmed that there were essentially two dimensions of difference among medical schools with respect to the 17 variables studied. It appears that there are fewer medical schools with preference for research-oriented students with goals to provide health care directly to patients and in geographic areas currently underserved.  Cluster analysis identified four groups of schools as characteristically different from one another. Subsequent analysis of data for schools in each group served to identify each group's distinguishing attributes. Research-oriented schools appear to form a distinct class of institutions. Other schools form three classes according to the degree of their preference for students oriented toward primary care service. A simultaneous presentation of the scaling and clustering models provides the most complete picture of medical school similarities with respect to preferences for students who would provide medical services directly through primary care delivery or indirectly through medical research.

Major variables in the study include specific sources of student assistance, tuition rates, and gross parental or family income. The analysis focuses on gross relationship between student assistance, family income and tuition rates for groups of schools differentiated by other control (private/public) and tuitions. It was found that despite the decrease in funds from the Health Professional Loan and Scholarship programs, the total financial needs of medical students in most schools were met to the same or to a slightly lesser degree in  1975-1976 than in 1973-1974. In high-tuition public schools and in private schools with tuitions ranging from $2,501 to $3,000, however, the growth in financial aid need was substantially unmet by financial aid resources. The major factors that determined how well these schools, as well as other schools, met their needs include: (1) the degree to which the school's financial aid needs increased during the period; (2) the extent to which the school suffered from a decline in certain sources of funding, particularly the Health Professions Loan and Scholarship programs; (3) the degree to which schools were able to use other sources of funding, particularly their own funds and guaranteed bank loans; and (4) the extent to which the PH/NHSC and the Armed Forces scholarships were directed to  needy students.

In order to relate this 1976-77 applicant cohort (and those accepted from it) to certain social trends in medical education and to continue monitoring changes in the size of applicant pools and first-year classes, the study also compares the 1976-77 pool (42,155 applicants) with the previous year's end and for certain variables, traces trends over the past five years. Data for the study were compiled by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and are maintained in the Medical Student Information Service (MSIS). Data are reported on: (1) application activity (applicants and applications, first-time and  repeat applicants, and available spaces); (2) demographic characteristics of applicants (residence, age, women applicants, racial/ethnic groups, size of hometown, marital status, and citizenship); (3) academic background (undergraduate college major, highest degree, and academic ability); (4) socioeconomic background (parental income and occupations); and (5) career plans (general plans, specialization plans, expected character of medical practice, and expected location of medical practice).

Three variables widely used in study of recruitment to college faculty roles are examined: career decision, occupational image, and institutional potency. The variables seem to focus in a general way on the same stage in the recruitment or selection process for college faculty--the years of undergraduate preparation. This review does not assume that there is a shortage or surplus, present or impending, of college teachers, and offers only the suggestion that the whole controversy and concern over the \"shortage\" of faculty has operated to obscure what should be the real concern: the shortage of college learning  rather than that of college teaching. The principal assumption that is made has to do with the value of conceptual clarity in the study of recruitment to occupations such as those in academe. (Author/LBH)",

Most universities are not open-door, and special admissions policies for blacks have been halved since 1969. Other problems are the lessening of recruitment efforts and differences between blacks' expectations of the university and their experience there. Financial cutbacks have also caused changes in resource allocations throughout the institution. The black persistence rate is alarmingly low. It has been proposed that the successful retention and instruction of blacks demands a total institutional response to the requirements of operating a truly multiethnic campus, involving all levels of administration up to and including governing boards. One model for  institutional responsiveness developed at the University of Maryland is described. (MSE)",

Critical problems in existing programs were also identified with possible solutions suggested. The educational programs included fire protection engineering and two- and four-year fire-related education. Audiences were identified as: pre-service population, fire service population,  two-year fire-related education program graduate, fire protection engineering student population, related student population, and practicing professional population. Problem areas identified include: enrollment policies, incentives for education participation, college credit for experience, quality of the faculty, uniformity of programs and courses, articulation and accreditation, and graduate and student opportunity.

Dr. Silber argues that faculty organization causes the university to become more like a factory than a university, that a faculty member has more in common with a middle level manager today than with a professor of 25 years ago, and that featherbedding in trade unionism is such that financial viability of unionized universities is endangered. He asks whether academe has inadvertently slipped into collective bargaining or done so with its eyes open. Dr. Nielsen argues that faculty are probably the most unlikely group to ever organize into a union in the history of the labor movement, and yet in nine years 25 percent of college professors have organized. He states that the way  universities are run is the major reason for the unionization, and that faculty are really organizing themselves as a fundamentally conservative force on campus. (MSE)",

The study uses multiple regression models to analyze the net impact of collective bargaining on a sample of over 100 union and nonunion institutions. Faculty compensation in union and nonunion institutions is compared overall and within several institutional categories (e.g., public, private, two-year, four-year). Included are considerations of the long-term effects of bargaining on compensation composed of salaries versus fringe benefits. Also studied are the relationships of collective bargaining to changes in the amounts of institutional income from varying sources and to changes in the distribution of  institutional expenditures. It is found that, holding other factors constant, average faculty compensation in unionized institutions during 1974-75 was about $1,291 more than in nonunionized institutions. Further, this compensation advantage increased steadily to 1974-75 at which time a reversal was noted; in 1975-76 the $1,291 advantage shrunk to $800. Beyond the financial implications for faculty, unionization does not appear to have changed the incentives of faculty to seek contract research money from the government. (Author/LBH)",

Distinctions are drawn among CAI, CBE (computer based education), CMI (computer managed instruction), and CGM (computer managed materials), and the functions of each are described. CAI has been slow in coming because of costs, educator and administrator conservatism, and a lack of adequate software and user program units. In choosing a CAI software package, one must consider hardware availability, BASIC capabilities, and the general applicability of author languages. Charts are provided which classify fourteen popular CAI author languages and systems according to forty capabilities outlined by C. Frye. The paper ends with a discussion of how to  integrate the above factors with narrow learning theories in order to promote the use of CAI in the classroom. (DAG)",

        "description":"In this study, two experiments indicate that modification of the method of scoring in the EQUATIONS game enhances achievement in learning specific mathematical ideas. The experimental scoring method (4+ scoring) which allows learners to obtain bonus points for constructing more complex solutions was introduced into year-long instructional gaming tournaments in two classrooms: a seventh-grade class in an inner-city school and an eighth-grade class in a suburban university-community school. The results in the experimental classes were compared with those in corresponding classes taught by the same teachers in which the conventional scoring method was used. The mean difference in pretest/posttest results was nearly three times as great in the experimental class as in the control  class in the eighth-grade group, and nearly double in the seventh-grade group. The results seem to have implications for the potential for improving learning processes by channeling attention appropriately. (Author/VT)",

Experience with this program, as it has operated in Ann Arbor, Michigan and the Watts area of Los Angeles over a two-year period, shows the potentialities of learning networks for complementing the educational activities of schools. Participants call each other on the telephone and play any of the current games. They can also form into teams with the winning team honored on a weekly basis. It is expected that it will shortly be possible to introduce the computer into these learning networks and further increase their educational potential. (Author/STS)",

It surveys four data compression methods--null suppression, pattern substitution, statistical encoding, and telemetry compression--and relates them to a standard statistical coding problem, i.e., the noiseless coding problem. The well defined solution to that problem can serve as a standard on which to base the effectiveness of data compression methods. The simple measure described for calculating the effectiveness of a data compression method is based on the characterization of the solution to the noiseless coding problem. Finally, guidelines are stated concerning the relevance of data compression to data processing applications. (Author/DAG)",

The judicial history of copyright in the twentieth century is reviewed with respect to advances in information technology. The impact of technological change on judicial decision-making in copyright is analyzed. The problem of transaction costs in the marketplace for copyrighted works is examined, and methods for the reduction of such costs are described. Models of policymaking are developed which clarify the roles of interest groups and the branches of Government. Recommendations  on the conditions of copyrightability for computer-readable data bases and computer programs are presented and are based on findings of basic principles developed during the study and described in the report.

A national survey was conducted from a sample of public, academic, special, and federal libraries to determine the annual volume of photocopying undertaken for interlibrary loans, local users, and intrasystem loans. Since interpretations of the Law concerning eligibility for royalty payment appear to vary, data are also given for the amount of photocopying that occurs under various hypothetical conditions of eligibility as they might be interpreted in the new Copyright Law and in guidelines set forth by the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) for photocopying for interlibrary loans. The report documents  the effects of these hypothetical conditions from the perspective of both libraries and publishers. In addition, the report describes alternative royalty payment mechanisms and discusses some advantages and disadvantages of each from the standpoints of small and large libraries and small and large publishers. A summary of the report presents estimates of total volume of photocopying, analyzes implications of the new law from the perspectives of libraries and publishers, and describes alternative payment mechanisms.

The program served 934 learners in this time  period; 216 of them were light or new project library users. The results of the evaluation made by the learners completing the program indicated that 91 percent were satisfied with the service and that 92 percent would use the service again for a new learning project. Other outcomes were (1) the successful integration of the service with program planning and management; (2) formation of the Consortium of Public Library Innovation; (3) identification of the conditions which must be met for the learners advisory service to succeed; and (4) identification of background and training requirements associated with the design, modeling, and implementation of a new service concept.

Comparisons were made in terms of mean grade point average (GPA), academic status, continued enrollment, performance before and after transfer, and GPA in 12 subject areas. Findings showed that community college transfers enter with a GPA equivalent to the lower division university GPA's of native juniors, and four-year college transfers enter with GPA's slightly lower than either of the two other groups; community college transfers experience more academic difficulty after transfer than four-year college transfers and natives, and have higher  academic probation and drop rates as well; native juniors have a higher retention and graduation rate than the other two groups; and, community college transfers consistently achieve lower GPA's than the other two groups in the 12 subject areas studied. However, only a small percentage of community college transfers withdraw due to academic difficulty, and two-thirds are successful as measured by graduation and retention rates. Seen in the context of student academic backgrounds and institutional mission, the evidence suggests that community colleges successfully provide access to further education. (LH)",

The cost measurement procedures used, for which 32 pages of tables and worksheet forms are provided, are designed to measure average costs in a particular area (excluding social service and agency administration costs). Direct and indirect costs are defined and discussed at length. The source of direct cost data presented is a U. S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the direct costs of raising a child to age 18, at economy, low cost and moderate cost levels, for rural farm, rural non-farm and urban families in the four U. S. census regions: North Central, South, Northeast and West. This  estimate, based on 1960-61 data, is adjusted through the government's Consumer Price Index (tables included). Average costs are given, per region and degree of urbanization, for: food, clothing, housing, medical care, education, transportation and other costs. Use of such existing data bases is strongly recommended for estimating direct costs, although local differences may necessitate some primary data-gathering. Local surveys may also be needed to determine the indirect costs (the dollar value of parental time). (BF)",

        "description":"The development of Arctic Canada's resources has historically been guided by two contrasting administrative approaches: one favoring the free play of profit motives in a laissez-faire market economy and the other the coordination of development through formalized government planning. In both approaches, Eurocanadians are the dominant figures, while Eskimos are depressed and subservient. Against this background, a third approach to development is emerging--the Arctic cooperative movement. This movement aims to encourage Eskimos to participate directly in the development of their communities. Pelly Bay, an isolated Eskimo community on Simpson Peninsula, joined the Arctic cooperative movement in 1966. The coop's first priority is to satisfy the immediate, basic needs of the  community for an Eskimo-owned retail store and for a producers' coop to encourage local industry. Today, its program is one of the most ambitious of the Arctic coops involving tourism, large-scale commercial fishing, and air transport. At present, every family is a member of the coop, and all decisions are made through the elected board of directors and executed by the coop manager and his staff. To date, coop ventures have been successful; community morale is high and coop revenues continue to increase. Yet, local initiative is often curtailed by poor communication between the village and the myriad of government agencies regulating Northern development. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"Information derived from a mailed questionnaire sent to a proportionate random sample of 5,500 Kentucky licensed drivers was used to determine opinions regarding the seriousness of community problems and desired levels of government expenditures for these problem areas. Eleven community problem areas were ranked by respondents as follows: government-citizen relations; employment and economic development; public safety; housing; natural resources and environment; transportation; human resources; leisure activities; health services; education; and community services. The rankings for government expenditure priorities were: housing; public safety; natural resources and environment; employment and economic development; human resources; health services; transportation; community  services; education; and leisure activities. Within the area of education, results indicated: blacks, the younger adults, and parents of school-age children saw education as a priority problem area; the three most important problems were identified as lack of public kindergartens, vocational training in high school, and financial assistance for college; only 36% of the respondents wanted to increase government spending on education; 50% supported increased funds for vocational training and control of violence in the schools; and blacks, newcomers, parents of school-age children, and younger people gave the greatest support for increased educational funding.

        "description":"A prestige scale for 50 agricultural and agriculturally related occupations was developed. The scale was constructed utilizing data from a mailed-questionnaire survey conducted during the spring semester of 1977 at 14 universities in the Southern United States. A 15% random sample of undergraduate majors in agriculture at these schools were contacted; this resulted in an initial target sample of 3,398 students. Seventy-four percent, or 2,392 students, participated in the study. Questionnaire items and scaling techniques closely parallel those used in the National Opinion Research Center study (North-Hatt Scale). The scale indicated that: veterinarian, with a prestige score of 92.7 was rated as the most prestigious occupation while migrant laborer, with a score of 34.0, was the  occupation with the lowest evaluation; there was a decided tendency for the sample to evaluate professional, managerial, and scientific occupations toward the top of the prestige hierarchy; swine raisers were given substantially lower scores than cattle raisers; poultry raisers were ranked slightly lower than swine raisers; farm production occupations were ranked high only if they involved either ownership or management by inference. A copy of the prestige scale for agricultural occupations, the scale value for each occupation, and an index of agreement for each occupation are reported along with an analysis of several factors which may explain differences in the perception of prestige.

The problem of cognitions or subjective worlds of actors is addressed in terms of Blumer's six features of public opinion; then, the delineation of relevant publics in developmental decision making is addressed. Perceptions of development as definition of the situation is the heading given to a section dealing with the basic question of how to link the process of development to the subjective worlds of pertinent actors (i.e., it is how actors define their situations, not how social scientists define them, that produces meaningful behavior). Three central cognitive dimensions  or definitions of the situation are suggested: factual beliefs; evaluations; and relevances. The suggested operational proposals include: sample selection (development issues or events selected by each principle investigator and based upon \"researchability\"; selection of key individual actors based upon data available from the ranking scheme in the contact matrices; key organizations selected via a similar fashion); and actors' perceptions (the nature of the developmental issue or event itself; the problem of identifying publics; the actual decision making process; and assessments of the outcome of this decision process).

Data were obtained through a comparison of where an individual lived in 1965 with where he or she lived in 1970. Twelve percent (250,832 people) of the 1970 population migrated to Kansas between 1965 and 1970. However, 14% (298,258 people) who lived in Kansas in 1965 left by 1970. People moved the most when they were 18 to 25 years old. Two important institutions that aided their mobility were the armed forces and institutions of higher education. More students went to California, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas than came from those states to school in Kansas. However, more students came from New Mexico, Missouri, Iowa, Montana, Illinois, New York, Delaware,  South Dakota, and Nebraska than went to those areas. Kansas lost large numbers of servicemen to Missouri, Texas, Illinois, and California. The majority of servicemen came to Kansas from the Pacific region. Nonmetropolitan areas of Kansas were the most attractive for out-of-state migrants as well as for Kansans changing residence to another economic area in Kansas. The step-migration of Kansas residents who moved were from a farm to a small town, to a medium sized city, to a metropolitan area in the state and then to a metropolitan area outside Kansas. Few moved from metropolitan areas to metropolitan areas in Kansas. (NQ)",

        "description":"The first part of this publication is a study of students' math skills and logical abilities and their success in an introductory college chemistry course. A 29-item instrument was developed and administered to 343 students. Test scores for students who received either A or B in the course were compared with scores for those who received either D or F. Statistically significant differences, beyond the .01 level, were found between the two groups. A 27-item revision of the test was given to 371 students in the same course. Analysis of variance and regression analysis were performed on the data. It was found that 85% of the factors explaining a student's success in introductory chemistry were different than the math and logic factors found in the test itself. The authors suggest  that such a test be used to help identify students who do not function at a formal level in science courses. Part two of this paper presents a model of 14 logic-related components directed towards concepts and problems typically found in natural science courses. This model, it is suggested, could serve to assist faculty in making changes in course content and approach that which would maximize the likelihood of furthering formal thought in students. (MR)",

        "description":"The research examined innovativeness among high school social studies teachers and departments. Innovativeness is interpreted to include awareness and use of certain innovative practices (e.g., inquiry, values clarification, and community-based activities) and the \"new social studies\" materials, teacher participation in school decision-making processes, and involvement of students in classroom decisions. It was hypothesized that researchers could identify the effect of specific factors on social studies innovation. Four sets of variables were considered: (1) individual teacher characteristics, such as age, teaching experience, tenure, and involvement in professional organizations; (2) social studies department characteristics, such as the chairperson's leadership style, the  nature and frequency of department meetings, and degree of communication and cooperation among the teachers; (3) school characteristics such as size, faculty age and experience, and provision for alternative programs; and (4) school district factors, such as size, wealth, geographic location, and political climate. Data were gathered from four sources: a survey of social studies teachers, principals, and district supervisors at 10 high schools in five districts; school observation and interviews with teachers and students; census data; and a 1969 study of political climate in schools by Harmon Ziegler and Karl Johnson. Findings indicated that the two major indicators of innovation were awareness of new project materials and use of innovative phactices. The variables which were identified  as having the strongest relationships with these indicators included tenure, current position, academic degree, professional memberships, and number of college courses relating to social studies teaching.

The first section presents five criteria for selecting instructional objectives, subject matter, and teaching procedures in basic education. The criteria include (1) emphasis on skills for daily living, (2) relevance to students' personal experiences, (3) continuity of curriculum throughout grade levels, and (4) practical application of skills. The second section describes the Essential Learning Skills Television Project, which creates brief television programs to help fifth and sixth graders develop skills in communication, math, and critical thinking. The third section suggests instructional procedures for developing other television programs and related printed  materials. Much of the discussion centers on how to teach students to make two types of decisions: factual and value-oriented. Factual decisions involve gathering and evaluating information to choose between alternative claims about reality. Value decisions involve use of both facts and value judgments to choose among alternative courses of action or policies. The concluding section evaluates the pamphlet's teaching ideas in terms of the original five criteria for basic education. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"To analyze income inequality in 32 nations, the research tested hypotheses based upon eight socioeconomic variables. The first seven variables, often tested in income research, were: political participation, industrial development, population growth, educational level, inflation rate, economic growth, and technological complexity. The eighth variable, degree of socialism, had not been considered by previous major models of income inequality. It was hypothesized that less income inequality would exist in countries with higher levels of political participation, education, economic growth, and technological complexity; median levels of GNP per capita; lower levels of inflation; and a socialist economy. Data were obtained from the national statistical bureaus of the 32 nations and  from the &quot;United Nations Statistical Yearbook, l973.&quot; Data were analyzed in three phases. The first phase considered the relationship of the first seven variables to income inequality. The second phase identified the effect of industrialization on income inequality. Only those nations with a level of development below the threshold where inequality increases despite high levels of industrialization were included in the analysis. The third phase entered the type of economic system (capitalist or socialist) into the regression analysis. Findings indicated that the first seven variables explained 59% of the variance in equality. The eighth variable, socialism, increased the explanatory power of the model to 71%. The conclusion is that future research on income inequality must consider degree  of socialism as a major variable. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"This paper outlines a new way of defining the scope and domain of citizen education within the social studies curriculum. It is intended to help educators better attain their particular goals and expand their vision of citizenship education. The paper is divided into three parts. Part I emphasizes that the narrow, traditional definition of the scope and domain of citizenship education keeps it totally within the schools; little attention is paid to the development of programs outside the school. Part II examines some weaknesses in the current definition: citizenship education is not treated as a cumulative, lifelong process; the development of citizen competence with problem solving is neglected; there are limitations on the school's capacity to contribute to citizenship  education; and the field's current focus on schooling unnecessarily restricts the capacity of social studies educators from experimenting with a full range of methods and instructional theories available to them. Part III redefines the field's interest in citizenship education as follows: social studies education has an interest in educating citizens of all ages by undertaking educational activities in each of the sectors involved in citizenship education. These sectors include schools; local, state, and national government; business; labor; mass media; and primary, voluntary, and religious organizations. The requirements and conditions for expanding the concept of citizenship education are also outlined. (Author/JK)",

        "description":"Many research studies which deal with the teaching of economics at the college level conclude that different teaching methods do not lead to very different results in terms of student achievement. This paper suggests that one reason student achievement may fail to demonstrate the superiority of one teaching method over another is that achievement is a function of a student's intellectual ability and time put into the course. It is suggested that less effort and time studying economics and additional leisure time, instead of improved achievement, may be the dominant benefit of a different teaching method. To test this hypothesis, a dependent variable was designed to measure the change in a student's effort in economics based on an economic learning model developed by McKenzie and  Staaf. Three effort variables were constructed and tested to determine if effort was correlated with grade expectation, student attitude, sex, age, hours worked, day or night classes, or having had or not had a high school course in economics. Results indicated that non-working students and those students who expect and/or receive high grades exhibit more effort. It is suggested that the effort variable be taken into consideration in evaluating teaching methods. (JK)",

        "description":"This annual report to Congress on Title XX of the Social Security Act reports on the operation of the 1976 fiscal year program. Preceding the report are descriptive highlights of the program. Title XX of the Social Security Act changes the role and relationships of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; the individual states; and interested citizens with respect to planning, operating, and accounting for the Federal-State social services program. The most notable change and key provision under this legislation is the requirement that each state establish a formal process that includes public participation in the development of the program. The report is divided into three major sections. Section one contains a brief history of social services legislation prior to Title  XX (enacted October 1, 1975) and a description of the major features of Title XX. Section two, the core of the report, outlines state implementation of Title XX and describes state approaches to planning and the services provided. Section three describes HEW evaluation and technical assistance activities offered to state offices with respect to the content of individual services programs, program planning, reporting, administration, and evaluation. Several appendices conclude the document, including a glossary of terms, charts, tables, and graphs on services provided to recipients, categories of recipients, and expenditure data by states.

        "description":"Focusing on the need for energy to sustain economic development on a long-term basis, the document examines energy options of the post-petroleum era in developing nations. Nuclear power and solar power are the most important among proposed alternative energy sources. Limited applicability of nuclear technology to the Third World is discussed. Problems include the need of most developing nations to seek foreign fuel to power nuclear plants, the difficulty of designing nuclear facilities that work equally well in different environments, and the problem of decommissioning radioactive facilities at the end of their usefulness. Energy-related research and experiments indicate that the most likely sources for new energy are solar (sunlight, wind, hydropower, and biomass). Factors which  should encourage the Third World to harness solar energy sources include: a general abundance of sunlight, a dispersed and predominately rural population (which encourages decentralized energy resources), prohibitive cost of conventional energy, customary dependence on indirect solar sources such as firewood, and insignificant capital investment in petroleum-powered energy. Various objections and reservations concerned with the transition to solar energy are evaluated. The conclusion is that solar energy, the most viable energy source in the post-petroleum age, can contribute positively to economic development in both developing and industrialized nations.

        "author":["Newland, Kathleen"],
        "description":"The paper explores the relationship of women's childbearing attitudes to educational and work opportunities. Program administrators for family planning, educational programs, and national development efforts in developing countries must realize the importance of the social and cultural environment in designing programs to reduce population growth. Section one discusses the impact of education on women's attitudes toward childbearing. Schooling exposes women to new kinds of information, can promote positive changes in self-image, can change the nature of maternal ambitions, and can motivate women to pursue activities outside the family. Section two explores the apparent relationship between opportunities for women to work and low birth rates. Employment may discourage childbearing  because of the burdensome dual workload of working mothers. Young women's earning abilities may encourage parents to delay arrangements for early marriages for their daughters. Employment also can offer women various degrees of economic and psychological independence. Section three urges population program administrators to realize that status, income, security, and emotional satisfaction may be reasons for women to have families, but that education and work opportunities can satisfy those needs as well. Successful programs of community education and development for women in Korea and Cuba are described to illustrate this point. (Author/AV)",

Indices of social change included schooling differences in rural and urban areas, industrial and economic development, school community relationship, and family life. The document contains 10 chapters; each chapter is based on both statistical and literary sources. Chapter I introduces the research, discusses the revisionist nature of recent educational history, and explains why Massachusetts was selected as a case study. Chapter II characterizes common schooling and enrollment levels prior to 1840. Chapter III examines school attendance trends from 1840-80. Chapter IV assesses rural urban schooling differences. Chapter V discusses the politics of educational reform  in mid-nineteenth century Massachusetts. Chapter VI examines relationships among parents, students, and the schools. Chapter VII considers pressures which encouraged students to leave school and work in the factories. Chapters VIII and IX present case studies of a typical rural school system (Boxford) and an urban school system (Lynn). The final chapter summarizes research findings. General conclusions are that educational development was strongly related to demographic and economic trends; organized differently in rural and urban areas; and responsible for constantly increasing roles in childrens' lives.

Previous research has assumed that the value of education is the same across all fields of work. In this study, the author analyzed educational and income data for 20,000 white men and 1,500 black men from the 1970 census reports. All the men's occupations were classified into six categories, including manual trades, scientific, sales and management, and clerical. Regression analyses were used to compare the returns to education for blacks and whites in each type of work. Results show that the income determination process may be similar for blacks and whites in blue-collar work, in science and medicine, and in social service and  educational work. However, blacks in sales, management, and clerical work appear to be treated differently than whites in such work. The black men consistently receive lower income per years of schooling than do white men. The differences in these areas may be due to past discrimination against blacks or to differences in the types of job activities and occupational rewards preferred by blacks. (Author/AV)",

All students in the study attended a sociology class taught by a very strict teacher whose rules of behavior conflicted with students' peer group behavior expectations. Participant observation of student behavior in class and interviews with individual students were conducted to identify daily behavior patterns and students' attitudes toward the patterns. Deviant behavior included skipping class, unauthorized smoking, use of drugs, school vandalism, and stealing. It was found that very few students skipped class, and that peers would not report students who did. Smoking restrictions were violated by all students who smoked, and they felt students should have smoking privileges equal  to those of teachers. Almost all students had used marijuana and alcohol, and admitted that it was deviant, but would not report the use of drugs to authorities. Vandalism occurred in only a few cases and was condoned by students as long as it did not interfere with individual rights. However, stealing personal property angered students and they reported they would prosecute someone who took their property. Conclusions are that students do not disapprove of deviant behavior unless it directly affects them. Students identified the major cause of deviant behavior as lack of parental control over their children. (AV)",

Previous research had indicated that a large percentage of sociologists do not publish very often. In this study, a random sample of 300 Ph.D. members of the American Sociological Association were queried about their publishing activities. The questionnaire limited the responses to publications, papers, and other means by which findings of the sociologists' dissertations had been disseminated. Tables of response data show that 54% of all the articles published were written by only 25% of the people in the survey. Thus, it is evident that a majority of the articles are written by a minority of the sociologists. Another analysis was performed to see whether the large number of  recent Ph.D. recipients was inflating the percentage of those with few publications. The analysis excluded sociologists who had received their degrees after 1969. Again, a high percentage of articles was attributed to a small percentage of individuals. The conclusion is that there is a highly uneven distribution of productivity among Ph.D. sociologists in the United States. (Author/AV)",

Children are considered to be persons under 14 years of age, and youth are seen to be between the ages of 14 and 24. Data in the report analyze trends among children and youth in the areas of population growth and distribution, migration, education, marital status and living arrangements, fertility, mortality, labor force participation, income and poverty status, voting, and crime. Data on children indicate they are a steadily declining proportion of the total population, that eight out of ten children are cared for by one parent while the children are not in school, and 80% under 18 years old in 1976 lived in families with both parents  present. Accidents were the leading cause of death in 1975 for children. Data on youth show that they are highly mobile, their enrollments in the high school and college populations have increased since 1970, that most lived in families in 1976 (either their own or their parents'), and that incidence of divorce has increased in recent years. The youth labor force is estimated to grow in the remainder of the 1970s but at a slower rate than in the early 1970s. The bulk of the report contains tables of statistics illustrating these trends.

        "description":"The booklet maintains that the key to meeting basic human needs is the participation of individuals and communities in local problem solving. Some of the most important achievements in providing food, upgrading housing, improving human health, and tapping new energy sources, comes through local self-help projects. Proponents of local efforts at world problem solving point out that national and international efforts are too highly centralized to encourage direct action by those who are most affected. Examples of problem-solving achievements by local initiative include private-plot agriculture in socialist countries; prefabricated housing in industrial nations; solar heating in Chinese villages; and self health care in industrial and Third World nations. Cooperation of national and  international agencies with community organizations can be effective if they combine local initiative with long-term financing for specific projects. Examples of successful cooperation include the World Bank Urbanization Project (which provided $866 million to 15 developing nations between 1972-77 for housing), and the local development project of the Inter-American Foundation (which distributed $40 million between 1971-76 to Latin American citizens groups for agricultural and housing improvements). The conclusion is that local participation in social reform offers individuals the opportunity to understand and develop administrative and organizational skills to deal with both immediate and long-term needs.

The eight to ten week unit is divided into four sections. Section I, a general unit outline, presents organizing concepts and questions, instructional objectives, and suggested topics for study. Section II considers the important geographical features of Maryland. Section III examines how people in Maryland can preserve the environmental quality of their state. Section IV focuses on Maryland's cultural heritage and suggests ways in which the people of Maryland can preserve their heritage. For each topic, a two-part format is followed. First, a class discussion is outlined. Questions are listed and correlated instructional supports to be  used by the teacher are described. These include use of flash cards, maps, globes, bulletin boards, art materials, and the blackboard. The second part lists student performance objectives, activities and procedures, assessment measures, and resources. Learning activities involve students in map, globe, and compass exercises; inquiry questioning techniques; illustration analysis; geographic feature model making; class and panel discussions; educational games; theatrical presentations; class reports; and field trips. A directory of resource material on Maryland lists books, filmstrips, maps, television series, and transparencies. (Author/DB)",

        "author":["Freeman, Milton M. R."],
        "description":"Anthropology research should be relevant to public policy formation. If anthropologists continue to produce research which reflects a \"detached observer\" perspective, their studies will not enjoy widespread credibility. The use of policy-relevant anthropology (applied anthropology) will depend in large part on the efforts of anthropologists toward making their value biases and research documentation public. One area in which social relevance is particularly clear is ecological anthropology. This relevance is exemplified by widespread public concern over wilderness, recreation areas, rights of native peoples, and depletion of natural resources. Anthropologists can contribute to policy formation by critically approaching an issue, objectively evaluating the data, and providing  information to policy makers. A case in point is a 1973 controversy between an Inuit Indian community and an oil company consortium over exploration rights on Bathurst Island, Canada. In this situation, anthropologists re-evaluated evidence relating to ecological damage and provided documentation to policy makers. The conclusion is that anthropologists share the responsibility of all scientists to create an informed public opinion and to undertake research in accordance with this objective. Conversely, anthropologists should avoid endorsement of policy-relevant issues prior to adequate scientific study of the problem. (Author/DB)",

Lacrosse, hockey, baseball were monitored on television, with students questioned about the impact the behavior of the players (pro-social and anti-social) has upon their own behavior on the playing field. Findings suggested that exposure to anti-social media does not necessarily lead to increased levels of aggressive behavior among children and youth participants in organized sports. In general, a positive relationship did appear between exposure to pro-social media and high levels of pro-social behavior. Results were inconclusive in regard to the issue of desensitization to violence as a  result of observation of anti-social media. It is recommended, however, that the mass media be encouraged to depict and emphasize the pro-social model and positive behavioral aspects of amateur and school sport activities, as well as offering more exposure to those sports high in pro-social behavior, such as golf and tennis.

Discussion among panel participants focused largely on the individualized education plan (IEP), the first provision of the Act, upon which further implementation rests. The preparation of the IEP, the placement of handicapped children in the least restrictive environment, and the inservice and preservice personnel development needed to write and implement IEPs in both regular and special education are  explored.

        "description":"The process of field-based teacher education (FBTE) over a five-year period at the Washington University (St. Louis) is reviewed, with emphasis on two areas: (1) shifting philosophical bases upon which the program was constructed and (2) recurring implementation problems impeding full program development. Three philosophies are identified as providing primary direction at different periods: first, an inquiry-personal commitment model of teacher education with the student-teacher as originator of much of the program direction and content. The second direction viewed decision making as a shared process, and the third saw a predefined &quot;good teacher&quot; as the result of program participation, thus feeling little need for a process of shared decision making. The changing philosophical  view is summarized as representing differences across cycles in the expectations held for students and attitudes toward the planning of curricular activities. Six implementation problems prominent in at least two of the three philosophical cycles are identified: university staff disagreement, interpersonal crises, surprise events, the dominance of logistics, typical student teacher problems, and the dilemma of teacher involvement. The occurrence and reoccurrence of each of these problems over the five-year period are described and analyzed. Implications for future FBTE programs are examined, beginning with an analysis of the limitations of the concept, and an analysis of one factor--decision making--identified as common to four of the six problem areas. Recommendations for coping with  these problems include: (1) development of ground rules for decision making; (2) formation of a small group of core FBTE faculty; (3) control of decision making complexity; (4) development of slack space built into staff meeting schedules; and (5) preparation for decision and conflict.

        "description":"This study reports on attempts to involve forty British teachers in a program of research into implementing inquiry/discovery approaches to teaching in classrooms, following the failure of a previous curriculum reform movement at the implementation stage. It was hypothesized that a fundamental problem of curriculum reform lies in the clash between reform theory and theory implicit (often unconsciously) in teachers' practice, and that fundamental change in classroom practice can only be brought about if teachers become conscious of the theories that guide their practice and are able to reflect critically about them. Organizational structure of the study is described, including (1) a focus on practitioner-defined, practical problems; (2) collaboration between researchers and  practitioners; and (3) a concern for generalizability. A second-order, action research role for the investigators is also presented: how can one initiate teachers into the activity of reflecting about their practice? Theoretical concepts of classroom structure used by the teachers were clarified and explicitly formulated, and used as the basis for teacher-teacher/teacher-researcher discussion. The criteria for testing practical theories of inquiry/discovery teaching are also outlined. Triangulation (observation from the viewpoint of three separate groups) was chosen as the main strategy for teacher monitoring, and its use is illustrated. Six hypotheses relating to teacher self-observation/self-criticism/change developed during the project are presented, as are as forty-three hypotheses on  the second-order action research role of the research team.

        "description":"Nine subjects, 5 of whom claimed absolute pitch (AP) ability were instructed to rapidly strike notes on the piano to match randomized tape-recorded piano notes. Stimulus set sizes were 64, 16, or 4 consecutive semitones, or 7 diatonic notes of a designated octave. A control task involved motor movements to notes announced in advance. Accuracy, measured on the basis of deviations of responses from targets, significantly differentiated AP from NAP (non-AP) subjects at all set sizes except the control task. For both groups, accuracy increased as set size decreased. Decision times--that part of total response time before a movement to the response note began--decreased as set size decreased, but did not differentiate AP and NAP subjects. The results are discussed in terms of a  two-factor theory of AP ability whereby NAP subjects use only relative tone height as the basis of judgment, but AP subjects also use standards of tone chroma stored in long-term memory. The abnormally high channel capacities and rates of information gain for AP subjects are based on the transmission of information in two channels, whereas NAP subjects transmit information in only one channel.

Before each trial, one experimental group was given information as to the word frequency (WF) level of the items' names. The other experimental group was given information as to the typical age of acquisition (AOA) level of the names; the pictures and names had been selected such that the WF and AOA had a low correlation. Under all conditions, AOA was a stronger predictor of latencies, or response time, than WF. Scores on a psychometric test of speed of picture naming were highly correlated with mean reciprocals of latencies in the experimental picture-naming situation. Priming of responses by prior information on AOA  was more facilitative than WF information, but as compared to the control condition such information had a retarding effect. Speed of naming improved over trials in all conditions, but AOA level of the names, as well as the lags between successive presentations of an item, affected the amount of improvement in a complex manner. Retrieval of an item from truly long-term memory appeared to place it in an immediate memory buffer. (Author/MV)",

This system is designed to systematically record and categorize all interactions of selected target children with the teacher, as well as critical behaviors performed independently and with their peers. The coding sheet is divided into four sections according to the type of interaction being coded. The response opportunities section includes categories for indicating whether the interaction was in a small group or general class discussion, the method of initiation of the interaction, and the feedback provided by the  teacher. The child initiated contacts section records the child's work, approval seeking, housekeeping, personal, tattling, and social interactions, while the adult afforded contacts section has divisions for work, housekeeping, personal, and social interactions between the teacher and the target child. The behavior related contacts section records student causative behaviors, and teacher's reactions to them, in addition to specific critical target and teacher behaviors. Instructions regarding coder training and reliability, and a sample coding sheet are included. (Author/MV)",

The specific teaching behaviors of interest are defined by a model for small group instruction which describes organization and management of the class, and ways of responding to children's answers that are associated with achievement gains. The coding system was designed specifically for this study, although several categories were adapted from the Brophy-Good Dyadic Interaction Coding System. This system is to be used only in reading groups and only to measure public encounters between the teacher and individual members of the class. There are two kinds of forms used, a high-inference and a low-inference coding sheet; both are appended. On  the high-inference sheet are check lists and rating scales describing various events which do not involve interactions between a teacher and a single child within the context of the reading group, i.e., teaching techniques, student behavior, or seating arrangement. The low-inference sheet is used to describe each step in an interaction between the teacher and an individual child within the context of the reading group. This involves both academic and behavioral interactions. (Author/MV)",

        "description":"Twenty-eight second and third grade classrooms in Austin, Texas were observed for approximately thirty hours each, using an elaboration of the Brophy-Good Dyadic Interaction Observation System. These process data were then analyzed for differences according to grade, student sex, and student socioeconomic status (SES). Grade and sex differences were below chance levels in frequency and were generally as would be expected in direction. However, SES differences were widespread, indicating that teachers working at the same grade level may be faced with very different opportunities and demands. High SES classrooms featured eager and competitive students and businesslike teachers who focused on the curriculum. In contrast, low SES classrooms featured students who were fearful,  anxious, and generally alienated from the student role. Their teachers attempted to combat student fears with patience and determination, and showed a greater willingness to deviate from the curriculum and to attend to matters of personal concern or interest; they generally exhibited a more personalized approach. These process differences in teacher behavior appeared to be appropriate responses to the particular demands placed upon the teachers. (Author/MV)",

Children in grades two through five who received consistent teacher rankings over a two-year period on one or more of 13 bi-polar scales describing student characteristics were identified. At the end of the second year, classroom observers completed a behavior check list on the target students they observed. Check list items were analyzed by grade and sex as well as for high, medium, or low teacher rankings on the 13 scales. The results revealed more overt classroom misbehavior attributed to boys than girls. Although few interpretable grade effects appeared, they generally supported the idea that  sassing and other negative behaviors decrease with age. In general, the check list data support other data from the study showing that students ranked high on teacher concern but low on the other 12 scales were described more negatively by coders than students ranked favorably by the teachers. Although there were obvious halo effects in the teacher rankings, the rankings were generally accurate. (Author/MV)",

The strategy combines adaptive item selection both within and between the subtests in the multiple-subtest battery. A real-data simulation was conducted to compare the results from adaptive testing and from conventional testing, in terms of test information and test length. Data for the simulation consisted of test results for 365 Navy fire control technicians on a paper-and-pencil administration of a 232-item achievement test divided into 12 subtests. Correlations between subtest scores from adaptive and conventional testing were .90 or higher for 11 of the 12 content areas. An information analysis showed that for all 12 subtests, the information curves from adaptive testing were  essentially identical to the corresponding subtest curves from conventional testing. The number of items administered with adaptive testing was half that required with conventional testing; the shortest adaptive test battery used 18% of the total number of items in the conventional test, while the longest used 80%. The adaptive testing strategy, therefore, provided a considerable reduction in test length and virtually no loss in precision of measurement when compared with the conventional administration of the same test battery.

        "description":"Mastery learning can be described as a set of group-based, individualized, teaching and learning strategies based on the premise that virtually all students can and will, in time, learn what the school has to teach. Inherent in this description are assumptions concerning the nature of schools, classroom instruction, and learners. According to the author, in mastery learning, both the teacher and learner are responsible for the desired learning. Moreover, differences in learning among individuals are, in fact, differences in the amount of time it takes them to learn. This amount of time is based upon three factors: his or her previous learning, his or her interest or confidence in learning the skill, and the quality of the instruction. Schooling is a purposeful activity, which  should develop talent rather than select and categorize it. Instructional grouping practices often violate mastery learning's assumptions about individual students. (Author/MV)",

Increases in reliability are generally found, but with mixed results for validity. Several methods of producing option weights, (i.e., Guttman internal and external weights and judges' weights), and their effects on reliability and concurrent, predictive, and face validity were examined. Option weights to maximize reliability produced crossvalidated increases in Hoyt reliability over rights-only scoring (.82 versus .58 respectively), decreases in correlations with other achievement tests, little changes in predictive validity, and a loss in face validity (i.e. some correct options had lower weights than incorrect  options). Weights to maximize validity did not crossvalidate and led to a reduction in reliability and mixed validity results. Judges weights produced increases in reliability and mixed results with validity. The size of Guttman weights was shown to interact with item option and test characteristics. It was concluded that option weighting offered limited if any improvement over unit weighting.

The following reasons are cited: (1) What the pupil brings to the classroom in terms of ability, previous knowledge, home and peer influence, motivation, and other influences is clearly very powerful in determining academic standing at the end of the year. (2) Student achievement reflects only a small portion of the total set of objectives for which schools increasingly are being held accountable. (3) Taking pupil standing at year-end as an indicator of teaching effectiveness frequently does not recognize standing at the beginning of the year; in addition, the problems of adjusting for prior standing are extremely serious and  rarely recognized. (4) This accountability system would reward the teacher who teaches to the test or who gives primary attention to those pupils who are below minimum standards but in reach of them. (5) Such an evaluation system would probably reward teaching behavior which promotes low cognitive level learning and penalize teaching which promotes complex learning. (Author/MV)",

The 1976 ETS \"The Testing Scene: Chaos and Controversy,\" presents a historical review of events surrounding the testing controversy. In \"Test Theory and the Public Interest,\" Frederic M. Lord suggested three alternatives for solving some of the problems of cultural test bias: weighted scoring techniques, tailored testing, and item sampling. Esther E. Diamond discussed test construction techniques that could alleviate bias, in \"Testing: The Baby and the Bath Water Are Still With Us.\" In \"One Man's View of Testing,\" William Raspberry stated that  norming contributes to cultural bias. Thelma T. Daley discussed the effects of testing on students, in \"The Student and Testing.\" In the final paper, \"Where Ignorance Is Bliss--'Tis Folly to be Testing,\" Robert L. Thorndike recommended that tests be evaluated in light of the decisions that will be based upon their results. (BW)",

Ecological validity is achieved through partnership relationships between researchers and the teachers implementing treatments, design of treatments to include clusters of related behaviors rather than just one, and provision of complete and detailed information about what to do and why. Simultaneously, a naturalistic analog of experimental control is achieved through judicious selection of research settings, and the capacity for causal inference is retained through collection of data regarding the degree of implementation and short term outcome. Finally,  treatments are designed to be as exportable as possible. (Author/MV)",

Measures of student achievement, attitudes, and teaching ability, as reported by student teaching supervisors and by school principals where the graduates are employed, were compared for two groups of students: (1) those with grade point averages above 3.5 (A=5.0), and (2) those with GPA below 3.5. Students below 3.5 were found to be seriously deficient in basic subjects. Students with higher GPA were rated higher on measures of attitudes, teaching performance, classroom management, and overall teaching ability. The authors recommend that the standard requiring junior year education majors to maintain a GPA of 3.5  should be continued as a method of screening potential teachers. (Author/MV)",

Questions asked of the parents included: What career would they like their children to pursue?, How many years would they like their children to remain in school?, and How many years did they expect their children would remain in school? Parents born in the U.S. who had attained a high school or higher educational level were found to have higher educational and occupational aspirations for  their children than those born outside the U.S. who had achieved less than a high school education.

Problem areas upon which the Carter administration is focusing are examined. These areas include the failure to eliminate discrimination against federal employees, the failure to ensure that Federal funds are not used in a discriminatory manner, and the failure to revise Federal laws and regulations which are sex biased. A number of court cases which have been brought against the government are mentioned and their legislative outcomes reviewed. Changes in policy and practice being implemented to correct previous federal laxities are described. Some bureaucratic, technical, and attitudinal problems which have  made compliance with and enforcement of civil rights legislation difficult are discussed. Ways in which the current administration is addressing these problems are outlined. Optimistic conclusions are drawn about the commitment of the federal government to abolish discrimination on the basis of race or sex. (GC)",

        "description":"Spurred by the impetus of the antipoverty programs of the 1960's, social science researchers and human service practitioners have focused upon the need for effective communication with the American urban poor. To this end, both groups have attempted to describe the context within which the urban poor receive and process messages in the hopes of drawing from these descriptions some guidance for communicating. In this paper the literature which describes the communications system of the urban poor is reviewed. The &quot;information poverty&quot; thesis prevalent in this literature is discussed. The manner in which social service agencies operate is examined in the context of the information network described. It is stated that the &quot;information poverty&quot; thesis has been of little help in  bettering communication with the urban poor. The assumptions inherent in the thesis are shown to reinforce a &quot;we to them&quot;, rather than a &quot;we with them&quot; approach. A number of weaknesses in this approach are pointed out. The most recent work, which appears to be offering a more helpful perspective and more helpful data, is summarized. In this literature, interests and situational perceptions are emphasized. This perspective is seen as providing a more positive and unified approach to communication with the urban poor. (Author/GC)",

The simple recognition of these factors, however, is of no help in characterizing the specific sources of language norms among urban minority students or in determining the ways these distinctive norms interfere with reading. Positions set forth in an attempt to define these considerations have tended to assume varying degrees of either language deficit or language difference. The language deficit position is reviewed in this paper. In an attempt to redress a lack of focus in the literature on the underlying social and cognitive forms of language, the deficit position is criticized from sociolinguistic and psycholinguistic perspectives. A number of  misunderstandings of deictic processes in verbal communication apparent in the language deficit position are analyzed. A counterposition is developed based upon the understanding of a new line of processes, which the author refers to as &quot;cultural deixis&quot;, in addition to the already established line, referred to as &quot;discourse deixis&quot;.

Analytic positions set forth tend to assume varying degrees of either language deficit or language differences. The language deficit position is examined in this work from a sociolinguistic or psycholinguistic point of view. Among the lines of criticism pursued are several which have already been established by proponents of the language difference position. These include charges that language deficit proponents have used invalid criteria in evaluating the oral performance of urban minority students, and have failed to investigate the actual repertoire of verbal skills that these students exercise in everyday communication. A psycholinguistic criticism also  levelled by the language difference proponents holds that the others have assumed that nonstandard forms of language reflect deficient forms of cognition. Pursued in depth in this document is another psycholinguistic criticism. This holds that language deficit proponents have assumed an inadequate theory of reference in evaluating the language of urban minority students. Specifically, they have not taken into account the holistic functions of oral language and the dynamic nature of language form. Neither have they recognized that the referential functions of lexical forms are established only in an immediate context, and that lexical forms of language may be considered as possessing deictic and nondeictic functions.

Many of the barriers to school improvement are cultural and relational rather than programmatic. Patterns of constituent relationship expressing mutual trust and respect, complementary roles, and shared goals are a necessary but not sufficient condition for a successful approach to the solution of persistent school problems. Three recommendations to improve the nature and quality of interpersonal relationships in school intervention projects, addressed to private and to  governmental funding agencies as well as to technical assistance groups are: Where possible, resource and technical assistance should be focused on the better functioning of those sites demonstrating an established set of change activity, identity, direction, philosophy, goals, and colleague constituent pattern of relationship; technical assistance groups must engage in face-to-face interaction with other constituents; Finally, a cross-site analysis suggests a need for the support of collaboratively designed school improvement proposals, projects, and strategies as well as associated colleague patterns of constituent relationship.

There is also a need to formulate statistical measures of segregation, so that developments in future years can be assessed against the past. This report was designed with these two objectives in mind. The analysis is primarily concerned with the experience of the 1960's, when the socioeconomic status of minorities was undergoing significant improvement, new civil rights initiative had emerged from the courts, and surveys revealed an apparent weakening in the prejudices of blacks and whites alike. Since the 1960's seemed particularly ripe for an increase in integration, developments within those years provide some telling clues to the prospects for future change.  A brief review of recent trends in attitudes, incomes, and policies which might have encouraged the breakdown of segregated living patterns is first provided. Statistics which describe the segregation of urban households in 1960 and 1970 actually show an overall increase in the level of segregation during the ten year period. Social, economic, and market factors that might affect the location of blacks and whites within a housing market are considered. The findings suggest that racial segregation may continue to plague the majority of urban areas. (Author/AM)",

Three of the five data sets were not available for the 1972 study by Christopher Jencks. None of the analytical approaches detected evidence that ability differences have larger effects in educational attainment among men with low scores than among men with high scores, nor among men with blue-collar as opposed to white-collar fathers. The tendency in the evidence is to suggest the opposite. Furthermore, with  respect to the effects of measured ability on occupational status the evidence suggests that if there are differential effects of ability, they favor those with higher scores rather than those with lower scores. The findings suggest, at best, that the effects of test scores and schooling are similar for men regardless of initial standing, and at worst, that larger benefits accrue to men who are already advantaged. The results of this study provide little support for those who view compensatory education as a potent instrument for extending economic opportunity to the disadvantaged. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"An evaluation was conducted to measure and assess student growth and development in the Second-Shift Program at the Johnstown Area Vocational-Technical School (Pennsylvania). The program was designed to provide educational services to students not generally accepted into the school's regular vocational program (eighteen of the forty participating students were identified as special education students), and was concerned with increasing the students' reading ability, computation skills, and familiarity with occupations. Appropriate evaluation instruments were administered to all subjects in the project, either as pretests and posttests or as posttests only. Evaluation project objectives were developed in the following areas: reading achievement as measured by grade level  attainment, mathematics achievement, general educational development and achievement, interest in and attitude toward school, familiarity with occupations, interest in an occupational area, attitude toward relevance of academic subjects, decreases in discipline problems, and increases in school attendance. It was found that student achievement as measured by standardized reading and mathematics tests was significant; some students made dramatic advances with respect to grade level attainment; and student attitudes toward school improved significantly. Knowledge of and interest in occupations as measured by the posttest was at a level where much student development might be attributed to the program. (Appendixes contain the pre- and posttest school attitude assessment scale, the parent  attitude assessment scale, and data for the occupational interest and knowledge survey.) (TA)",

The project results are as follows: (1) A working instructional system design (ISD) model and the accompanying strategies were developed that enabled vocational personnel to apply the systems approach to designing and developing instructional programs, (2) all  project activities culminated in a one-week institute (workshop) where vocational teachers, directors, supervisors, and teacher educators were trained in the system concepts and applied strategies, and (3) thirty-four vocational personnel were introduced to the ISD concepts and applied strategies. Most of this book consists of the institute training package and includes the workshop goals, schedules of activities, a bibliography, the ISD model, and workshop modules. These modules concern systems and the systems approach to instructional design, task survey, occupational analysis and performance objectives.

Twenty-two process objectives and twelve outcome objectives were evaluated with either a nominal (yes/no) assessment of status, or a descriptive (statistical/narrative) assessment of status, as determined by interviews with program personnel, examination of project records, and administration of appropriate instruments. A pre- posttest design was used to assess outcome objectives achievement associated with academic achievement, self-esteem, career orientation, and sex bias. A self-administering checklist/open-ended response form was used to collect summative impressions of the program from students, parents, and site resource  people. Pre- posttest EBCE/control results are provided for the Differential Aptitude Test, the Career Development Inventory, the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, and on the sex-role socialization questionnaire. Results of the parent evaluation, student evaluation resource surveys, and interviews conducted with resource persons at the work site are reported.

Weekly seminars were held in which the teachers shared their experiences with each other and with the company's executive staff. Each teacher agreed to also enroll in a graduate course in career education for each of two consecutive semesters following the summer internship, the purpose being to examine the activities conducted over the summer and develop subsequent programs and curriculum materials to apply in each teacher's home high school. Company employees and management trainees also enrolled in the courses,  producing a continuing exchange between educators and industrialists. Two evaluation instruments were designed and pre- and posttests were administered to four different employee groups (the eight teachers were one of the four groups) to establish the attitude of the groups regarding free enterprise and to test their knowledge of how our economic system functions. Results showed only minimal changes in the attitude and knowledge among the groups, but the data revealed that the teachers did not have the negative attitude about business and industry that is often perceived by the business world. As a whole the results of the project were encouraging and plans were made to design and implement future programs that will foster positive business-school-community cooperation. (BL)",

The incredible advanced technologies that have affected society are starting to affect education and are sure to change many characteristics of industrial arts education. As educators leading students in experiences aimed at enriching lives through the study of technology, we have to make value decisions about the nature of content which is to be taught. Regardless of one's philosophy and content interest, the study of industrial arts will increasingly evolve from an international base. We are on the edge of a new and interesting era in education. A characteristic of this era will be the use of electronic  technology in the classroom as teaching aids. However, many characteristics related to learning will remain the same. Industrial arts educators should be preparing students for their future by assisting them in the study of the many technological solutions to societal problems which exist today or will be present in the years to come. Industrial arts teachers should be familiar and utilize the different forms of methodologies and activities which allow for the study of the future. (EM)",

        "description":"Pilot testing was conducted on parts of the Occupational Exploration Program (OEP), a classroom program designed to enhance the career awareness and career understandings of seventh and eighth grade students through simulations, games, and small group and individualized activities. The Introduction to Occupational Exploration unit and three cluster packages representing the Trade and Finance, Health and Welfare, and Construction industries were implemented in more than twenty classrooms in two different school districts to pilot test the feasibility of using the program in regular classroom settings. Interviews were conducted and questionnaires were administered to both teachers and students using the OEP materials. For students the questions dealt with interest, use, and  understanding. For teachers, the questions focused on classroom organization, management problems, and general appeal/quality of the materials. The data collected was compiled for the introduction and for each cluster package as total units and for each specific product within those units. For the cluster packages and for most of the specific products within them, results were highly positive. Students felt that the products were interesting and appealing; that they could, in general, easily read them; and that they were learning about various aspects of the occupations included in the materials. Results from teachers not only verified the student perceptions but also indicated that the program could be implemented in the classroom without much difficulty. (A section on trends analysis  from the data collected in 1974-75 and appendixes containing evaluation instrumentation are included.) (TA)",

A statewide planning committee assisted in development of the method and instruments. A Delphi questionnaire was developed and sent to samples of personnel from seven different groups of vocational educators and policy makers in the state. Response and feedback was synthesized and analyzed to determine commonalities and differences, and participants were then asked to reach a consensus of opinion regarding each of ten issues. Results identify future needs and barriers in the following categories: influence of technological  and scientific advancements; effects of social changes; how to improve community involvement; role of local, state, and federal government; response to future occupational trends and innovations; how to meet the needs of minorities, disadvantaged, and handicapped; future educational strategies; identification of future problems; occupations which will be eliminated; and need for greater access to occupational education.

The four industries surveyed were fabricated metal products, machinery (except electrical), electrical machinery, and transportation equipment. The findings include the following: (1) Only 15% of all establishments in the four metalworking industries surveyed provided structured occupational training in the fourteen occupations studied, (2) the proportion of establishments offering structured training generally increased as employment size increased, (3) nearly  one-half of the 133,700 workers enrolled in structured training in the fourteen occupations received training in the machinist and welder occupations, (4) about 71% of all structured training was conducted to qualify employees for work in an occupation whereas 29% was conducted to improve skills of workers in current jobs, (5) more than two-thirds of all structured occupational training was provided on the job, and (6) about five-sixths of the establishments with training did not have a specific budget allocation for training.

Information was gathered to identify handicapped students and their vocational needs for 1977-82; the barriers which keep handicapped students from enrolling in and completing vocational courses; and successful techniques which work in teaching handicapped students. The results were used to provide a data base for special and vocational educators from the secondary schools and vocational administrators from Wisconsin's sixteen VTAE districts to jointly plan for educating  the handicapped in each VTAE district. This core group of educators and administrators from each district continued to meet in order to articulate the development and improvement of vocational education for the handicapped and to develop a strategy to help secondary students enroll in VTAE schools. In addition to providing a data base for program improvement and development, project PEP helped establish many new liaisons between vocational and special educators and between secondary and VTAE personnel which can be valuable in helping to increase the number of handicapped students who obtain employable skills through VTAE classes.

        "description":"Objectives of a study of the role of the school nurse were (1) to clarify the role of the school nurse within a particular setting, (2) to identify perceptions of key school personnel concerning the nurse's role, and (3) to identify and compare areas of perceptual congruity-incongruity between school personnel and school nurses. The instrument utilized included fifty Likert-type scaled statements related to the school nurse's role. Of these, thirty-two had previously been judged appropriate to the school nurse role. A composite mean score on the fifty items was computed for each of the four professional groups. Results of statistical analyses indicated a significantly lower mean score for teachers than the other groups and a significantly higher mean for nurses. Principals and  counselors were significantly different from school nurses but not from each other. Within the position categories there was agreement on the majority of the role perception items. Greatest amount of perceptual disagreement existed between teachers and nurses. It was concluded that (1) strong support for a school nursing program was evident from educators in this setting, (2) principals, teachers, and counselors did perceive the school nurse functioning in the newer areas of health education and counseling with some limitations, and (3) educators generally perceived the nurse as needing to perform the more traditional nursing functions such as care of the sick and injured. It is recommended that opportunities be created for more communication between school personnel and the school nurse.  (JT)",

It is intended to provide ideas for those engaged in health education program development with ideas for use in planning, implementing, and evaluating health education programs. The guide starts with a presentation of reasons for placing high priority on health education. One chapter considers the need for policies on defining health education, involving many persons in decision making, and establishing a process and structure for planning. Most of the guide focuses on steps in the planning process as they relate to health education: defining problems, setting  goals, designing plans, implementing plans, and evaluating programs. A health education program development scorecard pulls together the highlights of the guide in a form that can be used either as a checklist during program development or as a self-evaluation tool after completion of a plan or a program. Sources of assistance to health planning agencies are suggested, including staff, local and state organizations, regional resources, and national agencies; a list of references cited in all chapters is included.

        "author":["McCage, Ronald D."],
        "description":"In examining how one state (Illinois) approaches the development of a comprehensive state capacity for program improvement in vocational education, it is helpful to review federal legislative action. Research and development (R &amp; D) did not become an official legislative element of vocational education until the 1963 Vocational Education Act was enacted. Its major provisions supported research in vocational education and established the Research Coordinating Units (RCUs). The major provisions of the 1968 Amendments to the 1963 Act changed the face of the RCUs and redirected the efforts of many states. Prior to the passage of the Educational Amendments of 1976 a two-year study conducted by the National Academy of Science Committee on Vocational Education Research and Development  (COVERD) examined the total spectrum of vocational education R &amp; D. The messages presented by COVERD should be addressed in any effort to develop a state-level comprehensive plan. The past legislative changes have moved vocational education R &amp; D from basic to applied research and the RCUs from universities to state departments. Most RCUs may ultimately become an integral part of the total vocational education system at the state level. (The author explains how Illinois is implementing various legislative provisions. His answers to sixteen questions from the audience of vocational education research and development personnel are appended.) (EM)",

(Jobs Unlimited was a project which informed the public, especially women, of opportunities available in nontraditional employment.) The report researches the demographic background, employment history, and social characteristics of the women placed, explores client adjustment and progress in the new job, and examines the attitudes of personnel administrators toward women in nontraditional jobs, and those of women toward their nontraditional work. Some of the major conclusions presented follow: (1) For most of the forty-six women placed, the greatest strides came in the areas of wages and chances  for advancement, (2) the job retention rate of 85% with an average eight months of service indicated that, with proper counseling and screening of prospective employees, excessive turnover rates for women workers can be avoided, (3) the experience of nontraditional employment has been a positive one for the majority of women involved, (4) as a whole, company administrators failed to notice any significant effects from the employment of women, and (5) neither foremen nor administrators perceived any considerable advantages in the hiring of women, although overall reactions were generally positive.

On-site surveys of the existing administrative and programmatic arrangements for staff development were made and comments of both program directors and training officers were gathered concerning the way they felt staff development should be managed. Analysis of the program surveys showed that nearly all programs had been conducted by and for single professional disciplines, including very little multi- or interdisciplinary training in any of the states. Discussion of training concerns with state commissioners revealed that programs have been primarily sensitive to the needs and values of the individual disciplines rather  than to the objectives and goals of mental health or mental retardation programs. Several commissioners also expressed the need to give state level attention to career patterns for staff persons in their departments. This report of the survey and resulting recommendations is presented in four major areas: background and present patterns of coordinating training or staff development (includes descriptions of the types of training programs, patterns of training coordination, alternative objectives, and alternative managerial philosophies of state mental health agencies), functions of a staff development office, use of staff development as a management tool, and the office of staff development (includes organizational position, relationships with the larger agency and other agencies, and  staffing).

        "description":"Teachers of adults, if they are to be really effective, must be sensitive to the particular characteristics and needs of adult learners. Adults have many physiological, psychological, and social characteristics that are the result of normal aging. In determining which characteristics interfere with learning, it is found that all have an impact on the learning processes but few impair the adult from learning. Even though, as adults grow older, visual and audio acuity decrease, attention spans grow shorter, and energy decreases, the effects are usually not monumental. As adult educators become more familiar with these problems they are able to cope with them by planning, for example, more visual aids, better voice projection, and shorter, more concise assignments. As teachers  become more sensitive to the characteristics and needs of adults, the positive attributes of aging begin to outweigh the detriments. The freedom of choice that adults have in their educational ventures can help overcome their learning difficulties. Further, adults are generally settled in their lifestyles, are more mature in their thinking, have life's experiences on which to draw and are serious about how they spend their time. Although some characteristics of adults may slow learning, lifelong learning can become a reality as adult educators become more aware of adult needs. (EM)",

        "description":"Two of three phases of a study were conducted to (1) assess the state of the art on the prediction of nursing clinical performance and (2) obtain current information from nursing education programs about prediction criteria in use by them. Phase one involved a review of the 1965 through 1975 literature pertaining to studies that focused on the attributes possessed by individuals before they enter a school of nursing, individuals proceeding through the nursing education process, and performance following graduation. During phase two a national survey of 150 nursing schools was done to collect data regarding predictive criteria. Some of the findings follow: (1) The most commonly used admission criteria in decreasing order are health data, high school rank, high school grade point  average, applicant interviews, and prior college grade point average; (2) measures of cognitive attributes and achievement were the only predictive measures used by a substantial number of schools, and (3) teacher-made examinations were the most widely used measure of student progress in theory while clinical performance was evaluated by ratings of technical, interpersonal relations, problem solving, and assessment skills. (This report contains twenty-two tables summarizing the 398 studies reviewed during phase one. Each citation is cross-referenced with an annotated bibliography. The study's third phase, a follow-up of graduates, is currently underway.) (EM)",

Mercer (1977) points out that the student role includes two dimensions (social and cognitive), that student success depends upon progress in both dimensions, and that both dimensions need to be assessed. Traditionally, school success has been measured primarily in terms of achievement. Until recently there have been few measures of the social dimension. Mercer and Lewis' Adaptive Behavior Inventory for Children (ABIC) is a new scale which does assess children's social development through subscales reflecting six social spheres: family, community, peers, school, earner/consumer, and  self-maintenance. Inter-correlations between the WISC-R, ABIC, and achievement can fruitfully be examined in the light of racial-ethnic groups and socioeconomic status. (Author)",

First, do racial-ethnic groups differ on important social, economic, and cultural characteristics? Second, do they also differ in their test performce? And, third, do these socio-cultural characteristics correlate with test performance? Affirmative answers to these questions would suggest the need for pluralistic norms. The Estimated Learning Potential (ELP) is a statistical device which, if its validity is established, may help make equitable comparisons among children of different ethnic groups. (Author)",

The ABIC is premised on the belief that all behaviors are learned in a particular sociocultural context and that this context must be taken into account when interpreting behaviors. In California and Texas, Mexican American children are the dominant minority group and come from a linguistically and culturally different background. Their own social system has unique properties and often is outside of the Anglo core culture. Since their adaptive behaviors are nurtured and reinforced within their social system, these behaviors need to be interpreted with respect to the norms of their group.  (Author)",

Although subjects in all programs showed significant weight losses (an average of 8.1 pounds for the 22 weeks), no significant differences between groups emphasizing stimulus control, reinforcement or general discussion were found. The overall results suggest that a program of group meetings with self-monitoring, nutritional information, and encouragement can lead to short-term weight loss, with neither information on reinforcement nor information on stimulus control contributing significantly to the loss. However, the great number of studies showing poor long-term results of weight control programs suggest that results of any weight control  program lasting for less than a year should be viewed as tentative.

        "description":"This study attempts to answer the following question: Do males and females differ in their reporting behavior to interviewers of contrasting status backgrounds, specifically psychiatric physicians and lay interviewers? Subjects were 200 adults. A 263-item instrument was utilized to measure functional psychological disorder. Interviews took place under three conditions; (1) a physician conducting the interview made his status known; (2) a physician conducting the interview did not make his status known; and (3) lay interviewers were used with their status known. Results indicate that women give the most information about their symptomatology to unidentified physicians, and report the least to identified doctors. Males tend to report more symptoms to identified physician  interviewers. It is speculated that social training of the sexes might explain their contrasting performances. Women may be more responsive to interpersonal interaction, and therefore to the interviewing skill of the unidentified physicians. Men may be more responsive to interviewer status, and less to interpersonal skill; consequently, they report more to identified physicians. Also, women may feel threatened by the high status figure, being unaccustomed to lengthy interaction outside of evaluative contexts, and thus lack the trust necessary for self-disclosure in an interview.

In an attempt to provide some indication of whether such is the case, the history files of the Graduate Record Examinations were used to construct a history of aptitude test statistics for the years 1970-71 through 1974-75. The chief focus of the study was the examination of possible regular changes or trends in aptitude test mean scores over the observed period, but the study indicates that no such trends of practical significance occurred over the period. The major differences observed in scores were those between students in different fields, and these differences occurred consistently over the whole period under  examination. In quantitative ability, candidates in the Sciences averaged more than one standard deviation higher than candidates in Nonscience fields and, within the Sciences, examinees in the Physical and Math Sciences averaged nearly one standard deviation higher than those in the Life and Basic Social Sciences. In verbal ability, the Science and Nonscience candidates did not differ on the average, but within the Science group, Engineering candidates averaged noticeably lower than the others. (Author)",

A distinguishing characteristic of this management information system is its simplistic, yet elaborate nature. This apparently contradictory phrase illustrates the strength and flexibility of the system. It is simple in design, in data requirements, and in the number of forms used. On the other hand, it is elaborate in terms of the quantity and quality of information produced for use by program directors  and individual staff persons. Following an overview of the system, the major sources of input into the system are described along with a simplified introduction to the organization of the data base. Output, in the form of reports generated by the system, is also discussed.

The model, entitled SET, provides an outline of an effective, proven method for providing counselor trainees with satisfactory field practicum experiences, taking into account the roles and responsibilities of the supervisor, educator, and trainee. A cooperative effort is urged with recommendations that counselor educators relinquish the role of supervisor in favor of coordinator and consultant once the trainee has been placed. The argument is made that the on-site supervisor be given the primary responsbility for helping to set goals, to provide supervision and feedback, and to assess the overall performance of the trainee. It is also  recommended that the counselor educator provide as much information as possible to the trainee and supervisor so that meaningful behavioral objectives can be established. (Author/PFS)",

Qualitative data concerning problem-solving strategies and quantitative data were collected. EFT was administered to 12 females in each of the following decades: 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s. All subjects were moderately to well-educated, healthy, and relatively active members of the community. All had at least 20/33 corrected or uncorrected vision. An interview was held with each participant after completion of the EFT. ANOVA of time scores indicated that significantly more time is needed to solve the items with an increase in age; a Tukey (a) test revealed a significant increase between the 40s and 60s age groups. With an increase in age a significant  decline in the number of items solved was found. Partial correlations revealed that age is the most important factor relative to general intelligence, visual acuity, and the personality factors measured by the Eysenck Personality Inventory. The relative stability of performance up through age 49 and after 50 implies a decline in field independence rather than in higher-order cognitive processes. (Author)",

Respondents voluntarily completed questionnaires during hospital pre-natal classes or natural childbirth classes; post-natal questionnaires were mailed to respondents six weeks after the birth of their child. Both the pre-natal expectations and the post-natal ease of transition were measured by a 34-item checklist which tapped both positive and negative aspects of parenthood. A hierarchial, step-wise regression procedure was employed in order to examine separately the effects of expectations and control variables. Pre-natal expectations, age and education exhibited significant relationships with ease of transition, while  education was negatively related. Expectations of an experience appear to be a strong determinant of the perception of that experience. It was suggested that this might be due to the self-fulfilling prophecy or to an attitudinal component of anticipatory socialization. (Author)",

Stories were read which in some conditions contained information vitiating the implicational force of explicit inferences. The vitiating information was presented either before or after the inferences. In Experiment One, errors in memory for the inferences were prevalent in the &quot;after&quot; but not the &quot;before&quot; condition. Two kinds of errors were made: saying the inference had not been presented in the story; or, if it was remembered as having been presented, altering the specific content of the inference to produce the opposite of what was actually presented. The latter errors produced coherence with the  vitiating information, and subjects were not able to differentiate these errors from correct responses. In Experiment Two, the results of Experiment One were replicated, and a &quot;spontaneous correction&quot; interpretation was rejected. The results of both experiments combine to support the hypothesis of superficial processing and unstable representation of explicit inferences. The results provide a link between processes occurring at comprehension and recall in the State of Schema model of accommodative reconstruction. (Author)",

Protocols are used to describe specific strategies used in constructing an initial model of the text, revising the model, and evaluating the model.

        "description":"Children's well-developed oral language skills obviously facilitate their reading and learning to read. In contrast to a traditional position which contends that reading comprehension equals oral comprehension skills plus decoding, this paper claims that a child must learn (and, perhaps, unlearn) many more skills in the transition from oral comprehension to reading. In order to further delineate these skills, a dimensionalized space within which language experiences can be analyzed has been developed. The taxonomy implied by this space separates differences among language experiences into two major categories: those related to the medium or communicative channel and those related to the message itself. Comparing a child's oral language experiences (i.e., conversations) and the&quot;goal&quot; reading experience along these dimensions demonstrates clearly that the cognitive leaps we expect children to make in learning to read are enormous. Several consequences of this taxonomy for research and teaching are considered. As an example of the type of research question such an analysis might provoke, problems children might have in comprehending deictic terms (words whose meanings are sensitive to the time, place, and context of the utterance) in text are discussed.

        "description":"Recent studies have offered support for a constructive view of sentence memory in children, based on their preference in recognition errors for true inferences, which can be drawn from input sentences, over false inferences. However, with the materials used in these studies, this preference may reflect responding either on the basis of semantic or formal similarity to the original sentences. The present experiment separates these factors. Both semantic and formal similarity between input and test sentences are found to be significant and independent factors which together determine if children (second and fifth grade) will accept new sentences as old in a recognition test. The effect of formal similarity is greater for the younger children. Moreover, the patterning of recognition  errors on contradictory true and false inferences suggests that children of both ages monitor their own decisions so as to remain internally consistent with respect to the meaning of those test sentences indicated as old.

It is claimed that the use of non-explicit antecedents and referents for anaphora depends on a contract between speaker and listener. This contract requires that if the speaker uses an anaphoric expression whose antecedent or referent was inferentially derived, the listener both can and will make the same inference. Insofar as it is shown that many of these inferences rely on one of the few things explicitly available to both speaker and listener alike--i.e., the form of the utterance--the  identification of a sentence's formal properties become a matter of cognitive concern.

        "description":"This study investigated the effectiveness of teaching specific rather than global comprehension skills; the correlations among sex, intelligence level, and comprehension gain when taught global or specific comprehension skills; and the correlations between the factors of intelligence, comprehension, and vocabulary without regard for the teaching method. After 20 sixth graders completed an intelligence test, an achievement test, and an informal reading inventory, they were randomly selected for experimental group instruction in specific comprehension skills, based on diagnosed needs, or for control group instruction in global comprehension skills. Both groups received equal amounts of instruction for fourteen weeks. Posttest scores show that no significant gain in comprehension  was made by either group and that no significant correlations were evidenced between sex, intelligence, and gain in comprehension. These findings leave unanswered the question of what teaching mode is more effective for reading comprehension development, and raise the question of the significance for vocabulary as a factor contributing to comprehension development.

Three guidelines are offered to assist in this integration process. First, reading materials and instruction should reflect the ethnic diversity of the United States. This goal requires reading materials permeated with multi-ethnic themes and experiences, and instruction that accommodates the different cognitive styles of minority students. Second, reading instruction and materials should exhibit the linguistic diversity of the United States; standard English should be taught as an alternative dialect necessary for communication in this country. Finally, reading teachers should be cognizant of their personal  biases toward ethnic minority students.

Britton's model of writing, adjusted for mature writers, involves four stages: prewriting, writing, reconsidering, and editing. The first two stages, prewriting and writing, can be seen as the \"writer's role\"; reconsidering and editing can be seen as the \"reader's role.\" Teachers can improve the students' reader role through guided experience with texts, which develops the sense of audience necessary for reconsidering and editing compositions. For example, teaching the technique of scanning for information when reading an article can impress on the students the necessity of highlighting the topic and  signaling the subtopics with markers when writing an article, and teaching reading survey skills and the process of extracting information from a title will help writers create meaningful titles for their own work.

Complete data were obtained from 27 upper, 24 middle, and 23 lower SES level students. Oral language samples were recorded in semi-structured and spontaneous situations and then transcribed and keypunched for computer analysis. Oral language measures and a measure of knowledge of letter names were used as predictor variables in regression analysis; criterion measures were reading scores at the end of grade one. Results of the oral language measure show a wide variance for all three SES groups, while results of the reading achievement tests do not. Several  factors account for this difference, including the fact that all of the students had been in formal reading instruction for the same amount of time. The study report emphasizes the positive relationship between oral language fluency and reading achievement and suggests measures for improving future studies. (MAI)",

The saliency of Wolfe's stylistic boldness has prompted many to conclude that the absorbing, convincing quality of Wolfe's work is owed primarily to his unique and innovative stylistic techniques. But Wolfe is more than just a clever stylist; his essays reveal a carefully crafted argument through which he constructs an appealing rhetorical reality wherein there are simple, absolute, almost hilariously obvious explanations for everything. The rhetorical vision is architecturally achieved by Wolfe's reliance  on (1) analogy and metaphor, (2) single causality, and (3) hyperbolic &quot;put-on.&quot; (The major portions of the paper analyzes Wolfe's usage of these three devices in terms of its persuasive impact, philosophical dimensions, and journalistic implications.)

Eight separate individual research projects relating to the topic were organized; the paper describes six of them. It then draws preliminary conclusions about the hinterland press corps that emerged from the students'  research, notes that the program generated unusual degrees of enthusiasm and insight in the students, and suggests ways that practical and academic courses might be linked in more traditional journalism programs.

Dating from the invention of the telegraph in the late nineteenth century, news reports have been increasingly patterned after either a \"scientific\" or a \"literary\" model. The scientific report is based on irreducible facts, high-speed national communication networks, the professionalization of the journalist, and an integrated social foundation for the newspaper. The literary perspective is a more conservative approach to news writing, based on the integrity of feelings, personal observations, interpretations, and opinions, with an essentially local and individualistic organization of society. Although no resolution to the conflicting perspectives has been reached, a  few scholars, such as Robert Ezra Park and John Dewey, attempted to find a balance between the two perspectives.

After trying to identify who their students are, teachers need to develop a framework for teaching the elements of composition in a systematic manner; one such framework involves the teaching of invention, arrangement, and style. Teachers should help students find and structure the information they need, give them constant practice in writing, help them learn to write for an audience, and stress the pleasure that  comes in writing.

A review of more than a dozen such cases decided by state and lower federal courts in the last two years shows that judges have given increasingly greater freedom to students while insisting that school officials may do no more than establish narrow, carefully drawn regulations to prevent printed material from causing substantial interference with school operations. Court decisions against regulations that allow high school administrators to impose prior restraint on printed material make it increasingly difficult to impose such censorship. Other court decisions on libel and obscenity in school  publications indicate that standards set by the courts for the general community do not change in the high school setting.

Data for the study were taken from a 1976 national survey of non-voters focusing on the respondents' reasons for not voting and self-evaluations of their news media usage. Reasons for not voting were judged to be either substantive (disaffection for political candidate/party/system), neutral (lack of information), or technical (matters of convenience). Results indicated that the young and the elderly non-voters attached greater importance to substantive reasons. Although non-voters' and voters' mass media viewing habits do not appear to differ markedly, 18-to-24-year-old and over-65-year-old non-voters considered the news reporting on television and in newspapers to be less  helpful, and television news reporting less fair, than other age groups of non-voters. Although these study results are not conclusive, they suggest that televised news might have a critical role in non-voting behavior, thus questioning the general notion that greater public affairs media use encourages voting.

A composite week for the first quarter of 1975 was randomly drawn, and ten Canadian and twenty-nine United States newspapers were coded for all news items reported on those days, yielding the total number of column-inches of foreign news coverage in each country, with a breakdown by country or geographical area. As expected, a rather large discrepancy was found between Canadian coverage of the United States (49% of foreign news) and United States coverage of Canada (1.72%). However, elite nation factors proved to be poor predictors for the United States foreign news coverage, and only one of the factors,  trade, showed any predictive ability for the Canadian press. The results suggest that the elite nations themselves do not base their foreign news coverage on such matters as trade relations, population distribution, or economic development. (Author/RL)",

A placement test determines whether students begin with all or part of a ten-hour writing skills review or proceed directly to the core area of the program. Following the completion of the core instructional units, students select as many topics from a set of optional units as their individualized programs allow. The main advantages of the PIC program are that students receive instruction in a variety of job-oriented topics to help them before and during employment and that students can experience more learning situations in less time and in less physical  space than before. The program's disadvantages are that cost, class size, and instructors' workloads have increased, and that some students are unable to accept the responsibilities of independent study. Evidence of the program's success includes a significantly higher course completion rate. (A course outline of the PIC program is attached.) (RL)",

        "description":"Bias in mass communication can be defined as interpretation based on factors that are independent of the original information, or as shaping the meaning of information according to the context in which it is placed. Although research has explored the concept of bias from a number of perspectives, its subtle manifestations can be understood best by a careful study of media in different cultures. The importance of the person or nation involved in the event, the intensity or magnitude of an event, and even the designation of an occurrence as newsworthy, are factors determined largely by the culture of the journalist. Cross-cultural comparisons offer different patterns in the kinds of images and the types of stories that are juxtaposed, and these same comparisons clarify the level of  newsworthiness required of an event in a particular culture to merit general communication.

The article states that Armstrong's overt and purposeful declaration of an objective and rational approach, while actually  engaging in a subjective and emotional address, is unethical, but responsible for his overwhelming success.

        "description":"This study tested the ability of two semantic-memory models, feature-comparison and network, to explain differences in information processing times. The feature-comparison model assumes that an item's meaning is held in semantic memory as a set of characteristic and defining features, while the network model assumes that semantic memory is comprised of hierarchically arranged, superordinate and subordinate nodes. Each model makes different predictions about reaction times for information processing (retrieval and/or comparison). After fourteen subjects read a story that enumerated the characteristics and defining features of a hierarchy of fictitious animals and familiarized themselves with that hierarchy, they responded to 107 propositional statements about the animals' features  and interrelationships. Subjects' reaction times in responding to the propositional statements were compared with each model's predicted reaction times. Results show that neither model predicted reaction times accurately. A discussion of the results indicates that semantic memory is influenced by the form that a message takes, by the external cues that a communicator presents, and by the ways that people consciously order the messages they receive.

Both were administered the Mathematics Inventory for Teachers, an instrument designed to measure attitudes toward mathematics as a subject and toward its teaching. The principals were asked to respond as they believed an ideal mathematics teacher would, while the teachers were asked to express their own beliefs and opinions. The results were factor analyzed, and the principals and teachers differed in two of the eight factors. It appears that teachers are not as responsive to student needs as their principals would have them be. The principals would have their teachers give more attention to students who are having  difficulty learning the subject. In addition, the principals' responses showed a more narrow, conservative conception of the function of mathematics instruction while the teachers were more cognizant of the need for higher order outcomes in mathematics.

Principals and teachers had somewhat different points of view on science education and the functions of secondary education. However, both groups included student self-development, basic skills, and decision making as the top three functions of secondary education during the next decade. Principals ranked instruction preparation, curriculum development, and information as the top three areas for improvement.

Designed to be used by those working with teachers on curriculum development in economic education, the guide can also be used by methods instructors. Six major areas are defined as essential to economic understanding. First, students need to develop an objective, rational approach and be able to organize their thinking as they address economic issues and questions. Second, students need to master basic economic concepts and understand economic  institutions, measurement concepts, and concepts for evaluating economic action and policies. Third, students need a simple overview of the American economic system so as to provide a structure for examining specific issues. Fourth, students need to possess the knowledge and skills to recognize the various types of economic issues they are likely to encounter such as market and government action. Fifth, students need to apply their economic understanding to particular issues relevant to their own lives, such as the scarcity of oil or the rising coffee prices. Sixth, students need to form their own judgments on economic issues based on their analysis of the issues, tempered by their own values. (Author/JR)",

The activities stress group discussion and personal interaction. Section one gives a brief overview of various approaches to teaching about the non-Western world, including emphases on stereotypes, alternative life styles, universality of man, role of culture in an individual's development, and problems of modernization. Section two presents three models for implementing non-Western studies programs based on semester, unit, and lesson approaches. Section three, the largest section, gives samples of 13 different teaching methods. These include content  analysis of reading passages, situational exercises, role plays, mixed culture groups, use of outside resources, nonverbal communication activities, and field experiences. Each sample method explains requirements for group size, time required, materials needed, physical setting, process, special instructions, and related resources. Section four identifies innovative, multidisciplinary teaching materials, both audiovisual and textual, as well as resource guides, agencies, and major curriculum projects related to non-Western studies.

The study of popular culture consists of examining all elements of human activity and life style, including knowledge, belief, art, and customs that are common to a large group. These popular culture elements have been disseminated mainly, not necessarily, through the mass media. Popular cultural analysis has suffered greatly from the value orientation of its researchers. Negative views of popular culture resulting from its linkage in the minds of social scientists to facism and capitalism predominated the field from the 1930s through the 1950s. In the 1960s popular culture became linked with political forces approved of by many social scientists and has since then been  treated in a more positive manner. The tendency in both periods was to regard the study of popular culture as valuable only in terms of the effect of popular culture on political and social institutions. The author concludes with a plea for serious sociological study of popular culture. (DRS)",

Six major topics were discussed. The first report considered five components of multilateral disarmament mechanisms (information, study, deliberation, negotiation, and follow-up). The second report analyzed present and future capabilities of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The third report considered the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and suggested ways of making the SALT negotiations more effective. The fourth report examined international nonproliferation and plutonium management.  Demilitarization of outer space was discussed in the fifth group report, followed by a consideration of weapons limitation in the Middle East in the final report. The format of each group report includes a brief overview of topics considered by the group, background information on American and foreign government policy regarding the issue, a synthesis of group discussion, and suggestions for solutions to issue-related problems.

Intended as a forum for the exchange of ideas of government leaders from the United States and other nations about the international peace-keeping role of the United Nations, the Conference ordered discussion topics so that they would parallel the agenda proposed for the United Nations Special Session. The four-part agenda is as follows: (1) review of the international arms race and examination of the relationship between disarmament, international peace, and economic development; (2) adoption of a declaration of disarmament which would entail a firm commitment to action by national governments; (3) adoption of a  program of action on disarmament; and (4) review of the role of the United Nations in disarmament. Presented in outline format, the report is designed to reflect the essence of group discussions on disarmament topics, including arms limitation treaties, new weapons, escalating proliferation, the SALT talks, principles of disarmament, peaceful nuclear explosions, mass destruction, military budgets, world security, and international compliance with disarmament agreements. A directory of conference participants and comments by the conference chairman, Mexican government officials, and the United Nations Secretary General are presented. (Author/DB)",

Finances and guidelines regarding curriculums and standards come from the Federal government. The official language of instruction is Spanish, although Indian dialects are used in specialized rural programs. Although enrollment in noncompulsory preschool is low, over 75% of all students are enrolled in compulsory primary school. This comprises a six-year program emphasizing mathematics, Spanish language arts, and natural and social sciences. However, dropout rates are high. Secondary education, another six-year cycle, is offered in general and vocational schools as well as in open  programs using television and self-instructional media. Vocational/technical education is offered in vocational/technical schools, institutions of professional studies, and regional technical institutes. Various types of institutions exist for teacher education and higher education. Several nonformal education programs offer literacy training in rural areas and occupational training to elementary school dropouts. Recent developments in Mexican education include increased enrollment and finances, and availability of free textbooks. (AV)",

Despite various achievements in education, Peruvian authorities in recent years generally have not considered educational progress sufficient to meet the social and economic needs of their society. As a result, two educational structures are presently operating in Peru. The traditional structure of education is currently being phased out, and a reformed structure to be fully in effect by 1980 is being instituted. The new educational structure divides formal schooling into three levels: a six-year preschool or initial level; a nine-year basic education level, which forms the compulsory period of school attendance for all children between the ages of 6 and 15; and a higher education level. Higher education is  divided into three cycles consisting of professional-vocational education, university study, and graduate study. Other areas discussed in the booklet include educational administration, finance, teacher education, special education, nonformal education, and adult education. A brief reading list concludes the document. (Author/JR)",

A considerable difference is evident between educational levels of older and younger persons in the United States: persons 25 to 29 years old in 1977 were twice as likely to be high school graduates as persons 60 years old and over. However, data indicate that differences in educational levels between age groups will be smaller in future years. In 1977, a significantly smaller number of men 18 to 21 years old had completed at least one year of college than men of the same age group in 1970. This may be due to the recent decrease in the attraction of a college education. There has been a more rapid increase of blacks as compared with whites  in the proportion who were high school graduates by 1977. The high school graduation rates of the two racial groups began to converge in successively younger age groups of persons between 65 and 25 years old in 1977.

The study was conducted in a midwestern town where there were well established black and white communities, as well as more recently established, poorer black and white segments of the population. Information was obtained by means of longitudinal and cross-section nonparticipant observation in one elementary school. Particular mode of dress and clothing were associated with being labeled a school success or failure. Children were observed to be grouped according to neatness, cleanliness, and style of dress. Racial groups were mixed, but social class groups remained separate. As one moved from grade to grade, classroom  organization increasingly reflected social class rather than racial background. The author suggests that uniform dress be required in public schools in order to prevent this class segregation from occurring. (AV)",

Training programs consisted of ten-week periods of activity in fencing, body conditioning, and weightlifting. Analysis of data indicated significant personality differences between untrained and trained subjects in the following areas: anxiety, depression, hostility, intelligence, emotional stability, conscientiousness, self-assurance, and state of relaxation. These trait differences were not claimed as attributable to physical training; age appeared to be a more important factor. No changes in any of the trait characteristics were discovered after the  ten-week training period. (MJB)",

The thought is presented that only by working on these general problems, will the more specific problem of funding be effectively solved. Comments are presented on one aspect of educational research: that it is perceived as as having little impact upon practice. Explanations of this perception center on (1) the role of dissemination, and the relatively little funding devoted to it; (2) the role of research as a legitimizer of practice, rather than as an initiator of chanqe; (3) the gap between researchers and research users, in which researchers are the\"professionals\" and users a less knowledgeable \"public\"; (4) the nature of scientific models, in opposition to the humanistic concepts employed by users; (5) the problem of \"proof\" and \"truth\" in educational research--when is something \"proven true\"? Suggested remedies include (1) increased attention to dissemination; (2) increased attention to the demonstration of theoretical sources of practice; (3) increased emphasis on research rationale, the development of theory, and the integration of research into new wholes; and (4) attention to bridging the gap between researcher and user through increased awareness of the gap and its effects, through the use of classrooms for research settings, through an emphasis on success in practice as the final proof of research validity,. and through  modification of research development models to include more teacher involvement.

Pressures originating from the Pennsylvania State Department of Education are examined, as well as the University of Pittsburgh position toward performance based teacher education, approaches to implementation perceived from the school system viewpoint, outcomes as seen by the community, and benefits existing for children. It is suggested that to obtain a more realistic approach to PBTE, one must consider the background, cognitions, characteristics of persons, the persons themselves, and levels of role definition before identifying or specifying statements of competency.  Discussion is presented on roles and the generation of competencies within a role theory framework applying to the specific discipline of science. In a final section, the author attempts to integrate the notions of roles and competencies within the assumptions of a process directed toward the individualization of teacher education in favorable support systems using guidelines and standards proposed by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The long range goal in formulating an observational design is described as the establishment of a personal statement of philosophy of education. The process activities in design formulation include: (1) reflection on previous educational experiences and extrapolation of critical variables; (2) viewing of videotapes of classroom situations and eliciting  success/failure variables; (3) selection of classroom behaviors of personal significance, and asking how one could observe them in the classroom; (4) acquiring a general knowledge base; and (5) discussing, in small group interaction with peers, objective means for observing intentions, behavior, or values within the classroom. Implications for supervision and curriculum development of such idiosyncratic observational designs and their system of utilization are discussed. (MJB)",

General goals of physical education are discussed, and expected student outcomes at each of the three levels are listed. Equipment envisioned for the elementary school program is for a population of 600 students and approximately 24 teachers. The assumption underlying the plan is that there will be four sections per grade level and that only two of the four sections will be using the equipment at any one given period. Middle  and secondary school levels are based on a population of 900 for the middle school and 1,500 for the secondary school, with all students in the middle school enrolled in the program. Not all students in the secondary school are expected to take part in the program. Careful schedulinq and innovativeness on the part of instructors can reduce the expenditure necessary for equipment purchase. An equipment inventory check list is appended. (MJB)",

        "description":"In 1973-74, Tennessee Technological University developed and implemented a model for systematic data gathering and for making evaluations of their programs in teacher education. During 1976-77, four distinct groups of subjects participated in this longitudinal study. Basic instrumentation and procedures were pilot tested during the first year of the study and included: (1) University records; (2) principals' evaluations; (3) California F-Scale; (4) a measure of the satisfaction of the students of the graduates; and (5) observation by trained observers. Descriptive statistics, intercorrelations and comparisons were computed for all data obtained in the study. The major findings of the study for the first-year subjects were similar to those reported in the first three years of the  study. Detailed comparisons across four, three, and two years of the study, for the individuals that entered the project in, respectively, 1973, 1974, and 1975 indicated few differences. The differences that were noted were minor and, in most cases, no explanation can be offered for the changes. Comparisons were also made of all first-, second-, and third-year subjects. Again, only minor differences were noted. In summary, it appeared that the subjects who had been in the study for more than one year had changed little. Also it appeared that those students who entered the study in 1976 were little different from their counterparts who were in the initial years of the project. Factor analysis of data obtained with the Classroom Observation Record gave results similar to that reported in  the literature. A study of the results of the California F-Scale indicated that less authoritarian subjects exhibited many of the characteristics of good teachers reported in the literature. Based on the findings of the study, several conclusions were advanced and recommendations made for continuation of the study. (MJB)",

        "description":"The ethical issues concerning the use of behavioral procedures are founded on concerns relating to behavioral control. One major recurring ethical issue is that of coercion. The focus of this paper centers on the question: Ought behavioral programs to be employed even when they might be against the volition of the participant? A theoretical and administrative overview of client consent is presented. The need for incorporating self-control procedures into behavioral programming is emphasized. The theoretical position taken is one which emphasizes that environment and human behavior are bound in a reciprocal interaction process. It is suggested that the term behavior analysis replace behavior modification because of its focus on an analysis of the interaction between environment  and human behavior rather than on any single procedure which superimposes control of one on the other without respecting the interaction process. A suggested revision of teacher-training in behavioral procedures is offered. The need for additional emphases is discussed in detail. These emphases include complete behavioral assessment, knowledge of teacher modeling effects, consideration of antecedent events prior to contingency manipulation, a more thorough understanding of consequent conditions, and incorporation of the long-range objective of the student as the locus of control in any behavioral program.

Seventy-three graduates from the period 1971 to 1976, grouped according to specialization (school health education, community health education, or dual major) were polled on occupational record since graduation, job descriptions, reasons for choosing/leaving a job, salary, major, and opinion of course work value. Results showed that 23 graduates were employed within six months of graduation, earnings ranged from five to ten thousand dollars/year, 35 percent were employed at the time of the survey, and  dual majors more often chose teaching rather than nonteaching positions. The professional preparation blocks were ranked as of most value in the educational program. Dual majors were most prevalent and apparently the most successful in obtaining both teaching and community health positions. For single majors, the employment situation was not found encouraqing. Recommendations stemming from the survey urged that the department (1) reevaluate its advisement to majors, (2) consider the impact of specific courses with regard to redefining the curriculum and numbers of sections of those courses being offered, and (3) discuss with other departments possible ways to improve the meaning of their courses.

Selected areas of social-psychological research are briefly described, and concepts from these areas are applied to tutoring projects. Effects that are widely reported for tutoring projects are shown to correspond to reasonably well established social-psychological processes, and theories from areas of social psychology are shown to predict effects that have not been reported in the literature on tutoring or by practitioners. Using these two approaches the author identifies a number of topics needing empirical testing: (1) main attitudinal  effects of the role of tutor; (2) long-term effects of the role of tutor on cognitive functioning; (3) effects of tutoring on social relationships; (4) social effects of tutoring on groups; (5) aptitude treatment interaction and the role of tutor; (6) effects of tutoring on teachers' expectations; (7) training of teachers and tutors; (8) process studies of bases of influence; (9) formative evaluation; (10) the question of payment of tutors; and (11) process studies of influences on tutees.

The cycle should involve the following: (1) behavioral objectives should be defined clearly; (2) teaching methods should be related to present status--readiness of learners at given skill level; (3) level of mastery or standard of minimum acceptable performance should be agreed upon; (4) formative evaluation should occur at each level of performance in order to provide continuous feedback to  students; and, finally, (5) summative evaluation should be conducted to test the achievement of the learner and to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching methods.

Individuals with different handicapping conditions are often hindered in getting from one place to another by such barriers. This publication is designed to serve as a beginning reference and resource about architectural barriers and accessibility. Specific chapters deal with application of general principles, legislative mandates, rules, and regulations pertaining to physical education, recreation, sports, and related facilities so that each is accessible to the physically handicapped. Focus is on removal of physical and architectural barriers in facilities used for physical activities so that everyone can use them regardless of type or severity  of handicapping condition. In seven chapters the following subjects are discussed: (1) accessibility and attitudes; (2) architectural accessibility legislation; (3) physical education and recreation facilities; (4) swimming pools; (5) outdoor recreation facilities; (6) playgrounds; (7) transportation and travel.

The purposes of minimum competency testing in reading include the identification of students who need remedial assistance, and the evaluation of secondary school students regarding graduation requirements. Important considerations regarding test content include: its relationship to the assessment purposes, the role of task analysis, the priorities of particular skills, the type of test, the ways to include teacher judgment, the practical vs. academic flavor of the test, the methods for presenting very difficult materials, and the need for a more developed theory of reading. Several general properties of good systems for setting standards are presented: (1) The school's  responsibility toward the needs of the students and of the society must be recognized. (2) Management standards regarding planning, delegation of responsibility, and review or quality control should be maintained. (3) Expectations must be realistic. (4) Standards should be administered with adequate student preparation and feedback. (5) Standards should be applied consistently and should be acceptable to other institutions, so that credits will be transferred. (6) Standards should be administered fairly so that the involved students feel they have been well served. (Author/MV)",

Each group showed a decline in reading ability, but the drop for SAT takers was greater than that for the other two groups. A much greater increase in the proportion of low ability than of high ability students taking the SAT appeared to be the predominant source of the score decline. The decrease in ability level of high school seniors also contributed to the decline. There were appreciable changes in the background characteristics of all groups in terms of age, sex, parental educational and  occupational background, family configuration, high school curriculum, and expected college major. However, none of these factors provided a major explanation of the decline among high school seniors and college entrants. A decrease in the percentage of SAT takers entering four-year colleges might help explain the greater decline observed for this group. Some evidence indicated that SAT scores earned in 1960 and 1972 are not precisely comparable; thus, the actual decline was somewhat greater than the SAT scores indicated. (Author/EVH)",

In this critique of On Further Examination--the report of the Advisory Panel on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) Score Decline--the National Education Association (NEA) finds no fault with the reliability of the SAT. Its content validity, however, is suspect. The NEA maintains that the SAT is really an achievement test, and questions its relevance to high school curricula. The SAT is constructed primarily by psychometricians and psychologists who may not be sufficiently familiar with secondary curricula to develop a test with content validity. The College Entrance Examination Board Achievement Tests, which draw heavily on the expertise of teachers for content, do not parallel the  SAT score decline. The Panel is criticized for dismissing the issue of SAT bias by noting that racial differences occur on most standardized tests. Questions are raised about the desirability of an unchanging standard and about what a predictive test should measure. From the teachers' perspective, the SAT score decline raises important issues concerning: the quality of instruction, innovative teaching methods, the back-to-basics movement, literacy, automatic promotion, exit examinations at the end of high school, reduction in homework, individual differences in learning and maturation, standardized teacher examinations, and teacher organizations.

The one-parameter model of Wright and Panchapakesan and the three-parameter logistic model of Wingersky, Wood, and Lord were selected for comparison. These models and their corresponding estimation procedures were compared, using actual and simulated test results, with respect to: (1) the ability to calibrate multivariate data, (2) the sample size needed for calibration, (3) the effects of item quality on the calibration, and (4) the operational costs. The one-parameter procedure provided equivalent ability estimates at a lower cost than the three-parameter procedure when basically unifactor group tests were used. This method was therefore recommended for item calibration of group  administered, multiple choice tests. However, the goodness of fit of the models to the data definitely showed the three-parameter model to be superior. Whether the better fit will outweigh the higher costs can only be determined by further comparison of the usefulness of the ability estimates, in actual tailored testing. (Author/MV)",

Such findings have led to a careful investigation of certain environmental factors which might account for such change. A new instrument, the Life Complexity Inventory (LCI), was developed to measure both current and retrospective characteristics of the individual's life style and microenvironment. The LCI was completed by 140 individuals ranging in age from 40 to 88, whose intellectual and personality functioning had been measured in 1956, 1963, and 1970. Initial analysis of this instrument resulted in eight distinct environmental item clusters, which represent  particular patterns of life style or experiences, family relationship, or relationship to the environment. Moderate correlations were found between environmental cluster scores and change in cognitive function over two consecutive seven-year periods. These changes in cognitive function were measured by The Primary Mental Abilities Test and the Test of Behavioral Rigidity. The grouping of individuals according to these eight item clusters resulted in the identification of four modal subject types; these types differ in their pattern of change in cognitive function over time.

The Psychometric rationales for six approaches to the identification of biased test items are reviewed: (1) Transformed item difficulties: within-group p-values are standardized and compared between groups. (2) Analysis of variance: bias is operationally defined in terms of significant item by group interaction effects. (3) Chi-square: individual items are investigated in terms of between group score level differences in expected and observed proportions of correct responses. (4) Item characteristic curve theory: differences in the probabilities of a correct response, given examinees of the  same underlying ability and different culture groups, are evaluated. (5) Factor analytic: item bias is investigated in terms of culture specific and culture common sources of variance, or in terms of loadings on a biased test factor. (6) Distractor response analysis: the relative attractiveness of item foils, or response sets, is investigated. The limitations and advantages of each approach in terms of the underlying assumptions, psychometric soundness, conceptual complexity, applicability to criterion referenced tests and applicability to interdependent groups are discussed.

        "description":"A number of tables present data on the changing characteristics of high school students taking the American College Testing Program examination (ACT), and on the declining ACT scores, from 1970 to 1975. A brief research review indicates that the observed declines are not merely a result of the tests themselves. The author suggests these explanations: (1) the increased proportion of female test takers, many of whom represent lower academic ability levels; and (2) high school grade inflation, which encourages less able students to perceive themselves as &quot;college material,&quot; take the entrance examinations, and perform poorly. The author also concludes that the declines are not due to changes in the performance of racial minorities, since the declines have been steeper for Caucasian  students. The declines are also marked for students who plan to attain a Bachelor's degree only. Though a variety of student background and demographic variables exert modest effects on scores, the strongest statistical relationship was found between high school enrollment in academic courses and test scores. The author suggests that the score decline may also be a result of the broader spectrum of students who aspire to college, and that this is acceptable because of the expanded educational opportunity.

        "description":"Students previously attending Arapahoe Community College (ACC), Littleton, Colorado, who had not returned for at lest one quarter during the 1974-75 year were sent the Student Outcomes Questionnaire to elicit their reasons for not returning, satisfaction with their experiences at ACC, present and future plans, and background and demographic information. The 825 respondents (approximately 38%) were categorized according to the educational goals held when they left ACC: 8% sought a certificate; 20% sought an associate degree; and 70% sought neither. The background data showed that 94% of the respondents were Colorado residents, 94% were white, and 66% had a high school diploma as their highest degree. The median age of the dropouts was 26, and one third of the male respondents were  veterans. Over 80% attended ACC for one year or less. For all categories of dropouts, important reasons for leaving included: conflict between job and studies, lack of money, and home responsibilities. As for opinions of college services and experiences, three items were rated as very satisfactory: school location, library services, and enrollment size. Approximately two-thirds of the former students had either returned to school or intended to enroll within the next year. The questionnaire is appended. This booklet is a supporting document for the Student Outcomes Questionnaires. It is illustrative of the type of report that might be written as a detailed summary of a student outcomes survey.

        "author":["Metz, Mary Haywood"],
        "description":"This is a report on a study of two junior high schools in a small Midwestern city called \"Avon\". This industrial community serves an agricultural region. This study was undertaken as a complement to a study of two other junior high schools in a much less ordinary community and school system (\"Canton\") which had been previously studied. This report concentrates upon a comprehensive analytic description of the character of the classrooms and schools studied in Avon and upon those theoretical issues or empirical hypotheses where the findings from Avon extend or qualify those from Canton. Avon operates three junior high schools drawing from the city and two drawing mainly from surrounding unincorporated areas. Two city schools were chosen for this study, Dale and Fillmore. They have  the highest proportion of recent Appalachian migrants in their student bodies and were chosen for this reason. The approach in studying the schools was ethnographic. The main focus was to observe the ways in which maintenance of control interacts with the school's other functions both in the classroom and in the school at large. In studying these differences in children's behavior within and between schools, differences between teachers and differences in the way a single teacher treated different students, differences in the policies and the practices of the principals, and differences in the character of the schools as whole organizations were studied. It was observed that the character of a school depends in large part on the nature of its environment; as that term is technically used  in the study of organizations. Perhaps the most important single influence on a school was the students. Because the teachers perform the central work of the organization and because they form the vast majority of persons given a formal right to define the situation, they were found to be the next most important group in determining the character of the school. This detailed description of Dale and Fillmore provided a subjective sense of the complex ways in which students' behavior, teachers' skills and characters, and the principal's policies blend into a total school atmosphere which in turn shapes students', teachers', and administrators' behavior.

        "description":"The administration recently announced a broad overhaul of the welfare system called the program for better jobs and income. This proposed plan would consolidate three major components of the current welfare system and provide, for the first time, a nationwide minimum federal cash payment for all the poor. In this paper the existing welfare system is reviewed. Changes which would be brought about by the administration's plans are presented. The structure of the existing program designed the aid the poor is outlined as is a description of the many problems with the welfare system today. The administration's new proposal is also outlined. A crucial issue in all proposals designed to aid low income families is that of work incentives. The effect on work incentives of the  administration's proposal is compared with the current system. A second crucial concern with reform proposals is how they affect current welfare recipients and other groups of low income families. Because of the complexity of the administration's proposal, this is a difficult question to answer definitely, but a rough answer is provided. This is accomplished by looking at the effect of the proposal on several types of families. The extent to which individual states will supplement the benefits which are provided by the federal government is the main complication in assessing who will gain and who will lose. There are incentives for such supplementation in the proposal, and these are explained. A criticism of the administration's proposal is also presented. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This report presents an evaluation of a student team teaching technique, Student Teams-Achievement Divisions (STAD) in two seventh grade English classes in the Baltimore City Public Schools. This technique is composed of two principal elements: biracial, ability heterogeneous student teams, and achievement divisions, a statistical technique for insuring each student a substantial chance of contributing a maximum number of points to his or her team score, regardless of the student's past performance. Positive effects on achievement have been reported for the technique. This paper examines the effects of the technique on student race relations. Sociometric analysis indicated a significant STAD effect on the number of cross-race friendship choices and the percentage of cross-race  helping choices, and a marginal treatment effect on the number of cross-race helping choices and the percentage of cross-race friendship choices. The paper reports findings of increased cross-racial helping and friendship choices and academic achievement (at least for blacks) in a class using this technique as compared to a control class. These findings increase the degree to which student teaching techniques can be relied upon to integrate desegregated classrooms. They also validate a new and practical technique for accomplishing this goal. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This is the annual evaluation report (1974-1975) for the Georgia Schools' Title I programs. Title I programming emphasis is increasingly oriented toward basic skills. In the programs evaluated, 99.5% of the total participating units of instructional activities were in preschool education, reading, and mathematics. For the first time, the local educational agencies (LEAs) were required to submit objective achievement information if they collected it. In addition, they were asked to rate the success of their project as they perceived it. These two kinds of evaluation information revealed that in the area of preschool education, 84.7% of the students both pre and post tested met or exceeded the objective, and 95.3% preschool projects were considered successful or very successful. In  the area of reading, 53.2% of the students met or exceeded the objective, and 84.8% of reading projects were considered successful or very successful. In the area of mathematics, 65.4% of those students pre and post tested met or exceeded the objective, and 85.8% of mathematics projects were considered successful or very successful by LEA's. This shows a correlation between perceived success and actual success in terms of student achievement in these areas. In terms of objective type, two topped the list as most successful, the &quot;involvement, interest&quot; objective type, and the objective type concerned with &quot;reducing discipline problems.&quot; The objective type judged to be least successful was the one concerned with &quot;improving mental health&quot;. It was recommended that the Title I programs in  Georgia be continued. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Caribbean mental health professionals are concerned with the types of psychotherapy that are relevant to the needs of their clients, and with the uses of psychotherapy in a political context. They appear to be divided into two schools: one seeking to promote in clients a change from a traditional world view to a modern one, and the other seeking resolution within the client's lifestyle and belief system. This paper discusses mental health professionals' relationship to indigenous healing systems endemic to Caribbean people. For instance: (1) Haitians' Voudou, (2) Obeah, or witchcraft, which is prevalent in the British West Indies, the Virgin Islands, and the Bahamas, (3) Puerto Ricans' Espiritismo, and (4) Afro-Cubans' Santeria. These as well as other therapeutic modalities are  discussed in terms of their applicability in clinical and community settings. A second component of the paper deals with empirical approaches to psychotherapy with Caribbean immigrant groups in Miami. The University of Miami-Jackson Memorial Hospital Community Mental Health Center, maintains six ethnic community teams, four of which are geared toward Caribbean populations (Bahamian, Cuban, Haitian, and Puerto Rican) with staff of matching ethnicity. This center has developed a range of various types of therapeutic interventions. Among them are the following: (1) a network of culturally homogenous mini clinics in six different communities, (2) group therapy within a social recreational context, (3) involvement of the extended family in family therapy, (4) knowledge of the various forms of&quot;hexing&quot;, (5) consultation and informal referral to folk healers when this seems indicated, and (6) merger of traditional and scientific techniques in psychotherapy.

        "description":"Desegregation and integration are affected by many of the same forces that affect other major social changes, such as dramatic news events, authority in the form of law and policy, educational programs, and experience of the new situation. How these forces affect desegregation and integration has to do with peoples' attitudes and the effect of changed attitudes on changed behavior. This paper concerns the major forces affecting desegregation and integration as presented in three different studies that have dealt with patterns in processes of desegregation and integration. Each study determined whose attitudes and behavior were the major target of change efforts, what positions they held, and whether they were black and white, or primarily white. It is noted that for integration  as well as desegregation, the major focus for change is white resistance to the process. The major forces affecting desegregation and integration are: (1) the occurrence of dramatic national events, (2) law or administrative edicts or authority, (3) teacher attitudes toward race, (4) interracial contact, and (4) the presence of certain educational programs (i.e. compensatory efforts to equalize educational opportunities and curriculum and materials reflective of cultural diversity). It is concluded that desegregation demands less than integration. Law, administrative policy, and teacher attitudes can take the process only so far. Integration must ultimately come from the minds and heart of the people. These reports suggest that a combined approach is called for: starting young, and  providing supports for attitude change.

Two replicate studies of social mobility in the U.S. undertaken in the early sixties and seventies enable social scientists to measure shifts in opportunities for American men. General findings about recent trends are presented in this document. Typically, American children have acquired more schooling than their parents, and access to a high school education has increased for the less advantaged. This greater equality of precollege education by social trends, however, tends to mask the persistence of unequal opportunity for a college education. In terms of job opportunities, occupational mobility of whites  did not change between 1962 and 1973, but that of blacks did. In 1962, there was little relationship between the occupational position of the black man and that of his father. In 1973, there was evidence that the occupational positions tended to persist across generations for both blacks and whites (although there is also substantial occupational mobility). In terms of income opportunities, the relative economic returns of college education have declined for young whites but not for young blacks. This latter phenomenon has contributed to a relative \"catching up\" of the black minority. (Author/GC)",

Although discrimination in employment against women has been illegal for more than a decade, between 1967 and 1974 the male/female earnings differential remained virtually unchanged. The results presented in this paper show that the earnings differential would have widened by approximately 7 percentage points in the economy, and 13 points in the private sector alone, had it not been for the enforcement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 over this period. The paper begins by presenting a theoretical background for determining the expected effects of enforcement of EEO laws on  earnings. It then specifies a model of firms' compliance with Title VII, and a model to estimate the impact of enforcement on the male/female earnings differential. Following that, the impact of enforcement between 1967 and 1974 on the earnings of individuals is estimated for the economy as a whole, and for the private and government sectors. Finally, the distribution of gains and losses in earnings due to enforcement across experience intervals and education classes is assessed. (Author)",

The first component of this strategy is a marginal hours employment tax credit, similar to the recently enacted New Jobs Tax Credit. This would serve to generate an expansion in employment. The second component entails the distribution of vouchers for both training and employment. These vouchers would be given to hard-to-employ workers, such as veterans, the disabled, high school dropouts, ex-convicts and ex-addicts. They would, when turned over to the employer, result in the government sharing the initial year's wage costs with the employer. Families with children would be brought out of poverty by the third and fourth  components of the author's proposed strategy. These are: the guarantee of an at least minimum wage job for every family's primary wage earner, and a family wage rate subsidy conditioned on family size that would raise the earnings of low wage workers with large families.

Previous research has documented an association of early motherhood with lower educational attainment, marital instability, higher subsequent fertility, and later economic poverty. However, these associations have not been tested in multivariate models of attainment that include important controls for social, economic, and motivational factors. Therefore, it is not clear whether the attainment of young women is inhibited by having a first birth at a young age, or whether the achievements of early childbearers are limited by personal and social characteristics other than age at first birth. The analyses summarized in this paper evaluate the attainment of approximately 5000  contemporary young American females as it is affected by the age when they bare their first child. In addition, the effect of the legitimacy status of the birth is evaluated. Quantified results and analytical discussion focus upon education; family size (fertility); marital stability; and occupational and income status. Additional foci include an examination of the relationship between female headed families, welfare dependency, and poverty. Some means are suggested by which the government, the schools, and other institutions could ameliorate the problems of high teenage fertility. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"The subject of career education is a vast and complex one. For example, it often emphasizes alternative educational programs for high school and junior high students that may involve substituting work for academic experience in industrial settings outside the schools. Or it may encompass recurrent or lifelong education programs for adults that provide additional education which may or may not be work related. The youth oriented ideas can mean less education while the concepts aimed at adults suggest more. No one would deny that education and work are related. The real issue is what form any advocacy movement takes and whose interests it serves. The rationale behind much of the federally supported career education effort is weak, and many of the programs seem to be more in the  interests of big business than in the interests of our nation's youth. Career education cannot solve the youth unemployment problem, but certainly there are youth problems that well-directed career education programs could help with. The American Federation of Teachers advocates dissemination of more information on job availability, occupational projections, and job access. It supports job training programs which build upon a basic education by combining further academic experiences with on-the-job experiences, but it strongly opposes any occupational education program that would diminish general liberal education or that would endanger present child labor, minimum wage, early school leaving, and health and safety laws. It also strongly opposes programs that involve turning over some of  the responsibility for public education to the private sector. (BL)",

        "description":"Vocational education as a social intervention process operates on two levels: (1) the micro level at which services are designed to improve the employability of the individual and (2) the macro level where the objective is to heighten the awareness and the sensitivity of the community as to the importance of human resource development for the world of work. The mandated use of advisory committees at the local, state, and national levels is a built-in means of achieving the social participation necessary to an effective social intervention program. Also necessary is social experimentation, the process of testing what works and what doesn't. Vocational educators are conducting such experimentation in many areas, giving rise to need for a research dimension. Specific areas of  research need include the interface between the five major delivery systems for employment and training services: vocational education, Vocational Rehabilitation Service, Social Services (WIN), State Employment Service, and Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs. Methodology must be developed which will provide measurements or indicators of both the social and economic effectiveness of all such programs at both the micro and macro levels. Too much concern for economic efficiency (costs/benefits and cost effectiveness) ignores the critical need to develop criteria to show program contributions to social efficiency, i.e., to values relative to the human condition. (The author's answers to questions from the audience of research and development personnel is appended.)  (JT)",

        "description":"Objectives of a research project were to determine current employer practices in personnel performance evaluation in New Hampshire, and to inform vocational teachers and guidance counselors of these employer practices so that they might make program or counseling service modifications to better acquaint vocational students with these practices. Interviews were conducted with twenty-three employers across the state to learn of their current procedures in employee evaluations. Also, professional meetings of personnel managers and training seminars for personnel were attended to gain perspective and insight into the tasks personnel managers are required to do. Overall findings indicated that graduates who know what they want and what they have to offer, and who cultivate human  relations skills, will interview effectively and be more successful in landing a job. This report discusses the findings under three topics: how to get a job: evaluation prior to employment, how to hold a job: evaluation after employment, and the importance of work attitudes. Brief suggestions directed to vocational teachers for teaching work attitudes and interpersonal relations are included. These suggestions refer to use of the appended materials, which comprise the major portion of the report and include sample employer interview forms, employee performance evaluation forms, a listing of teacher resource materials.

Project data generated the following conclusions: (1) The inservice model presented to the public school level was effective in producing gains in career knowledge, in creating more positive attitudes toward career education, and in implementing activities in the classroom; (2) key components as identified by teacher  participants in inservice workshops were demonstrations by experienced teachers of career education activities, participation in actual experiences suggested for students, follow-up support by consultants for teacher career education activities, and small group meetings within grade and subject areas to discuss implementation of career education concepts; (3) career education is an accepted goal by the State Board of Education but not necessarily a priority item for funding support in Maine; (4) postsecondary teacher educators or administrators in general do not perceive career education as a priority item; and (5) the inservice training model for demonstrating career education philosophy, concepts, and practices is a viable procedure.

        "description":"The aim of the research review reported here was to draw together empirical findings that illuminate the factors affecting Work Incentive Program (WIN) results and contribute to discussion of future welfare, work-training, and employment policies. (WIN, authorized in 1967, has sought to put people on Aid to Dependent Children (AFDC) to work through a variety of educational and training services.) Three chapters deal with research on the characteristics of welfare recipients, e.g., research on whether they share a strong work ethic and on what other factors affect their trainability and work effort. Subsequent chapters deal with what is known about the results of offering jobs to welfare recipients, the importance of family structure and personal motivation in welfare dependence,  and the policy significance of the research findings when viewed in historical perspective of federal efforts to deal with welfare and unemployment. An introductory chapter briefly summarizes the whole review. It is concluded that WIN training helps certain welfare recipients improve their earnings and length of time in jobs, and that whatever policy choices are made, they should be made with awareness that the current inability to turn welfare into workfare resides primarily in limitations of the job market system and only secondarily in the characteristics of welfare recipients.

        "description":"A comprehensive course of study for natural resources was developed and offered to eleventh and twelfth grade students as an elective, to determine whether such a program was feasible in a high school vocational setting. An area-wide survey of environmental occupations was conducted and an advisory committee made recommendations as to course content, which was based on a curriculum developed by the Pennsylvania State University Agriculture Education Department. Students were enrolled for two years, three class periods per day, five days a week, with one-half of the instructional time spent in classroom subjects and the other half in mechanics. Extensive field experiences were also conducted. After three years of program operation, conclusions are that students previously turned  off by school now appear to have more tolerance for school because they have a program of interest and one with which they can identify. A second class section of first year students was added to accommodate increased interest, and the local school board agreed to fund the program when federal assistance is no longer available. Graduates of the program are all employed, many of them in natural resources or related occupations. Recommendations included establishing programs of this nature in other schools and conducting follow-up studies of employment patterns of graduates. (A natural resource course of study is appended.)

Section 1 reviews concerns and fears of minority leaders relating to career education as a concept and discusses the six career education missions of the U.S. Office of Education. Section 2 discusses the applicability of process and programmatic assumptions of career education to the needs of minorities. Section 3 analyzes reasons why minority leaders are concerned about career education. As the central part of the monograph, section 4 reports results of a study conducted on attitudes of minority leaders toward career education in 1976. The following topics are discussed: attitudes of minority leaders toward conceptual assumptions of career education; some examples of the  growth of the career education concept; attitudes of minority leaders toward programmatic assumptions of career education; some successful career education programs for students with special needs; evaluative data on career education projects; and services of civic, social, and professional organizations to meet the needs of minority and low-income students. Section 5 details implications for career education and minorities in the following areas: minority children; unemployed minority adults and school dropouts; federal, regional, state, and local governmental agencies; business, industry, labor, and professional organizations; and the educational system. Specific implications for career education as it relates to minorities are outlined. Appendixes contain response data from the survey.  (TA)",

        "description":"Two survey studies were conducted to determine what rural and small school personnel perceived as their communication, information, and consultive needs in the area of career guidance materials and practices, and how these needs best could be met. For the first survey a questionnaire was sent to 7,618 schools which asked about awareness of career information, how that awareness came about, and the usefulness of certain communication means for increasing awareness of career information. The second survey instrument sent to 500 schools and agencies focused on identifying specific career guidance information needs of rural educators that could be met through a variety of communications techniques or services. Recipients of both surveys included administrators, teachers, counselors,  coordinators of pupil personnel services, coordinator/directors of guidance and/or career education, and curriculum coordinators. Respondents from both samples identified a lack of awareness of current methods, materials, and resources necessary to plan and implement comprehensive and effective career guidance programs. It was concluded that current and future rural school-focused career guidance information activities should provide at least the following services: packets of information on current career development materials, toll-free telephone consultation services, free consultative service by mail, newsletters, and consultants.

        "description":"A feasibility study was aimed at developing a strategy for implementing and utilizing the job analysis methodology which resulted from the Health Services Mobility Study (HSMS), particularly as it can be applied to the field of diagnostic radiology. (The HSMS method of job analysis starts with task descriptions analyzing the tasks that make up a job. The tasks are then rated (scaled) for their skill and knowledge requirements and arranged in groups according to their levels of skills and knowledge. This makes it possible to design job ladders based on similarities of task content, arranged in rising hierarchies of tasks according to the level of difficulty. This also forms the basis for developing curriculum objectives that are related to what is done on the job, and designing  educational ladders that parallel the job ladders.) After in-depth interviews with potential users and thorough explorations of potential areas of implementation of the HSMS methodology, it was concluded that the methodology can be used in health and other work areas to develop critiera for (1) identifying job tasks and educational preparation required at different levels, (2) describing and evaluating job performance, and (3) for developing criterion-referenced tests with content validity to meet Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines. Recommendations for immediate, intermediate, and long-range applications of the HSMS methodology were made. Half of this report is contained in an appendix which includes general statements on HSMS, descriptions of use of HSMS task data, HSMS  methodology and application in diagnostic radiology, examples of task description and curriculum objective sheets, and explanations of HSMS curriculum objectives and how they can be used.

The conditions and parameters of the following claim were examined: any lifelong learning enterprise initially funded by the federal government outside of the existing educational system as nonsequential, nonselective and noncertificatory will be transformed into a system that is sequenced, selective, and certificatory. The conclusions were that (1) any effort to determine federal policy in the case of lifelong learning by the conduct of small-scale experiments is likely to be maximally misleading, (2) there are many opportunities for a small-scale federal role to be quite  successful by attaching an increase of lifelong learning opportunities to already existing federal programs, (3) any new initiative in lifelong learning should constitute a rapid expansion of those institutions that are free, accessible, and open to all Americans without discrimination, and (4) some subsidies should be made available for existing institutions to serve new populations. (Much of this report is devoted to showing how a federally supported expansion of lifelong learning opportunities will develop into a system much like the existing educational system, and how that will affect the existing educational system.)

Section 2 reviews the historical development of OJT policies, including the Manpower Development and Training Act, the National Alliance of Businessmen's Job Opportunities in the Business Sector Program, and CETA. Section 3 discusses several considerations in developing and operating OJT programs, including objectives, OJT versus classroom training, economic conditions, realistic  budgeting, operating or subcontracting the program, job descriptions of key positions, production and performance standards, linkages with other employment and training programs, selection of industries and jobs, and monitoring. The fourth section discusses marketing considerations and includes target population priorities and characteristics, legislatively mandated priorities, the job market, contact service representatives and employer contact procedures, and public relations tools. The OJT contract design, including essential features, a pre-CETA model, cost reimbursement versus fixed cost, and supportive services are covered in section 5. Section 6 describes several experimental OJT alternatives, such as, incentive payment to trainee and contract extension. The final section makes  recommendations for OJT program improvements. (EM)",

Critical features of planning necessary to assure that local career guidance programs are in fact designed, developed, tested, and delivered to meet specific career development needs of the people they are to serve are discussed in the area of each process step including the following:  planning (initial planning, local data-based planning, planning for local career guidance and counseling, activity tryout and implementation test), career development, needs assessment (individual and group), resources for guidance, goals and objectives, new career guidance practices (home-centered guidance, subject and nonsubject-matter-based guidance and counseling, and community centered guidance), placement (labor exchange models, client-centered models, client-advocate models), follow-through, evaluation, community relations and involvement, staff development, and attitudes toward guidance.

(3) Sex stereotyping and sex bias in publications, career counseling, materials, textbooks, and curricular materials are extensively documented. (4) Within the next two years a variety of inservice sex fairness training materials should be available. (5) Focus seems to be on equality for women rather than equality for both sexes.

Two different approaches to cooperative education are identified: (1) the capstone approach, in which the student receives one or more years of in-school vocational training prior to the cooperative experience in specialty areas, and (2) the diversified occupations approach, in which much of the vocational training is done on the job, with little or no formal in-school instruction prior to cooperative experience. Other topics discussed include the following: world of work and career decision making; cooperative education and the special needs student; cooperative education in higher education; adult education (cooperative  distributive education for disadvantaged young adults, preretirement programs); cost-benefits; and concerns and problems of cooperative education. Summaries suggest that (1) instructional modes will vary according to expected objective, (2) the world of work involvement provides a sound base for aiding students in making realistic career decisions, (3) cooperative vocational education coordinators should have adequate skills and knowledges in dealing with special needs people to insure maximum success, (4) cooperative programs in adult education will be emerging at a greater rate as the lifelong learning concept is accepted by more adults, and (5) the benefits of cooperative education outweigh its cost.

The intent is to assist curriculum developers, administrators, and program planners in vocational, technical, and adult basic education in understanding issues in metrication, the metric system, and curriculum and instructional strategies as they begin the transition to the metric system of measurement. The basic parts of the metric system (linear measure, area, volume and capacity, mass, temperature, and metric notation) and the changes that  will need to be made in different occupations are discussed with illustrations provided where appropriate. Occupations discussed are grouped under the following cluster headings: agribusiness and natural resources, business and office, communication media, construction, environmental control, health occupations, home economics, hospitality and recreation, manufacturing, marketing and distribution, personal services, public services, and transportation. Appendixes include tables of metric unit prefixes and typing and keypunching style sheets for metric notation. (TA)",

Information and insights are given so that vocational administrators and supervisors can assess their efforts to provide equal opportunities for the handicapped to participate fully in all facets of vocational education including youth organizations, cooperative vocational education, vocational guidance services, and consumer education. Also, practical suggestions are included for effectively accommodating handicapped students through both regular and special instructional arrangements. Specific topics discussed include the following: rationale for the participation of the  handicapped in vocational education, barriers to participation, impact of legislation, identifying the handicapped, developing appropriate program alternatives for serving the handicapped, prevocational education, role of vocational education in comprehensive secondary programming for the academically handicapped, need for interagency cooperation, curriculum and instructional materials to assist in vocational training, personnel preparation, evaluation of students and programs, and professional organizations. The conclusion is made that emphasis of the future must be one of equal access and maximum accommodation. The appendix contains descriptions of information systems on the handicapped. (TA)",

It is noted that vocational educators are only now beginning to report in any volume on the subject of sex fairness and that there is little doctoral research in this area. The following topics and issues are discussed: sex fairness in vocational education as a warranted assumption, impact on careers of sex-role stereotyping and sex bias in vocational education, forces promoting sex fairness in vocational education (including socialization, instructional materials, vocational interest inventories, world of employment), and forces promoting the eradication of sex unfairness in vocational  education (including legislation). Recommendations are made to maximize reduction of sex unfairness in vocational education. These include the following: enforce appropriate laws, provide overt support, take affirmative action, provide new models for vocational aspirations, require inservice education for vocational educators, re-examine the principles of vocational education, and disseminate information.

Areas of emphasis identified for vocational education policy include the need for increased job satisfaction, opportunities for retraining, flexible programming to meet individual needs, accountability through evaluation, responsiveness to labor market supply and demand, coordination among various agencies and institutions, elimination of sex bias,  and availability of vocational education to minorities and the disadvantaged.

        "description":"This information analysis paper examines the Educational Amendments of 1976 projecting the effect of the amendments of vocational and technical education which may result and discussing immediate as well as long-range implications of the amendments. Organization of the paper is around areas of special legislative emphasis that will create the greatest change in vocational education: planning, data and information, evaluation, elimination of sex bias and sex stereotyping, special groups (disadvantaged, handicapped, English deficient), and program improvement (research and curriculum). Overall directives of the amendments are summarized and changes in internal operations of departments and programs of vocational education and changes that affect vocational education's relationships  with other agencies such as the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act and with the public are discussed. Noting that the law is a good one but that there are problems with how it is funded, the author concludes that planning, data and information, and evaluation systems will probably become more sophisticated and will involve and influence a much broader segment of society, that the thrust to eliminate sex bias and stereotyping will hopefully cause vocational education to become more open and accepting in both programs and staffing, and that research has a tremendous challenge in providing the understanding and knowledge needed to channel change.

It is hypothesized that for mental health workers to function at optimal levels of effectiveness both within an agency and in delivering service to clients within an agency context their own needs for recognition, support,and enjoyment must be attended to. The view of the comprehensive community mental health center (CCMHC) as an interdependent system where clientele, service staff, and administration are continually affecting and being affected by one another is presented. Social system, family interaction, and individual personality theory are briefly discussed so as to provide a framework and rationale for this view. The authors' experiences at two  mental health agencies illustrative of good and bad mental health practices with regard to staff serve to crystallize relevant issues. In conclusion, specific proposals to provide for the needs of mental health staff and the improvement of agency functioning are presented. (Author)",

These hypotheses were tested with observations of 1,147 aggressive acts of 157 children in nine preschool and kindergarten classrooms. All of the hypotheses received support  except the induction hypothesis and the verbal sex-role training hypothesis. (Author)",

Interrelationships between variables within the system and outside it can be examined, and appropriate interventions developed on this basis. The distribution of power (ability to influence the beliefs and behaviors of others in accordance with a wish or plan) within the system must also be considered. Communications systems are discussed; they have implications for the social worker's knowledge of his own role and the organization of his school or  agency.

Data from the 1970 U.S. census were used to determine the mean income of 27,067 white men aged 26-65 grouped by educational level and by Holland type of work and to determine the proportion of white and black men aged 36-65 falling within each of these educational and type-of-work groups. Enterprising work was found to provide higher incomes with less education than do other types of work. Although a large proportion of white men at all educational levels hold enterprising jobs, relatively few blacks were found in this type of work. Counselors and educators have  traditionally tried to reduce the income gap between blacks and whites by increasing college attendance among blacks. These findings suggest that counselors also can help black youth find better-paying jobs by providing them more access to enterprising work. Such programs might be especially helpful to black high school students who will not be attending college. (Author)",

The present study examined factors related to the prevalence and intensity of math anxiety in college students and the extent to which math anxiety is predictive of math course grades. The 655 subjects were obtained from two math courses and one psychology course at Ohio State University. Results indicated that math anxiety occurs frequently among college students, and that it is more likely to occur among women than among men and among students with inadequate high school math backgrounds. Higher levels of math anxiety were related to lower mathematics achievement test scores, higher levels of test anxiety and higher levels of trait anxiety. Students reporting  confidence in their ability to learn math and who perceived their parents and teachers as having positive attitudes toward math tended to report lower levels of math anxiety. Math anxiety was not a significant predictor of grades in math courses. However, it was the second strongest predictor (after ACT Math subtest scores) in one subject group and for females in the other subject group. (Author)",

        "description":"A large national sample of men and women college seniors were asked for their perceptions of five careers: medicine, law, college teaching and research, elementary and senior school teaching, and business. The responses of men and women seniors to 18 items repeated for each field showed that they held different images of these fields. The images are described and compared. The most striking findings are that women find school teaching more appealing and challenging than do men, in most respects, and that women seem to have a less favorable image of college teaching, law, and medicine--especially because law and medicine require spending time away from one's family. The implications of the results for individual decision making and the needs for better vocational information and  counseling are discussed. (Author)",

Retirement needs to be examined separately for men and women because of the great differences in their life cycles and work patterns. In some respects women are disadvantaged relative to men when the time comes for them to face mandatory retirement. A number of mechanisms, both formal and informal, operate to socialize them to retirement. Among them are pre-retirement counseling, compensations such as pensions or Social Security, and various rationales for retirement. (Author)",

Subjects' responses to questionnaire items were utilized to measure the predictive power of these three theories. Data is presented on adoptive and biological couples. Subjects were classified as primarily upper-middle class and were matched on a number of categories, including age, education, income and length of marriage. Adoptive subjects were significantly more conservative or traditional in their sex role ideologies than were biological parents; this was true for men as well as women. Of the three  theoretical approaches, only secondary reinforcement through parental nurturance was found to be significantly accurate in predicting sex role ideology for the women subjects. Women with traditional sex role ideologies usually reported that they maintained close ties with their parents and tended to report that their mothers had been somewhat disapproving of them as children.

Three large-scale studies were consistent in placing only children lower than firstborns from two-, three-, and four-child families, and at about the same level as firstborns from a five-child family. The explanations considered are conceptualized within the confluence model (Zajonc, 1975) which proposes that intelligence develops as a function of a combination of factors, including the child's age and experience within the family, and additionally suggests that sibling tutoring is beneficial to the intellectual development of the tutor. The author criticizes several aspects of the confluence model and states that the lack of research in  this area is a further obstacle to valid conclusions. She feels that sibling tutoring is nothing more than a convenient explanation motivated by the desire to improve the correlation between simulated and real data, with little external support. She argues that further research should be conducted to test the explanation. (PFS)",

These and other strategies are adopted in order to reduce interpersonal uncertainty apparent in initial encounters. The present paper reports on three preliminary studies which suggest that another's speech patterns afford us valuable information for formulating such proactive attributions. More specifically, the studies were concerned with the social significance of various forms of female taperecorded speech in Britain. It was found that people can stereotype women as androgynous and feminist. Among the latter are those more  committed than others, on the basis of accent and paralinguistic features of voice. Further avenues of research are suggested with regard to interpersonal communication with women which tests, and perhaps may extend, Berger &amp; Calabrese's theory. (Author/MFD)",

        "description":"Love which focuses on an emotional relationship involving some sense of commitment and either an ongoing sexual relationship or the potential for such a relationship is viewed and defined in a variety of ways. Despite the fact that the major portion of a treatise on love devotes itself to a consideration of tendance in love (i.e. aquisitive, benevolent, acquisitive-benevolent), this categorization of the primary beneficiary is of little value in understanding love. Love is best understood as a decision, rather than a feeling or behavior. Empirical research on the dimensions of love points to a large general factor of love dependent on a cognitive evaluation that one is understood, and a feeling of competency and involvement in understanding the other. Feeling seems dependent on  cognition rather than vice versa, and behavior, apart from verbalized behavior of acceptance, also plays a secondary role. A taxonomy shows in what way one definition of love differs from another. It becomes possible, therefore, to communicate these differences and to study their behavioral correlates. (Author/LEB)",

The study concludes, after considering several decades of applied research, that, when skill in word recognition is the outcome studied, code-oriented programs are more effective than language-oriented programs, especially with low socioeconomic groups and low achievers. However, when comprehension development is the  criterion, there is no clear advantage to either program. The report recommends that national reading policy include both systematic code-oriented instruction, particularly in the primary grades, and carefully defined language experience instruction, which builds on the child's own writing and dictation.

Interview data on the main and control samples were collected four times by telephone, at intervals of two to three months; control samples were interviewed concurrently with the second, third, and fourth phases of data collection. Among the many findings discussed were positive relationships between adoption of the programs and external contact (for example, access to university and percent  of IRA members) and between adoption and exposure to messages about reading programs.

In the first experiment, 162 undergraduates circled the misspelled words in a text as the experimenter read the passage aloud. In the second experiment, 165 undergraduates corrected misspellings as they read the same passage silently, and then completed a spelling test of the misspelled words and a three-question comprehension test. In both experiments, half the misspellings were phonologically consistent (&quot;brane&quot; for &quot;brain&quot;) and half were phonlogically inconsistent (&quot;brone&quot; for &quot;brain&quot;). Subjects in both experiments failed to detect significantly more phonologically consistent misspellings than phonologically inconsistent misspellings. The second experiment's  comprehension test, moreover, demonstrated that good performance in the proofreading task is not achieved at the expense of comprehension. The study concludes that reading is, in fact, mediated by a phonological recoding stage and that this stage takes precedence over other stages that are used to extract meaning from written language.

When no faculty enthusiasm or support for a reading program exists, the reading teacher  shares responsibility for program content with the students, using thematic units, learning centers with relaxed environments, self-paced individual activities, and small group activities that allow the reading teacher enough free time to work with students who need special attention.

The survey data indicate that members of all three groups believe that they comprehend more than their peers, that they enjoy reading more than their peers, and that they actually read more than their peers. Analysis of the surveyed reading habits shows that junior high school students in Tucson read more books but fewer magazines and newspapers than the other two groups, and that the adults relied more on reading materials as a news source than the other two groups.

The grammar describes the higher-order structures regulating the organization and retrieval of incoming story information. These structures, defined by a basic set of rewrite rules, specify the types of information which should occur in stories and the types of logical relations which should connect story components. Recall and reconstruction tasks were administered, based on sets of well-formed, slightly disordered, and randomly ordered stories and on unrelated statements. Results of the study indicated that higher-order story structures exerted a significant influence over the accuracy of story memory and  had a pronounced effect on the reorganization of stories not conforming to the story grammar. Implications of the deliberate use of these story structures in retaining incoming information were illustrated. (Author/AA)",

We need to view those actions as steps in, or reactions to, plans. This paper sketches some of the components of a model for the understanding of plans and social actions. The model is first applied to narrative text, wherein actions of characters need to be interpreted as social actions. The emphasis on social actions and plans leads to a distinction between &quot;story analysis&quot; and &quot;story model analysis&quot; (that is, analysis of a reader's model for the story). Next, the model is applied to texts in general, wherein the author's action of writing needs to be interpreted as an action performed to achieve a social goal.

A survey was made of the high school composition instruction experienced by the two groups; findings indicated that the amount of instruction in grammar and spelling did not differ significantly, but that students who wrote passing essays had received more instruction in developing and organizing essay content and had had more opportunity to write short expository essays than had students who wrote failing essays.

Over half of the 200 schools surveyed responded to the questionnaire concerning current teaching practices and facilities. Results indicate that magazine journalism is more widely taught than generally supposed: most schools have at least one course that concentrates on magazine writing or editing; one-fifth of the surveyed schools offer separate magazine, news magazine, or professional (freelance) writing sequences in their journalism curricula. In contrast to the expanded course offerings in magazine journalism education, nearly half of the responding schools indicated that they did not have any faculty members devoting more than one-third teaching time to magazine  courses. Additional data that are discussed include enrollment, facilities, texts, internships, &quot;joys and frustrations,&quot; and other aspects of magazine education. A sample questionnaire is attached.

In what directions do the media, and minorities working in the media, appear to be headed in the next decade? Three panels provide a framework for discussing those questions: the first panel discussed education, training, and employment of minority journalists; the second panel examined methods and trends in minority news coverage; and the third panel explored the professional expectations, experiences, and attitudes of black reporters and white  editors. The general concensus of the panel discussions was that &quot;the more things change, the more things stay the same&quot;; although more blacks and other minorities have been educated and employed in journalism, the frustrations and inequities that existed when the Kerner Report was first published exist today, ten years later.

Positive and negative attitudes were assessed immediately following the commercials, and again two weeks later.

While Kenyan dramas deal with a variety of themes, the majority are topical rather than universal in their treatment of issues. In many, the emphasis is on the supernatural and on the conflict between the old and new forms of religion. Although the positive influence of the British educational system is acknowledged, this study illustrates how the traditional and innate African forms of theatre have been stifled. The paper indicates a need for secondary schools to stress that Kenyan dramatic origins within the tribal context are equal in importance to the literary classics of the western world.  (MAI)",

Incorporating information gleaned from interviews with school administrators, as well as from the literature on CBE, the author describes the implementation process and problems associated with instituting competency based  education.

From interviews with school administrators, as well as from a review of the literature, the author has identified four major issues that are involved in making busing for desegregation work: (1) choosing an efficient and fair busing plan; (2) gaining community support by involving parents, students, and community members in decision making, by school administrators showing strong leadership and support for the plan, and by communicating effectively with the community; (3) making  sure the plan runs smoothly by handling discipline problems and violence even-handedly and equitably, and by orienting parents and students to changes brought about by busing; and (4) making necessary improvements in facilities, curriculum, and staff development.

Specific techniques and programs are presented for dealing with discipline problems when they do occur. Barriers described that block school personnel from making constructive changes needed in order to solve school discipline problems include unwritten rules; fear of change;  and lack of money, time, authority, and knowledge.

Development will also produce increased government revenues. Special taxes on coal production have been enacted in Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming in order to ensure that state and local governments receive sufficient revenues to finance the new services required. This study reports detailed estimates of the state and local taxes that would be paid by three different-sized coal mines and their employees in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The estimates were obtained by using the ENERGYTAX simulation model. While in all states the total revenue available appears sufficient to meet the increased demands for services attributable to the mines,  there are other considerations. When the analysis is done by type of government, state governments and, to a lesser extent, county governments appear to receive enough new revenues to meet their needs. The cities and, in some states, the school districts appear less well-off. State and local governments may also face a cash flow problem when mineral development occurs. (Author/IRT)",

Described are study procedures including collection of background data on each child through visits with the parents, observation of children's play behavior and intellectual performance in the laboratory, and administration of pediatric and psychophysiological tests. The rationale for using an auditory tape procedure for elicitation of responses is explained. Also discussed are preliminary results and some procedural considerations (such as the role of nursery schools in the project). Among findings reported are that it appears to be possible to select, by psychophysiological techniques at the  age of 3, children who behave differently at the age of 6 and who react differently to the intervening experience of attendance at a nursery school; and that the type of behavior exhibited by the children is not in discord with what might legitimately be expected on the basis of earlier high risk studies and data from work on adult patients. Also included are tables with statistical data, a list of references, and graphs illustrating study results. (SBH)",

Without directly observing the child, each mother telemetrically monitored her child's performance on a puzzle. Following an error, she selected the intensity of punishment to be delivered. However, the frequency of errors was electromechanically generated independent of the child's performance. Concurrently, mothers worked on another task unrelated to the child where the magnitude and ambiguity of response demands were manipulated. Maternal punitiveness was directly related to both the external response demands and the frequency of interruptions (the child's errors) which necessitated administering discipline. (Author)",

It is especially applicable to the relationships among varieties of a single language (or more properly, linguistic &quot;cline&quot;), which, as is generally known, are poorly described by the hierarchical mode of classification commonly used in comparative linguistics. But multidimensional scaling may also frequently be used to describe spatial variation which has persisted among distinct but related languages and which cannot be adequately described by an otherwise well-motivated hierarchical classification. These conclusions are illustrated by the application of multidimensional scaling to  lexicostatistical percentages within four linguistic groups, located in the Philippines, Africa, and North America.

        "description":"Recently several persons involved with language study in the U.S.S.R. have publicly voiced concerns on the value of summer programs for American students there. The proliferation of these programs in the last ten years calls for a reexamination of what students who study in the Soviet Union are expected to achieve. By examining the expectations of students and how they have developed versus the reality of study in the Soviet Union, and the intentions of faculty versus the actual achievements of students, two issues are brought into focus. Why should students be sent to the Soviet Union? What should be demanded of a program before it is recommended to students? At the present time there are clearly substantial differences of opinion between students who wish free time to  participate in their Russian experience and professors who place greater emphasis on academic excellence. Nonetheless, a synthesis of the opposing viewpoints may be found in recent innovative theories of &quot;communicative competence,&quot;&quot;lingvostranovedenie&quot; and &quot;culture.&quot; These concepts provide new justification for faculty support of overseas programs and offer new areas for the evaluation of student progress made in the U.S.S.R. At the same time, these concepts represent a framework within which can be placed those programs which consitute a balanced diet of academic pursuits and cultural interaction. (Author/CFM)",

As part of an initial step in planning new syllabi, the Curriculum Advisory Committee of the New York State Education Department identified the following needs: (1) more options in terms of language goals; (2) greater flexibility in methodology; (3) a cultural component; (4) better evaluation techniques; (5) practical suggestions for handling instructional materials; and (6) more student-centered and individualized instruction. A two-part syllabus is planned; the first part will be a general syllabus applicable to all language teachers and administrators, and the  second will be a supplement consisting of solutions to problems in specific languages. The general syllabus will have 7 chapters concerning: (1) philosophy; (2) motivational and promotional techniques; (3) the modern foreign language program; (4) goal-attainment strategies; (5) materials and equipment; (6) extending the classroom; and (7) professional growth. Chapter 3 will be the focal point and will describe the Committee's program, which involves a State Diploma Credit strand and a Local Credit Strand, both of which will allow schools to offer options for concentrating on one, several, or all of the four language skills. Data on foreign language enrollments in New York's public secondary schools in 1974-75 are included. (AM)",

The study is based on data collected from the speech of two children, from birth to age nine in the first case and from birth to five in the second. Analysis focussed on the identification of those social factors which the children considered in selecting the appropriate code to use in each instance. Even though their less dominant language (English) was slightly delayed in onset, appropriate code selection was clearly manifest toward the end of the second year in both cases. The factors which appeared to influence choice were, first of all, the interlocutors, secondly the setting, and next the function and form of the speech  act. Each of these areas was tempered by additional considerations as time went on. Surprisingly, however, the topic of conversation was not a factor causing either child to favor one or the other of their available codes. Through analysis of the data, it is possible to identify not only the temporal order in which each social factor became of importance, but also to specify a hierarchical order of importance of these factors.

CA in the United States was closely connected with structuralism, which was an obvious cause for later criticism. The culminating point came at the Georgetown Roundtable in 1968, after which American CA slowly died out. Interest was revived in Europe, however, particularly in Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Hungary. The main areas of CA which have caused criticism are the following: (1) relevance for language teaching; (2) structuralism and CA; (3) the turmoil in the theory of grammar; (4) the theory and methodology of CA; and  (5) the nature of the criticism. CA must be expanded beyond contrasting grammatical elements to contrasting elements of communicative competence. The communicative approach in language teaching necessarily leads to contrastive discourse analysis. CA will have to be expanded in the following areas: (1) linguistic research (in phonetics, syntax, semantics, lexicon, text); (2) psycholinguistic research; and (3) contrastive sociolinguistic studies.

        "description":"It has been claimed that error analysis (EA) has two broad aims and two levels of application: pedagogical (relevant to syllabus design and second language teaching) and psycholinguistic (relevant to language learning studies). At the moment, EA's pedagogical claims are stronger than its psycholinguistic ones. In its early days, EA defined its object of study as the native and the target language and the points of similarity between them. This was based on the notions of contrastive analysis and interference. From criticism of this approach grew the notion of interlanguage. This, too, is open to criticism. It is proposed that a new approach is needed toward the learner's knowledge and use of the target language, one which is neither purely psycholinguistic nor pedagogical, but  which incorporates a sociolinguistic element. The suggested approach describes the learner's language in terms of his or her \"linguistic repertoire,\" which includes the native language and the target language. (AM)",

An attempt is made to give a description of the factors which may explain the occurrence of glottalization and to outline the method by which the phenomenon will be approached in greater detail in the future. It is felt that the key to the difficulties connected with glottalization is the difference between the Finnish and English concept of the morphophonological word, or, more precisely, the different role assigned to glottalization in these languages. Three groups of 15- and 16-year-old Finnish students of various dialect backgrounds were tested for their pronunciation of Finnish and English. Irrespective of dialect,  glottalization was more evident in English than in Finnish. A second test was based on the pronunciation of test sentences by 24 ninth grade pupils from the Ostrobothnian dialect area. From these tests, it may be concluded that: (1) erroneous word-boundary signalling exists with pupils who do well in their language studies as well as those who do not; (2) some students retain features of interference from native language pronunciation even after long exposure to a foreign language; and (3) possibly a student's word-boundary signalling pattern can be attributed to teacher pronunciation.

Forty-eight children from grades 1,3,5, and 7, with language impairments for which there was no identifiable cause, were given a paraphrase production and a paraphrase recognition task. Their performance was compared to that of a matched group of children with normally developing language. The language-impaired children produced and recognized fewer correct paraphrases, and they relied on a strategy of lexical substitution for paraphrase production for a longer time. In addition, they produced more repetitions and  antonymic responses than the normally developing children, and some used a &quot;preservation of quantity&quot; strategy. An error analysis indicated that the paraphrase strategies of language-impaired children were qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from those of normally developing children. These strategies tend to hinder normal linguistic development. Further studies should involve a natural communication setting, as well as pragmatics and body language. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This study is a detailed analysis of the phonological development of Sylvia, a bilingual child, in her acquisition of American English and Brazilian Portuguese from the age of 1 year, 7 months to 3 years, 8 months. The study is divided into four stages: ages 1.7 - 1.9; 1.9 - 2.1; 2.1 - 2.3; and 2.3 - 2.8. Up to the age of 1.9, the same phonological substitutions applied to Sylvia's production of phonetically identical segments in both English and Portuguese. After the age of 1.9, phonological differentiation developed, and with it a distinct set of substitutions became associated with each language. Although this study involves only one child, it does suggest that child phonology can reveal significant things about the adult system. It also suggests that the two languages have  quite different trends for future change. Evidence for this can be found from dialect comparisons as well as from Sylvia's different treatment of the two languages. Perhaps a language's tendency toward a specific type of change is governed by a language specific speech posture and a specific set of phonological processes which is a natural consequence of such a posture.

The author examines statutory provisions affecting certification, contracts and tenure, conflict of interest, school records and reports, pupil protection and child abuse, duties and responsibilities of teachers, and self-discipline by the teaching profession. He examines case law concerning certification denial, suspension, and revocation; contract nonrenewal and termination; teacher suspension, transfer, and demotion; and salary loss, fines, and imprisonment. The major developments over the past five years  have been in the areas of state legislation and court decisions. (Author/IRT)",

First, what actually constitutes school climate, and, second, can research indicate in concrete, useful terms what impact school climate has on morale and productivity and, conversely, what effects leader behavior and other organizational factors have on school climate? The author describes Halpin and Croft's seminal research on organizational climate and the development of their Organizational Climate Description Questionnaire (OCDQ) and then reviews two other studies attempting to use the OCDQ as a measure of different aspects of school climate. The results were inconclusive, indicating that researchers have yet to develop a prescriptive measure of school climate.  The author also reviews sample pragmatic, administrator-generated approaches to climate improvement, pointing out that these approaches also fail to do anything but describe climate. (Author)",

The funding of an articulation program, the incentive for high school and college faculty to collaborate, the definition of responsibilities and roles, and the anticipated problems and their  resolution are covered. Chapter 3 deals with evaluation. It discusses the evaluation activities that must be built into a program to address the concerns of parents, students, and college officials.

The preliminary findings center on the principal's use of time, new problems in the relationship between principals and their staffs, the impact of administrative transfer for racial integration, and  results that challenge some myths about urban school systems, particularly in the areas of firing tenured teachers, &quot;pushing paper,&quot; and administrator isolation.

Now, community growth, changes in property values, and concern with self-governance have prompted interest in deregionalization. This is the study of a constituent community's desire to withdraw from a regional district. The study has four purposes--to assess the comparative distribution of educational resources among the three high schools in the regional district; to determine the relationship between the present status of educational resources and a desirable level indicated by the needs of the students of the study district; to examine the extent to which the present methods of governance have been sensitive to the study district's needs; and to assess current cost and the  projected cost level under the proposed deregionalization plan to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of withdrawing from the regional district. Findings indicate that the community's high school is receiving less than an equitable share of resources; that district governance and community noncooperation will not allow this situation to be rectified; and that deregionalized school operation need not necessitate additional costs.

Chapter 1, which makes up most of the study, consists of separate case studies of eight educational jurisdictions that encompass a major proportion of the Francophone student population of Ontario. These case studies involve examination of the costs to a school board of maintaining the present programming level and the costs incurred where a board offers paraprofessional and consultant resources. Chapter 2 examines the availability and cost of textbooks, library books, and learning materials. Chapter 3 discusses specialized services that should be available to French-language schools and  the services provided by the Regional Office. Among the study's major findings are 1) the most direct influence on the additional cost per Francophone student seems to be the Francophone/Anglophone ratio within each jurisdiction; 2) to provide adequate service within totally Francophone jurisdictions, a minimum of $78 extra per elementary student and $180 extra per secondary student is needed; and 3) to provide &quot;ideal&quot; service, the minimum amounts of $78 and $180 per student should be increased according to the specific Francophone/Anglophone ratio of each jurisdiction.

The data analyses revealed significant relationships between superintendents and principal organizational behavior perceptions and the amount of elementary principal role conflict and ambiguity. An additional finding was that there is a negative relationship between open  organizational behavior and the level of administrative position. The findings also support the research of behavioral scientists in recommending a higher level of participatory management in order to overcome the reduction of perceived autonomy in lower levels of management.

For example, schools maintain interacting spheres of influence with a range of decisions outside the control of administrators. In fact, teachers often use administrators as pawns, controlling events from their own positions in the hierarchy. (Author)",

The purpose of the study was to survey small school administrators' interest in leadership training through inservice education; to explore the areas of such interest; and to determine the preferences for type, location, and duration of such training. A 71-item questionnaire dealt with three major categories of administrator competence--curriculum and instruction, personnel, and operations. Demographic data collected included the administrator's title, level of administration, rural-urban setting of the school district, major type of economic support in the community, and the community ethnic breakdown. Thirty percent or more of the respondents indicated a strong interest in  over one-fourth of the items on the list. Almost three-fourths of the administrators were favorable to attending a workshop on topics of interest. About 35 percent desired some type of graduate credit for such a workshop, and most were willing to travel up to 100 miles to take part. (MLF)",

The means of control available to principals and teachers are analyzed and the consequences of strategies of control are considered as they interact with strategies for academic education. Order and academic education as goals often require mutually contradictory actions supported by different organizational structures. The need for opposing practices to meet these two basic goals is greatest when incoming students are skeptical or challenging of the usefulness of the school's academic goals or of its good faith in pursuing them. The character of four junior high schools in two school districts is analyzed to illustrate the interaction of these factors. (Author/MLF)",

        "author":["White, Lydia"],
        "description":"In early transformational generative grammar, it was assumed that all semantic interpretation would be done off deep structure, but with the proposals for the extended standard theory (EST) of Chomsky (1968, 1972) came the realization that certain aspects of semantic interpretation, such as focus and presuppostion and scope of quantifiers, must be done off surface structure. More recent developments suggest that EST did not go far enough. Given trace theory and certain other assumptions, it appears that all semantic interpretation can be done off surface structure, including case relations, for which deep structure is usually considered necessary. This article looks at semantic interpretation as it is considered in Jackendoff's \"Semantic Interpretation in Generative Grammar\"  (1972) and shows how certain problems and inconsistencies of interpretation that arise in the case of adverbs, co-reference, scope of modal operators and thematic relations can be resolved if all interpretation is done off surface structure. The article also discusses how this might be achieved. (Author/CLK)",

The instructor points to a box on the grid thus formed and calls upon a student to make the correct question for that character. For example, &quot;next Sunday - Mr. Redford&quot; would yield: &quot;What is Mr. Redford planning to do next Sunday?&quot; The box contains the answer cue &quot;tennis&quot; or sometimes just a question mark, which would yield &quot;I don't know what he's planning to do.&quot; Students have  a copy of the chart; they also keep a notebook with sample questions and answers for home study. Additional lines are added to the chart weekly as new structures are covered. The students are always responsible for the cumulative total. (Author/CFM)",

Interlanguage may be defined as a separate linguistic system which results from a learner's attempted production of a target language norm. According to the recreation hypothesis, this is a dynamic system of increasing complexity, whereas, according to the restructuring hypothesis, it is essentially the same in overall complexity over time. Interlanguage studies have concentrated on: (1) the dependence of the native language upon the acquisition of a target language; (2) the acquisition of the target language in developmental sequences; and (3) the types of strategies involved in language learning and language production. There exists a parallel between interlanguage and pidgins and creoles, in that  their characteristics depend on function within a social setting. Other factors that should be taken into account in interlanguage analysis studies include age, personality, language attitudes, and situational, interactional, and cultural variables. (AM)",

The study focused on the prosodic and paralinguistic features of adult speech to the young child. Adult speech directed to children was compared to other kinds of systematic speech adjustments adults make in response to differing social situations. Speech samples of 24 mothers addressing their children were analyzed. The mean age of one half of the group of 24 children was two years, three months; the mean age of the other half was five years, four months. The adult speaker made a systematic adjustment in the prosodic and paralinguistic aspects of speech addressed to the young child, and these adjustments varied in  relation to the age of the child listener. It is suggested that various features of the baby talk register can serve at least two functions, analytic and social. (Author/SW)",

The purpose is to examine the frequency and type of nonverbal cues accompanying verbalizations directed to the young child and to observe how these cues vary with the response of the child as well as with his or her linguistic sophistication. The paper is part of a larger study designed to specify the informational sources, clues to meaning, available to the child as he proceeds to learn language. The data examined in this paper are based on videotaped recordings of nine mother-child dyads. Three of the children were one-year-olds, three were two-year-olds, and three were three-year-olds. The gestures concomitant with one type of  illocutionary act, the request for action, are focused on. The frequency and explicitness of the mother's concomitant gestures varied with the age and responsiveness of the child. It can be concluded from the study that the adult adopts certain nonverbal strategies, such as modeling and pointing, as an adjustment to the child's limited understanding of the meaning being conveyed in the utterances.

The relevant theoretical questions are: (1) Are all the child's productions mediated by his current phonological system? (2) What is the role of the adult model in phonological acquisition? The spontaneous and repeated utterances of four children were examined, and it was found that there were differences between the spontaneous and echoic forms produced. The child's productions immediately following those of the adult did not necessarily approach the model more closely than did spontaneous productions. In  certain cases a \"trade-off\" occurred, i.e., a sound segment in an echoic form more closely approached the model while another sound segment fell short of the target. This suggests that echoic and other repeated forms are not \"phonologically progressive,\" as had been proposed. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"Evidence exists that, in the past, phonetic variants functioned as sociolinguistic variables, just as they do today, at least in societies with comparable stratificational patterns. This paper presents the significant details of the sociolinguistic environment within which the beginnings of the Great English Vowel Shift were embedded. An attempt is made to demonstrate how an understanding of the sociolinguistic situation surrounding historic changes leads to an understanding of the transition from earlier to later pronunciations. It is demonstrated that: (1) contemporaneous changes in the social and linguistic profiles of England during the 14th century led to a situation in which two regional dialects were juxtaposed and realigned as social dialects; and (2) the different  phonological histories of the convergent dialects provided the raw material for sociolinguistic variation at that particular time, when older sociolinguistic barriers were disintegrating in England. It is hypothesized that the type of cross-dialectal phonological restructuring that has been observed in contemporary settings would have led to the initial phase of the Great Vowel Shift as a matter of course, given the phonetic variation and socio-dialectal alignment pattern that have been reconstructed for Early Fifteenth Century London English.

The program represented approximately one semester of introductory French instruction. The subjects consisted of two classes of grade ten French students who used different texts during regular class hours, and who were bused to the University during regular French periods for one and a half hours of CAI twice weekly for a period of 10 weeks. Results of achievement comparison tests between CAI and control groups indicate that the CAI students did  not suffer in terms of prescribed school curriculum even though they spent up to 30 hours less time in its use than regular groups. A questionnaire designed to measure attitudes toward FRAND was administered to the students when they had completed the final achievement test. Attitudes in both experimental groups were very positive. Advantages of CAI include the individualized nature of the instruction, the immediate feedback given to each student, and the necessity of mastery of given material before advancement to new material.

(4) The kind of education desired is related to adult life stages. (5) Education for adults must have high credibility. (6) Women are  closing the educational gap between men and women, but there is some evidence that today's voluntary and largely self-supporting adult education is widening the gap between Caucasians and ethnic minorities and between the \"haves\" and \"have nots.\" (7) There is a high correspondence between the \"needs\" identified in assessment studies and the component responses offered by nontraditional programs. (8) There is a great variety in the nontraditional programs studied, making it difficult to group programs into typologies. (9) The trend is toward different forms of education and services for nontraditional learners as opposed to an expansion of traditional education to include adult learners. (Author/LBH)",

A set of six attributes of an educational outcome was established, and five related factors were identified. In addition, three dimensions (continuum along which outcomes can be placed and related to each other) were on a small scale, and may have a number of uses throughout postsecondary education.

The primary goal of the regional centers in Rochester, the Iron Range, and Wadena is to meet regional needs more efficiently and effectively through increased cooperation among area institutions and coordination of programs and planning. Generally, the students are adults for whom access to four-year institutions is difficult because of job and family responsibilities. The centers do not offer degrees, but through the use of joint schedules, joint advising services, and other means, students may select courses and earn deqrees from participating institutions that bring their  resources (faculty, courses, etc.) to the project area.

Two-thirds of the programs have been in operation less than five years, and in 71 cases, responsibility was with the personnel office. Formats included one-to-one counseling, group sessions, lectures, and discussions. Program topics included the institution's retirement benefits, other financial matters, health care, legal affairs, housing, and leisure time.

The data base used was drawn from the base-year and the first and second followup data of the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. The extent of transfer in terms of percentages and estimated numbers of various transfer groups is discussed and the differences in transfer rates among subgroups are described (e.g., groups defined by sex, race, and levels of ability and educational aspiration). The differences between transfers and nontransfers in four-year and two-year institutions are examined and include comparisons between transfers and persisters, and between  tranfers and withdrawals. Vertical transfers (e.g., students who moved from two-year to four-year colleges) are compared with four-year native students on background variables, financial aid status, satisfaction with college education, and academic performance. Tabulations of students' self-reported reasons for changing schools are presented separately by type of transfer and type of college. Three hypotheses are related to reasons for transferring; these center on the issue of an incongruency between the student and the institution. The major findings and implications are summarized.

It looks at the use of mass media in the formation and propagation of national ideologies and campaigns, and analyzes the support given to development communication and the creation of national communication policy by supranational agencies. The conclusion raises several questions. How and when will rulers allow more freedom of expression and who will decide when is the right time? To what extent are the media promoting campaigns and officials rather than the development  programs themselves? Are supranational organizations such as UNESCO allowing themselves to be victims of blackmail from Third World governments? These and other questions must be answered soon if a large part of the world is to be saved from the Orwellian big brother syndrome which some critics are predicting. (VT)",

The mental health category includes books about retardation, severe depression, alcohol and drug abuse, suicide, dealing with feelings and problems, withdrawal, and mental illness. Family life is restricted to books on such contemporary issues as broken homes, working parents, aging, death, and social problems. Each book received favorable reviews in at least two review journals. Titles are organized by grade groups: (1) preschool and beginning readers--preschool through second grade; (2) middle grades--third through sixth grades; and (3) young  adults--seventh grade and up. Books for a wide range of age groups are included in the lowest appropriate grade group. (Author/KP)",

Phase I involved development of an interview schedule and evaluation instruments, and visitation of the seven selected sites, to investigate the factors contributing to program success or failure. Interview questions were formulated to obtain information in 16 areas, including community characteristics, library cooperation, planning, financial data, collection development, library operation and programming, site characteristics, and staffing. Evaluation criteria developed by the research team determined two of the selected sites to be successful,  four unsuccessful, and one (not yet completed) successful in planning efforts. Within the 16 interview areas, findings were reported in terms of success and failures for comparison purposes. The two major conclusions were (1) it is unlikely that a community able to support separate school and public libraries would provide better service through a combined program, and (2) the combined program does present a possible alternative for communities with limited or non-existent library services.

The essential aspects of the student's behavior are analyzed with respect to a set of \"issues,\" which are addressed to the basic conceptual constraints that might prevent the student's full utilization of the environment. Issues are viewed as procedural specialists that \"wake-up\" or become active when an instance of an issue manifests itself in a move. These issue specialists help the Tutor  isolate what to comment on. The intent of the system is to transform a \"fun\" game into a productive learning environment without altering the student's enjoyment. (Author)",

The second chapter examines the organization's efforts to reduce the time and cost while improving the effectiveness of various management functions by using the PLATO IV CBE system. The last chapter surveys the process of lesson revision and development in order to determine its effects on the lessons and the pedagogical impact of the CBE  materials.

While the major emphasis in this paper is on text transmission, some discussion of other display functions is included. Chapters provide (1) a description of the PLATO IV architecture and communications system; (2) a review of two projects involving processor based terminals; (3) an explanation of how text is currently transmitted, followed by an analysis of the average number of bits/character obtained by this method; (4) an introduction to the theoretical  background for variable length or Huffman coding; (5) projected savings and overhead involved in the use of word lists to reduce the average number of bits/character used to represent text; and (6) conclusions, suggestions for future research, and discussions of projects involving text compression and other methods of improving display speed.

The purposes of the study were (1) to demonstrate the potential of computer-based scanning of CBE programs as a means for extracting information about the programming techniques used; (2) to suggest the use of computer-scanning techniques to aid the management of CBE development efforts; and (3) to provide additional information about the products of CBE lesson development projects conducted under ARPA sponsorship. The lesson characteristics selected for examination were chosen on the basis of: (1) the ease and reliability of their measurement and (2)  their importance in CBE. Most data are reported on a site-by-site basis. (Author/DAG)",

The 25 undergraduates who participated had also participated in a previous investigation by Chiang and Atkinson. A battery of traditional ability tests and several film tests were administered to all students. One of the film tests was designed to produce backward masking effect in short term visual memory. Factor scores were computed separately for ability tests and the short term visual memory test; these scores and other raw variables were then correlated with the slope, intercept, and digit span parameters from the Chiang and Atkinson study. In general, the correlations between parameters and ability variables were  low, and the regression of parameters on ability variables yielded larger R's than the regressions of abilities on the parameters. The short term visual memory film test did not correlate more substantially with the processing parameters than it did with the ability factors. The overall pattern of correlation was interpreted in terms of an information processing model in which general ability is viewed as the executive function that selects, creates, and implements programs that process and store information.

A single cable television system in Marin County, California was chosen as a focus for these observations. Literature review and personal interview are the primary techniques of this analysis. The national regulatory background to and educational experience with the cable television medium are documented. A history of cable television in Marin County is constructed; and the experience of Marin educators with television generally and cable television specifically are recorded. The major findings indicate that there will not be much use of cable television by Marin educators in the near future. The level of  interest in the subject among educators is not great, even though Marin County would appear to be hospitable to the educational use of cable. (Author)",

Providing health care for students is said to be generally overlooked by community college professionals who feel it should not be the college's responsibility. A lack of both medical treatment facilities and mental health programs on community college campuses is identified. However, data are presented indicating that because community college students frequently have low socioeconomic status, they cannot afford independent health insurance coverage, and further, that community facilities such as emergency rooms, free clinics, and referral services on which these students rely when  they have health problems are inadequate in caring for them. Some innovative programs and practices of health planners on campus are described: cutting health costs by identifying the precursors of disease; adopting self-completed student health appraisal forms as a substitute for traditional physical examinations, generating comprehensive health assessments for students through computer analysis; promoting the &quot;wellness&quot; idea via campus health fairs; and developing and managing health programs with student participation. Suggestions for implementing comprehensive health care programs are offered. (TR)",

Part Three reports the results of instructor, student, and administrator surveys regarding program quality. The results indicate  that students, teachers, and administrators are generally satisfied with the community services program and their role within it, but that the program tends to serve those who are already veterans in the educational system, and people with lower levels of educational attainment, lower family incomes, or who are senior citizens are not participating proportionately to their numbers in the district population.

The sample contained approximately 45% males and 55% females, the direct opposite of the distribution for active students. Over 43% of sample students planned to attend SAC for three or more semesters, reflecting that they are &quot;serious students&quot;, the majority aspiring for higher degrees.

Participants answered questions on present activities, satisfaction with the college they attended, employment relationship to college program, salaries, jobs, and preparation for further education. Over 54% of respondents were working full-time; three-fourths of these were working in areas related to their college program. Better than eight out of ten employed respondents felt they had been well prepared for their current occupation. Full-time employment salaries varied significantly  by sex; 40% of males as compared to 17% of females earned at least $900 a month. Of health occupation graduates, 98% were working in related jobs, while only 38% of technical program graduates were working in related jobs. Program completion appeared to be an important variable in obtaining related employment. Of early leavers, 67% were lower division collegiate majors, most of whom transferred; early leavers were twice as likely as graduates to be full-time students.

Seventy John Wood Community College students, selected at random from among those pre-enrolled for the winter 1978 term, completed the twenty-item McCroskey Personal Report of Communication Apprehension--College instrument. Results showed that there was a significant difference in communication apprehension experienced by community college as opposed to four-year college students; the survey population exhibited higher levels of communication reticence when compared with national norms. The question of why  community college students experienced more apprehension requires additional investigation. However, in light of studies indicating that the apprehensive student is less likely to participate in classroom discussion or receive high grades in classes requiring such interaction, the higher-than-average reticence scores also suggest that communication apprehension measures may be a successful predictor of academic success among community college students.

        "description":"This study compared three ways of analyzing individual mother-infant attachment behaviors in order to test the hypothesis that success in the search for stable individual differences in attachment behavior is in part a function of the level at which behavior individuality is assessed. Fifty infants were videotaped in the Ainsworth and Wittig Strange Situation at 12 and 18 months of age. Three different assessments of individual differences were employed: (1) time samples of discrete behaviors directed toward adults (look, glance, vocalize, etc.); (2) rating of categories of behavior directed toward adults (proximity seeking, contact maintaining, crying, etc.); and (3) a classification scheme based on profiles which combine several of the rated behavior categories. Results  indicated that evidence for the stability of individual differences was a function of the level of analysis. The reliability of discrete behavior variables was typically very low, and there was little evidence of temporal stability. There was clear evidence for stable individual differences in the analysis of behavior category data. Classification data based largely on reunion behavior and crying were even more stable across the six month interval. These classifications have a variety of theoretically significant correlates in non-Strange Situation behavior from early infancy into the third year of life. (Author/SB)",

In this program, children actively follow along with the TV show using multi-colored Picturepages booklets distributed to their homes weekly in advance of the broadcast. In the Home-Based Study, a single-page survey questionnaire was used to examined program effects on children's learning readiness attitudes and on learning-related parent-child interactions. Of the 50,000 questionnaires distributed on a statewide basis 1,067 were returned. The Center-Based Study collected data over a 20-week period for 110 children enrolled in 7 preschools. Subjects were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups and were pre- and post-tested  on a variety of instruments. Findings of the Home-Based Study indicated that the Picturepages Program was popular with both children and parents and was perceived by parents as educationally worthwhile for their children and helpful in increasing their own ability to teach their children. Results from the Center-Based Study indicated no evidence of significant program effects. The approximately 250 pages of appendices contain the complete content analysis of Picturepages, copies of the Picturepages Test Battery and other principal evaluative instruments, report forms, and communications utilized in evaluation of the Kentucky Picturepages Program.

The Piagetian rationale for the use of games is examined and three benefits of gaming are identified: (1) games are related to intellectual, socio-emotional, and motor learning in young children, (2) gaming requires aspects of assimilation and accommodation, and (3) a child's responses to gaming reflect the mental level at which that child is operating. The behavorist rationale for using games with young children is then examined and two beneficial aspects are identified: (1) games motivate the establishment of cause-effect relationships that can be used in the process of problem solving and (2) games foster the acquisition of specific knowledge about the color,  shape, and texture of objects in the environment. The conception of an adequate gaming strategy from a motivational theorist's point of view is then presented. According to this conception, a game's major objective should be to stimulate children to continue to engage in problem solving behavior that grows out of the questions posed during the game. Sample Piagetian and behavorist games are included. (JMB)",

Three key property tax series provide the core data for much of this analysis. Impetus for this study is explained in terms of secular change--relative decline of the agricultural sector; declining role of the property tax; growth of local nonproperty taxes; increased exemption of personal property; increased  relief to homeowners; increased use of differential assessment; changes in educational finance. Presented via narrative and tabular data, the analysis deals with: property tax incidence (traditional view, current view, and implications); agricultural-nonagricultural comparisons (income and wealth basis); and internal agricultural sector changes (number of farms, taxable farmland, farm population, value of farmland and buildings, real estate as an input, and farm income). The analysis concludes that the longrun horizontal tax/income ratio inequity of the property tax borne by the agricultural sector is likely to continue. (JC)",

Both models were evaluated with data from a matched sample of public school bilingual Mexican American children from grades 1-8, in a medium sized South-Central Texas community. The control group students, identified as low achievers, were participants in a compensatory educational program which consisted of a modified behavioral modification schedule and strategy designed to stimulate academic achievement through: the usual token economy reward structure; the use of bilingual tutors and various cultural activities designed to strengthen the self-concept of the Mexican American child; an effort to enlist the family's interest and  cooperation in the educational process. These students were matched by age, grade, sex and social class with other Mexican American students not identified as poor achievers. Students in both groups were surveyed and tested in the fall and spring with the Metropolitan Achievement Test, the Piers-Harris Self-concept Scale, and measures of internal/external social power. Teacher's evaluative ratings were obtained and parents were interviewed in both time periods. After one year, experimental subjects had significantly higher reading and math scores and improved self-concepts. Regression analysis indicated higher achievement scores were due to self-concept gains, a result of the interaction of positive family and school expectations. (Author/NQ)",

The following main elements in the agricultural extension model are identified: a critical mass of new technology; a research sub-system oriented to utilization; a high degree of user control over the research utilization process; structural linkages among the research utilization systems's components; a high degree of client contact by the linking sub-sytem; a &quot;spannable&quot; social distance across each  interface between components in the system; evolution as a complete system; and a high degree of control by the system over its environment. The analysis of model application to seven different cases (Social and Rehabilitation Service, Office of Education, National Diffusion Network Program, family planning, developing nations, and diffusion of technology among private manufacturing firms) indicates: little success with SRS application due to the neglect of certain elements of the model; more OE and SRS success; little success when transferred to agricultural applications in developing nations; greatest success with adaptation to the family planning context; and little success in industry applications of the model.

The Committee observed conditions on the Fort Berthold, Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, Lower Brule, Crow Creek, Winnebago, Yankton, Santee, Rosebud, and Pine Ridge Indian Reservations. Service unit facilities and staff were visited at Turtle Mountain, Eagle Butte, Winnebago, Yankton, Rosebud, Pine Ridge, and Rapid City. Observations were made on the following specific facets of the environmental health programs reviewed by the Committee:  accident control, solid and liquid waste disposal, water supply, institutional environmental health, sanitations at celebrations, zoonoses control (vector and vermin), housing and premises sanitation, epidemiology, and environmental health personnel. Among the recommendations were that: the staff be expanded; closer coordination between the Indian Health Service environmental health programs and state and Federal agencies having related concerns should be given priority attention; current efforts to encourage the development of appropriate sanitary codes and regulations and effective enforcement procedures by the tribal councils be continued.

A study was designed in July 1961, involving questionnaires and interviews, to obtain information on non-applicants for these programs and to compare applicant-rejectees and applicant-attendees. Data were obtained concerning biographical information; professional activities, needs, attitudes, and motivations; training and education; and relevant school and community characteristics. This preliminary report was written when 1,684 questionnaires and 606 interviews (half of the expected totals) were received. The preliminary questionnaire and interview results are summarized, a  description of the non-applicant population is given, and experimental and analytical procedures are described. An appendix presents the classification system used to analyze the interview summaries. (Author/BB)",

These students and nearly 700 non-UICSM algebra students were given Cooperative Algebra Test (Coop Algebra) Forms T, X, and Y. Analysis of covariance was used to compare group means on this test, with adjustments for inequalities between groups on the Differential Aptitude Tests of Numerical Reasoning and of Verbal Ability. The UICSM students showed greater achievement than did the non-UICSM students. This was also true of four of the six UICSM groups taken separately. The adjusted Coop Algebra means of the other two UICSM groups were not  significantly different from that of the control sample. Possible reasons for these results are discussed. (Author/BB)",

The tests were sent to 105 teachers from 70 schools in 19 states using this University of Illinois Committee on School Mathematics (UICSM) text. Teachers were asked to evaluate the suitability of each test question for their students. A factorial-analytic method was used to compute the intercorrelations among the pre-test scores, post-test scores, gain in test scores, and teacher rating for each of the 54 test questions. No particular relationships were found between mean values of the teacher  ratings and the student performance on either pre-test items or post-test items, even when the mean values for Pekin teachers only were considered. A weakly positive relationship was found between mean values of the teacher ratings and the student gains. (Author/BB)",

Teachers were asked certain demographic questions and if they had used certain National Science Foundation (NSF) curricula for each semester between 1970 and 1974. They were also asked to rate their level of usage of the curricula. Possible urban-rural differences, cross-year differences, and junior-senior high differences for secondary curricula were investigated. Use of NSF curricula was about 40% for elementary and 68% for secondary curricula. The PSP group tended to use the NSF  curricula longer than the control sample. (Author/BB)",

In the study, 115 teachers responded to the scale six times, once each for the six content areas listed above. The results were compared among the six  curricular areas to determine a composite teacher perception of which area was most effective in meeting the objectives of social education. Social studies objectives seemed representative of general education objectives. Objectives for individual curriculum areas did not seem to change from elementary to secondary grades. The strongest relationship existed between science and mathematics objectives. Social studies was ranked among the top third of most useful curriculum areas. (Author/AV)",

In this study, 180 college students were given questionnaires containing short descriptions of interactions between an adult and an adolescent boy. These questionnaires were designed to examine the effects of two role sets (female-male and employer-parent), two types of action (task-oriented or expressing emotion) and several concrete situations on three dependent variables: (a) predicted behavior for the adult in each hypothetical situation, (b) selection of most relevant attributes of the adult's personality, and (c) ratings of the adults on several personality attributes. Adults were depicted as employers or parents of the boy, and their actions were  either task-oriented or expressively affective. Students were asked to predict the adults' behavior in certain situations, and to identify personal characteristics of the adults in situations where their behavior was already described. Characteristics included terms such as \"businesslike\" and \"loyal and supportive.\" Results showed that predictions of behavior are strongly influenced by the parent-employer role set, but not by the sex of the hypothetical adult. Personality ratings are determined primarily by actions, not by role. (Author/AV)",

The aim of the program is participation by ethnic minorities in the development of psychology, both as a practicing art and as a science. The APA received a training grant to provide fellowship stipends to ethnic minority students eligible for or attending graduate programs leading to a Ph.D. in psychology. From 1974 through 1977, stipend awards were made to 115 students from 44 institutions. In most cases, student support was cost-shared by the institution. Evidence suggests that even though minority admission is increasing, there continues to be a need to modify existing standards for optimal success of the program. Special  student recruitment efforts must be considered; modified interpretation or exclusion of GRE scores for other predictive information is desirable; a support system consisting of a critical mass of ethnic minority students and faculty members is needed; and there must be a modification of the curriculum so as to include other perspectives and assumptions. The document lists the names of the Fellows, their institutions, and their career goals. An appendix contains the program's policies and application procedures. (Author/JK)",

The document is presented in five chapters. Chapter I presents a historical review of civic education from colonial days to the present. Chapter II identifies factors hindering reform of civic education in public schools, including alienation, lack of interest and discipline, negative effects of television viewing, and deficiencies in civic education programs. Chapter III examines the values base of citizenship education and suggests that educators devise programs which stress moral education without identifying with a specific religious doctrine. Chapter IV describes K-12 and community  programs which stress one aspect of citizenship education. Examples include programs in economic, legal, political, multiethnic, and family relations areas. The final chapter explores future directions of citizenship education and offers suggestions for improvement.

In general, administration is centralized at the state level. Each state issues its own course of study, conducts secondary level examinations, revises curriculum, and approves textbooks. Building and equipment maintenance takes place at the local level. Federal government, states, and local units all participate in school finance. The educational system consists of preschool, a common four-year primary school, and a secondary level with three tracks including both general academic and vocational programs. Course requirements, evaluation programs, and graduation requirements of these programs are discussed at length. Schools for the handicapped and private  schools are described, also. All teacher education occurs in institutions of higher education except that of kindergarten and vocational teachers. There are four types of higher education institutions: universities, colleges of education, colleges of the arts or sports, and specialized higher institutions, formerly higher technical schools. The pamphlet concludes with a glossary of German educational terms and a selected reading list. (AV)",

Part of national information gathering project related to educational achievement in various learning areas, the report is presented in three chapters. Chapter I examines instruments used to measure recognition of the elements of art, knowledge of art history, and knowledge of criteria for making aesthetic judgments. Comparative results for students in the three age groups are presented. Chapter II offers a comprehensive picture of overall average national performance and reveals results for different subgroups within the national population. Chapter III summarizes assessment results and discusses implications of the results for art  educators, parents, and interested members of the community. Findings indicated that students encountered more difficulty with factual questions than with judgmental questions; possessed high interest in and involvement with Western art, even when their knowledge level was not particularly high; and knew more about art when they participated in many types of art activities. Areas identified as worthy of further consideration by art educators centered on curriculum emphasis, student attitudes, and student performance. Appendices include background questions posed to principals of all schools participating in the survey, tables of data, and definitions of National Assessment reporting groups.

A major objective of the course is to develop student ability to recognize, compare, and analyze style, form, and expressive content as a means of achieving greater insight into the meanings of 20th century art and architecture. The suggested course is divided into three parts: chronological overview; comparative analysis of movements, styles, and techniques; and independent student research. Three major sections of the guide present sample teaching units based on concepts in each of the three course areas. Each unit identifies its basic concept, a learning objective, instructional suggestions, assessment measures, bibliographic resources, and an activity to correlate the unit with the overall program of instruction. The guide can serve as the basis for a mini-course, a one-semester course, or a year's course. It can also be used in developing instructional objectives pertaining to art history which are included in most studio art courses. A briefly annotated bibliography cites 90 teacher and student resources. Appendices present a sample chronological overview of 20th century art and architects in chart form; and short descriptions of specific movements and styles in 20th century art and architecture.

Teaching techniques emphasize class discussions, demonstrations, studio experiments, and research. There are three parts to the course: a chronological overview of major styles and periods of world art; study of the \"language of vision\" through systematic analysis of recurring themes and comparison of styles and structures; and individual student research on a particular style, artist, art form, or period. Field trips,  guest lectures, and print and audiovisual resources are suggested to supplement the unit activities. The guide contains sample units based on concepts in each of the three course categories. Each unit identifies the basic concept, a learning objective, instructional suggestions, assessment measures, bibliographic resources, and an activity to correlate the unit with the overall program.

The bibliography is divided into 12 content categories. These include earnings of women workers, occupations of women workers (professional, clerical, blue collar, and service), unemployment among women, unionism, attitudes of and toward working women, and home production and child care. Most of the entries were published in the 1960s or 1970s. Information is given on author, title, source or publisher, date, and length. The second part of the document describes findings of theoretical and empirical research studies about sex  differences in earnings and occupations. Occupational differentiation appears to be an important source of the male/female earnings disparity. However, it is not clear to what extent the differentiation is produced by labor market discrimination or by sex role discrimination in the home and schools.

The aims of the study were to examine what MACOS students seemed to learn, what they retained, and how what was learned was different from what they might have learned in other social studies courses. Data were collected from 15 school districts in 11 states. The sample consisted of 57 fifth and sixth grade social studies classes which were exposed to MACOS and 51 comparison classes which were exposed to other social studies curricula. Classes in both groups were predominantly white, non-low income, and taught by teachers with similar amounts of teaching experience. All classes  were given pre- and posttests intended to measure achievement and attitude variables, such as interpretation of ethnographic data, interest in problem solving, and reaction to unusual beliefs and customs. Findings indicated that all students tended to learn most about the content of whatever curriculum they were studying and that MACOS classes did not differ significantly in attitudes toward the cultures they had studied. It was concluded that MACOS was interesting to a large number and variety of students and teachers, more effective with sixth grade students than with fifth grade students, and generally equal to other social studies courses in developing inquiry skills and interest in open-ended problems.

Classes selected for the study exhibited similar racial and socioeconomic characteristics, and were taught by persons with similar teaching experience. The study used pre- and posttests, tape recordings of class sessions, checklists, rating scales, and repeated interviews with teachers and students to determine what was taught, how it was taught, and what course outcomes were for  students in areas of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behavior. Nine measurement instruments were developed to assess achievement and attitude variables. Two instruments measured student ability to organize, interpret, and evaluate MACOS, social science, and ethnographic data. Other instruments evaluated student attitudes toward unusual customs, problem solving, social studies, and the suitability of vivid topics for elementary school students. Findings indicated similarity between MACOS and non-MACOS groups of classes on generalized tests of social studies and inquiry skills, and differences on tests that were curriculum specific.

Characteristics computed for classes included ability grouping; average age of students; and percentage of students who were white, female, and male. Characteristics computed for teachers included educational background, social studies objectives, and preferred teaching methods. No significant differences were found  between the two groups of classes with regard to pretests of achievement, attitude, demographic characteristics, or class composition.

Project staff members conducted and tape recorded 20-minute interviews with teachers and small groups of students three times during the school year in order to discuss course content, explore perceptions related to social studies courses, and encourage personal interaction between researchers and study participants. Transcripts were made of all taped interviews and all remarks or questions were identified by interviewer (I), teacher (T), or student (S). Code numbers were assigned to teachers and schools to preserve anonymity. Teachers were asked about problems  and pleasures of teaching social studies, controversial issues, values derived from social studies courses, interactions with principals and other teachers, and inservice social studies workshops. Students were asked about social studies course relevance to their lives, knowledge of and attitudes toward other peoples' customs, and the advisability of studying controversial subjects in elementary school. Analysis of tallies of data from interviews indicated that teachers in both groups had problems working with groups of students and felt that additional inservice training would be helpful. Although students developed similar social studies skills, inquiry skills, and attitudes toward other cultures in both MACOS and non-MACOS classes, MACOS students tended to express a more favorable  attitude toward social studies.

        "description":"The fourth volume of the summative evaluation of &quot;Man: A Course of Study&quot; (MACOS) contains all appended materials developed by the project staff to analyze the MACOS program. MACOS, one of the more elaborate and controversial developments of the New Social Studies, was designed in 1970 as a one year course based upon social science concepts for grades five and six. The appendix is presented in eight sections. Section I, the major portion of the appendix, contains instruments which measured student and teacher skills and attitudes related to MACOS and other social studies programs. Section II presents tables of data which relate to characteristics of the 15 school districts which participated in the project, and to social studies programs and curricula used in the districts.  Section III presents scattergrams related to variables such as student attitudes, achievement, classroom processes, and climate. Section IV presents histograms of principal component distributions. Section V offers statistical data based on class means. Section VI gives a brief description of five innovative upper elementary social studies programs which were used as bases of comparison with MACOS. The final section discusses the agreement among project staff members regarding the coding of interviews with students and teachers. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The paper reports the results of a field test of a future studies program for students in grades eight through ten. The first section reviews the small amount of research that has been done in the area of future studies instruction. The program which was evaluated in this study is a teacher-led instructional program containing 42 to 70 class sessions. One goal of the program is to integrate skills and strategies of inventive problem solving with content and activities focused on the investigation of alternative futures. Over 300 students and ten teachers in Philadelphia schools participated in the field test. This report describes the test design, procedures, and results of only one subset of the total field test population. Eighth and tenth grade groups voluntarily chose to take  either the future studies course or a traditional elective in \"human society.\" Two measures of students' orientation toward the future were used as pre- and posttests for all groups: a questionnaire measuring attitudes toward the future (for example, optimism versus pessimism) and an essay which asked students to describe what their life might be like on a typical day 20 years in the future. Extensive statistical analysis of results showed that the experimental future studies program was fairly successful in increasing the fluency, flexibility, and originality of students' descriptions of possible futures, but it was not successful in altering their beliefs and attitudes about the future.

        "description":"This case study recounts the attempts of two school districts to improve decision making on the adoption of a new elementary social studies curriculum by using formal evaluation methodology. The study's main objective was to develop a series of criterion referenced (mastery level) tests from a list of social studies objectives to determine whether these objectives were taught more effectively by the new curriculum. Other objectives included: developing a firm data base for decision making; involving teachers and principals in a field test to assess curriculum objectives; and projecting a plan for an inservice program. Drawing on the technical resources of the University of Illinois, the districts conducted a field evaluation of the new curriculum. Two groups of students were  administered the tests; the experimental group received instruction in the new curriculum, while the control group was exposed to the more traditional curriculum. A total of 1086 students in 48 classrooms participated. Findings indicated the experimental group consistently made higher gains in achievement than the control group. It was also concluded that although criterion referenced evaluation provided important information, traditional test analysis measures proved to be more useful for making decisions on adoption and for planning teacher inservice programs.

The report is intended for use by pre- and inservice teachers and teacher educators as they develop awareness of values and devise strategies to transmit this awareness to students. Members of the Moral Education Project administered an opinion survey to approximately 12,000 Ontario educators in March 1976. The four major areas of inquiry were concerned with definition of values education, teaching techniques, resources and materials, and resources already experimented with. Most educators agreed that two major goals for values education were to encourage respect for other people and to help individuals develop  social responsibility. Respondents indicated the need for classroom skills and additional knowledge of how childrens' thinking develops. Resources most often used in values education programs included kits on moral education and values, religious materials, literature, and films. The appendix, which comprises the bulk of the document, presents a description and results of the survey, background information on values education, an overview of six major conceptions of moral and values education, teaching techniques, and lesson plans.

The study is based on the theory that the goal of most youth sports organizations is participation--to get as many children involved as possible. Conversely, professional-athletic organizations strive for elite athletics rather than mass participation. The behavior of the sports organization frequently does not facilitate the goal of participation, and the result is dysfunctional conflict. Primarily four variables serve as obstacles and bring pressure to bear upon the behaviour of those involved in the sport organization: the structure of the organization, the individuals and groups within the organization, stress  from society at large, and strain from those within the organization. These variables are examined as they affect interschool sports competition. (JD)",

        "description":"This study explored the relationship between fear of automation and teachers' attitudes toward instructional media. Ten terms describing instructional devices were presented under three experimental conditions: replacement, adjunct, and neutral. Five of the devices were considered traditional while the remainder were associated with instructional technology. The subjects, 112 graduate students in education who were teachers or applying for teaching posts, rated each term using six bipolar scales. Results strongly confirmed the hypothesis that fear of automation is an important variable in modifying teachers' attitudes toward terms describing instructional media. Terms directly denoting technology (teaching machine, automated instruction, computer based instruction, computer  managed instruction, educational technology) evoked more negative attitudes than the more traditional terms (textbook, flash card, workbook, film strip, exercise book), regardless of instructional set. The group receiving replacement instructions had a less positive attitude toward the terms than either of the other two groups. In the replacement group, moreover, even the more traditional terms, which received very positive responses in general, were viewed much more negatively once they were associated with a phrase suggesting that such devices might be used as a replacement for the teacher. It was concluded that educators and instructional technologists should be circumspect in the selection of terms describing new instructional equipment, and that attention should be paid to teachers'  attitudes in media workshops and related activities. Failure to deal with these attitudes may have the effect of teachers' attitudes biasing student performance on new instructional equipment in a negative direction. (Author/MJB)",

Two levels of clarity were utilized, as determined by appropriate use of examples and sequencing of instruction. Three instruments were used to measure the dependent variables: university student rating form; affective questionnaire; and a twenty-item posttest designed to measure student learning. Three groups of university students participated in the study: experimental (unclear) and experimental (clear), both receiving treatment, rating form, questionnaire, and posttest, and control, receiving only treatment and posttest. Results of the study suggest the relative independence of clarity of explanation from other indicators of teacher effectiveness as judged  by students on the teacher rating instrument.

Two originated in the staff development offices of public school systems, but differ markedly in their structure: one of these works primarily with a single school site and a single university center toward a specific goal; the other uses the resources of community agencies, area higher education institutions, and individuals for a multitude of  discrete offerings. Two programs feature cooperation among several universities; in both of these programs, the roles of teacher organizations, administrator associations, school districts, and state department of education are essential components.

        "description":"This paper concentrates on incidents of severe conflict in eighth-grade classrooms observed in studies of four socially diverse junior high schools in two districts. Severe conflict is generated when teachers violate students' conceptions of the character of legitimate classroom authority. In a cosmopolitan community within an urban complex, students of both high and low social status and academic achievement were unusually skeptical of the schools' good faith. The school staffs had especially small resources for exercizing forms of control other than authority. Consequently, the character and importance of authority emerged with unusual clarity in classroom encounters. In a small, conservative, midwestern city, there was a significant contrast. Neither teachers nor students were  self-conscious about the character of authority, and at first glance classroom conflicts appeared to stem from personality characteristics and conflicts. But, analysis of interaction in the light of findings in the first district suggests that, though the participants were less articulate in their claims, adherence to norms defining the legitimate character of authority was as crucial to harmony and conflict in the second district as in the first.

In the package &quot;Monitoring Classroom Behavior&quot; three films are sequenced to create improved skill in observing and classifying student behavior. In the first film the settings are described, i.e., a third and tenth grade class engaged in art and science activities respectively. Five categories of student behavior are defined and examples of each are  shown. Two goals are addressed in the second film. First, the concepts are presented in a more complex context demonstrating the difficulties inherent in classifying human behavior. Second, the trainee is asked to try to use the categories in classifying student behavior. In the third part, an attempt is made to simulate the condition in an actual classroom where a teacher may be asked to monitor the behaviors of a variety of students at the same time. (JD)",

Approximately three-quarters of the respondents felt that professional athletic teams should be owned and operated by some form of private enterprise, while the remainder felt that this was the government's  responsibility (21 percent) or had no opinion (four percent). Responsibility for ownership and operation of national/international amateur athletics was viewed mainly as the responsibility of the government, with only 18 percent attributing responsibility to private enterprise. In terms of organizing and paying for school/amateur youth sport, about half of the respondents saw this as a government responsibility, one-quarter as an amateur athletic organization responsibility, and 14 percent as a school responsibility. The overwhelming majority of the respondents favored socializing sport as opposed to athletic excellence. Over 50 percent of the respondents felt that TV little affected themselves or their family members, in respect of athletic aggression. When questioned on responsibility  for regulating the aggressiveness of TV athletics, 70 percent indicated athletic organization responsibility, with the remainder split between government, network, and combined responsibility.

        "description":"In this speech, the president of the National Education Association presents a series of arguments against the development of national educational standards and against the continued use of national, norm-referenced, standardized tests. Eight objections to the use of such tests are noted. Defense of the teaching profession's objections to the tests is based upon the fact that (while such tests provide much more security for the teacher than do criterion-referenced tests and parent-teacher-student conferences) they are simplistic in their measurement, nearly impossible for the layman or local teacher to interpret, and label half the test-takers as losers. In opposition to standardized testing, it is recommended that evaluation be performed in a variety of ways: observation of the  student and his academic and personal growth by behavior, motivational patterns, independent work habits, presentations, parent-teacher conferences, individual diagnostic tests, teacher-made tests, school letter grades, and the development of criterion-referenced tests. A role for the federal government is suggested as being financial support and encouragement of the development of tests for assessing the performance of groups and tests for assessing the performance of individuals. Continuation of support for the National Assessment of Educational Progress is also urged. The speaker concludes with the observation that norm-referenced, standardized tests make a lie of education's often-stated concern for individual differences.

The players, graduate students or practicing professionals, design and conduct an experiment comparing the effectiveness of available educational programs on students in a mythical school district. As a \"research assistant,\" the computer can identify individuals or groups of students by category (test score, grade, sex), apply educational programs, and administer and score tests, which determine the effects of a program over time. There is no  predetermined decision; rather, the results of each team are critically evaluated and methodological implications are discussed. The Game Manager's Manual is a comprehensive guide to FEHR. The introduction describes experiences which FEHR can provide, and the author's perspective on the program evaluation process. Three detailed descriptions are presented: (1) Players' Introduction--an overview of the game, its physical components, and descriptions of the problems available, (2) Fair City U.S.A.--a chamber of commerce description of the mythical community, and (3) players' step-by-step instructions for completing tasks assigned by the Game Manager. General guidelines for setting up and validating the computer program, training instructional staff, and adapting FEHR to local needs and  purposes are included. (CP)",

Introductory chapters describe the NLS data base--including sample size, content areas of data coverage, the time frame in which variables were measured, and accessibility of the data files; and summarize the use of the NLS data, including frequency counts of studies by various categories (i.e. type of report, subject area, sponsoring agency, etc.) and present suggestions for future research. The NLS focuses on the educational, vocational, and personal development of high  school graduates, and the personal, familial, social, institutional, and cultural factors that contribute to that development. The purpose of the NLS is to establish a factual basis for verifying and refining federal policy concerned with maximizing individual access to education and vocational opportunity, with improvement of the educational system as a vehicle for preparing youth for productive, satisfying adult roles. Another purpose is to extend knowledge of human development during the years spanning the transition from high school to adult careers. (Author/EVH)",

Information of a correlational nature collected on a broad and representative sample of persons is available for use in establishing normative information and in providing construct validation for tightly controlled experiments conducted on an unrepresentative sampling of persons--e.g. college sophomores. These data are potentially most useful to psychologists and other researchers for generating hypotheses.

Currently, social science research is rarely used as a basis for policy decisions. A reason for this is that social scientists profess interest in policy issues, yet are naive in understanding how policy decisions are formulated and in knowing how to report research so that it is politically relevant. A report prepared by the Rand Corporation sees the NLS data as having potential for four stages of policy formulation: (1) early warning of forthcoming problems, (2) issue exploration, (3) identification of specific problems, and (4) evaluation of the impacts of past policy decisions. The author suggests only two  stages: the exposition or confirmation of a problem or need that was previously suspected, and the evaluation of prior policy decisions or solutions that have begun to fall into disrepute. Political sophistication and an advocate/adversary stance may be the research tools of the future for social scientists. (BW)",

Specifically, the following questions were addressed: 1) what base-year differences exist among subgroups defined by demographic and personal characteristics (sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, ability, and high school program) and on the basis of modal post high school planning and activity sequences? 2) What differences exist at the time of the first followup study, particularly among groups differing in post high  school activities and sequences in the transition from high school to adult roles? 3) How are the changes in self-esteem, locus of control, and goal orientations related to demographic and personal characteristics, transitional sequences, and changes in activities? Clear and predictable differences were found among subgroups; most differences existed at the time of the base-year assessment and were unmodified as of the first followup. Differences for subgroups classified according to activity and transitional states were more marked; those showing the greatest changes in profiles appeared to be those with the greatest changes in activities.

The reliability study includes an evaluation of test-retest reliability as a function of data collection procedures (whether mail-in or personal interview), item characteristics (response format, item content, and item length), respondent characteristics (sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and academic ability), and the interaction of these diverse factors. At issue is not only the quality of NLS questionnaire data, but the consideration of guidelines for analyzing survey data and improving the quality of that data. In  lieu of an empirical analysis of validity that might have encroached on the privacy of respondents, the validity check was based on a literature review, focusing on NLS types of items. The validity study also focused on data collection procedures, item characteristics, respondent characteristics, and their interactions. An overview of the purpose of the NLS and the methodologies employed are also included. The Short Form of the Second Follow-up Questionnaire is appended. (Author/EVH)",

The results indicate that dropouts are less likely to return mail questionnaires, have lower retention rates in a longitudinal study, need more effort to trace their residence and to complete editing checks, and generally provide data of lower quality. The results also indicate that no substantial differences in data quality exist between those dropouts and graduates who were interviewed. It is thus suggested that the interview approach is preferable as far as data quality is  concerned. The combined use of mail survey, extensive telephoning, and interviews would also be advisable. In either case, questionnaires should be simple and straightforward. A complicated and lengthy questionnaire would probably discourage dropouts from completing the questionnaire. (Author/EVH)",

An illustration is given to clarify how the process of hypotheses testing reduces the number of assumptions one has to accept in drawing conclusions about the program effects. The analysis of covariance procedure illustrated involves 18 possible hypotheses; however, the branching nature of the analysis results in the testing of no more than six hypotheses. The result obtained in testing  a given hypothesis leads to another hypothesis while simulataneously precluding other hypotheses. Thus, efficiency of design is achieved by considering a large number of hypotheses while testing only a limited number of them. At the same time, the design makes it possible to retain the most general hypothesis which adequately explains the data. (Author/MV)",

        "description":"Proficiency testing, the measurement of what a person can do as a result of learning, is used increasingly in higher education to determine whether students have mastered basic skills or whether they deserve credits for specific courses (which they may not have actually taken). The motivation for proficiency testing stems from general dissatisfaction with the low caliber of skills attained by many graduates, and the cost effectiveness of using challenge examinations to avoid re-teaching already mastered skills. Proficiency testing at the secondary level may reduce the need for remedial instruction at the college level, provided that the cutting scores are meaningful. The implications of proficency testing at the college level are numerous. Extensive remedial programs may have to  be instituted, or poorly prepared students may no longer enroll, leading to a decrease in revenue. However, this trend may be offset by other students who are encouraged by the availability of credit by examination programs. The nature of the entering class may change drastically. The faculty will face changes also, since some will have to provide remedial instruction or gear their teaching toward proficiency. A serious problem may be the disproportionate number of minority students who may be unable to pass these tests, regardless of the reasons for the failure. (EVH)",

        "description":"Test fairness or bias may be defined in many different ways, and the existence of possible bias is difficult to demonstrate. Sociolinguistic analysis may be used to check for fairness or bias in test directions, test content specifications, or test items. Four sociolinguistic principles are held to be relevant for this task: (1) pragmatics--that the values stated or implied in test items should be consistent with the values and experience of the examinees, (2) processing--that the process required to arrive at the answer should be explicit in the item stem and appropriate to the test content, (3) formality--that the level of formality in language should not exceed the level required to state the problem effectively, and (4) redundancy--that clarity and completeness are more  valuable in item writing than are brevity and avoidance of redundancy. These principles are applied to examples from a word-knowledge test which may be used in the Armed Services aptitude testing battery. Prospects for further research and test development are discussed. (CTM)",

        "description":"The measurement of change is such a broad topic that this article must limit its focus to a few specific subtopics. These specific topics include: longitudinal research design, attrition in research studies, the statistical analysis of difference scores, and the comparison of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) techniques in analyzing repeated measures data. The purpose and sampling techniques, as well as the internal and external validity are discussed for each measurement technique. The author concludes that a considerable number of problems are inherent in the measurement and analyses of change, especially in research designs of a longitudinal nature. However, most of these problems can be avoided with sufficient care and planning prior  to initiating the research project. The cross-sectional sequential type designs which are required for valid measures of developmental change are very costly--but necessary if the research is to have any scientific value. Multivariate statistical procedures utilizing complete data sets will provide for valid and relatively powerful tests of hypotheses. (Author/MV)",

While conceding that the language barrier did prove difficult for him at first, the student says that language was not the overwhelming problem he expected it to be. He proceeds to explain six features of life and work in American schools that he has never understood. First, he finds it difficult to accept that he must attend school until he is 16 years old; in Portugal, six years of formal schooling was considered sufficient. Second, he feels strongly that he is treated as a child in American schools; in Portugal he was considered mature and responsible. Third, he is uncomfortable with the relative informality of American classroom procedure.  Fourth, he finds examinations in America to be very different from what he encountered in Portugal. Fifth, he finds it difficult to deal with American teachers who want to be his friend instead of remaining aloof. Sixth, he discusses an apparent difference in the role and purpose of schooling in the two nations. In sum, he decides that American schools are easy and demeaning. (Author/GC)",

After needs have been identified, a study should be made of the reasons why such needs exist. It is at this point that objectives of a project can be enumerated. The objective should be limited to assure concentration of effort and clear understanding by all those taking part. After the program objectives are outlined, activities  and services can be planned. The regulations and criteria require that the needs of nonpublic school children living in the project area be appraised in consultation with persons who know the needs of those children. Regulations also require that parent advisory councils be established to advise in the planning for, the implementation of, and the evaluation of such programs and projects. This document also explains the fiscal and accounting provisions accounting for revenue and expenditures. Also outlined are guidelines of the Local Educational Agencies' responsibilities.

The second chapter on the communications revolution first presents an overview of the communication process and mass media and then discusses the rise of specialism, consumerism and the message of the media (particularly television), and health  behavior and mass communication. Chapter 3 on quality medical care covers the origins of the health consumer; legislative initiatives, such as national health insurance, professional standards review organizations, and health maintenance organizations; and quality assessment including the establishment of a physician-consumer alliance and outcome measures.

        "description":"The first of several on-going tests was conducted of the Behavior Descriptor Index (BDI) which is a new behaviorally oriented job performance appraisal and training evaluation instrument developed for five large Canadian chartered banks. The new instrument was shown to be valid across organizations. Twenty-five assistant bank managers in these five banks were evaluated by their superiors using the BDI as well as the Graphic Rating Scale and the Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS). Three conclusions were drawn from the results of this study. First, behaviorally oriented scales need not be organization specific. Second, it is possible to improve the psychometric characteristics of behavior oriented scales by switching from a Likert-type scale with specific anchor points to an  anchorless format which allows the use of the total job behavior domain. And last, it is possible to use BDI information as a basis for a personnel management system because of its favorable rating characteristics, the increased utilization of job information, and the very specific feedback to raters, evaluators, and ratees.

        "description":"The state and local vocational education advisory councils, created by the Vocational Education Amendments of 1968, provide citizen input into the development and planning of vocational education programs. The whole structure of American industry is undergoing enormous change. We look to vocational education to help prepare this nation for expanded economic growth and to meet the increased needs for human resources. The six pillars of American education to consider when structuring the future system of vocational education are career education, vocational education, postsecondary education, adult education, special education for the handicapped and disadvantaged, and special education for the gifted. Now how do we get all this put together? By law we have created the state  advisory councils. They have a full role to play in developing a state plan; evaluating vocational programs, services, and activities; identifying state vocational education employment and training needs; and providing technical assistance to local advisory councils. The 1976 Amendments recognized the importance of research in vocational education and pull together the state and local advisory councils, state education board, manpower people, research establishment, and others to build an educational system that will meet the needs of the twenty-first century.

The Research on Institutions of Teacher Education (RITE) project was done to study knowledge production (R & D) and knowledge utilization activities in a national population of schools, colleges, and departments of education (SCDEs). Insofar as the indicators of productivity employed in the RITE study reflect important output of the R and D community in education, SCDEs and universities, including university-based R and D centers, are major contributors to the knowledge base in education and to communication with educational practitioners. However, although SCDEs compete well with  other educational agencies, individual faculty productivity is disappointing. (In the concluding half of this paper, the author presents a number of contextual factors and conditions in SCDEs explaining some of the individual and institutional variances in R and D productivity. He uses the data to suggest, by analog, factors which might affect productivity in other educational organizations engaged in R and D activity, especially university-based R and D centers.

Forkner shorthand students achieved a higher accuracy and transcription rate during the first year of instruction. Thus, it is suggested that this is the preferred method of instruction for students who are able to devote one year or less to shorthand instruction. However, by the end of the second year Gregg shorthand students had higher accuracy scores and better English error scores, suggesting that this is the preferred method for students who are able to take two years of shorthand instruction. None of the three shorthand systems included in this project  resulted in first-year shorthand achievement at vocational skill levels, assuming that mailable letters from dictation at 80 words per minute represents minimum vocational skill.

        "description":"A six-month study of the Kentucky State Department of Education programs in practical arts education (career exploration) in junior high schools was done in two parts. In the first part a questionnaire was given to teachers, counselors, students, and principals from twenty schools during the 1976-77 school year. The questionnaire was designed to poll programmatic aspects of the state practical arts program and to monitor attitudes relative to program effectiveness, acceptance, and degree of impact upon students. In general, the respondents were satisfied with most aspects of the program; however, the students felt more supplies, materials, equipment, and career information were needed. The second part of the study involved two administrations of an instrument entitled the  Assessment of Career Development (ACD). The ACD was first given to a sample of Kentucky non-practical arts students in 1975. Later that year a sample of students involved in the practical arts program were administered the ACD. Students with practical arts education experience scored higher on the ACD than those who were not in the practical arts program. In addition, national norm mean scores were higher than practical arts student mean scores in all but one area of exploratory occupational experiences, but the practical arts students' scores were higher than national norm mean scores in all but one cognitive area measured by the ACD.

Curriculum in the job readiness training program was designed to prepare clients to self-appraise their vocational interests and attitudes, to provide them with knowledge about job seeking skills, and to better enable them to exhibit more appropriate job maintenance behaviors once they have acquired a job. Included in the training were techniques related to job finding,  employment application procedures, how to handle the job interview, personal presentation and appropriate behaviors in the interview or job search, and personal presentation and appropriate behaviors recommended to maintain a job. Based on a randomized block design with pretest as a covariate, the experimental group showed significantly greater attractions toward work as measured by the Vocational Opinion Index than did the control group.

        "description":"A national study of vocational education in corrections was conducted to describe the current status of vocational education programs available to inmates in all types of correctional facilities. The study produced the following technical reports: a review and synthesis of the literature on correctional vocational education; a set of thirty-four standards for vocational programs in correctional institutions; and a national survey of correctional facilities. Results of the study showed a wide range of opinions describing what kind of treatment incarcerated individuals should receive, including educational opportunities. Development of standards for planning, operating, and evaluating vocational programs was enthusiastically welcomed by administrators and teachers in correctional  facilities. Survey data showed that in correctional facilities offering vocational education about sixteen percent of the total inmate population (212,000 inmates) participated in those programs. Another four percent were waiting to enroll in vocational courses. Recommendations for continued research in the area were made, and a suggestion for testing the standards in actual vocational program planning and operation was presented. The appendixes, which comprise a major portion of this document, include the technical reports and a report of the site visits which were included in the study. (Author/BM)",

Part 1 examines the problems that youths face in making a successful transition from school to work, including knowledge of the labor market, self-knowledge of abilities and aptitudes, occupational socialization, certifying competencies, and assistance in finding work and developing job seeking skills. Effectiveness of current programs in addressing these problems is also discussed. It is suggested that the Vocational Education Act or the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) be amended to effect the provision of school-based placement services and establishment of state career information  systems. It is also contended that federal activities in the areas of certification of competencies, occupational socialization, and self-knowledge of abilities and aptitudes fall within the categories of research and development or technical assistance and training and could be funded under current discretionary authority and budget levels. Part 2 addresses the problems which adults face in finding opportunities to change their career or life directions and the inequitable distribution of work in American society. Recommendations for federal policy focus on research on career and life redirection and renewal, career information and guidance systems, time-income tradeoff and work scheduling options, and leave-of-absence without pay. Implementation of these recommendations is discussed.  (TA)",

Five problem areas are recognized as potential constraints in implementation of the project activities. To minimize these problems, a complete spectrum of analytic tools is suggested, including the following assessment and evaluation approaches: office of youth programs issue papers, grant narratives, program data, continuous longitudinal manpower survey, national longitudinal survey, outside monitoring and assessment network, regional office assessment reviews, national office reviews, and impact  assessments. The analytical framework suggested is based on ten basic principles, assumptions, and goals which include the following elements: knowledge development, youth participation, serving those most in need, avoiding substitution, minimizing overhead, institutional change, service deliverers, program integration, and implementation. Finally a detailed schedule for the implementation of the assessment efforts is presented. (BM)",

One suggestion made is that while the counselor's role has traditionally been a passive exploration of student options, it would be better for counselors actively to encourage women to seek nontraditional careers. Otherwise, their socialization may prompt them to consider only the most traditional career options. In addition, the author discusses several key issues for future researchers to deal with: (1) to specifiy what is meant by sex discrimination and to achieve some consistency in the use of this term; (2) to research the total process of counseling rather than its component elements; (3) to acquire more  information about sex discrimination in personal/social counseling, since research there is even more limited than in career counseling; and (4) to acquire more information on the differential impact of counseling on men and women.
