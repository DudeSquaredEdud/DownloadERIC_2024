        "description":"Recent research shows no significant educational benefits from providing summer schools, extended school years, or year-round schooling to disadvantaged students. However, the severe educational difficulties faced by these students, combined with the many practical reasons for deviating from the traditional school year, are strong reasons why educators continue to hope for improvements in student achievement from these programs. While it is unfair to expect such improvements without a clear picture of how students learn over time, it is also clear that the programs themselves are in need of improvement. Program management problems associated with summer school include the following: (1) short duration; (2) loose organization; (3) little time for advance planning; (4) low academic  expectations; (5) emphasis on \"fun\"; (6) discontinuity between the curriculum of the regular year and summer school; (7) time lost to establishment of teacher-student relationships; (8) teacher fatigue; (9) low attendance rate; and (10) homogeneous classes. Problems associated with year-round schooling include the following: (1) curriculum changes when schools switch from 9-month to year-round; (2) lack of support and assistance to teachers in adapting to the change; (3) insufficient provision for teacher fatigue; (4) administrative complexity of staggered schedules in secondary schools; and (5) parent objections. Additional research is needed on both student learning and the effects of various program components. A list of 10 references is included. (Author/FMW)",

        "description":"During the 1987-88 school year the New York City Board of Education instituted Magnet School Programs in the following high schools: (1) Central Park East Secondary School; (2) The High School for the Humanities; (3) Townsend Harris High School; and (4) John Dewey High School. The programs at these schools were designed to offer special curricula in the Humanities not ordinarily available at students' zoned high schools, and to provide a school environment in which students of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds would have increased achievement motivation. Administrators hoped this would translate into high attendance rates, high achievement, positive intergroup relations, and a positive attitude toward the Magnet Program. Overall, the program achieved its evaluation  objectives, although there was some unevenness with respect to how well certain schools performed on individual objectives. Three of the four schools exceeded the achievement objective; three of the schools met the attendance objective; and students' responses to survey items about their school and their peers indicated generally favorable attitudes, despite the fact that the evaluation objective was not met in every case. Although the program's evaluation objectives were finalized late in the school year, the program was implemented successfully at the school level. However, late finalization of the objectives did preclude conducting a comprehensive program evaluation. Data are presented on three tables. (BJV)",

        "description":"The 1986-87 Attendance Improvement Dropout Prevention (AIDP) Part-Time Jobs Program was begun in spring 1987 to place at-risk New York City, New York, high school students in part-time, unsubsidized jobs that would motivate them to improve their school attendance and academic achievement. Twenty-one community-based organizations (CBOs) contracted to provide appropriate job placements and job-readiness training to 70 to 150 students in 24 targeted high schools. A total of 3,300 students were targeted for services, and 3,174 students were given training; of the students who received such training 1,557 (47 percent) were placed in jobs and worked an average of 6.4 weeks. For students hired while in the program and for whom complete data were available, attendance increased from 82  percent in spring 1986, to 85 percent in spring 1987. Achievement for these students, measured by the percentage of courses passed, increased from 70 to 71 percent during this same period. Participating CBOs and high schools thus fulfilled their obligation to provide staff and training although they did not meet their job placement objective. However, CBOs varied significantly in the number of staff and the amount of staff time they devoted to the program, and the number of training sessions they required each student to attend. Recommendations for improvements are made. Data are illustrated on a table and in the appendix. (BJV)",

        "description":"This program was developed for use for those who wish to learn more about the increasing complexity of implementing school desegregation, school integration, and equal educational opportunities for all children and youth in the public schools. It is designed to assist school districts in evaluating the extent to which desegregated elementary schools are developing an integrated educational program. Information about individual schools may be used by the staff to accomplish the following: (1) assess their current status in developing an integrated school; and (2) chart changes over a period of time in developing an integrated school. This individual school assessment method was originally developed and field-tested in four California school districts in 1972. The program may be  used with Asian, American Indian, Black and Hispanic children. Critical dimensions of cultural and structural integration assessed are the following: (1) student self-concepts and attitudes toward school; (2) student academic achievement; (3) development of multicultural programs; (4) multiethnic student roles; (5) multiethnic educator roles; and (6) multiethnic parent roles. Because of large differences between assessment profiles of different schools in the same school district, it is suggested that principals concentrate on their individual school's completed profile as a guide for goal setting and planning. An example of a completed profile from an actual school and instructions for interpretation are included. (Author/FMW)",

The program was designed to provide direct instruction to some 2,613 students in grades one through nine. The goal of A2 was to improve the pupils' reading and/or mathematics achievement. Instruction occurred primarily in small group settings outside the regular classroom for the elementary level, and in a regular classroom setting with a reduced number of students for the secondary level. The 1987-88 compensatory education delivery system showed a decrease from the previous year in terms of the percentage of grade levels meeting the standard in both reading and  mathematics. Overall, A2 results remain adequate, especially at the elementary level. The results of the pre- to post-testing of compensatory education students indicated that the greatest gains in reading were made at the first grade level, but all grades attained the performance standard except grades 7, 8, and 9. Mathematics gains were again the greatest at grade 1, but that all grades met the standard except grades 7, 8, and 9.

        "description":"This paper presents a model and some empirical research on the process of ethnic identity development beyond childhood. Several models of ethnic identity development among minorities share with Erikson the idea that an achieved identity is the result of an identity crisis, which involves a period of searching that leads to a commitment. In order to achieve a secure ethnic identity, minority adolescents must explore the meaning of being a minority in a predominantly white society. The paper developed a measure for assessing ethnic identity development based on the two components of the identity process, search and commitment, that could be used across ethnic groups. A questionnaire was administered to 300 undergraduates at an ethnically diverse urban college campus. Responses were  analyzed from the following: (1) American-born Mexican Americans; (2) American-born Asian Americans; (3) American-born Blacks; (4) American-born Whites; and (5) foreign-born Asian students. Results include the following: (1) ethnic identity is an important issue with all groups; (2) mixed race subjects may experience higher levels of identity conflict; (3) most minority students seem to have achieved or be in moratorium in the area of ethnic identity; (4) minority students appear to have begun the identification process at an earlier age; (5) a strong relationship exists for minorities between ethnic identity and self-esteem; and (6) whites experience lower levels of search than minorities, but similar levels of commitment.

        "description":"A 3.5-year study of dropout prevention programs in New York City public schools shows that current programs have been effective in increasing professional and public awareness of the dropout problem and providing needed support to some students. However, the categorical approach of most programs is inadequate, providing special services to only a limited number of students under a rigid format for a limited time. It slights the needs both of the students reached, and the vastly larger population of students in the same and other schools who are truant, or at-risk of becoming so. Moreover, the approach does not address the problem of school environments that are personally alienating and academically ineffectual, and which counteract the effects of the special programs. The  programs studied are funded by the New York State Attendance Improvement/Dropout Prevention Program (AIDP), and the New York City Dropout Prevention Program (DPP). Project staff made observation visits to 11 middle and 9 high schools, and conducted structured interviews with students, staff, and administrators on all levels between 1985 and 1987. A comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of the various programs resulted in the recommendation that funding and program policy incorporate a systemic approach, characterized by the involvement of school staff in solving negative schoolwide conditions. A list of references and six appendices containing descriptions of the AIDP and DPP programs and schools are included. (Author/FMW)",

        "description":"The purpose of the High School Development Center, an alternative school in Detroit, Michigan, is to provide educational opportunities for 300 students identified as unsuccessful by principals of five high schools. Students in grades 9 and 10 are selected for the program if they exhibit two of the following: (1) very low academic achievement; (2) poor attendance; and (3) behavior problems. Evaluation of the Center was accomplished by analyzing and comparing trends in the number of violations of the Student Code of Conduct, attendance, and academic achievement of students at the Center with a carefully selected control group at the home schools, and by surveying students, parents, and teachers. This document presents a summary of the evaluation. Conclusions include the following:  (1) no improvement was perceived in the safety and school climate at the home schools as a result of removing the students sent to the Center; (2) Center students showed greater improvement in academic achievement; (3) attendance rates for Center students decreased, while rates for the control group increased; and (4) the rate of Code of Conduct violations for Center students was lower than the rate for the control group. Responses from staff, students and parents were incorporated into a list of 11 recommendations for program improvement. (FMW)",

Co-signers agreed to the following: (1) assist in developing private sector initiatives in employment training; (2) help double the number of schools participating in the Jobs Collaborative, a school-to-work transition program; (3) recruit 300 companies to participate in a priority hiring program for graduates by 1984; and (4) increase the number of summer jobs available for students by 25 percent by 1984. The business community agreed to hire 400 June 1983 graduates into permanent jobs and to increase the number to 1,000  students by 1985 if they could meet entry-level requirements. On its side, the school department agreed to: (1) reduce both absentee and dropout rates by 5 percent annually; (2) implement increased standards for graduation that would ensure minimal competency in mathematics and reading by 1986; and (3) increase job and college placements after graduation by 5 percent annually. The business community exceeded its goals, but the schools were less successful. Although student performance as measured by standardized tests in mathematics and reading had increased, district average results were still below the national average. Instead of decreasing, the dropout rate increased each year. (FMW)",

At-risk students should be identified early during their formative years, and social and academic enrichment programs should be implemented as soon as possible. School-based models can make an important difference with low achievers. The principal must provide the leadership to create an inviting, supportive learning environment for staff and students. The attitude of the classroom teacher is the key to program success. Successful teacher approaches must include the following: (1) communication of high expectations; (2) utilization of a variety of effective teaching strategies; (3) emphasis on  the development of the total child. The appendix contains an extensive list of practical strategies divided by the following: (1) reading/writing/spelling; (2) social studies; (3) science; (4) mathematics; (5) adaptable to all subjects; and (6) motivation/self-concept.

This is the second year that the new California Achievement Test (CAT) Form E, normed in the Spring of 1985, has been used for program evaluation purposes. The locally adopted performance standard was that grade level post-test mean percentile scores would evidence improvement over pre-test scores. Overall, results show decreases from the previous year in the percent of grade levels meeting the performance standard in both reading and mathematics. For the State Bilingual Program, the decrease was the same. For the Migrant Program, the decrease was less in reading than in mathematics. The results of this product  evaluation were combined with the results of a process evaluation to generate recommendations to improve the implementation of next year's programs. Statistical data are included in 13 tables. The appendices provide a count of program participants, an explanation of the procedure for the identification of students eligible for program participation, and a table showing mean percentile gain/loss in reading and math by building and grade for 1-12 state Bilingual and Migrant, spring 1987-spring 1988.

McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (the McKinney Act), Federal emergency aid has failed to keep pace with the growing need for assistance. Less than one year after the passage of the McKinney Act, progress has been made toward meeting the emergency need for food, shelter, and health care among the growing number of homeless persons, and virtually every program authorized by the legislation has been made available to the public. Nevertheless, the funds are not adequate and agencies have acted slowly in distributing the money they did receive. McKinney Act appropriations have affected every state by creating new programs and sustaining existing programs to meet the survival needs of homeless persons, including the following:  (1) the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) emergency food and shelter funds; (2) the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housing funds; and (3) the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) primary and mental health care program funds. Yet failure to implement some of the provisions of the McKinney Act have resulted in the following: (1) no increase in the availability of food stamps; (2) endangerment of the Temporary Food Assistance Program; and (3) unavailability of education and job training programs until the end of the summer of 1988. The McKinney Act must be renewed at higher funding levels that realistically address the size and growth of the homeless population. Each agency receiving funds is profiled, with the following information provided: (1) amount  of award; (2) amount distributed; (3) programs covered; and (4) demand for funds, by state.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) recruited many Hmong to fight rebel forces in Indochina. Losing to the Pathet Lao in 1975, the Hmong were forced to flee Communist-controlled Laos. The United States accepted more than 60,000 Hmong refugees between 1975 and 1986.

The main focus is Hmong resettlement in the United States, but material has been included on the Hmong in Southeast Asia and China. The  principal language focus is English, but English-Hmong bilingual material is included. Topical divisions are the following: (1) Bibliographies; (2) Ethnography; (3) Linguistics; (4) Refugees/Resettlement Issues; (5) Physical and Mental Health; (6) Bilingual Materials; (7) Audiovisual Materials; and (8) Sources (a list of addresses of organizations that produce materials on Hmong/Southeast Asians, or that engage in refugee advocacy).

        "author":["Sherritt, Caroline"],
        "description":"Since the 1970 English publication of &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed,&quot; Brazilian educator Paulo Freire has been a compelling and controversial figure in adult education. Most often associated with the radical end of the philosophic continuum, Freire has nonetheless managed to gain acceptance among moderate adult educators who do not necessarily share his philosophic outlook. This phenomenon can be understood within the context of liberal and radical education, two orientations increasingly reflected in adult education literature, especially by P. Jarvis. In addition, some social developments of the last three decades have contributed to an acceptance of radical thought. In practice, Freire is largely liberal, stressing the phenomenal and existential nature of the individual; his  private life has not been that of the radical revolutionary. It is possibly Freire's eclectic blend of Marxism, Christian humanism, and existentialism that appeals to adult educators, particularly adult educators within a Judeo-Christian context that teaches that all good things evolve from the power of the individual. However, since liberals ignore Freire's radical ideas and radicals ignore his liberal teachings, Freire's true contribution to adult education will be obscured until these issues are faced objectively.

Study results indicate that spatial reasoning is highly related to figural structures that allow for the mental manipulation of abstract mental imagery as a reasoning faculty. \"Stylistic Independence in Art: Doodling as an Indicator of Idiosyncratic Expressiveness\" presents a conceptual framework that characterizes doodle activity in adults as a  consistency of figural relationships resulting in an artistic style. Results of a study reveal that the practice of graphic activity produces an individual artistic perspective, expressed in consistent figural markings, that links the activity of doodling to artistic development. Appendixes include a measurement scale for the spatial manipulation of abstract mental imagery and a classification of doodles. (YLB)",

An estimable disequilibrium model of the labor market is specified in Chapter 3, and in Chapter 4 the data are discussed, the estimation procedure is outlined, and results are presented.  Chapter 5 specifies and estimates an equilibrium model of the labor market and discusses its implications. Chapter 6 concludes with comparisons between the disequilibrium and equilibrium results and some suggestions for future research.

Forty-five percent of all participants in Soviet adult education are over 35 years of age (full-time education is restricted to those under the age of 30). Correspondence courses are the most popular form of adult education. Other popular programs are the people's universities (which are similar to Western junior colleges), the Likbeze (a literacy program that provides literacy courses targeted toward adults and produces educational literature), on-the-job training, and self-education. The predominant  form of adult education is political instruction, with courses arranged by employers and local houses and clubs of political education. Although not legislatively required, adult education is avidly encouraged by the Soviet government. Major issues affecting Soviet adult education are the conflict between creativity and tradition, the scarcity of labor resources, outside threats of capitalism, and inadequate school administration.

The 9-month investigation included a study of the use of joint facilities in five states, a study of training models used in industry, and an examination of ways of integrating on- and off-the-job training within traineeships. The TAFE/industry partnership picture was found to be very patchy. Excellent examples of effective relationships in TAFE course development were found; however, these excellent relationships were not nearly so widespread in the area of TAFE course implementation. The following were identified as ways of improving  TAFE/industry partnerships: (1) form the highest possible TAFE/industry/training policy committee at the state levels; (2) have industry commission TAFE to develop and help implement all components of publicly accredited industry training curricula and commission TAFE to help develop other training programs; and (3) have industry provide TAFE with modern equipment, either at TAFE colleges, skills centers, or industrial sites.

        "description":"A study examined and evaluated both public and private efforts to assist dislocated farmers, with particular emphasis on employment and training programs. The study found that about 46,000 farmers are currently leaving farming each year, and the rate probably will continue for the next several years. Since the majority of the farmers who leave farming are under 45 years of age, there is a need to retrain them for other jobs. The primary employment and training program currently serving dislocated farmers is the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). The JTPA has experienced some success in retraining farmers, although statistics are difficult to obtain. The study identified five key elements in successful retraining programs: (1) use of trained field staff for outreach activities;  (2) setting enrollment criteria in a way that permits enrollment of the target population with a minimum of embarrassment; (3) use of a neutral service center removed from the stigma of &quot;welfare&quot;; (4) statewide leadership; and (5) a state structure that permits support of the most aggressive local projects. Obstacles to farmer retraining include the lengthy and uncertain process of farm dislocation, the lack of nonfarm job opportunities in rural communities, and the farmers' lack of job search skills and self-confidence. The study concluded that the JTPA model of public investment in human capital is an appropriate one for retraining dislocated farmers but that long-term solutions to structural unemployment are also needed.

Because adjustment assistance is preferable to protectionism, the trade assistance program should be modified to include more provisions for adjustment assistance, including worker adjustment assistance geared toward retraining and finding new jobs for dislocated workers.  Recent federal efforts to provide increased educational and transitional services for disadvantaged youth deserve praise, although the program could be strengthened by making a few technical changes in programs.

A number of JTPA officials at the federal, state, and local levels were interviewed to determine ways in which the JTPA performance standards system can be used to encourage the provision of services to hard-to-employ individuals while still maintaining an emphasis on performance. Two types of policies were determined to be promising: (1) reducing disincentives to serve hard-to-serve persons and (2) providing incentives to encourage increased service to hard-to-serve populations. Policies to reduce disincentives include  adding factors to the models for deficiencies and barriers, additional target groups, and adjustments for activities; changing the reward structure for exceeding standards; and providing performance standards exemptions for hard-to-serve individuals. Policies to provide additional incentives include allocating six-percent funds, adding standards and giving extra credit for the hard-to-serve, and providing additional technical assistance.

Telephone interviews were conducted with representatives from Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs and departments of public welfare in nine states. A significant amount of state-level activity was aimed at improving the level and quality of services available to AFDC recipients, including the hard-to-employ. All of the programs identified placed a premium on interagency coordination and on flexible and enriched program design. Welfare agency respondents considered limited funds and the lack of an adequate consensus as to the proper role of employment and training programs and their  relationship to public welfare programs to be the greatest barriers to providing services to AFDC recipients. Among the JTPA respondents, performance standards were the most commonly cited barrier. Six of the nine states studied had undertaken efforts to develop local performance standards beyond those produced by the Department of Labor's adjustment model. The message regarding performance standards was mixed. Although they were considered the biggest obstacle to providing services, they were also seen as one of the most effective means of improving the level and quality of services. (MN)",

Summaries and syntheses are then provided on literature related to definition, vocational preparation, living arrangement, mobility, and correlates of employment. Part 2 of the monograph develops a typology of transition. These three main categories of elements of the typology are described: employment, living arrangement, and mobility. The typology is followed by a descriptive analysis of the subjects in a specific study that tests the viability of the Transition Typology for  understanding relationships among the variables that may affect transition. Variables that may contribute to differential success of transition are then analyzed. A 12-page bibliography is appended. (YLB)",

        "description":"The San Diego (California) Saturation Work Initiative Model (SWIM) was part of the Social Security Administration's two-site demonstration of saturation work programs in an urban area. The multicomponent program operated from July 1985 until late 1987, when it was replaced by a new statewide initiative called the Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN) program. The model was designed to test the feasibility of requiring the continuous participation of welfare applicants and recipients in a series of work-related activities for as long as they remained on welfare. The program activities included job search, work experience, and referral to education and training programs. The program was examined from the standpoint of two perspectives--the extent to which the full Work Incentive  (WIN)-mandatory caseload was involved in employment-related activities at a particular point in time and the continuity of individuals' participation in the program. During typical months of the demonstration, approximately half the WIN-mandatory caseload subject to the participation requirement was active in one of the program's components. Although many program eligibles did not participate on a continuous basis, it was concluded that San Diego reached the maximum feasible participation rates for the type of program in question. (MN)",

The study considered programs in San Diego, California; Baltimore, Maryland; several counties in Virginia; Little Rock and another county in Arkansas; and Cook County (including Chicago) in Illinois. The experimental groups consisted of persons who could receive the special service programs. Welfare recipients assigned to the control groups could not receive the services under study. They could, however, avail themselves of other community services (on their own initiative). The impacts and outcomes identified indicate that, if maximizing program impacts while limiting resources is the goal, it is a  mistake to concentrate only on serving the most job-ready portion of the AFDC population. It also appeared relatively clear that programs should not focus exclusively on the most disadvantaged among the Work Incentive (WIN)-mandatory caseload (at least not with low- to moderate-cost services). The data collected suggest that program operators wishing to maximize impacts on earnings may find it desirable to work first with applicant returnees or applicants with weak work records, whereas those operators desiring to maximize welfare savings devote increased effort to the most dependent client groups.

TOPS was distinguished from Maine's other WIN demonstration activities by three program elements. It was a prescribed sequence of activities--prevocational training, unpaid work experience, and subsidized on-the-job training, preferably in the private sector. Second, it was intended to reach harder-to-employ clients. Third, it tended to involve more intensive use of staff time. A comparison of the experiences of an experimental group of TOPS participants with a control group that did not have access to the TOPS sequence indicated  that TOPS produced employment and earnings gains that contained throughout the 3-year follow-up period. The combination of earnings gains and no welfare reductions led to substantial increases in the total measured income of TOPS enrollees. Because of the relatively high cost of the program and the absence of welfare savings, however, TOPS did not pay for itself from the perspective of government budgets within a 5-year period. (MN)",

It was carried out using a questionnaire and structured interview technique with 24 organizations. Larger organizations had their own facilities and trained in-house whereas smaller organizations made more use of Technical and Further Education (TAFE) facilities. Most of the general staff training was operator/skills training. The staffing of training functions in organizations varied enormously with great variations in the arrangement of responsibility for training. Types of training methods varied depending on whether participants were apprentices, general staff, or management. The most used techniques were classroom lectures, practical sessions, and on-the-job  instruction. The overall impression of current training and staff development in Australian industry was depressing. Apprentice and management training were well managed and run, but the overriding impression of industrial training in Australia was that it was uncoordinated and ad hoc. Where there was an identifiable model in industrial training, it resembled a systems approach, which tended to create somewhat static training activities. What was needed was a more open model that would allow input from industry, TAFE, and government and encourage cooperation. (The questionnaire is appended.) (YLB)",

A year after the project began, it was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively through such data collection instruments as attitude assessments, journals and logs kept by program  participants, and onsite interviews with the adult educators and students involved in the project. The adult educators participating in the project agreed that the CAI format increased (sometimes dramatically) the numbers of students in programs. Comparisons of participants' performance on pretests and posttests showed average grade equivalency gains of 0.63 and 0.92 grade levels after 3 and 6 months, respectively, for 26 students for whom complete test results were available. Students and teachers alike felt that the CAI enhanced students' general computer literacy and specific job skills. (MN)",

In addition, seven employer/school forums were held across the country. Some of the findings were the following: (1) the workplace and the economy as well as job requirements are changing rapidly; (2) the basic skills gap between what business needs and the qualifications of entry-level workers is widening; (3) employers find the competencies of entry-level workers deficient in basic mathematics, reading, writing, and  communications, as well as in problem solving and teamwork; (4) lack of these skills is costing American business money; (5) educators agree with business about the skills needed in the workplace but few educators acknowledge that the gaps are as severe as business indicates; (6) business must do a better job of anticipating future work force needs and communicating them to educators, parents, students, and the community; and (7) more cooperation between business and the educational community is needed. It is concluded that in order to close the skills gap, the quality of education must be improved, businesses must assist schools, and the community must be mobilized to ensure the best education for young people and a high quality work force for the nation. In addition to describing  research findings, the report also contains descriptive profiles of three communities which are successfully closing the gap between workplace needs and workforce capabilities.

        "description":"Structural change in the economy is causing economic stress in rural America, especially in areas with a heavy dependence on agriculture, mining and energy, and manufacturing. This contrasts sharply with the 1970s, when widespread economic growth and vitality were the dominant rural themes. Rural economies in the 1980s are characterized by slow job growth and high unemployment, outmigration and reduced population growth, and underdeveloped human resources. Although public policy can facilitate community adjustment to structural economic change, there is considerable debate about the role of public policy in easing the adjustment burden for displaced people and their communities. Devising a national rural development policy involves making political choices. The interests of those  affected by rural stress and structural change must be balanced against the costs and likely success of attempting a remedy. Much of the responsibility for devising and administering rural programs will fall to state governments, and the success of these problems will depend on leadership in local communities. The Federal Government's role is to foster an economic environment conducive to growth, to facilitate multistate and multicommunity approaches, and to ensure that adequate attention is given to human development programs, such as education and training.

        "description":"After analyzing the needs of special student populations in vocational and technical education in South Carolina, private sector involvement in vocational and technical education, and the distribution of funds for secondary and postsecondary vocational education in the state, the South Carolina Council on Vocational and Technical Education developed the following recommendations. Efforts to serve special population groups outlined by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984 should be continued. The Office of Vocational Education should analyze the declining handicapped enrollment and find ways of rectifying the situation. Greater marketing efforts should be directed toward special population groups. The State Board of Education should revise its guidelines for the  involvement of advisory committees in vocational and technical education and should establish some process for ensuring that active use is indeed made of local advisory committees and/or councils. The current ratio of expenditures of federal funds for vocational education between secondary and postsecondary vocational education programs should be maintained at essentially the same level and in the same manner.

        "description":"Concern for performance management has increased sharply in recent decades in both the public and private sectors. This has been particularly true in the management of state and federally funded human resource development programs. Legislative purpose, level of use, the role of performance standards, appropriate measures of performance, target groups, and general implementation policies are key issues that cut across the major publicly funded job training and placement programs. This report examines these program design and implementation issues in relation to Job Training Partnership Act programs, state-administered job placement and labor exchange programs, postsecondary vocational education, welfare-to-work programs for recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children,  and the new state-run food stamp employment and training programs. Various contextual issues are discussed, including grant-in-aid programs, enhanced state discretion, market bias, ambiguous goals, appropriate actors/levels of use, appropriate groups, target groups, the role of standards, and adjustment processes. General recommendations to federal and state level policymakers and program-specific recommendations for addressing performance management issues are included. (Ninety references are listed.) (MN)",

        "description":"This guide explores ways that schools can put the idea of integrating educational and community support for dropout prevention to work in the school and community. Part 1, \"Implementing a Plan for Restructuring the School,\" recommends the formation of a task force to involve the community and school staff from the start. It also describes the integrated learning environment (ILE) that is at the heart of the effective plan of action. Part 2, \"Generating Strategies To Create an Integrated Learning Environment,\" suggests strategies that schools can adopt or adapt to implement their notions of the ILE within their schools. Both schoolwide and classroom-based interventions are discussed and illustrated. Schools may tailor these interventions to their local conditions. Four chapters in  this part explore ways that schools can manipulate school-level factors related to dropping out--reducing truancy, providing alternative school schedules, examining school policies that affect retention, and improving school climate. The rest of part 2 focuses on the events in the classroom that are indicative of an ILE. They include increasing educational relevance, changing teacher roles, creating a career-focused curriculum, providing for success, and monitoring progress. A list of 236 references concludes the guide. (YLB)",

        "description":"This guidebook presents a variety of dropout prevention strategies and is intended to help readers determine which strategies are best suited for a particular classroom, school, or district. The primary audience is school personnel who work with young adolescents. It begins by addressing major dropout issues, primary research findings, and possible solutions. Three additional concepts are then presented: bonding, basic skills, and youth advocacy. These topics relative to bonding are explored: classroom and school climate, various school policies (attendance and truancy, suspension, nonpromotion and retention, discipline, tracking and testing), and the roles of parents, families, and the community. These basic skills topics are then discussed: curriculum concerns, instructional  issues, teaching/learning styles, career awareness and educational planning, cooperative learning, peer tutoring, and the role of vocational education. Specific issues featured in the discussion of youth advocacy are adolescent behavior, expectations of youth, early identification of potential dropouts, building self-esteem, guidance and counseling, and accommodation. The monograph concludes with a discussion of planning and evaluation techniques, staffing patterns and staff development, the role of administrators, and overview of choices that teachers, counselors, and principals should consider in developing dropout prevention strategies. A list of 145 references concludes the guide. (YLB)",

Following a review of literature that found significant positive outcomes in many studies of group treatments, 39 students volunteered to take career decision-making courses in fall 1983 at a rural, open-admissions  community college in the northeast. Two experimental groups received a longer treatment of 20 75-minute sessions for 10 weeks or a shorter treatment of 10 75-minute sessions lasting 5 weeks. The third group was in a no-treatment condition for 5 weeks and then received the longer treatment. The results favored the effectiveness of the longer treatment. Some significant age differences, favoring younger students, were noted, although sex and reading-level differences were negligible. The research encourages continued group approaches to career decision making, but warns about the limitation of short-term interventions and those that do not provide for individualization. (KC)",

        "description":"Project LIFE, which began in October 1987, was a model program that involved a coalition of community agencies in addressing the problem of adult illiteracy in a community college setting, enhancing participants' employability, and providing them with career adaptability. To improve outreach efforts, program planners made heavy use of commercial television as an awareness and instructional medium. Other project objectives were to increase public awareness of the complexities and problems associated with adult illiteracy while promoting literacy as a value within the community; to combine the resources of the major literacy providers in addressing the pervasive and complex problem of adult illiteracy; and to provide prevocational workshops to enhance employability, affect  employment, provide career adaptability, and explore technical/vocational fields. Described in the body of the report are the project's promotional campaign, personnel and office procedures, inservice and intake components, class format, instructional materials, roles of the counselors, advisory board, and volunteers, and project evaluation and conclusions. Project materials related to most of these areas are contained in 11 appendixes, which also include student handouts and a student survey. (MN)",

Developmental differences were examined in the effectiveness of two instructional design features--the use of pictorial (graphics) versus highlighting--and extent of learner participation. Fifty elderly adults and 50 young adults were randomly assigned to five treatment groups--signaling, signaling/embedded questions, passive graphics, interactive graphics, and embedded questions. The five versions of the CAI lesson differed in the form of highlighting used and the extent to which learners had to respond actively. Following completion of the lesson, subjects took a prompted recall test. Subjects were also administered a survey assessing  previous experience with computer-related technology and were pre- and posttested on attitudes toward computer-related technology. The main effect for highlighting was significant. Twenty percent of the elderly reported having used a microcomputer, compared with 98 percent of the young subjects. Both age groups were found to be slightly favorable toward CAI, and attitudes became slightly more favorable following participation in the study. Elderly subjects performed best on signaling; the young were best with graphics. Both age groups were relatively poor performers with interactive graphics. (YLB)",

The data were obtained through the quick-turnaround portion of the Job Training Quarterly Survey (JTQS) and were extracted from service delivery area administration records during the 1986 program year. It was discovered that an estimated 26 to 28 percent of the population served by JTPA are school dropouts in contrast to an overall dropout rate of 14 percent commonly estimated for the general population. For youth and adult dropouts alike, JTPA is serving slightly larger percentages of men than would be suggested by the eligible population. Blacks also appear to be somewhat overrepresented, whereas  Hispanics are underrepresented. Of the 182,900 school dropouts who were terminated from JTPA during 1986, an estimated 57 percent entered employment at the time of termination compared to a rate of 64 percent for all other JTPA terminees.

Since 1970, the number of births to Oregon teenagers has more than doubled (from 8 percent in 1970 to 19 percent in 1985). Female-headed families represent 11 percent of total households in Oregon, and women represent over 44 percent of the state's labor force. Sixty-seven percent of unmarried mothers of three- to  five-year-olds and 81 percent of unmarried mothers of school age children are in the work force. Fifty-four percent of Oregon families are supported by two or more wage earners. Oregon men and women continue to work in traditionally sex-typed occupations, with males being paid more in every occupation (even in those that are predominantly female). Women employed full-time earned an average of $9,955 compared with $17,505 for their male counterparts, and families maintained by women are the most vulnerable to poverty.

        "description":"The history of research on distance education was studied. Major research done on distance education in such diverse areas as the United States, Venezuela, and Europe was analyzed. It was discovered that the earliest attempts to develop theories of distance education were mainly concerned with identifying its very concept. Like most educational research, studies of distance education were, from the outset, based both on intellectual inquisitiveness and practical requirements. During the 1970s and 1980s (when distance education research seems to have come of age), most research emanated from distance education organizations. Many studies were carried out in the planning stage in anticipation of the needs of new distance teaching organizations. Statistical studies seemed to  dominate for a long time. Inductive methods were often used. An articulated discipline of research on distance education should include attention to the following areas: the philosophy and theory of distance education, the characteristics and attitudes of distance students, subject-matter presentation, interaction between students and supporting organizations, administration and organization, economics, systems, and history.

The information gathered during these interviews was then used as the basis for formulating recommendations to the Department of Labor concerning actions that could improve collaboration between vocational-technical education and apprenticeship. The principal barriers to collaboration identified were: (1) the apprenticeship selection process, (2) the perceived inadequacy of vocational-technical training, (3) the lack of awareness of and communication with other training  entities, and (4) turf issues.

        "author":["Rafaeli, Anat"],
        "description":"Although many modern occupations require employees to express particular types of emotions while doing their jobs, little empirical evidence exists about factors related to emotional behavior on the job. This study investigated the relationship between emotional displays (smiling, greeting, thanking, eye contact) of sales clerks and variables of clerk attributes, clerk behaviors, customer attributes, and contextual factors. Specifically, the relationships between clerk gender, customer gender, the wearing of a uniform, and the display of positive emotions were examined. The behavior of 1,319 sales clerks during their interactions with customers was observed and coded. Female clerks were observed displaying positive emotions significantly more frequently than were male clerks.  Male clients, however, were found to receive more positive emotional expressions than female clients. Employees were more likely to display positive emotions when wearing an organizational smock and a name tag. A lower level of positive emotional display was observed when a long line of customers was waiting or when a coworker was present. No relationship was observed between time of day and the display of positive emotion. The findings suggest that sex role socialization may generalize to behavior at work, especially the tendency of women to display a greater frequency of positive emotions, and the inclination of individuals of both sexes to attribute higher status to men. The findings also suggest that wearing organizational identifiers may be related to an increase in employees'  self-awareness and may therefore be worthy of further organizational research.

The first section, Global Issues, focuses on legal and ethical issues, as well as on arguments for and against the use of the label &quot;counselor&quot; when describing peer counselors. The second section, Pre-training Stage, examines the issues of how to enlist support for a peer counseling program, assess needs, and delineate objectives. Peer counselor selection process issues are also considered. The third section, Training Stage,  discusses issues related to the content and process of training, duration of training, and qualifications of trainers. Examples of training packages and widely used training manuals are included. The final section, Post-training Stage, examines the issues of tracking, supervision, peer duties, and special training topics.

        "description":"It is not uncommon for counselors to experience professional burnout due to a combination of circumstances including, among other things, unrealistic expectations, frustration, and a heavy workload. Society in general and schools in particular tend to emphasize accountability, measurable achievements, and quantitative results. This places a premium on systematic left brain thinking, but this pressure also contributes to counselor burnout. Through the use of fantasy into the future exercises, counselors can use their right brain imaginative and creative talents to enhance their self-esteem and to identify their values and goals. By synthesizing these right brain inputs with left brain logic and systematic planning, counselors can combat burnout and contribute to their own  well-being and the successful treatment of their clients.

A proportionate stratified cluster sample of older adults (N=456) were interviewed. Factors that might be predictive of program use, such as the respondent's awareness of the program, involvement or participation in groups, level of need, years of education, and control over one's life were examined. Analysis of variance showed that, compared to younger elderly  respondents, the oldest-old respondents had the greatest social and economic need and were least likely to actually use programs.

Little work investigating the concepts of self-control and self-efficacy has been done with the elderly in spite of the fact that coping strategies in the elderly have been associated with a variety of health and psychological factors. This study examined the relationship among self-control coping skills and the perception of chronic pain, self-reported physical health, and psychological adjustment in a population of community dwelling elderly (N=19). Eight subjects had a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee; 11 subjects were robust and healthy. All subjects were administered a battery of assessment instruments before and after the arthritic  patients had received pain control therapy. Data from the initial tests given to all subjects were analyzed to examine the relationship among the key variables without the component of treatment being a factor. The results showed that self-control and directive instrumental coping were critical factors in pain perception, physical health, and psychological adjustment. The data also suggest that social support is mediated by self-directing and coping mechanisms, and is not in itself the prime basis for adjustment, physical health, or pain perception. (NB)",

This study examined attributions for health behavior change by using retrospective reports to elicit college students' (N=466) current views of successes and failures at adopting health promoting behaviors. In completing the Health Behavior Questionnaire, 229 subjects provided details of a successful attempt to change a health behavior and 237 subjects provided details on an unsuccessful attempt. Subjects freely generated their own causal ascriptions and used the Causal Dimension Scale to locate their attributions on the dimensions of locus, stability, and controllability. Causal dimension scores indicated that the average attribution was internal, unstable, and controllable and that success  attributions were more stable and controllable than were failure attributions. This suggests a tendency to make attributions that enhance perceived control over health behavior outcomes. A self-serving attributional bias was observed for reports involving exercise and substance use, but not for eating. Successful road safety habit changes were more external, more stable, and less controllable than were unsuccessful changes. Stable attributions were associated with expectations that previous outcomes would continue into the future. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Some research on attribution processes has suggested that attributional search is exploratory behavior that serves adaptation and mastery motives. This study was conducted to investigate attributional search in reactions to success and failure after quitting smoking, to look for antecedents of attributional search other than expectancy and outcome, and to identify subjects' concerns about future outcomes. Sixty-one persons were telephoned 1.5 to 2 years after they had completed smoking cessation treatment and were asked to list the questions they asked themselves about the fact that they had quit smoking or continued to smoke. Number of attribution questions served as an index of attributional search and number of prediction questions was a marker for concern about the future. As  predicted, smokers who had relapsed after a period of abstinence asked the most attribution questions and ex-smokers who slipped but returned to abstinence asked the most prediction questions. These results are consistent with previous demonstrations that attributional search is stimulated by unexpected and negative events and that concern about the future follows unexpected success. Regression analyses showed that a more extensive attributional search was associated with smoking outcome, occurrence of a slip, and lighter smoking habit before treatment, and that higher concern about the future was connected with shorter duration of habitual smoking.

        "description":"Hoffman's (1975) theory holds that altruism is based on cognitive development and mechanisms for empathic distress present from birth, with the individual going through stages of personal distress, empathic concern, and perspective taking. The Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), a measure of empathy, contains four subscales: personal distress, empathic concern, perspective taking, and fantasy. The Hoffman model was tested using a Guttman scale structure and latent class methods applied to IRI responses. This study examined what theoretically relevant variables discriminate among the four latent classes of the unidimensional empathy model for people for whom the model has meaning, and how these variables appear differently in individuals for whom the model does not reflect  their socialization history. Data obtained from 94 college students who had completed the Nurturance and Succorance subscales from the Personality Research Form, the shortened form of the Marlowe-Crowne scale, and the Helping Orientation Questionnaire were analyzed. The unidimensional model of empathy was validated against measures of other relevant variables. More mature individuals by the Hoffman criteria scored higher in nurturance, succorance, and social responsibility. The model did not predict the pattern of responses to the IRI measure of empathy for approximately one-half of the subjects. Findings suggest that these unscalable types, who exhibited more nurturance and less succorance than the Hoffman types, were not typically low in prosocial traits relative to peers, but that they  had arrived at their developmental stage by a different socialization route.

The purpose of this study was to examine role and life satisfaction and stress in women involved in multiple life roles and, using an interactional theory of stress as a guideline, to explore the mediating effects of coping strategies, hardiness, and social support on these levels of stress and satisfaction. The sample included 111 female university faculty, research scientists, and administrators involved in multiple role lifestyles. Participants completed questionnaires assessing their levels of stress; general life, career, marital, parental, and  leisure role satisfaction; hardiness; social support; and typical coping strategies. Participants reported relatively low levels of stress and moderately high levels of satisfaction with their roles. Regression analyses revealed that the various forms of satisfaction were significantly predicted by hardiness and social support (p&lt;.05). Coping strategies were not a strong predictor for any of the satisfaction variables. Stress was significantly related to lack of hardiness and use of avoidance coping strategies for women (p&lt;.001). These results have implications for counseling multiple role women. (Author)",

Fifty male and 50 female subjects completed a variety of religious measures in addition to measures of empathy, guilt, and sex roles. Responses to the Personal Attributes Questionnaire were used to classify subjects as androgynous, masculine, or feminine. The results revealed that male subjects showed less religious concern and had lower scores on measures of empathy and other variables which  assessed orientation toward others than did female respondents. For traditional males, a sex-stereotypic self-description was found to be related to fundamentalist religious beliefs. These males also scored lower on measures that reflected concern for others than did any of the other sex-typing groups. Various aspects of an evangelical/fundamentalist worldview were also negatively associated with several measures that reflected an orientation to others.

These include the ideas that: (1) drug abuse is a progressive disease  and that gateway drugs are precursors of drug abuse; (2) drug education facts and techniques must be current; (3) social skills and refusal skills are essential; (4) programs must be designed to avoid the &quot;risky shift&quot; in group activities, a theory that groups have a tendency to take greater risks than do individuals; and (5) the message source may be as important as the message itself. In addition to careful program planning and educator training, schools and community agencies need to develop better fundraising and grantwriting skills in order to receive federal funding. States will also need to develop a long-term funding strategy to provide resources necessary for quality drug abuse prevention programs. Taxation on the gateway drugs of alcohol and tobacco may be the most logical  funding strategy in the long run. (Sixty-five references are listed.) (NB)",

        "description":"To evaluate the effectiveness of telephone crisis lines in reaching adolescents at risk for suicide, questionnaires were administered to 1,000 tenth grade students in a medium-sized southeastern city. A total of 837 questionnaires were completed. Questions concerned psychosocial background, symptoms of depression, suicide awareness, and attitudes toward crisis lines. Of the 11.6% of students who reported having attempted suicide, 41% said they would call a crisis line service for help. In comparison, 37.3% of students without a history of suicide attempt said they would use this service. While a majority of respondents said they would not call a crisis line service, a significant percentage of students (56.9%) reported that they would first confide their suicidal intentions to a  friend. The most common reasons students gave for not calling a crisis line was that they did not want to talk to a stranger. In addition, there was a general lack of knowledge about the existence of the crisis line service, its purpose, confidentiality of calls, and policies concerning the use of tracing procedures. These findings support the need for a school-based suicide education and prevention program that could both publicize the crisis line service and teach adolescents how to help a suicidal friend.

The results indicated no significant predictors of self-esteem among males. Among females, the significant predictors of self-esteem were the number of hours of work, age, and curricular track (college preparatory, general, business, vocational-technical).  Being older, working fewer hours, and being in the business or vocational versus the general or college preparatory curricular track were associated with higher levels of self-esteem for females. Sex differences in the predictor variables were significant. Neither participation nor involvement in extracurricular activities were significantly associated with adolescent self-esteem. (NB)",

The SCI was administered to college freshmen (N=213) who became involved in a retention management program comprised of faculty-student interaction, an orientation program, and appropriate use of resources. Results indicated that the SCI was able to accurately identify at-risk students; significant differences were found between scores of those who persisted and those who did not. Additionally, total retention increased from 61% in 1984 to 76.3% in 1986. Based on the significance of these results, it appears that dropout-prone students can  be accurately identified at an early stage in their college careers, and a positive effect on retention can be achieved when a comprehensive program aimed toward the social and academic integration of students is initiated by the faculty of an institution.

A significant main effect for sex indicated that women were more liberal; there was neither a main effect of race nor a sex x race interaction. Results are consistent with previous research suggesting that as blacks are more fully integrated with the white community, blacks will assume some of the same sex role attitudes of whites, and race may not be a factor in large urban areas.

The objective of the program is to expand the service options available to older people by letting market forces determine what services are needed. Currently, services available to the elderly are based upon what reimbursement programs will cover, rather than the elderly's total needs. Eleven home health agencies are participating in this demonstration. The most common services being offered are house-based products, such as minor home repair, heavy chores, and handyman services. Case management and caregiver education programs are also being  offered, as are a wide range of additional services, such as personal emergency response systems, transportation, and personal affairs management. The services offered under this program have been developed in response to the demands expressed by a private market. Use of this approach, rather than relying on provider determined &quot;needs&quot; has led to a different array of services than traditionally are provided by home health agencies. At the same time, this program was also intended to develop non-medical types of services since the framework for acute care services at home is fairly well-developed. (Author/ABL)",

Three scripts, which differed with respect to intimacy and were adapted from actual interviews were used as stimuli. Using a 2 (two counselors) x 3 (low versus moderate versus intense levels of problem intimacy) analogue, these pseudoclients reported more favorable dispositions toward therapy solely as a function of the intimacy of  the presenting problem. Generally, when clients' presenting concerns were highly intimate in nature, therapists were viewed as less attractive and trustworthy. Results seem to validate the clinical observations that following significant self-relevations, clients have a tendency to pull back.

This study compared a group of parasuicides who mastered their presenting problems within 3 months after the key episode with a group who had not and examined some of the underlying psychopathology and its relationship to repetition of suicidal behavior. Subjects were parasuicides (N=228) who presented at hospitals and were interviewed within 3 days of the event or as soon as detoxification allowed. Subjects were asked to name up to three problems which they considered responsible for the episode and to complete a variety of psychological tests which were repeated at the end of 3 months. Results of predisposing or triggering problems that precipitated deliberate self-harm  seemed to depend on more acute versus chronic problems, a sense of mastery and relatively low self-dislike. Compared to non-resolvers, resolvers experienced better fortune, with fewer new stresses and more improvements, which may also have been related to better coping and to the mastery of their initial problems. Nevertheless, one in six persons of either group repeated. They turned out to be people who began deliberate self-harm earlier in life and resorted to it more often. Their shorter prodromes suggest lower thresholds. Externally directed hostility and externally attributed control over their lives also distinguished repeaters. At 3 months they were predictably found to be characterized by poor social adjustment and dislike of themselves. (ABL)",

This study compared the moral reasoning, identity formation, and role traditionality of pregnant (N=8) and non-pregnant (N=9) adolescent females ranging in age from 14-18. Subjects who were more highly developed in identity were also likely to be higher in moral reasoning, but lower in role traditionality. Pregnant adolescents  were more likely to be rated higher on the interpersonal components of identity status than on the occupation portion; non-pregnant females showed a greater orientation toward occupational goals. The groups were indistinguishable in terms of role traditionality. Plans are underway to extend this study to a larger and more cooperative sample. Results from this line of inquiry will strengthen the conceptual links among moral reasoning, identity formation and sex role, as well as increasing understanding of the developmental features of adolescent sexuality.

The introduction presents two case studies of adolescents who have attempted suicide and background on the nuclear family's need for a health kin system in order to adapt successfully to major life transitions. The next section discusses current research on what propels youth to suicide and what prevents suicide, highlighting the disrupted kin network of the two adolescents presented earlier. Next, aspects of a healthy functioning kin network which functions as a  good suicide deterrent is described. The rationale for the Systemic Crisis Intervention Program is presented. The treatment model, consisting of these parts is discussed: (1) providing an immediate emergency response which serves to maintain family members' anxiety within manageable limits; (2) mobilizing extended family members to become involved in the crisis; and (3) restructuring kin system relationships to provide successful long-term solutions to the current crisis. The effectiveness of the program was examined using 47 adolescents accepted for treatment and the results of the evaluation are discussed which showed that during the follow-up period of more than one year only two subjects engaged in suicidal behavior, neither of which resulted in physical harm, and that family and  marital functioning improved during the treatment phase.

In the fall of 1987, the department conducted a study of the characteristics of students who had dropped out of the district. Subjects consisted of 103 students who had dropped out of high school in the 1986-1987 school year and 31 students who had dropped out and were in the process of reentering district programs. Most of the students who dropped out had been in the district since elementary school, but had attended several district schools. They generally reported their school experiences to be more positive at the elementary level when  compared to intermediate and high school. Many students reported difficulty moving from intermediate to high school. An exceptionally high percentage of students had been retained, with over 50% of the boys having repeated a grade at least once. Many subjects reported that their schools could have done nothing to help them stay in school. The reasons students gave for dropping out fell into the areas of school-related, family, and personal problems. Findings suggest that there is no single dropout profile and that many students leave school for other than academic reasons. Most dropouts in the study reported that they would advise potential dropouts to stay in school. A large number of the students were back in school again or had already graduated. (NB)",

        "description":"This paper begins by noting that recent efforts in the United States to reduce the incidence of alcohol-impaired driving have not been very effective and suggests that for efforts to be effective, they must raise the actual risk of punishment to a level that cannot be ignored by potential offenders. It then describes an effective system of controls on alcohol-impaired driving begun in Australia which includes extensive use of random breath testing for all drivers. Discussion is focused on efforts in three Australian states where 70% of the population resides. Approaches adopted by Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland are described and data on fatal road crashes in each state over the past 15 years are presented. It is noted that when the program was implemented in New South  Wales in 1982, road crash fatalities dropped 20% and the rate has remained at this lower level for the past 5 years. An important factor in the success of the program is the perception of increased risk of arrest for alcohol-impaired driving. Public agreement with the policy of random breath testing is discussed and a rise in agreement from 70% of drivers in 1979 to the current level of about 95% agreement is described. Legal problems to initiating programs of random breath testing in the United States are considered and the Australian experience with random breath testing is presented a a potentially valuable source of guidance for American efforts to improve the credibility and effectiveness of laws dealing with alcohol-impaired driving.

It begins with a brief overview of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders causing dementia and gives actual and projected figures on the incidence of such disorders in the United States. The goals of public policy related to dementia are explained and federal policy priorities, reasons for the increased interest in dementia, and policy interest in dementia are discussed. A section defining dementia presents symptoms of dementia and lists disorders that may cause dementia. The course of the dementia-causing illnesses is traced. The magnitude of the problem of dementia is considered, with sections looking at the prevalence of dementia and  the costs of dementia, including overall costs; costs of diagnosis, drugs and medical services, nursing home care, and informal long-term care; and costs to the government. A section on coordinating services for those with dementia considers the care system; presents an inventory of services; and examines senior, acute care, long-term care, social, and mental health services. Groups of special concern are identified, including those without families, minorities, those experiencing dementia onset in middle age, rural populations, veterans, low income groups, and caregivers. Policy issues are considered in the areas of: (1) special programs for dementia; (2) diagnosis and treatment; (3) legal and ethical concerns; (4) education and training; (5) delivery of long-term care; (6) biomedical  research; and (7) health services research.

Two hundred of the dropouts and 200 of the graduates comprised a special subsample of Franco-Ontarians; data for this subsample is examined separately in the report. The report is divided into 10 sections. Part 1, Introduction, discusses research limitations and describes characteristics of the sample. Part 2 examines family and demographic background. Part 3 looks at the  consequences of dropping out in the areas of employment, occupation and income, gender differences in occupation and income, and marital status. Part 4 discusses attitudes toward education. Part 5 looks at the types of schools attended by respondents, the courses they took, and their grades. Part 6 considers the situation and attitudes of dropouts and part 7 looks at the dropouts' later education experiences. Part 8 describes the non-dropouts. Part 9 examines family structure and support. A summary and discussion are included in part 10. (NB)",

The management process involved a series of seven handouts, used across the semester, making obligations clear and tracking progress and reactions. These were: a student data sheet; a course overview; an assignment sheet; a check sheet for key terms and questions; a summary of completed assignments; a student/teacher conference sheet; and a final examination  project sheet. The instructional process emphasized self-questioning strategies, word-learning skills, listening and note-taking skills, library skills, test-taking techniques, and time management skills.

        "description":"A study examined the relationship between cultural schemata and the reading process to identify the strategies proficient readers employ to develop their understanding of culturally familiar and unfamiliar passages and to examine those strategies in relation to the cultural backgrounds of the readers and the cultural perspectives of the reading materials. Subjects, 30 American and 30 Palauan eleventh grade students (from the Paulau Islands) identified by their teachers as proficient readers, read and responded to a passage concerning funeral rites of the other culture. The subjects' think-aloud protocols and post-reading retelling were analyzed in four phases: (1) phase 1 produced a taxonomy of 22 processing strategies and five categories of strategies; (2) phase 2 determined  statistically significant differences in the frequency with which subjects used these strategies when reading culturally familiar and unfamiliar passages; (3) phase 3 identified three patterns in the manner in which individual subjects used the strategies to construct their interpretations of the passages; and (4) phase 4 revealed statistically significant differences in the number of idea units, elaborations, and distortions which appeared in the subjects' retellings. Results indicated that cultural schemata influence the processing strategies readers employ and the level of comprehension they achieve, and that comprehension monitoring strategies seem to provide the strategic scaffolding readers require to develop a unified meaning of text when they lack sufficient background knowledge.

(initial teaching alphabet), certain influences exist which contribute to lasting improvements in reading and writing. Several factors can help to distinguish trends from the more permanent influences on education. A historical perspective is necessary for a sound research-based reading and writing curriculum to meet the needs of changing populations. It is also necessary to strive for greater language precision when discussing literacy and learning disabilities. Other cultures, languages, and customs must be explored in order to teach reading and writing effectively to a diverse population. All of these factors should be considered when training  reading and writing teachers at all levels. (A 27-item bibliography is attached.) (MM)",

        "description":"Understanding the literacy process and using the child as the informant will ensure a better learning experience. Two fundamental assumptions of language learning provide a base for understanding the literacy process. Firstly, the decisions a child makes while searching for meaning in a literacy event are the same ones made by an adult, involving the following cognitive strategies: a constant search for meaning, hypothesis testing, alteration of ideas because of hypothesis testing, and taking risks. Secondly, there are eight patterns within the literacy process that all language learners incorporate: (1) organization; (2) intentionality; (3) generativeness (engagement and reengagement in the event); (4) risk-taking; (5) social action; (6) demonstration; (7) context; and (8) text.  In order to make the best possible judgments concerning curriculum and evaluation, the child should be the source of information. Educators should know what the child's background knowledge consists of, and what strategies children use in their literacy processes that are either conducive and detrimental to success. Educators should watch the child involved in the process in as natural a setting as possible, ensure that ownership of the process remains with the child, and test their own educational assumptions while interacting and observing. These approaches will give the educator a far more complete picture of the learner than the best-written basal. (SR)",

        "description":"Progress charts are an effective means of dramatizing student effort and improvement in reading and are especially important for remedial reading students, who need concrete evidence of progress. Remedial reading students often need extrinsic reward, and since reading is a complex act, progress charts lend themselves to the element of reward and to the recording of successes in specific reading skills. Student involvement and choice of theme are important in progress chart construction. Charts should be based on students' interests and designed and created by the students themselves using such ordinary materials as poster board and felt markers. Units of improvement chosen to be recorded on the chart should be small enough so that progress can be recorded at frequent intervals.  For example, if a child is interested in baseball, the progress chart can be designed as a baseball diamond, with the student scoring a home run for each book read. In this way, the student is rewarded for small steps taken in the reading process and his or her successful efforts are recognized visually. (Three illustrations of progress charts are included.)

Results indicated that significant differences do exist between books of literary merit children like and those they do not like. These differences were more readily apparent in characteristics of style and structure than for themes. In addition, children liked predictable qualities, an optimistic tone, a lively pace, action-oriented structure and complete resolution.

        "description":"Metaphorically, the head and the heart represent different decision-making strategies. The disjunction between these two cultures is both sharp and unnecessary. The conflict between rationality and emotion is much broader than the tension between critical thinking and values analysis, but the assumptions responsible for the mutual awkwardness of the processes are almost identical. Critical thinking and values analysis must be joined for either to provide the guidance to decision-making that aficionados of each have promised. There are several manifestations, including critical thinking and social science texts, educational assumptions, and pejorative references to emotion, that show: (1) the conflict between reliance on critical thinking or values analysis as guides for  intelligent description-making; and (2) the depth of the disagreement between partisans of the affective and cognitive domains. Teaching students a healthy respect for critical thinking and values analysis can help them make use of a more complete version of their analytical abilities and demonstrate to them the efficacy of both critical thinking and values analysis.

However, little research has been done to indicate the impact of college on students' critical thinking skills. A study conducted at a midwestern university measured the critical thinking capability of college seniors. Subjects, 37 volunteers derived from a previous study, had their critical thinking ability measured by an original essay question designed to force the students to indicate what cognitive processes they go through, and what questions they ask when engaged in critical evaluation. The analysis of their responses was divided into two scoring categories: specific criticisms and general criticisms. The results indicated (1) that 40% of the sample identified at least one  appropriate general criticism and 17% identified more than one; (2) the students' specific criticisms showed a general failure to focus on definitional issues; (3) that many seniors lack fundamental critical thinking skills; and (4) that while most students were able to identify some flaws in statistical reasoning, they generally failed to recognize ambiguities, questionable assumptions, and value preferences--important components of critical evaluation.

        "description":"A study examined whether children increased their vocabularies as a result of hearing unfamiliar words within the oral context of a story and observed the oral strategies the children employed as they attempted to define a new word. Subjects, 64 males and 64 females, were from self-contained third-grade classrooms in public schools in a small town in the northwest. They were divided into experimental and control groups. An oral posttest measured the extent to which children acquired meaning through oral context. Oral context consisted of listening to a tape of the children's books, &quot;Solomon the Rusty Nail&quot; and &quot;The Legend of the Veery Bird.&quot; The posttests were scored for word meaning and for sentence recognition. Results indicated that the children who heard the story from which  the words and sentences were taken had a better understanding of those words and recognized sentences from that story better than the children who had heard the other story. Gender was also a significant source of variance for both stories. The posttest scores of males were significantly higher than those of the females. Findings suggest that the process of meaning acquisition does begin with the first encounter with an unfamiliar word within the context of a children's book. In this study, recognition of a sentence from the story indicated a step in the process of the development of word meaning. (One figure, five tables of data and 31 references are attached.) (RAE)",

        "description":"The prevailing assumption underlying practice in the classroom is that children acquire most of their new words from context during silent reading. The trouble with learning from silent reading is that many pupils do not read widely or quickly enough. Reading aloud to children will, however, allow them to participate in activity that they all can share in, and if some vocabulary acquisition also occurs at this time, then the less avid silent readers may well learn as much vocabulary as the enthusiastic ones. A study (with 188 children in all) was undertaken in New Zealand to explore (1) how much new vocabulary children learn from context while listening to stories; (2) how much difference it made if the teacher discussed the new word in passing; (3) whether the learning was  permanent; and (4) how much the weaker readers learned relative to the good ones. Two new books were chosen (with a range of difficult words) and read to students--one with discussion and one without. Students were then given a posttest a week later. Findings indicated that much vocabulary acquisition does occur during the enjoyable experience of listening to suitable stories read aloud to the class and that teachers' explanations add substantially to the level of acquisition. Findings also showed that the lower ability children learn as many words, or more, than the bright children, and that the learning is long-term. (MS)",

Initially, curricular congruence should be firmly established so that learning center staff and classroom teachers mutually support the use of school time for developing students' fluency. In addition, sustained silent reading and paired repeated reading are specific strategies to consider for remedial students who already have experienced failure. Conversely, maintenance of reading levels, reading recovery, and paired reading are useful suggestions for children who are at risk of failing. These approaches, if used positively, can benefit students in remedial and preventive ways.

A by-product of the project, funded with money from the Library Services and Construction Act, was the development of an instructional manual for use by library staff, volunteer coordinators, and activity directors interested in conducting read-aloud programs. Staff and volunteers conducted 372 programs for 3,396 residents in 9 months, with volunteers contributing 90% of the programming time. The results of  the project led to its incorporation into the overall outreach program of the library and the creation of an annotated bibliography of more than 200 titles appropriate for read-aloud programs.

        "description":"The stasis, stock, kinetic, spectator, and dialectic responses to literature all serve to deny the popular misconception that literary analysis invariably deals a death blow to the vitally engaged, spontaneous, and thus authentic response. Stasis is a response in which an intuited imaginative identity between subject and object develops in an almost instantaneous recognition of the entire form of the literary work. The stock response exists at a pre-critical level, and concerns itself with cliched thought and ego-massage. Kinetic response involves compulsive action and engagement through visceral states and pseudo-feeling. The spectator response is detached and disinterested, and operates at the critical level. The dialectic response incorporates intellectual and emotional  working through to attain imaginative identity and oscillates between engagement and detachment. The dialectic response to literature is the only response that moves between all levels (precritical, critical, postcritical, and autonomous). Actual student responses to Sinclair Ross's short story &quot;The Painted Door&quot; and John Updike's story &quot;A&amp;P&quot; illustrate the variety of responses possible in the literature classroom.

A survey was distributed to all journalists working for the three newspapers (38 of 205 surveys were returned for an 18.5% response rate). Although factor analysis results indicated that having a role in the development process was considered important by respondents, there was relatively little development news in the three newspapers.

The survey was pre-tested on 30 minority journalists outside Ohio, then administered to 154 minority journalists at 15 newspapers (with circulation over 25,000) and 26 television stations in Ohio. Minority contacts within the various institutions distributed the questionnaires. Response rate was 44%. The questionnaire was divided into four parts: racial discrimination items; job satisfaction items;  communication satisfaction items; and general information. Results indicated that although Ohio minority journalists perceived racial discrimination in the workplace, they were satisfied with their jobs and job-related communication. Sex, the existence of an affirmative action plan in their company, years in journalism, and the number of minorities in the newsroom were all partially or strongly related to the perception of racial discrimination or job satisfaction or communication satisfaction, or all three elements. The single most important factor affecting job and communication satisfaction and the perception of racial discrimination was whether respondents thought their company's affirmative action plan was working well.

Philosopher of education James Gribble would rather risk some form of aestheticism than allow that a great work of literature could be viewed in such a way that it (or what it 'presents') could legitimately be rejected in the light of a moral code. &quot;Literary literacy&quot; encompasses both engagement and detachment, both the feeling of coming to know certain &quot;truths&quot; about oneself and/or the world, and getting distance on that feeling. The acquisition of literary literacy would enable students to read literature as assertion, as a form of knowing, and as hypothesis, as a form of  questioning. Awareness of the political context of the engaged reader is a first step in respecting each other's imaginative and psychological identities. Now that engagement with the text has been established as a fact of reading life, learning to stand outside engagement may be one of the basics students move ahead to. A definition of literary literacy encompassing the goals of transformation and enculturation by way of a pedagogy of engagement and detachment might help keep those odds even. In actual censorship cases, educators should maintain consistency and acknowledge their own political investment in the literature curriculum. (RAE)",

        "description":"A literary communication model cannot adjudicate the conflicting claims of transformation and enculturation: that literature is intrinsically educational, that it conduces to psychic growth as a process, irrespective of subject matter and free from the dangers of indoctrination, but that the imperative to make it instrumental to political ends necessitates stacking the curricular deck. Both the goals of transformation and enculturation can, however, be accommodated by the notion of literature as a dream for awakened minds. What requires resolution is how badly the dream is wanted and how conscious of that dream students are allowed to become, how much educators and parents are willing to risk the way things are in order to let happen the way things might be. Like literacy itself,  response to literature is a deeply ambivalent enterprise. Increased attention to how literary texts are experienced and understood will perhaps alleviate the anxiety associated with such ambivalence. Using Alfred North Whitehead's three stages of mastering a discipline--romance, precision, and generalization--brings to mind the politics of engagement as moving literature educators from the first stage of romancing the response to the stage of precision--to confronting the issue of literature's ambiguous explosive power. Students must enjoy reading, to be sure; otherwise they don't read, but they must also be reading epistemologists--at least of their own reading--such that managing their own literary responses becomes one of the basics they move ahead to.

The analysis consisted of 335 letters; 240 were&quot;published&quot; and 95 were &quot;rejected.&quot; The survey consisted of a questionnaire to which 269 of the letter writers responded. Findings showed: (1) letters to the editors are written by a group of people above the norm in education, income, age, and community stability; (2) a majority believe that the open forum is not a good gauge of general opinion; (3) published writers were more likely than the unpublished ones to write letters opposing something in the newspaper; (4) published writers tended to write based on some expertise more than the unpublished letter writers; and (5) those whose letters were rejected tended to be more likely to submit a cathartic letter.

        "description":"Investigating the differences between students' conventional responses to the identification of writing topics and their responses to matters of real concern (as revealed through the use of &quot;lifewriting&quot; processes in the classroom), an exploratory study surveyed 455 eleventh and twelfth grade students at three large urban high schools. Students listed possible writing topics on 3 x 5 cards. After a class discussion about significant places, people, or turning-points in their lives, students wrote their final topic choice on the back of the card. (In the pilot study, three ninth grade classes simply listed their first topic choice.) Cards which contained both responses (61% of all cards) were analyzed, comparing initial and final topic choices. Initial choices included: (1)  dreams; (2) fears and frustrations; (3) family relationships; (4) first experiences; and (5) vacations. The students' final topics included drugs, summer holidays, and family and pets, with grade 12 students emphasizing &quot;putting one's life in order,&quot;&quot;concern with finances,&quot; and &quot;My Very First...&quot; (love or car). Results indicated that students were struggling to find things in their lives to write about. (Appendixes include a handout describing lifewriting, a description of the lifewriting project, and instructions to the teachers involved in the study.) (MM)",

        "author":["Abbott, Eric A."],
        "description":"Despite their important role in the community, there have been a number of economic cycles and population shifts which have resulted in rural communities losing their weekly newspapers. An exploratory case study examined a small Iowa community of 450 persons which launched a volunteer newspaper nearly 10 years ago. The experiences of this community are seen as a possible model for other small communities which desire a newspaper, but are too small to support a commercial weekly newspaper. The study was divided into two main parts. The first part, using a series of interviews with persons instrumental in creating and operating the volunteer newspaper, was aimed at explaining how the newspaper came into existence and how it had survived its first decade. The second part consisted  of a mail survey of all 427 subscribers to the volunteer newspaper. Results indicated that the newspaper has high readership in terms of both time and types of items. Although it has its highest readership among the elderly, most of whom have lived in the community for many years, its overall level of readership is also high--at least comparable to that of commercial weekly newspapers and urban neighborhood newspapers as shown in previous studies. These results suggest that a volunteer newspaper may be a viable model for meeting the communication needs of persons living in communities too small for a commercial newspaper. (Seven tables of data are included, and 17 references are appended.) (MS)",

Exploring both poetry and the AIDS epidemic can make all students more aware, more human, and more sensitive. Community college teachers have the opportunity to be on the forefront of an educational campaign to inform people about both AIDS and poetry. Rather than using literature specifically about AIDS, such as Larry Kramer's play, &quot;The Normal Heart,&quot; or novels that speak about living and dying with AIDS, it is possible to use more traditional and timeless literature as  examples, such as the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop, Walt Whitman, D.H. Lawrence and others. Elizabeth Bishop's poetry, for example, is capable of bringing a new perspective to these issues. It can help accomplish the objectives of teaching something directly about the human condition and indirectly about AIDS and the lives of gay and lesbian students.

        "description":"In order to investigate the effects of computer technology on the composing processes of students in grades 8 and 12, a study compared students' writing in two conditions (writing by pen and writing by word processor), specifically addressing the questions of whether computer use led to an increase in revision and/or an improvement in quality. Data were collected over one academic year from 13 classes, including pre- and posttests and all course compositions, and subjected to varying kinds of analysis. Extensive classroom observations produced descriptions of differing pedagogies, codings of classroom writing behaviors, and video recordings of specific students' writing behaviors. Results of revision analysis revealed that, for all grade levels, there were more changes in essays  written entirely by pen than in those written by computer. However, the number of revisions in essays that were begun by pen and revised on the computer approached that in essays written by pen. Coding of students' behaviors as they wrote indicated that the computer diverted a significant amount of time from the task of composing, and that for many students the correction of typographical errors was a persistent interruption of their composing with a computer. Conclusions include the recommendation that a specialized pedagogy be developed to guide the teaching of writing with a computer. (Thirty-seven tables are included and 60 references are provided. Fifteen appendixes include instructions for the pre- and posttests; the rhetorical instrument used; tables of comparative data; and an  interview protocol and questionnaire. (SR)",

        "description":"In the comparative hearing, the mechanism traditionally used by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to choose the best applicant for a broadcast license or frequency allocation, the virtues of each candidate are compared using several criteria, such as integration of ownership and management, but weight has never been fixed to the different criteria. Consequently the comparative hearing process has produced uneven and unpredictable results, and has been subject to much criticism. The comparative hearing process appears to be a good candidate for use of a computer-based decision support system (DSS) using the PrefCalc application program. PrefCalc can have a valid function in discriminating competing applications for a broadcast license. A major caveat is that it relies on  qualitative data, and another potential problem is one of comparability. One approach that may be valid would be to have individual decision makers rank each alternative on each criterion. The mean score on each criterion could be used in subsequent analyses. With the constraint of having to process thousands of applications in a short period of time, the FCC could use quantitative criteria and the modeling tool of additive utility theory to allocate licenses quickly, efficiently, and fairly.

        "description":"Using radon (a naturally-occurring radioactive gas linked to lung cancer) as the health risk factor, a study examined which risk-taking tendencies interact with different health-risk message strategies. A phone survey pretested 837 randomly selected homeowners from three Florida counties with the highest levels of radon in the state (706 agreed to continue the study). Sixteen message conditions were manipulated from four experimental factors: (1) message source (newspaper article or government brochure); (2) health hazard target (children or adults); (3) complexity of comparative risks (smoking and x-rays, or nuclear power); and (4) specificity of information about actions to reduce the risk (a detailed step-by-step plan or an address for further information). Subjects were  mailed questions based on one of the 16 message manipulations (with a 44.9% response rate). Some 317 persons returned the test booklets. Questions concerning media dependencies, personality attributes, home construction, and demographic attributes were measured, along with two dependent variables: fear of radon and estimates of the likelihood that the risk would affect the subject's own home. Risk-taking tendencies were measured by questions concerning personal freedom, sense of control, and sensation seeking. Results revealed that the risk-taking tendencies of adventurousness, impulsiveness, and rebelliousness interacted with message source, risk schema complexity, and target to affect estimates of the likelihood that the risk was a threat, and self-reported fear resulting from the risk.

Three perspectives are used to explain the model: structure and organization, workshop, and pedagogical philosophy. The paper utilizes experience at WCWS, the College of Wooster's (Ohio) 890 watt FM-stereo radio station, as the example for the model. The paper suggests that the management and operation of the campus radio station, practically and officially the students' domain (in this case), provides a unique opportunity to engage in experiential education that presents an immediate link between core concepts in the communication discipline and its practical aspects. The  paper concludes that students can gain hands-on experience in a variety of ways, including casting programs, engineering programs, producing shows, supervising the operation of others, and acquiring managerial and communication skills.

        "description":"Historically, radio broadcasting has been affected by innovational, social, technological, and economic change. For instance, FM (frequency modulation) radio emerged out of a desire to free broadcasting of static noise common to AM (amplitude modulation) signals. The eventual response by AM was to improve the technology of the signal. The inquiry for the feasibility of stereo broadcasting for AM and the suitable technological standard to set began in 1977. By 1982 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revealed an intention to allow the marketplace to decide the fate of AM stereo. During these years several actions by the FCC indicated that it was uncertain of its proper regulatory role. The process of wrestling with whether to set a technological standard led the FCC to  question its own responsibility in such matters. Ultimately, the FCC determined that it was not responsible for the success or failure of any particular technology and that the proper technology selection should be passed on to the marketplace.

        "description":"Most of the &quot;talk&quot; about the role of mass media in the Third World is generated by politicians rather than by professional communicators. The &quot;Developmental Play Model&quot; treats media experience as an encounter with the &quot;self&quot; and considers the &quot;self&quot; as an integral part of the mass communication process. The Developmental Play Model calls for separation of communication from information, of opinion from fact. Development is measured in terms of the growth of the self and therefore deals with matters of self-image, motivation, pleasure, and the creation of, and pride in, culture. Information processing in this model is a phase that precedes attitude formation. The process starts at the psychological level, moves to the social level, and ends at the physical level. The Developmental  Play Model consists of two major stages: one that shows how the process starts at the psychological reality level and one that probes the motivational process. A major difference between this model and the dominant linear models is that the former takes attitudes as its principal component while the latter takes information or messages as its principal component. The major contribution of this model is its attempt to solve the problem of motivation, by using local culture as a principal motivator to media exposure, rather than by importing foreign cultures.

        "description":"Several critical questions are raised by the proliferation of communications internships, yet the question of grading and evaluating internships is one that can be answered by examining the Media Program at Loyola College in Maryland. Although the communications curriculum was not fully developed until the 1986-87 academic year, enrollments in the program increased dramatically in 1983-84, when internship opportunities were expanded. In examining the grades college-wide for Loyola interns, a pattern emerged indicating that internships resulted in grade inflation, a danger which can undermine respect for a discipline. The Writing/Media Department addressed this problem by asking internships' supervisors to rate intern performance in 20 categories (including resourcefulness,  graphic and editing skills, and ability to contribute to the organization), using a 1-5 numerical rating system, instead of giving the interns a final letter grade. The evaluator's focus thus shifted from the consideration of an overall grade to a specific appraisal of attributes that indicate successful professional performance. After implementation of this grading procedure, registration for media internships decreased from the usual 25 to 8 for the fall 1987 semester, indicating that grades may have been a factor in the extensive participation in the internship program.

Purchases of television sets are rising, replacing radios as the new consumer status symbol. Modernization under Deng Xiaoping's administration has been critical in the development of the television industry; like all of China's mass communications systems, the television industry is operated by the government. Television is becoming less political and more a  source of entertainment, although news is still the subject of greatest interest across all media, followed by sports, entertainment, and educational programming.

Respondents answered approximately 40 questions. An index of risk (defined as the extent to which an individual reported behaviors that put him or her at risk of getting AIDS) was formed from responses to five questions concerning sexual behavior, blood transfusions, and intravenous drug use over the past seven years. Other measures consisted of: &quot;risky&quot; attitudes toward AIDS; knowledge of AIDS; and exposure to each of three major daily news media (newspapers, and local and  national television news programs). Results revealed that a majority of the variance in risk for AIDS was predicted by demographics and lifestyles, issue salience, knowledge of AIDS, and attitudes toward gambling with one's health. Significantly influencing risk for AIDS were the salience of the AIDS issue, newspaper use, and a gambling attitude. (Four tables of data and 33 references are appended.) (MM)",

As children become more sensitive to the speaker-listener relationship, they will realize the overlap to the writer-reader context. This awareness demonstrates to students that the broadly based language arts are a better source of support than is isolated fragmentation. Children need direct exposure to activities that guide them to think more specifically about their intended listeners. Teachers  can form intraclass groups and motivate speakers to interact with other students by: (1) modeling the intended behaviors of the audience; (2) observing students to determine how well they apply the newly learned behaviors; (3) providing students with much guided practice until they demonstrate facility with reading outlines and drafts of speeches and making pertinent comments; and (4) guiding students to communicate to a unique public, such as pre-school children.

For him, to be a rhetorician is to direct toward good or evil and to be a rhetorical critic is to determine whether that direction is the &quot;right one&quot; and/or judge whether the rhetorician &quot;is a master of his art.&quot; To determine if the rhetorical critic's rhetoric is a reflection of the critic's view of reality it is necessary to address whether a Weaverian model of ethical criticism based on standards for ethical rhetoric can be applied to rhetorical critics' critiques in order to classify types of critics in light of their value system (philosophical orientation or metaphysics). The Weaverian model would have three ascending levels of criticism: description/reconstruction, analysis, and  evaluation. Weaver's all-encompassing standard for ethical rhetoric is the obligation for the rhetorician to acknowledge the metaphysical reality of truth, the ideal good. Weaver continually points out that rhetoric has intention and that noble rhetoric's intention is to point toward ultimate metaphysical reality. These standards and the three levels of criticism will not only be useful to label types of critics, but also to classify their metaphysical dreams. This model demonstrates both that every member of a culture has a responsibility for what he says, and that what he says is a reflection of who he is. (Sixty-three notes are included.) (MS)",

Specifically, the study examined the results of trafficking behavior on station prices. The study analyzed 26 cases where stations were traded at least twice (involving periods of ownership of three years of less) during the period of 1973-1986, and for which full information on the original purchase price and the later sale price was available. Other  measures considered the influence of various factors, including network affiliation, and whether the current owner or purchaser owned other media properties at the time of sale. The influence of competing stations and cable penetration were measured by the change in number of competing stations and the change in cable penetration levels from the time the station was originally purchased to the time at which it was sold. Results indicated that no statistically significant difference existed in the station price growth rates of &quot;traffickers&quot; and other owners. In fact, controlling for the influence of other factors, &quot;traffickers&quot; appeared to achieve marginally lower growth rates than other owners. (Two tables of data are included.) (MM)",

        "description":"Dada was a collective movement among avant-garde artists who rejected the existing culture of post-World War I Europe on the grounds that it belonged to the same society that had produced the war. This paper discusses Dada typography in relation to typography's role and function in the history of printing, the changes resulting from the industrialization of the printing industry, and the accelerated volume of commercial activity in the nineteenth century. Dada typographic experimentation is contrasted with traditional typography conventions and is compared with the typographic works of the adjacent movements of Futurism and Constructivism. The paper describes and analyzes Dada typography and its application in various publications and art media in the context of the traditional  conventions it sought to break and how it broke them. Dada's typographic innovations are discussed in terms of their initial rejection and eventual incorporation by other movements to create the new typography. Twenty-six notes and 11 figures are included, and 15 references are appended. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"Focusing on educational settings, this paper examines receiver apprehension (anxiety associated with the decoding, interpreting, and/or adjusting psychologically to messages sent by others). The first section, in a review of the literature, discusses the theoretical basis for receiver apprehension. A summary of educational consequences is contained in the second section, indicating that while educational consequences have not been specified, receiver apprehension has been associated with decrements in measures of academic achievement and with higher levels of test anxiety. The third section presents a typology of potential educational outcomes of receiver apprehension, characterized into major educational domains based upon the conceptual nature of receiver apprehension. Three  figures are included. Twenty-nine references and a 31-item comprehensive bibliography of empirical research on receiver apprehension are attached. (SR)",

Subjects, 92 female and 96 male faculty, 133 female and 136 male staff, and 100 students in the sophomore, junior, and senior classes filled out questionnaires designed to provide information about various understandings, perceptions and experiences regarding gender communication. The project was initiated by the Human Relations Coordinator who had recently assumed the responsibility of the equal opportunity office. Return rate was very high--between 70-75%. First, gender communication was defined at St. Olaf as &quot;appropriate relationships between men and women in the St. Olaf community setting.&quot; This implied that  the scope of the issue was broader than sexual harassment or discrimination and included such relationships as casual, day-to-day interactions. Second, the issue included interactions of genders and did not focus only on females or identify one gender as the oppressed and the other as an oppressor. Third, since gender communication does not occur in isolated segments of the community, all units were included in the study. The study provided information that resulted in improved understanding of the climate at St. Olaf and that can be used as a basis for future decisions. The information obtained from this project should encourage other institutions to think of their campus climate for gender communication in a similar broad perspective.

The program was developed and completed its first year of operation in both the Fargo (ND) and Moorhead (MN) areas. Materials were developed so that any teacher, regardless of experience in communication or critical thinking skills, could use them, and so that children would enjoy them. Six month-long units included: (1) basic public speaking skills; (2) oral reading; (3) creative expression and storytelling; (4) informing and persuading others; (5) argumentation and debate;  and (6) communication etiquette. Instruction took place in small groups or individually. Though attrition over the six-month program was substantial, reactions to KIDSPEAK from administrators, teachers, parents, and children were positive.

By looking at a completed Q sort, some of the problems that arose in the sample can be examined. Several basic methodological decisions regarding the selection of a Q sample are considered: (1) how the statements for a Q concourse will be collected; (2) whether a pleasure-unpleasure  (agree-disagree) balance to the sample will be imposed; (3) whether the statements evoke imagery and meaning; (4) whether a theoretical structure will be imposed; (5) how statements will be modified or rewritten; and (6) whether the Q sort will be tested and statements that provide little information will be omitted. Results support theories stating that communication channels in formal organization follow vertical and horizontal channels but do not indicate whether these channels of communication are a result of a mixture of types of communicators found in an organization or the communication style of an organization.

This discourse pattern, termed &quot;instructional talk,&quot; as well as another pattern termed &quot;cohorting&quot; (treating the pupils as an undifferentiated group), are inhibiting to genuine discussion. The second section, called &quot;Achieving Genuine Discussion,&quot; presents two basic suggestions: (1)  change the agenda (stop taking a didactic stance, directly evaluating each reply, and controlling the discourse); and (2) play the right game (avoid having a particular response in mind as &quot;the right answer&quot;).

In this case, a tension is identified and foregrounded between this conventional application of the Oedipal complex and Freud's interpretation of the Oedipal complex, based upon a literal reading of Freud. The key play of difference is found in the opposition between pleasure and perfection, desire and structure. Hence the pleasurable becomes different from itself; it is deferred, delayed, and scattered. It is given movement by proto-writing--by the reader's inability to say what she/he means, or mean what she/he says. Because proto-writing is forever operable, new spaces are opened up with each&quot;new&quot; interpretation; the chain of substitution is virtually endless. (RAE)",

Jeanne Meadowcroft's (1986) finding that socio-orientation decreases with the age of the child supports the conformity/autonomy interpretation, and contradicts the traditional harmony/confrontation interpretation of family communication patterns.

        "description":"To penetrate the growing complexity of theoretical perspectives and research methodologies surrounding organizational behavior, this paper introduces the ABC Matrix. This conceptual framework clarifies complex, repetitive organizational behavior by grouping behaviors (avoidance, buffering, and confronting) into readily understood categories. Second, the matrix stresses the importance of observing behaviors at the individual, the group, and the overall organization levels. Third, the framework helps ascertain trends over time and explain current behaviors. Fourth, the matrix serves as a basis for developing practical tools to diagnose behavior and encourage behavior change when appropriate. While early feedback from graduate seminars and professional development workshops for  educators supports the matrix as a useful tool, it has not yet been widely critiqued or field-tested. A survey instrument has been designed to meet this need. This paper's three sections (1) introduce, define, and integrate the ABC concepts; (2) present a case study employing the matrix; and (3) explore the matrix's potential for analytical and diagnostic purposes. The matrix enables organizational leaders to see both extreme behavior types and the blending of these behaviors as they typically occur in reality. Because the matrix is not a &quot;canned&quot; approach, it provides guidance for understanding, while encouraging contingency applications to specific organizational sites. (MLH)",

        "description":"Besides spotlighting education and influencing agencies' intervention in the educational processes, the recent reform movement has focused attention on all educational actors and called for increased accountability for teachers and administrative staff, including principals. While researchers disagree on the degree of instructional leadership required of principals, even the harshest critics of school effectiveness research conclude that staff development is a vital dimension of effective schools. This study focuses on staff development aspects of building principals' instructional leadership and addresses (1) whether training session content could cut across all school levels; (2) whether this content could be taught to principals; (3) whether principals would use the content in  training sessions; and (4) how well they could teach it. (The expectation was that all of this was possible.) In fact, all the principals in two school districts in two different school years were taught to be the change facilitators of classroom organization and management content, using materials developed by the University of Texas (Austin). When tested, principals showed significant gains in their knowledge of classroom management principles and proficiency in facilitating use of new materials. Teachers also showed significant gains in their classroom management knowledge. Included are numerous figures and tables, a summary, 18 references, and 2 appendices describing workshop training activities and the project's phases. (MLH)",

The present study is a systematic effort to assess perceptions of teachers' associations and boards regarding the services of the Fact Finding Commission. School administrators and negotiators representing the association and board who had participated in the commission's hearings during a 5-year period prior to October 1987 were surveyed by mail in the fall of 1987. The survey instrument solicited perceptions about the law, the process, and the results of the process. After a brief contextual statement, the North Dakota data are  reported and analyzed and implications for state statute and process are then suggested. The report next examines the literature on the subject of fact-finding, and concludes with a discussion of prospects for future deliberations in North Dakota and elsewhere. (TE)",

Section I defines child maltreatment and reviews federal and Indiana laws and reporting requirements. Section II focuses on the ethical and professional responsibilities of educators. Section III presents the results of survey responses from 203 of the state's 304 school corporations to determine their policies and procedures for handling child maltreatment. In section IV,  suggestions are offered to improve school policies and procedures that include inservice and preservice education, school policies to ensure accountability in abuse situations, coordination with community child services, state support for maltreatment programs, and standardized record-keeping practices.

The questions of access to schooling and the years of education attained have become two critical indicators of women's progress. Mainstream theories about inequality are gender-blind and do not attempt to explain gender differences in education. They take social class as the main variable. Feminist perspectives do consider women as a main social construct, but they vary in the role they attribute to the state, the family, and the school system in the process of change. Three feminist theories are examined in detail: liberal feminist, radical feminist, and socialist feminist. The  socialist feminist theories appear to offer explanations for the present conditions characterizing women's inequality in education. In conclusion, it is suggested that it is unlikely educational gender inequalities will wither away as long as patriarchy and the capitalist mode of production reinforce each other.

The findings indicate that a rich culture of shared values, perceptions, and beliefs pervades the administrative ranks at both district and school site levels. These findings suggest that symbolic language, coupled with myths and legends, contribute to the development of shared values in which administrators believe in the district as an \"ideological system\" and the superintendent as \"symbolic chief.\" This implies that symbolic or cultural dimensions can contribute, in a variety of ways, to the overall effectiveness of a district's organization by increasing personal self-worth, motivation, and commitment. Extensive interviews with 70  percent of the district administrators were conducted. A key finding was the effects attributed to the motivational management style of the superintendent.

        "author":["Smart, Don"],
        "description":"Historically, in sharp contrast with the United States, the Australian state systems of public education have always been extremely centralized and hierarchical in structure. While these highly centralized systems served the sparsely populated Australian states well during the early years of this century in providing universal free education and promoting equality of opportunity, many feel that this highly bureaucratized system has become obsolete. Yet only in the 1980s have any of the Australian state education systems undertaken efforts toward decentralization. The most potentially far-reaching efforts are currently underway in Victoria and Western Australia. In Victoria, however, the major efforts to restructure the educational system in 1983-84 to provide for greater local  control have since given way to a &quot;corporate management and efficiency movement&quot; which is restoring strong central control. In Western Australia, moves toward devolution of power are more recent, and no specific structure has been proposed for school-based decision-making groups. Hence it is too early to tell whether the movement toward self-governing schools will be successful. Experience to date suggests, on the whole, that the movement toward self-government in Australian schools will be a long evolutionary process, in which reversals toward centralized control will be frequent.

An introductory section discusses the problems inherent in relating research on teacher thinking to educational policy, based on the difference between conclusion-oriented research (which is appropriate for teacher thinking) and decision-oriented research (which is appropriate for educational policy). At the present state of the art in research on teacher thinking, there is no comprehensive, decision-oriented knowledge to guide policy. Accordingly, the second section discusses features of policymaking in education that create difficulties or opportunities for application of research on teacher thinking. Policy problems are characterized as (1) public in nature; (2)  consequential; (3) complex; (4) dominated by uncertainty; and (5) reflective of disagreement about the goals to be pursued. Each of these features of policymaking is examined in light of existing knowledge on teacher thinking. The third section discusses the role of schemata in learning from research. These schemata could provide policymakers with new ways of understanding educational problems. Twenty-four references are listed. (TE)",

In an overview of the legal system, the types of courts, the nature of legal precedents, and the levels within the judiciary are reviewed. The first major issue centers around the question of due process as it relates to students' rights. Based on current educational law, a student may not expect to have general protection of the 14th Amendment while attending parochial school. It is recommended, therefore, that school administrators establish a system of discipline based on principles of equity and fairness, and that this system be published as a handbook for all parents and students. Private schools also  have the right to hold secular goals, to emphasize moral development and discipline, to discourage criticism, and to impose conformity of dress, speech and action. The second major issue discussed regards the liability questions. In this area, the factor that determines liability is negligence. To prove that one is negligent, four factors must be present: there must be a clear responsibility to be performed, this person must be shown to have breached this duty, the person in charge must be shown to have had substantial effect in producing the injury, and the incident must result in damage.

Although this body of law varies from state to state, the basic principles are generally applicable. After an introduction, the first section defines defamation and cites litigation that has clarified and interpreted the scope of this definition. The second section defines the concepts of liability and damage in relation to defamation suits. This is followed, first, by a review of pertinent cases that have been used to define published defamation (libel) and, second, by a survey of cases that construe the scope of fault that can be attributed to publishers. The following section discusses liability  with respect to the truth or falsity of statements made in publications. This is followed by a discussion of case law construing the concept of privilege, or immunity, in defamation cases. The last section defines burden of proof in defamation cases, and is followed by a summary of guidelines in determining the extent to which actions may be liable for defamation. (TE)",

A brief review of tracking practices, assumptions, and evidence of effects is included in the beginning of the paper. Several relationships within the schooling context of tracking are discussed: (1) student characteristics and track placement; (2) track systems and track placements; (3) track systems, student placements, and learning opportunities; and (4) responses, outcomes, and future placements. Throughout the article, a set of hypotheses is raised to account for tracking's effects and its persistence as school practice. These hypotheses are as follows: (1) the schooling context of tracking consists of a complex set of relationships among structures and events within  schools, and this schooling context has long-term consequences for students' cognitive and affective outcomes; (2) the societal context of tracking--specifically, historically grounded assumptions and shared norms about how schools should respond to student diversity--shapes the content and processes of school tracking; and (3) contextual considerations can explain tracking's persistence in schools despite empirical evidence against its effectiveness.

OTE training for local school personnel is intended to establish an approach to improvement that is focused on student performance, implemented and managed at the school level, and supported by board and central office policy. The overall strategy is to intersperse training events with inschool improvement work. The participants learn skills and immediately apply the new knowledge in their schools. Follow-up support is also an important component to the training.

This discourse assumes that education is an economic site in which individuals invest in the acquisition of qualifications in order to maximize their future earning power. It demands the full privatization and deregulation of education. The development of the discourse is analyzed as follows: from 17th century scientific and liberal conceptions of the individual, society, freedom, and market equity; through Adam Smith's human capital doctrine and the second development of human capital ideas by Keynesian and neoclassical economists; to the free market human capital arguments of Milton Friedman and his successors. The policy claims of Friedman's Australian  followers are examined, and the paper closes with consideration of the implications of free market practices. Appended are 44 references. (Author/LMS)",

This book is designed to assist in the strategic planning of effective school safety by helping a school to analyze where one is, where one should go, and how to get there by using the available resources. Chapter 1 suggests ways to assess school climate and how to address problem areas. It offers administrators and teachers guidelines for developing an effective school discipline plan. Chapter 2 examines the reasons students are absent and eventually drop out of school, giving strategies for increasing attendance. Chapter 3 shows how schools, working in cooperation with parents, law  enforcement, social service agencies and other community members, can promote the health and safety of children. Chapter 4 describes the role the school law enforcement or campus security personnel can play as well as outlining other methods in making campuses physically safer and more secure. Each chapter contains sample assessment surveys, model policy statements, and references. (LMS)",

The first report, &quot;Artificial Intelligence Applications in Special Education: How Feasible?,&quot; by Alan Hofmeister and Joseph Ferrara, provides information on the development and evaluation of a series of prototype systems in special education administration, training, diagnosis, and instruction. The second report, &quot;Assessing the Accuracy of a Knowledge-Based System: Special Education Regulations and Procedures,&quot; by Alan Hofmeister, discusses procedures used to develop and evaluate one of these systems. The project evaluated a range of expert-system software and hardware, including computers of all sizes, to determine their potential usefulness in addressing special  education problems. Prototype systems were then designed, including four systems designed to give a second opinion on classification decisions, a system to advise teachers dealing with behavior problems, and a system called &quot;Mandate Consultant&quot; which considers the appropriateness of the decision-making process used to develop an individualized education program. &quot;Mandate Consultant&quot; was selected for full development by the project and received extensive field-testing. Data on the prototype systems' validity, user acceptance, and administrative support suggest that expert systems are potentially effective in the areas of diagnosis, planning, and instruction, and are valuable for training purposes.

The citations are discussed in five categories: research overviews, methodological studies, policies and large-scale programs, evaluations of specific programs and intervention techniques, and parent training. The research overviews indicate that early intervention has significant immediate benefits which may be sustained for many years. Methodological studies describe new methods, evaluate older methods of collecting and analyzing data, and identify methodological issues (such as ethical concerns prohibiting a &quot;no treatment&quot; group). Examples of reports concerning  policies and large scale programs include summaries and analyses of federal, state, and city programs as well as statements of private organizations. Evaluation studies of specific programs and intervention techniques have generally found programs to be effective in terms of improved skills, low levels of subsequent special education placement, and positive parent assessments. Although some studies claim little support for the importance of parental involvement in early intervention, most programs evaluated suggest the value of parent training. (DB)",

Citations are described in five sections: learning disabilities, autism, other learning handicaps, assessment techniques, and instructional techniques. Although some studies have found an unusual reliance on one hemisphere by the learning disabled, the relationship of these findings to learning disorders is unclear. Despite the popularity of hemispherically related explanations for learning disabilities, a review of research concluded that there are strong empirical arguments to the contrary. Studies of autism found some evidence of left hemisphere dysfunction as well as  evidence of neurochemical disturbance. Studies of other learning handicaps (such as deafness, behavior disorders, handedness, brain damage) were less frequent. Work on assessment techniques includes tests and electrophysical measurement techniques used to determine hemispheric preference, identify neurological problems, and identify subtypes of learning disability. Most studies on instructional techniques stress that education currently emphasizes left brain activities and that greater use of right train and integrated activities should be fostered.

Special education and rehabilitation professionals (N=20) in a university course learned and taught the three database management software systems (Friendly Filer, Mastertype Filer, and Filing Assistant) using a customized teaching manual developed by project personnel. Files containing career information were developed for each of the software systems. Structured group instruction plus individual assistance resulted in all students being able to perform basic database manipulations, some  being able to add information to existing files, and a few able to create their own files and input their own information of interest. Students rated the computer lab as their favorite activity. Recommendations included introducing novices to application programs before more traditional educational programs; having novice computer instructors work as a teaching team; and encouraging individual applications transferable to professional positions.

Scores of children identified by teachers as possibly learning disabled were compared to scores of non-identified children. Results suggested that: (1) mean total and subscale BRS scores of identified children were lower than those not so identified; (2) less educated teachers and those teaching in the lower standards tended to have the most undifferentiated responses; (3) use of the scale should be  differentiated by user population; (4) distinction needs to be made between statistically significant results (shown by the study) and practically significant results (not yet demonstrated).

Implications for special education include: differences between emerging demographic characteristics of the country and current demography of special education as a discipline; an expansion of groups eligible for special education services (e.g. children handicapped by sexually transmitted diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome); the possibility of public reaction against increased special services leading to more  careful delineation of eligibility; and increased need for educational services by disabled adults. Special educators are encouraged to be aware of demographic trends and prepare to respond to the changing ethnic nature of our society and schools. (DB)",

An interventionist approach to assessment and evaluation is suggested to reduce biases and improve educational decision making. It is recommended that psychometrically based, indirect assessment procedures be replaced by curriculum-based practices that focus on the educational process rather than on student performance alone. A prereferral approach to problem identification is offered.

Subjects were 30 pairs of Japanese children, with a developmental age range of 12-35 months, and their mothers. The children were individually administered five phases of premodeling, controlled mother-child play, uncontrolled mother-child play, modeling by the experimenter, and post-modeling, in that order. The materials used were lifelike objects, miniature toys, and ambiguous objects. The study's results show that more children increased their levels of pretend actions and showed the highest level of decentration and/or decontextualization in the modeling setting rather than the mother-child play setting. However,  modeling produced a decrease in nonmodeled and modified pretend actions with developmental age, while mother-child play showed an increase in the number of different acts. The difference in the two settings was regarded as merely a discrepancy of control, as it was possible to teach the mother to be a more effective model. The study suggests that controlled and uncontrolled settings are appropriate for the acquisition and facilitation of pretend actions in retarded children. An abstract is provided in Japanese. (JDD)",

One autistic boy, aged 5 years, 4 months with no verbal imitation skills and few movement imitation skills, was taught to shape 16 imitation skills and few movement imitation skills, was taught to shape 16 noun signs by using a simultaneous communication method. The study's results indicate the following changes as training progressed: the child's spontaneous behavior increased, while responses to the teacher's mands decreased. The rate of various response modes changed, with the rate of response with sign alone being high at the  beginning of the training and finger-pointing with vocalization being high near the end of the training. The rate of the child's correct signs increased. Interaction patterns between the child and the teacher shifted toward increasing give and take behaviors. The child learned to imitate orally all the Japanese vowels, some diphthongs, and some three-connected vowels. In conclusion, the teaching strategies used showed considerable promise for the acquisition and acceleration of the spontaneous use of noun signs acquired. An abstract is provided in Japanese.

The study sought to: compare three methods used to identify and analyze phases in family problem-solving interactions, establish criteria to evaluate the methods, utilize the criteria to evaluate the three methods, and select a method. The three methods were: R. Bales and F. Strodtbeck's method, the marker method, and the rating method. The Bales and Strodtbeck method divides a family's interactions into three equal phases; predicts the phase in which the frequency of a particular behavior would be highest, intermediate, or lowest; and compares the observed ordering of each behavior against the ideal predicted ordering. The marker method conceptualizes the problem-solving process as an  eight-step loop which might be repeated several times. The rating method, also using an eight-step loop, goes on to assign points to particular problem-solving behaviors and then rates the family's effectiveness based on the number of points assigned. Using the three methods, nine well-functioning families were ranked as being high, moderate, or low in rationality. The relative rankings were consistent for the majority of the sample. It appeared that any of the techniques could be used for a project such as this. (JDD)",

Flexible pacing is defined as placing students at an appropriate instructional level and allowing them to move forward in the curriculum as they master content and skills. Flexible pacing is achieved by such methods as continuous progress, compacted course, advanced level courses, grade skipping, early entrance, concurrent or dual enrollment, and credit by examination. An introductory chapter looks at the historical and theoretical context of flexible pacing and gives a brief explanation of the canvassing and survey methods used to obtain data. The next two chapters describe flexible pacing programs in 8 elementary and 11  secondary schools. Chapter 5 looks at district-wide programs for all students or all gifted students and finds six such school systems. The next chapter examines cooperative programs between schools, colleges, or other educational institutions. The seventh chapter discusses selected features of flexible pacing including school policy, strategies of implementation, staff selection/development, and record keeping. A staff development program to prepare teachers for flexible pacing in mathematics is described in the eighth chapter, contributed by Kathleen Martin. The concluding chapter identifies principles of implementation including capitalizing on what is available, initiating a program gradually, and winning support. The survey form and a sample program description are appended.  (DB)",

Transition systems have been developed to overcome these barriers, focusing on the needs of the individual, the role of parents, and the role of the state education agency. Several cooperative interagency models have been created by states to meet students' transition needs. The state plans described represent diverse geographic locations, demographics, agency structures, transition concerns, and intervention strategies. Idaho's plan emphasizes identification of the extent of need for transition services; implementation of the interagency transition process; and solutions to barriers encountered when developing pre-employment training, support work options, independent  living options, and transition teams. Maine's plan includes in the interagency agreement the specific roles and responsibilities of each agency. New York's plan focuses on early referral to vocational rehabilitation and ongoing sharing of information among special educators, occupational educators, and vocational rehabilitation personnel. Washington's model attempts to unify its fragmented services through a state-level transition plan. (JDD)",

It functions as a diagnostic, training, and consultative resource to local school districts in north central Florida and provides short-term diagnostic services for children with complex medical, learning, and behavioral difficulties. Inservice, preservice, and parent training are also offered. The case conference procedure is fundamental to the design and operation of this model program. Case conferences follow a prearranged order of presentation, and are attended by the child's classroom teacher(s) and other local school district personnel, the MDTP liaison consultant, the  educational diagnostician, the pediatric neurologist, speech pathologist, and school psychologist. A 1985 survey of teacher perceptions of the MDTP case conferences yielded highly positive responses, and 95 percent of a sample of 23 teachers reported that they modified their teaching as a result of case conference suggestions. Direct observational data collected on the interactions of MDTP team members during 10 randomly sampled case conferences indicated that all disciplines contributed to brainstorming solutions. Further investigation is recommended to identify specific variables of greatest significance in producing positive outcomes for case conferencing. (JW)",

In chapter 3, the how-to's of designing and preparing for activities are described. Activities in chapter  4 (e.g., wheelbarrow walk, Simon Says) accompany a discussion of the meaning of play for children. Chapter 5 focuses on the creation and use of toys and spaces for play, with activities such as pointing to body parts and pushing objects. Discipline and setting limits is addressed in chapter 6, while the final chapter describes ways to include special needs children in group activities.

The project is a program of Rosemount Center (Washington, D.C.), a multicultural, bilingual day care center for infants and young children which serves a mixed socioeconomic neighborhood with a majority of Hispanic families. Among major program accomplishments were providing the only bilingual assessment and intervention team in day care for infants and children in the Washington, D.C. area, accommodating working parents by offering on-site child treatments, and successfully integrating a special education model component into a day care  program. Topics addressed in the report include need for the program, program description (multidisciplinary service team, bilingual assessment and intervention services, technical support and training), evaluation procedures, program accomplishments (including the development of two manuals for family day care providers and one for program replication), and efforts toward program continuation and expansion. The bulk of the document consists of three appendices: external evaluation reports for each project year, an internal evaluation report, and sample individual evaluation reports on five children served by the program.

The series stresses that the New Jersey special education system has vastly improved from what existed prior to the 1975 Education for All Handicapped Children Act, but that the system still falls short of its goals. The effectiveness of special education programs is analyzed, noting that education is not truly individualized, schools do not spend enough money or employ enough staff, some schools place students in inappropriate special education classes, many schools discourage parental participation, and the state does not monitor special education programs well enough. The articles provide statistical data on: special education  enrollments by school district and by classification of handicap, types of special education programs by county, and costs of special education by school district. Numerous vignettes illustrate the efforts of classroom teachers to help disabled students learn and the efforts of parents to acquire appropriate services. A state plan is reviewed, calling for increasing mainstreaming, reducing inappropriate placements, modifying funding systems, and providing special training for teachers. Methods for evaluating special education are discussed. Programs enabling learning-disabled students to attend college are described. (JDD)",

The section on characteristics discusses kinds of intelligence, indicators of giftedness, student characteristics that may pose difficulties for the classroom teacher (e.g., persistence, criticalness, and tendency to master generalizations at the expense of details), definition of giftedness in an educational context, distinction between the concepts of gifted versus talented, and the special characteristics of gifted underachievers, minority gifted, and gifted females. The second section describes types of identification instruments and procedures, as well as specific procedures implemented by selected programs for the gifted. A two-stage  identification procedure is recommended. Procedures tailored to identification in such specific areas as intellectual ability, academic talent, leadership, and visual and performing arts are noted. Approximately half the text consists of supplementary materials which include lists of characteristics of gifted and talented individuals, sample checklists, rating scales, and recommendation and evaluation forms. Information on representative group and individual achievement and intelligence tests, and on tests for assessing higher-level thinking behavior, is presented in chart format.

In the first application of the program at the college, peer tutors (who would be assistant teachers in the subsequent immersion program) were trained in a three-day workshop. Immediately following the workshop, a ten-day immersion course brought together 15 students of three languages (French, German, and Spanish) in classes taught by master teachers and the peer tutors. Participant evaluations were positive but revealed areas for course improvement, particularly in timing and ability grouping. Business language courses in all three languages were introduced into the college curriculum after the first  immersion course. Internships intended to begin after the second offering of the immersion courses were suspended due to international incidents. The third offering of the immersion course was undersubscribed, but the fourth offering was successful, serving college students, teachers, and individuals interested in self-enrichment. A total of nine courses have been added to the college curriculum as a result of the initial immersion effort. Additional results include a program of distance learning in French. Internships have not developed as intended, but graduate credit courses for teachers may become a program by-product. Additional ideas are being pursued. (MSE)",

It was found that this teacher's approach is to respond to topics introduced by the students rather than to introduce topics, and to contribute to the dialogue by making statements and expressing opinions rather than eliciting student writing with questions. This technique results in a collaborative writing effort, with teacher and students mutually developing topics of interest to them and with the students  writing far more than the minimum required.

        "description":"The adjunct model of language instruction is described as it has been implemented at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). In this model, freshman English and English-as-a-second-language (ESL) courses are linked with content area courses to better integrate the reading, writing, and study skills required for academic success at the university. The report presents a rationale for the adjunct model and describes the key features of the UCLA Freshman Summer Program. It also presents the findings of three studies carried out in the UCLA freshman program: (1) former students' evaluation of the program; (2) an assessment of the home background and high school preparation of the 1986 participants and of their self-assessment of academic skills; and (3) follow-up  interviews with selected ESL students and the results of a simulated examination comparing the progress of program participants with that of non-participants.

        "description":"A study of progress in the Edison Elementary School (California) bilingual immersion program after its first year of implementation looked at: (1) student levels and gains in first and second language proficiency; (2) levels of math and reading achievement and their possible relationship to student language background; (3) levels of students' perceived academic, peer, physical, and mother-child relationship competencies; and (4) attitudes toward the program among parents and staff. A total of 58 kindergarten and 54 first-grade students participated. Pre- and post-test comparisons of achievement showed that all students made gains in both Spanish and English, with more Spanish-dominant than English-dominant students fluent in both languages. Overall, both Spanish- and  English-dominant students scored above average in content area achievement. Students' perceived interpersonal competence was high in each domain examined, and attitudes toward the program were generally positive. Recommendations include promotion of leadership among teachers, development of a Spanish language arts component, development of an English language arts curriculum, provision of more opportunities for native English- and Spanish-speakers to interact in group work; and inclusion of non-bilingual immersion students in the evaluation.

        "description":"Results of a survey of 1,416 elementary schools and 1,349 secondary schools concerning foreign language instruction are reported. The survey sought to provide a national picture of foreign language education in public and private schools by investigating demographics, the amount of instruction provided, enrollment, specific offerings, program type, scheduling and funding (elementary schools only), the existence of curriculum guidelines, materials, student participation in foreign language-related activities, sequencing, teacher qualifications and in-service training, and major problems. Survey results are presented in graphs accompanied by narration, and reveal that foreign language instruction is currently offered in just over 20% of the elementary and 87% of the secondary  schools that responded. Twice as many private as public elementary schools and slightly more private than public secondary schools offer instruction. National attention needs to be focused on developing a more rigorous foreign language program beginning in earlier grades and continuing to the fluency level. Specific recommendations include establishment of new programs, particularly starting in elementary schools and aiming at high proficiency; more intensive programs; improvement of sequencing; addressing the major problems noted by teachers and administrators; and offering more programs in the less commonly taught major world languages.

        "description":"A study examined second language article acquisition by analyzing the spoken interlanguage of speakers of five different native languages, three with no article system (Chinese, Japanese, and Russian) and two with article systems (Spanish and German). Informal interviews of four speakers of each language at successive levels of interlanguage provided data for a pseudolongitudinal analysis of article usage for each of the five languages represented. The interlanguage level was determined primarily by negation criteria. Findings show that subjects whose first languages contained article systems differed markedly in English article acquisition from those whose first languages did not contain such a system, indicating that English article usage, particularly at the beginning levels,  is clearly influenced by the first language. The most dramatic change in article usage appears to occur between the basilang and low mesolang levels for \"the\" and zero usage. \"A\" appears to be acquired at a slower and more gradual rate, perhaps reflecting its linkage to the plus-or-minus count system.

Three tests (cloze, multiple-choice, and fill-in-the-blank) were developed to measure learners' knowledge of five verb forms. The tests, containing corresponding items designed to elicit equivalent structures, were administered to nonnative speakers of English grouped by proficiency level and by language background and also administered to a smaller group of native speakers. The results showed a clear pattern of variability, with students performing best on the multiple-choice task and least well on the cloze task, with greater variability at lower proficiency levels and on the more difficult verb structures. Differences in performance also seemed to be  closely related to the production versus recognition features of the elicitation task. Analysis of two other factors, language background and error type, suggest a role for first language in performance variability. (MSE)",

        "description":"The Computers in Bilingual Education (CIBE) program at South Bronx High School offered computer-assisted instruction in English as a second language (ESL), native language arts, social studies, mathematics, and science to limited-English-speaking students and provided instruction in computer literacy. It served 340 low-income ninth-, tenth-, and eleventh-grade Spanish-speaking students, mostly recent Puerto Rican immigrants. Classroom instruction was funded by several sources, and due to lack of experienced staff, some teachers taught outside their licensing areas. Program students made up over one-half of the school's graduating class. Since the program was strongly supported by the administration, its curriculum closely paralleled that of the mainstream. Analysis of student  achievement data indicates: (1) English language development met or approached the objective in both semesters; (2) English, English reading, and native language course completion objectives were met; (3) content-area course passing objectives were met; (4) students achieved high passing rates in computer literacy; and (5) the attendance rate was significantly higher than that of mainstream students.

In its third year, the program served 275 limited-English-speaking students from the Caribbean, Central America, and Cambodia in grade nine through eleven. The project offered a wide range of courses, including English as a second language (ESL), Spanish, bilingual content-area instruction, computer technology, and business. Computer use for academic preparation increased during the project. Lack of a Khmer-speaking teacher made individualized content-area instruction for Cambodians  infeasible; however, Khmer-speaking paraprofessionals assisted students in courses taught in English.

The program included travel to the host country, living with the partner's family, attending the partner's school, and participation in career and cultural tours and seminars. Stated objectives for American participants included some knowledge of Israel's language and cultural institutions and favorable response by the Israeli student to the four-week  introduction to American culture, education, and career opportunities. The program achieved its general goal, but implementation problems kept the program from realizing its full potential. The cooperating Israeli staff should be more aware of the program's objectives, procedures, and requirements, especially relating to visiting students' needs and that students hosting visitors should also visit the other country; and the American schools should help students make up work missed during foreign travel.

Eligibility requirements included limited English proficiency and the inability to schedule required or makeup courses during the academic year. The program operated at 18 high schools in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. Evening classes were available at one location. Courses included three levels of ESL, bilingually-taught classes in business math, Latin American studies, American history, biology, and general science, and six levels of native language arts in French and Spanish. Most  participants were Spanish- or Chinese-speaking, and many were in the ninth and tenth grades. Although no specific objectives were proposed, data show passing rates in all but two courses were over 70%.

        "description":"An analysis of informal reasoning and examination of teaching practices looks at ways to improve reasoning skills in college students. Teaching students to reason more effectively is an important but difficult goal of higher education. Reasoning consists of complex skills which must be taught. Effective instruction is based on two key features: (1) a model that specifies the product of reasoning and the skills involved in informal reasoning; and (2) direct instruction of skills and close supervision and guidance of students during the acquisition of reasoning expertise. A distinction between formal and informal reasoning is offered. Most arguments college students encounter use informal reasoning. The structure of informal arguments is broken down into six essential elements  (claims, grounds, warrants, backing, modality, and rebuttal). Informal reasoning skills and knowledge are explained in terms of analytical skills, evaluative skills, constructive skills, and topic knowledge. Common problems students have in informal reasoning include: underdeveloped mental models of argument structure, inadequate use of evidence, underdeveloped arguments, and errors in logic or faulty inferences. Teaching informal reasoning requires: providing students with a model of reasoning that clearly specifies the skills to be learned; organizing skills into a rough sequence based on their function and complexity; direct instruction of reasoning expertise; frequent opportunities to practice reasoning; and precise feedback. A suggested sequence for teaching these skills is outlined,  its purpose is to teach students to analyze, evaluate, and construct informal arguments. Some complications of this teaching endeavor include the knowledge versus skills issue and the problem of transfer or generalization. Contains 13 references. (SM)",

        "description":"Many studies have been made over the past several years on black students and their academic performance at predominantly white institutions, but the reversed situation of white students attending historically black educational facilities has received minimal coverage. Based on a literature review and two surveys of white students at a black institution in Alabama and another in Florida, information is presented on: characteristics of white students attending historically black colleges and universities (reasons for attending black institutions, levels of motivation, and prior contact with blacks); educational climate (teacher competence, attitudinal relationships, and extra-curricula activities); black institutions and white enrollment conflicts (Alcorn State University in  Mississippi and Tennessee State University/University of Tennessee); and the surveys of white students at Bishop State Junior College (Alabama) and Florida A&M University. Statistical data are provided on: general characteristics; classification and career goals; sources of income; enrollment; factors affecting attendance; prior contact with blacks; academic experience; non-academic experience; impressions; and preferences in academic and social guidance. The findings reveal that: most white students attend black colleges solely to get an education; the average age is 23 and older; over 50% of the white students are enrolled full time; nearly 50% finance their own education; 54% transfer to black institutions from predominantly white institutions; and over 50% find that their academic and  non-academic experiences meet their expectations.

        "description":"The process of instructional consultation with feedback at postsecondary institutions is explored. In the past decade, instructional support to faculty has become a priority in many institutions of higher education. One popular method of helping faculty improve their teaching is through consulting with them about their teaching and feeding back information about their effectiveness in the classroom. Until now, there has been little systematic study of the process, so practitioners have few research-based guidelines for providing effective feedback. In this study, verbal interactions between instructional consultants and their faculty clients were examined. Results show that consultants spent most time listening or silently reviewing information, suggesting and discussing  solutions, discussing information about their clients, and giving their opinions and interpretations. Clients spent most time listening or silently reviewing information, talking about themselves, and identifying and discussing problems. Consultants asked more questions than clients, but spent the same amount of time in silence, talking, and making statements. When novice and experienced consultants were compared, no differences were found in the amount of time they spent talking, opining, identifying problems, and suggesting solutions; also no difference was found in the number of questions they asked. Two models of consultation--Prescription and Collaborative--were the most frequently practiced by both novice and experienced consultants. Further research is needed to determine which  model of consultation, under what conditions and with which kinds of consultants and clients, is most effective in producing change in instruction.

        "author":["Neumann, Anna"],
        "description":"The self-reported errors of college and university presidents are examined and analyzed from the perspective of organizational learning. Very little is known about how presidents take on their roles, identify and assume their responsibilities, and learn about their workplaces or the difficulties they face and the mistakes they make in doing so. Study methodology consisted of intensive, semi-structured interviews with college and university presidents in a purposive sample of 32 institutions distributed nationally. The four error clusters described by presidents are listed as: errors of omission (&quot;I should have done something&quot;); substantive errors of commission (&quot;what I did was wrong&quot;); process of errors of commission (&quot;how I did it was wrong&quot;); and errors of commission--action  errors (&quot;I should have refrained&quot;). A comparative analysis of these error clusters looks at patterns of difference and patterns of similarity. Factors that account for presidential error and the learning that occurs as a result are explained. The four conclusions resulting from this study are as follows: college presidents are prone to err; most presidents see themselves as making their worst errors as novices; the possession of interpretive skills appears to be related to the ability to recognize retrospectively that one has made mistakes; and errors help presidents learn a significant amount about their own relationships with others and about the relationships that bind others in organizations. Three appendices offer statistics on: level of presidential experience at time of error;  presidential error by initial presidential strategy; and presidential error by presidential strategy at time of interview.

        "author":["Pedras, Melvin J."],
        "description":"The model used in a multivariate fashion to reorganize the Department of Industrial Technology Education at the University of Idaho thereby undergoing a test for effectiveness is presented. This model is a product of a seminar held in West Germany in 1986 in which a group of professional educators from several countries produced a generic model for use in the redirection of any aspect of professional education. Development of the model is explained, certain underlying assumptions are noted, and definitions of the model components are given. This gyro model allows for infinite entry points from any location within the system. If a mission change occurs, the gyro is placed in motion, or if constraints are imposed, again the motion begins. Regardless of where the model is entered,  it can be used as a guide for change. The gyro model can heat up or increase interchange among its elements dramatically as the degree of agitation transmitted through the decision set increases. The source of educational innovation may occur within any element. The conceptualization, development, and testing of the model at the University of Idaho made an opportunity to place the change process in a formal structure and utilize it for a specific purpose in education. It offered guidance in the restructuring of an academic department at the university level of education. Two appendices provide a list of participants in the development of the model and the proposal by the University of Idaho to use this model. Contains 5 references. (SM)",

        "description":"The first in a series of National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) reports on undergraduates presents NPSAS data to policymakers and other interested parties. It examines the education expenses of undergraduates who were enrolled in a postsecondary institution in the fall of 1986 and the methods by which they financed these expenses. This is done for all students and all selected groups of students. Following an executive summary, the eight chapters focus on: an introduction; postsecondary enrollment; undergraduate education expenses; sources and types of financial aid to undergraduates; federal financial aid to undergraduates; the composition of student aid awards; sources of financial support to undergraduates; and summary and conclusions. Financial aid is shown to be an  important source of support for many undergraduates, reducing the price an undergraduate must pay by nearly 40% in most cases. As students' family income levels increase, the concentration of students receiving federal aid decreases, no matter what type of institution is attended. The glossary of pertinent terms is followed by four appendices: additional tables; technical notes; advisors to NPSAS; and survey forms. Figures, text tables, and appendix tables are described.

This analysis was done as part of the ongoing GAO study of guaranty agencies' activities required by section 1311 of the Higher Education Amendments of 1986. The focus was on the more than 1,182,000 borrowers who had received their last loan in 1983 and had either begun to repay or had defaulted on their loans as of September 30, 1987. Preliminary analysis of student loan borrowers and defaulters show that: (1) vocational school  students defaulted at higher rates than other students; (2) independent students defaulted at higher rates in each income catetgory than dependent students; and (3) borrowers who attended school one year or less defaulted at higher rates than those who continued beyond one year. Appended charts show: kind of institution attended by students; borrowers and defaulters by institution attended; more defaulters from low income families; independent students have higher default rates; most defaulters attend school for one year or less; defaulters' income by selected characteristics; percent of 1983 borrowers who defaulted by 9/30/87; and characteristics of borrowers and defaulters.

This system will replace the system called Uniform Methodology (UM) for federally supported programs and is expected to be adopted for most state and institutional supportd programs. The implications of the change in governance and specific changes in the methodology are presented. A background and definition of the issue looks at the federal government and postsecondary education and characteristics of California students. A section on history, theory, and operation of need analysis focuses on theory and governance of need analysis, operation of the Uniform Methodology,  development of the Congressional Methodology (CM) system, operation of the CM, and implications of the CM system. Governance questions raised by the adoption of the CM focus on criticism of the CM and support for the CM. In discussing critical issues, it is noted that for most financial aid administrators, students, and families, the change from UM to CM will result in confusion. It will require changes in computer systems, forms, and procedures. It is critical that the CM serve as a true need analysis methodology which can be used to determine a student's need for assistance from all sources without regard to availability of funds from any particular source. It should not be reduced to a formula determining eligibility for a particular program. Contains 8 references. (SM)",

Fellows also had to serve as interns for 2 weeks at an institution other than their own. Components of this project include the following: winter and summer institutes; attendance at a national higher education conference; the internship and written project; the selection procedure; a group profile; the project  budget; a program evaluation and outcomes; and the overall program effectiveness. Participation in this project enabled some fellows to move on to administrative positions and some to get promotions within their institutions.

The project's three functions were to (1) examine policy directions related to the economy; (2) develop a network among FIPSE-supported projects in education and economics; and (3) disseminate program and policy information generated by the project. It was an experiment of FIPSE to see if clusters of projects, working in similar areas, could be formed to address common problems in a collaborative way. The project's activities were policy papers, a newsletter, case studies, the &quot;New Directions for Continuing Education  Sourcebook,&quot; and the Education and Economy Alliance. It convened a group of 24 other FIPSE projects to form the Education and Economy Alliance. Each of the projects in the Alliance was concerned with improving postsecondary educations' ability to respond to changes in the economy.

Each received a three-part questionnaire concerning ease of movement and perceived desirability of moving, including the individual's propensity to search out other opportunities, the best opportunity to leave in a selected time period, and the degree of enticement a series of factors had on the individual's decision on that opportunity. The study focused on &quot;star&quot; faculty at a major western university during the 1984-85 academic year. The results are considered  highly contextualized by the cultural milieu of the institution and its geographic location, and are therefore considered not transferable to other settings.

Following a description of the task force structure and procedures, the methodology employed in analyzing and developing student/faculty ratio guidelines is presented, including the use of spreadsheets developed on Lotus1-2-3 to the present and analyze Colorado's student and faculty data and compare it with that of other states. Eight models developed to bring Colorado's student/faculty ratios in line with those of other states are described. The role conflicts experienced by an institutional researcher in this situation are also discussed. The  impartial role of the institutional researcher was in conflict with the political demands and needs of various sectors of the higher education community, in that different models for developing ratios would allocate funds differently within the state. This role conflict was resolved by presenting data generated by each of the models to the task force. (KM)",

Performance in the first college math course (College Mathematics, Calculus, or Business Calculus Matrices) was the dependent measure. Independent measures included demographics, high school achievement data, and College Board test scores. Using &quot;type of mathematics&quot; as either an independent dummy variable or as a moderator variable was considered. The data came from over 3,500 students who were beginning freshmen in 1986 and 1987 and who took one of the three math courses. The models were developed on the 1986 beginning freshmen and were compared to the sample  on which they were developed and cross-validated on the 1987 freshmen. The following conclusions were reached: (1) the statistical models were useful in predicting performance, particularly among those who are predicted to have difficulty; (2) actual ability to explain performance &quot;shrinks&quot; from the modeling sample to the use sample; and (3) the 70% unexplained variance in performance calls from the developing of more discriminating critical variables.

Significantly different conceptions of educational purpose among faculty in different fields may inhibit agreement on plans for curricular coherence and ways of communicating expectations to students. Interviews with 89 faculty members teaching in diverse colleges and representing eight fields also identified faculty attention to student preparation, available textbooks, and locally important factors, but little attention to alternative instructional strategies during course planning. The development of a tentative general model of course design and related questions to guide future study, based on the findings, is discussed.

The model focuses on a student's motivation for attending college, the tension that derives from conflicting motivations, and the social context of the student-college bond. The validity of the model was examined in a study that tracked 40% of the freshman classes of 1984 and 1985 at the University of Massachusetts through their first year of college. The Student Information Form (SIF) survey was used to obtain data about the entering students. The SIF data provided only limited support for the engagement model.

The complexity of this decision was managed with a multicriteria method that was used to evaluate alternative systems. The method took into account the many and sometimes conflicting concerns of the people who would use whatever system was finally selected. Multicriteria analysis not only provided a way of managing a large amount of information, but apparently reduced people's resistance to change. The method and its application to this particular computer system selection decision is described, and a chart of criteria and ratings is provided.

One purpose of the two projects was to develop school-specific databases to: provide graduate school administrators with information regarding their applicant pools; highlighting influential factors in the matriculation decision process; identifying applicants' sources of information regarding the schools; and identifying major competitors. For the Graduate School of International Affairs, accepted applicants (166 matriculants and 187 non-matriculants) were surveyed by mail, with response rates of 63% and 45% respectively. For the School of Dental Medicine, 592 prospective  applicants were contacted by telephone, of whom 87% completed a telephone interview. Results of both projects indicated that issues of quality were of primary concern, and admissions activities with a personal touch (contact with faculty or students, tour of facilities, attending classes) appeared to be important influences.

Results included the following: (1) the average grade of the semester just completed was 2.70, higher than the official designation of the average grade; (2) there were pronounced differences in grading among departments; (3) average grades increased during the period studied; and (4) analysis of departmental differences does not support the departments' claim that superior students in a given department account for the differences. An inter-institutional study, now ongoing, was then  undertaken. A total of 351 peer institutions was surveyed, with a response rate of 35%.

A national database was built in LOTUS 1-2-3 containing information on secondary enrollment, revenue, and other institutional characteristics. A joint faculty-administrative advisory committee eventually negotiated the selection of five key data elements. Institutions not possessing these characteristics were &quot;deselected.&quot; The remaining 44 schools became the agreed-upon database for the national faculty salary  survey.

Educators are now in a position to develop and implement programs and enter a new age of educational responsibility and decision-making. The U.S. Department of Education is interested in the role computer technology plays in education and has provided block grants via the Educational Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA), which have been used to purchase books and computer equipment. Teacher computer literacy is one area that  needs further development, and to assist in alleviating this problem, the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) has distributed funds for programs directly related to improvement in this area. Other educational projects monitored by OERI include Project Quill, which uses microcomputers to help teachers teach writing; the development of a mathematics and reading curriculum and methodology to improve learning for elementary students, handicapped, gifted, and culturally diverse children; and the establishment of the National Diffusion Network (NDN), which provides funding for the dissemination of information about exemplary programs using technology in science and math. Individual &quot;lighthouse projects&quot; identified by NDN use computer-assisted instruction to improve basic  skills for compensatory education, teach secondary math courses, provide occupational education, and/or utilize computers for records management and prescriptive instruction.

Results revealed that: (1) impediments to the integration of computers into the curriculum include lack of budgetary support, demands on teachers, negative experiences with previous innovations, and competing demands of other school improvement programs; (2) coordinators facilitate computer use through a combination of product- and client-centered strategies which include resource-adding,  training of teachers, providing technical assistance, organizing the school's instructional computing program, energizing and motivating the client, and collaborative problem solving; (3) effective coordinators must have technical expertise as well as interpersonal skills; (4) outcomes resulting from the computer coordinator's work include improved teacher skills, implementation of school goals, teacher satisfaction, and greater student comfort with computers.

The five areas of focus are: (1) curriculum integration, or the general rationale for using computer technology in education; (2) the use of applications software as instructional tools; (3) telecommunications; (4) implementation constraints, including teacher training and their levels of concern; and (5) the influence of contextual variables, or the &quot;environmental press&quot; on the impact of technology (i.e., the interaction of the characteristics of the particular computer-related material itself with those of the teacher, students, and the physical and  philosophical organization of the learning environment. A review of the literature suggests that these five areas of research may have transfer value to developing nations. It is concluded that emphasis on computer-related technology as a curriculum-related tool rather than as a vocationally-oriented tool seems generally valid for school environments in developing countries as well as in more developed countries.

It was found that the group permitted to &quot;build&quot; during interactive training never performed better than the group not permitted to build (on structure or efficiency), and sometimes performed significantly worse. An explanation for these findings is offered using a framework for multimedia concepts in memory: when practice is mixed with simultaneous audiovisual instruction, the motoric elements created by practice do not become an integrated part of the concept of building the  object formed from the audiovisual information. Instead, motoric elements remain &quot;outside&quot; the concept. Motoric elements can be integrated into the visual and linguistic concept only with more extensive practice, or when practice and audiovisual instruction are presented sequentially and not simultaneously.

Students from lower socioeconomic family backgrounds in 15 classrooms in 1982-83 and 13 classrooms in 1983-84 used curricular materials in learning centers of five students each. Teachers used a classroom management system designed for the study which assisted them in delegating authority and avoiding direct supervision when students were working cooperatively at learning  centers. Students were observed to determine the frequency of their working and talking together, working alone, and disengaging from their tasks, and were tested for achievement. The data showed that an increase in the number of learning centers in operation permitted less teacher supervision and teacher facilitation, while less direct supervision permitted more student working and talking together (or student communication). In addition, student cooperation correlated positively with gains on mathematical achievement tests. These findings are examined in terms of both theoretical applications to classroom organizational theory and practical applications to classroom management.

        "description":"A survey of the personal, socioeconomic, and professional characteristics of the 100 men and women who served as President to the American Library Association (ALA) between 1876 and 1986 was undertaken to identify those socioeconomic and professional characteristics whose frequency distributions remained relatively constant for all 100 members of the club, and to identify those group characteristics whose frequency distributions changed over the 110-year period during which the group held office. A comparison of presidents from 1906 to 1925 with their counterparts from 1966 to 1985 shows a sharp contrast: the former individual was more likely to be white, male, married, and Protestant; somewhat more likely to be a Republican; and a graduate from a northeastern college or  university but without formal library education; and the director of a nonpublic library in the northeast. By contrast, the latter individual was more likely to be white, married, and Protestant; somewhat more likely to be female and a Democrat; either from the midwest, the south, or the northeast, with an undergraduate degree from a midwestern or southern school; more likely to have a Ph.D. in library science; and to be directing a library school at the time of tenure. Despite the shifts evident in the last 20 years, the picture still shows significant gaps in representation of the association's membership in terms of both personal and professional characteristics. A list of the 100 former ALA presidents together with the dates that they held office is appended. (7 references)  (EW)",

        "description":"More community college faculty members should become involved in programs and activities to improve communication and articulation between community colleges and high schools. The strengthening of high school graduation requirements and recent calls for closer relations between colleges and schools intensify the need for a greater understanding of expected student performance at each level. The major articulation programs operating in California include: (1) concurrent enrollment and transfer of credit opportunities; (2) the California Academic Partnership Program; (3) projects to improve placement and/or instruction in chemistry, humanities, mathematics, and writing; (4) the California Students Opportunity and Access Program; and (5) the Curriculum Consultant Project. In  addition to these statewide efforts, regional articulation programs and 2 + 2 programs are becoming increasingly common, and most colleges carry out some articulation with local high schools. To promote faculty involvement, academic senates should encourage institutional participation in statewide activities, sponsor meetings of high school/community college faculty within disciplines, arrange faculty workshops, promote faculty exchanges with high schools, and establish mentoring programs. Adequate incentives and support must be provided to compensate faculty for the time expended in these activities. A directory of the articulation projects discussed in the paper and short descriptions of articulation programs at seven California community colleges are appended. (AJL)",

        "description":"In response to dwindling enrollments and increasing competition from other postsecondary institutes and private training schools, the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) has developed a marketing plan to take advantage of existing opportunities. SAIT's Marketing Department focuses on developing a strong and unique institutional image and is made up of a marketing manager, projects funding manager, creative supervisor, public affairs supervisor and assistant, and school/community liaison. In addition, a faculty member within each department is designated as marketing representative. These representatives act as liaisons with potential students, employers, and advisory committees; promote SAIT facilities, expertise, and courseware; and encourage donations of equipment,  supplies, funds, and scholarships. The development of SAIT's marketing process involved the following steps: (1) the creation of a network of departmental marketing representatives to facilitate communication; (2) the identification of target groups; (3) the identification of activities to be included in the marketing efforts; and (4) the development of marketing strategies for each department. Since the marketing program began, the role of the department representatives has been expanded to include responsibilities for business/industry/government training, school relations, special events, continuing education, and public relations. Although some issues remain to be resolved, positive outcomes of the marketing process have included the expansion of the pool of potential donors, advisory  committee members, employers of graduates, and other contacts in the community; broader, more credible exposure in the marketplace; and the generation of revenues. An outline of the responsibilities of marketing representatives and the marketing objectives of SAIT's Business Education Department are appended to the paper. (AJL)",

The second track of the workshop made extensive use of case studies to examine the planning process. Participants could elect to follow either track or mix sessions from both. Topics, such as outcomes assessment, institutional effectiveness, linking accreditation and strategic planning, grantsmanship/resources development, and scenario development were considered in special sessions.

With regard to hiring, the Academic Senate argues that faculty must bear the primary responsibility for hiring new full- and part-time faculty, that appropriate adjustment in workload must be made to allow faculty to participate, and that the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges must provide a statewide mechanism to verify the academic records of applicants. After reviewing minimum employment qualifications for faculty, including a master's degree for academic faculty and a bachelor's degree with four years of appropriate work experience for  vocational/technical faculty, the section on hiring presents recommendations for implementing the guidelines. The next section suggests procedures and standards for the transfer of full- or part-time faculty from one teaching discipline to another and for the transfer of administrators to teaching positions. With respect to professional development, the paper asserts that development and renewal opportunities must be provided by the colleges, that faculty who transfer to new disciplines should be provided with reasonable opportunities to develop skills, and that adequate staff development funds should be regularly set aside. Finally, guidelines for faculty evaluation are presented, suggesting that the same criteria should apply to full- and part-time faculty and administrators with  teaching responsibilities, and that faculty be involved in tenure decisions.

        "description":"Designed to assist California community college personnel in implementing 1986 regulations concerning associate degree requirements, this paper analyzes the key terms in the new policy, &quot;college level&quot; and &quot;critical thinking,&quot; and discusses practical implications for assessment, curriculum, and instruction. First, the paper identifies factors that can be used to define &quot;college level,&quot; including intensity, abstractness, open-endedness, rigor, independence, and type of instructional materials. A chart linking these factors with instructional methods, assignments, and tests is provided. The remainder of the paper focuses on &quot;critical thinking,&quot; arguing for a broad definition of the term, encompassing the generation of ideas, decision making, problem solving, and profound thinking.  Subsequent sections examine: (1) the appropriateness of a broad definition for educational policy; (2) a programmatic definition of critical thinking skills as those diverse cognitive processes and associated attitudes critical to intelligent actions in diverse situations and fields that can be improved by instruction or conscious effort; (3) the cognitive processes that do not constitute critical thinking (e.g., innate or instinctive processes) and learning activities that do not require these skills (e.g., short answer quizzes or rote drills); (4) holistic assessment of competencies; (5) learning objectives; (6) the impact of critical thinking requirements on programs and enrollments; (7) curriculum planning; and (8) course structures. The next sections of the paper describe a  process-oriented method for teaching critical thinking, discuss coaching techniques that support skill development, and underscore the importance of planning for transfer and commitment to the process. Finally, a chart is presented which identifies the components of intelligent acts and related generic and domain-specific thinking skills and attitudes. (AJL)",

        "description":"A Single Team Bargaining (STB) approach was used to reduce the complications in labor/management relations resulting from the merger of the British Columbia Institute of Technology and the Pacific Vocational Institute. Traditionally, collective bargaining is a conflict-oriented process, in which the parties represent different constituents, are governed by often incongruent responsibilities and demands, and must compete for limited resources. STB, on the other hand, is a collective process in which parties view the success of the organization as a common goal in their search for solutions that are acceptable to both labor and management. In the STB process, there is no one spokesperson, discussions are off the record, all ideas are examined carefully, more than one solution is  documented, constraints are declared, extensive research may be required, there is no game playing, and caucuses are deemed unnecessary. The Institute has successfully reached three collective bargaining agreements using STB and has found that the focus of the negotiations is on real problems, not symptoms, that parties are prevented from digging in behind unilateral solutions, and that management and the union have both reacted positively. Though the process has advantages, STB will not work without trust and commitment. (AJL)",

Chapter 1 describes the process used to evaluate the 22 programs, identifies primary sources of information, and offers a profile of EOPS students in 1984-85 through 1987-88. Chapter 2 presents a survey of the EOPS services, noting exemplary activities. Highlighted findings include the following: (1) all of the programs distributed financial aid, but the amount of the aid, the form in which it was distributed, and  the timing of the distributions differed considerably by college; (2) half of the programs were managed by a full-time director or coordinator; (3) all 22 programs were involved in outreach and recruitment efforts in their local service areas; (4) in cases in which the EOPS programs funded a portion of the total costs of the colleges' tutoring services, additional tutoring services beyond the level normally provided to other students were available to EOPS students; and (5) counseling services to facilitate transfer to four-year colleges were provided by most schools. Chapter 3 offers a summary of the recommendations for program improvement resulting from the evaluation. Appendixes provide a list of the programs reviewed in 1987-88, guidelines on operational program review procedures, and  statistics on the characteristics and goals of the EOPS student populations in 1984-85 through 1987-88.

After studying financial aid problems, processes, and trends, the Chancellor's Task Force on Student Financial Assistance developed a series of recommendations for enhancing the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges' role in policy development at the federal and state levels. The task force recommended that the Board of Governors: (1) support federal initiatives to increase the availability  and accessibility of federal grants to community college students; (2) support legislation to establish a new state grant program for community college students to reduce their dependence on loans; (3) adopt financial aid packaging policies that encourage colleges to restrict as much as possible federal loans as a source of financial aid for first-time students; (4) support federal initiatives that would help institutions reduce GSL default rates, while reaffirming the colleges' open door philosophy; and (5) focus new or redirected federal and state funds on first-time students and investigate work-study programs as an alternative to loans.

        "description":"Contact North/Contact Nord (CN) was designed to enhance distance education opportunities at the secondary and postsecondary levels in Northern Ontario through the use of new information and communication technologies. The central thesis of CN is that access to education at all levels could be improved through a combined effort by community colleges, universities, and adult-education providers, and that such an effort would create a synergistic effect beyond the resources or capabilities of any one of the participating educational institutions. One component of the four-year pilot project focuses on the development of distance education programs. The Northern Distance Education Fund, which was established to underwrite the cost of creating new programs and encourage cooperative  program development, has approved 22 feasibility studies and 15 full degree or certificate programs, with priority given to collaborative projects and those focusing on the specific educational and instructional needs of Northern Ontario. Another component of the CN is the cooperative use of a heterogeneous collection of educational delivery technologies. The most common mode of delivery is print and audio tape packages supplemented by audio and computer conferencing. The initiative has had remarkable success in reducing the geographic and/or philosophic isolation of the participating colleges, in encouraging creativity in program development and resource utilization, and in improving student support systems and professional development. Information on institutional access and user  charges, the roles of the two regional coordinating centers and local site coordinators is included, and enrollment and bridged teleconference statistics are also provided.

        "description":"Drawing from information gathered at conferences, through a literature review, telephone interviews with writing directors at all the community colleges in Michigan and several four-year institutions, and a survey of faculty members at Monroe County Community College (MCCC) this report assesses the status of writing-across-the-curriculum (WAC) in community colleges and offers recommendations for implementing a WAC program at MCCC. After parts I and II define WAC in terms of what it is and is not, parts III and IV review the literature on the benefits and drawbacks of four WAC models. Part V looks at the applicability of these models for MCCC, concluding that teacher-centered models would place too great a burden on the faculty and financial resources of the college, but that a  writing center model would have potential for long-term success. Parts VI and VII present the results of a survey of MCCC faculty views on student writing, indicating that an overwhelming majority of MCCC students have writing problems in such areas as organization, supporting an idea, coherence, grammar, punctuation, spelling, vocabulary, and proofreading. Parts VIII and IX briefly describe selected WAC programs in Michigan and other parts of the country, and part X looks at the status of WAC in each community college in Michigan. After part XI sets forth five WAC options for MCCC, part XII suggests steps that should be taken if a WAC emphasis were to be implemented at the college. A 33-item bibliography is included. (EJV)",

In many of the areas that have attracted or developed high-technology industries, a close alliance with a higher education institution has been an important consideration. The colleges and universities provide  research facilities for firms, as well as a pool of qualified, newly-trained personnel. Cooperation between colleges and firms helps bridge the gap between the first generation of an idea and the commercialization of a product or process. Finally, colleges can play an important role as catalysts in the transformation of economies from manufacturing to information-based industries. In order to ensure economic growth, state governments should develop policies to encourage relationships between businesses and colleges. (AJL)",

        "description":"In support of the premise that a better understanding of the causes of poor student motivation may lead to the development of techniques to stop unmotivated students from dropping out of college, this paper reviews the literature on the nature of motivation among adolescents and factors influencing academic achievement. After introductory comments on the problem of underprepared and unmotivated community college students, the paper considers the following aspects of student motivation: (1) the educational attitudes and low level of involvement in learning of unmotivated students; (2) the incidence and causes of dropping out; and (3) the special motivational problems of underprepared students. Arguing that most unmotivated community college students experienced similar problems in  high school, the paper then considers their attributes in terms of college entrance examination scores, knowledge level, courses, family characteristics, lack of involvement and motivation, and tendency to drop out of school. The next section reviews materials on motivation in adolescents, considering social influences, adolescent identity, locus of control, attributions for success or failure, academic goals, aspirations, deferred gratification, and academic self-concept. After reviewing students' reasons for attending college, the paper considers ways in which the high school environment and curriculum can be modified to enhance motivation; reviews research on single-sex high schools and boarding schools; and looks at ways the community environment and students' parents can influence  motivation. Next, ways of increasing students' involvement in learning and raising their expectations are discussed. After suggesting that more attention be paid to the motivation of average students, the paper highlights teaching methods that can help motivate all students. A 58-item bibliography is included.

Increased federal support for Title XX programs was advocated, partly on the grounds that day care employees have long subsidized child day care. Concluding testimony of experts concerns the accomplishments of a day care planning project, a child care resource center, and the employee benefits offered by a bank holding company.

The report begins with 12 recommendations concerning day care and latchkey programs, and continues with a summary of the dialogues. The emphasis throughout the dialogues was on the responsibility and control parents have in the education and upbringing of their children. The keynote speaker, United States Congressman, Thomas J. Tauke, set the theme for the conference by asking the participants and attendees to ponder the options available for care for latchkey children. Topics discussed by other speakers included  corporate contributions to the needs of the absent parent, private and community resources available for child care, and perspectives on current child care programs. The report also includes letters from President Reagan and Secretary of Education William J.

Over the past 10 years, California's society has shifted from a predominantly White to a predominantly ethnic society. The number of the state's people living in poverty has increased, and poverty has been concentrating in big cities. The achievement gap between Latino and Black students and other students is significant. The report suggests that the causes of low achievement include the quality of education that poor and minority children receive and an environment that has limited resources with which to support students. Some schools have attained high achievement among minority and low-income students. Foremost among common characteristics of these schools is a belief that all  students can learn. Three of these schools, Sweetwater High School, Claremont Middle School, and Bell Gardens Elementary School are covered. Fifteen recommendations concerning the curriculum, teachers, principals, parents, and communities of California are offered. The report concludes with an appendix. (RJC)",

        "description":"A wide variety of kindergarten teacher training programs existed in America during the 50-year period between 1920 and 1970 after Froebel's system was introduced. The most significant reasons for this variety were the sources of knowledge about the system, the ability of its advocates to read idiomatic German, and the basic personality characteristics of persons who gained leadership. The development from an apprenticeship method to kindergarten training schools and then to incorporation of kindergarten into normal schools designed for the preparation of teachers for all grade levels had its parallel in the rise of compulsory public education. Socioeconomic conditions and changed attitudes toward women were also reflected in the training of kindergarten teachers. Carrying the  momentum forward was the exponential increase in the numbers of kindergarten classes and in the popularity that they attained during the half century. Discussion provides a broad overview of American teacher training during the period and descriptions of kindergarten apprenticeship training, kindergarten training schools, and kindergarten in normal schools.

        "description":"The purposes of this paper are to consider how the prototypical research design of day care studies may unjustifiably emphasize day care as the effective factor or &quot;treatment&quot; in children's development, and to describe processes by which the family or some interaction between the family and day care may also affect preschoolers' development. The paper points out five alternative processes, in addition to the direct effect of day care, by which day care and the family may affect preschoolers. After an exploration of problems in the design of most day care studies, discussion focuses on: (1) day care as treatment; (2) the family as treatment; and (3) the combination of day care and family as treatment. The family may be the effective or variable in day care studies. Nonparental  care, alternatively, may affect children indirectly, through its effects on parents. Day care could mediate the effects of the family on a child's development. Day care may have an effect on the child which, in turn, affects the parent-child relationship. Finally, families may affect their children in such a way as to influence the relationship between their children and day care. It is concluded that researchers may easily emphasize the direct effects of day care on the child, while overlooking other important sources of influence that may be independent or that may interact with day care.

        "description":"While there is a genuine hope among some educators that computer use will radically restructure the process of education, and fear from others that it may very well succeed in doing so, it is unlikely that such aspirations or fears should be held for early childhood education at this time. Nor does it seem likely that the situation will change quickly. Evidence from both theoretical and empirical sources suggests that computers by themselves are not advantageous or disadvantageous for young children. As with any new item of preschool equipment, their value depends on the context within which the item is used, and on the manner in which the environment for learning and development is established by teachers and parents. A number of observational studies need to be done before it  becomes evident which variables should be investigated. Adults' perceptions of computers, and their expectations for their use, will shape the way in which they will be used. The theme of this paper is that careful thought must be given to the model of education being promulgated when computers are advocated for young children. (RH)",

The study relied primarily on the theoretical and methodological perspective of interpretive interactionism: an approach that illuminates themes, as they emerge, in the experiences and perspectives of social actors in everyday situations. Included is a discussion of the perspectives of both parents and providers regarding their satisfaction with each other and the extent and content of their communication and collaboration. Findings suggested that there may be little communication or collaboration between  providers and parents that is related to their expectations and the children's ongoing experience and development.

Each of the groups, families, school principals, classroom teachers, and Chapter 1 teachers provided a different point of view about the Homestart Program. To allow each viewpoint to emerge, findings from each group at each educational level are discussed  separately. The final section of the report integrates the four points of view. Although a curtailment of funding for the program was announced midway through the evaluation, the problem was considered unlikely to influence respondents' attitudes toward the intervention, and the program continued to receive widespread support.

Ethnographic research in two primary schools in the south of England identified six aspects of settings which can be used to mark gender: social categories, group composition, space, material culture, activities, and behavioral styles. Of the six, grouping, space, and materials are discussed. Longitudinal observations were made in three first-year classes of the schools. Observations conducted over a period of weeks in the second half of the first school term resulted in the recording of target children's activities. At least 10 and no more than 20 observations were recorded for each child. Findings  identified the resources for the expression of social gender identities that are available to children as they enter school. The resources marked as masculine and feminine can be mobilized by children who are entering school. (RH)",

        "description":"Organic education, which was introduced into the United States during the last third of the 19th century, was based upon Froebel's ideal of life as a connected whole. The late 19th century was a favorable period for innovation, for its economic prosperity made leaders feel that with the use of scientific methods anything was possible, and its society was overtly child-centered. For more than a century, America's dominant educational philosophy had been based on John Locke's concept of children as a blank slate upon which teachers should imprint those things that would produce virtuous, hard-working citizens. In contrast, organic educators advocated self-activity and self-direction. They believed that a child's full potential was contained in the child at birth and that the  function of adults was to encourage that potential to emerge. In 1988, nearly 100 years after William Hailmann implemented organic education in La Porte, Indiana schools, it seems ironic that one of the most hotly debated issues in preschool education is whether organic education should be incorporated into the public schools.

The fact that Native American schools have fared poorly when standardized achievement tests have been used as measures of effectiveness led to a concentration on the definition of variables that separate effective from ineffective schools. The study compared achievement scores of Chapter I students in four conventional Bureau of Indian Affairs elementary schools (under nonlocal control) with those of three contract elementary schools (under local control) where native  language and culture were part of the curriculum. Results, which covered school years from 1980-81 to 1983-84, indicated no difference in any achievement test area. However, the independent variable of native language of the teacher did lead to significantly higher scores in reading and language for students whose teachers were native speakers of the first language used. These results suggest that a combination of local control and instruction in native language in Native American schools can make a difference in student achievement. (SKC)",

        "description":"This publication is based on two surveys of the same Anchorage, Alaska households taken in June and November 1987 to study the effects of a strong recession of the previous two years. Different kinds of households were queried about household incomes, housing status, members' occupations, moving plans, and expectations about the financial future. Results showed that close to 13% of the households had left Anchorage in the interim months. Those who left were more likely to be young renters, out of work, in the military or to have lived in Anchorage relatively few years. Nearly half of single-family homeowners had paid more than their homes were worth at the time of the survey and many condominium owners owed more than their properties were worth. Half the renters surveyed said  they were considering buying homes in Anchorage. More than 65% of renters had moved into Anchorage within the previous 18 months. Only 7% of homeowners had plans to move within the city in the coming year. Longtime residents and people who came to Anchorage during the boom years of the early '80s were among those hardest hit by the recession. Many were affected by the real estate slide. New arrivals were the clear winners. Most came with jobs, housing was cheap, and they were optimistic about their financial futures. Anchorage residents generally became more optimistic about the economy between June and November. The document includes tables, charts, endnotes, and a list of other Institute of Social and Economic Research publications. (TES)",

        "description":"This review describes Alaska's economic boom of the early 1980s, the current recession, and economic projections for the 1990s. Alaska's economy is largely influenced by oil prices, since petroleum revenues make up 80% of the state government's unrestricted general fund revenues. Expansive state spending was responsible for most of Alaska's economic growth in the early 1980s. Plummeting oil prices triggered a recession by late 1985. A medium case scenario, which assumes that oil prices remain stable at about $18 per barrel, projects that the recession will bottom out in mid-1988 and that slow but steady growth will follow. Alaska's population, number of wage and salary jobs, and real personal income rose 30-37% between 1980 and 1985, will probably fall 3-10% between 1985 and  1988, and should rise to slightly better than 1985 levels by 1995, according to medium case projections. Fairbanks and southeast Alaska will have the fastest recovery, while Anchorage and North Slope regions will have the slowest. The report includes economic projections based on best and worst case scenarios; employment projections broken down into (1) construction jobs; (2) trade, finance, and service jobs; (3) mining, manufacturing, transportation, communications, and utilities jobs; and (4) government jobs. Nineteen figures and graphs, and a descriptive list of nine recent publications by the University of Alaska's Institute of Social and Economic Research are included. (SV)",

The guide discusses the potential hazards of pesticides and the kinds of clothing and equipment that should be worn for personal protection. It also explains how the type of pesticide formulation affects an individual's chances for exposure, and how to clean, maintain, and store personal protective equipment such as respirators, boots, masks, and clothing. The guide illustrates and describes washing procedures during and after pesticide use, levels of toxicity, formulations, precautionary statements on hazards to humans shown on pesticide labels, handling of concentrates, and the protective clothing and equipment needed for either minimum or maximum  exposure to various chemical formulations.

        "description":"Three socioeconomic classes of rural students ages 6 to 18 were interviewed about their conceptions of the rich and poor and economic inequality. The 114 students in the sample were divided as follows: (1) middle class, 23; (2) working class, 61; and (3) lower class, 30. Responses of the students are analyzed according to Leahy's categories of descriptions of the rich and poor. These categories are (1) peripheral, referring to possessions, appearances, and behaviors; (2) central, referring to traits and thoughts; and (3) sociocentric, referring to life chances and class consciousness. Central characteristics, use of which increased with the respondent's age, were most frequently employed in defining classes of persons. Sociocentric responses were evident in describing the rich,  while peripheral responses were used to describe the poor. Subjects seemed unable to explain inequalities in wealth. Both younger and older children viewed personal effort within the existing social structure as the main means of increasing wealth. It is suggested that rural children, though less isolated by socioeconomic class than urban children, may reflect a belief of limited socioeconomic mobility. Findings are interpreted from the perspective of three theoretical systems: cognitive developmental, functionalist, and conflict. Tentative implications for the social studies curriculum of elementary, junior, and senior high schools are presented. Includes 26 references and appendices. (CS)",

        "author":["Weinberg, Mark L."],
        "description":"This profile summarizes the responses of 20 managers of rural business incubators, reporting on their operations, entry and exit policies, facility promotion, service arrangements and economic development outcomes. Incubators assist small businesses in the early stages of growth by providing them with rental space, shared services, management and business assistance, and an entrepreneurial environment. The number of U.S. business incubators has increased from 40 in 1983 to 271 in March 1988, the majority of them being in smaller rather than larger urban areas. Findings show academic institutions managed 55% of all rural incubators, with nonprofit organizations accounting for another 40%. Entry policies for rural incubators are similar to those for incubators nationally. Half of  the facilities had formal exit policies. Rural development rates, measured in occupancy and incubator milestones, were lower than national averages. Recruitment of entrepreneurs is a problem facing all incubators, but especially for rural projects. The most effective recruitment method reported was individual contact. Assistance most used by tenants were accounting, marketing, business plans, and government grants and loans. Services were paid for using tenant reimbursements, donations, and professional fee reductions. It is concluded that, while incubators contribute to community development, the process has been slow and risky. Rural educational institutions are taking a disproportionate part of this risk and their continued involvement in incubator development is crucial. Subsequent  research must resolve policy and management questions concerning strategies for incubators. The paper includes tables, endnotes and a sample list of rural incubators. (TES)",

          "Zekeri, Andrew A."],
        "description":"Former agricultural students from five Southern land-grant universities evaluated the relevance of curriculum competencies and skills to their careers. Using a 4-point scale, 291 respondents from 1862 institutions and 105 respondents from 1890 institutions rated 15 action competencies and 23 agricultural competencies. On action competencies, respondents rated oral communication skills as most needed and computer and statistical skills as least needed. Compared to the 1862 alumni, 1890 alumni gave higher ratings to all skills, and gave significantly higher ratings to written communications, project evaluation, public speaking, cost management, computer use, and basic statistical techniques. This may reflect a feeling by 1890 alumni that their precollege training in action  competencies was insufficient, or it may reflect precollege expectations by 1862 alumni of more specialized curricula with less emphasis on basic action competencies. Among agricultural competencies, respondents rated knowledge and use of agricultural chemicals as most needed and awareness of the world food problem as lest needed. However, the highest need score for agricultural competencies was lower than the lowest need score for action competencies. Three animal science skills were the highest rated items for 1890 alumni and among the lowest-rated items for the 1862 alumni. The 1890 alumni also tended to give higher scores to broad general competencies such as awareness of the world food problem. These results may arise from the college major of the respondents and the presence of many  foreign students among 1890 alumni. The report includes eight statistical tables and four references.

Among the four national health and nutrition surveys conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey plans to oversample Mexican Americans, the largest Hispanic subgroup, in its current project, and completed a special regional survey of Hispanics in 1984. The National Medical Expenditures Survey will oversample Hispanics in general. The National Health Interview Survey and the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey currently have  no such plans. The Vital Statistics Program's new birth and death registration forms include a Hispanic identifier. The states need not decide whether to use the form until 1989, but 23 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City already collect Hispanic natality and mortality data.

The purpose of IRCA is to control illegal immigration to the United States, and a key provision makes it illegal for employers to knowingly hire or continue to employ undocumented aliens. Since enforcement of employer sanctions began in June 1987, it is too soon to clearly identify and measure IRCA's effects. In addition, researchers differ as to the best method for measuring the flow of undocumented Mexican workers to the United States, and there is a lack of pre-IRCA baseline data on the Mexican economy and social structure. A meaningful assessment of IRCA's impact on Mexico requires a coordinated research effort by  Mexico and the United States. Appendix I contains a map identifying the Mexican states which are the chief source of emigration, and it summarizes research covering: (1) history and characteristics of Mexican migration to the United States; (2) major impacted areas in the two countries; (3) characteristics of Mexican migrants; (4) numbers of undocumented migrants; and (5) IRCA's possible impact on Mexico's economy and labor force, and on the level of private remittances from the United States to Mexico.

Pest prevention may be possible by modification of pest habitat: removal of food and water sources, removal or destruction of pest shelter and breeding sites, and good horticultural practices that reduce plant stress. Nonchemical alternatives to pesticides involve biological treatments by natural predators, parasites, or pathogens, or mechanical treatments such as trapping or removal by hand. Nonchemical pest controls require time and energy, but pose no health hazards and do not create pesticide resistant pest populations. Chemical controls are available in many forms. Chemicals are easy and quick to use, but require careful use and generally achieve only temporary results. A careful  reading of the pesticide label is essential for selection and use of the proper product.

Prior to its venture into television, the office had produced, for inclusion in the extension service's news packet, two or three science stories per week on what researchers were doing and hoped to find. In the course of writing these stories, the office staff became generalists in the agricultural sciences and established contacts throughout Georgia's widespread system of agricultural experiment stations. The staff checked all stories back with the researchers before distribution, and gradually developed a reputation as serious professionals. This background made the transition to television relatively easy. The staff returned to  their print stories and prior contacts, and changed the stories into television segments. The office's approach assumed that the public television audience was interested in science news, especially in so relevant a field as agriculture. The mechanics of television production included: (1) taking the show into the laboratory or research site; (2) keeping plans minimal; (3) shooting about five times as much tape as needed; (4) assembling the final tape by intercutting the interview with field or laboratory pictures; and (5) writing a concise script.

The paper details the project's seven-step method for building or regenerating a local economy. The second paper, &quot;The Nature of Regeneration: The Evolution of a Concept,&quot; (Ron Shegda, Gabel) offers philosophical background for the economic theory, borrowing terms from various disciplines. The paper also discusses the holistic thinking behind regeneration. The third paper, &quot;The Regeneration Center: A Vortex for Local Economic  Development,&quot; (Gabel) discusses plans for a center that would produce research, marketing surveys and perform outreach, networking, education, and business incubation. The paper also discusses financing and personnel for the center. The fourth paper, &quot;Tools for Regeneration: Beyond the Bottom Line,&quot; (Ellen Pahl, Gabel) discusses work for evaluating and initiating local economic regeneration. The tools for such work include indexes, inventories, and market searches. The work should reach beyond &quot;narrow economic concerns&quot; to tie a local economy into natural systems, use of free time, and the creativity of local people. The last paper, &quot;The Need for Pioneer Enterprises in Regeneration Zones,&quot; (Robert Rodale) supports the need for regeneration projects, especially in agriculture.

The profile looks at the dropout rate and student enrollment, including the number of students receiving public assistance, special education, and bilingual education. Also studied are: the pupil/teacher ratio and teacher loads in various grade levels; the number of certified staff, including degrees and years of experience; proficiency examinations and the number of graduates; and the results of standardized achievement tests (Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills). Vocational education information is also reported. Section 1 of the document is a summary overview of the statewide data, gathered over a 3-year period. The  data indicate that the number of New Mexico students is increasing as is the diversity of their needs. Forty-seven percent of the students are Anglo, 40% are Hispanic, and 10% are Native American. Of the teachers, about 70% are Anglo, 24.2% are Hispanic, 1.6% are Native American, and 1.2% are Black.

This report describes the sociotechnical system implied by the panel's conception of human factors and outlines the factors that affect the performance of that system. It then reviews the chronology of the NRC's human factors research from 1981 to 1985. Following a brief discussion of research methodology and management, this report identifies a set of broad research areas and suggested high priority topics within these areas. Descriptions of these areas  and topics, together with recommendations on the management of human factors research, form the core of this report. The panel used the potential for increased plant safety as a criterion against which to evaluate the topics considered. Nine pages of references are included.

The investigations consider whether children's efforts to make conceptual sense of new mathematics instruction in terms of their available knowledge may sometimes lead them to make systematic errors. In particular, the possibility is explored that children overgeneralize concepts from a familiar domain of mathematics in order to interpret a new domain. A total of 113 children in the early phases of school instruction on decimal fractions participated: an American sample from grade 5 (n=17); an Israeli sample from grade 6 (n=21); and French samples from grades 4 (n=37) and 5 (n=38). Children were individually interviewed using described tasks. The findings are discussed in some detail.  There seem to be fundamental differences in the kinds of conceptual understanding that produce the Whole Number rule and Fraction rule. Different patterns of rule categorization among the three countries indicate that different curriculum sequences produce different patterns of rule invention. Errorful rules appear intrinsic to learning and cannot be avoided in instruction: they can best be regarded as useful diagnostic tools for instructors, to detect the nature of children's understanding of a mathematics topic.

Considerable research shows that many children learn mathematics as symbol manipulation rules, without meaning. Collaborative problem solving is used as a means for meeting the goals of interpretation and meaning construction. The social setting of shared problem solving provides occasions for modeling effective thinking strategies, critiquing and shaping of thinking, motivation to try new, more active approaches, and scaffolding for an individual learner's initially limited performance. Findings and interpretations from studies with fourth and fifth graders  focused on scaffolding are reported, and current and future studies are briefly described.

There were significant correlations between their abilities to perform computations and to answer more conceptual questions on individual tests and across separate tests, for the final examination, and for the total number of points earned throughout the semester. The correlations indicate that the two styles of testing provide partially redundant, but not totally overlapping, information about student knowledge. Further, although student averages did not differ in the two types of tests, they seldom preferred only conceptual tests of their knowledge, judging the computational  tests a better means of evaluation. Applications of these results extend to prediction of missing test scores and to the testing of students for whom English is a second language. (Author)",

Malinen) describes experimental teaching with low-achieving students in order to develop analytical skills, use of mathematical strategies, and metacognitive thinking. &quot;A Model for Teaching Problem Solving in Mathematics&quot; (E. Pehkonen) considers prerequisites for problem solving and sketches a model  for teaching problem solving which incorporates the solving of separate problems as well as problem solving as a teaching method. &quot;Identification, Comparison and Justification of Central Research Orientations in Didactic Research of Mathematics&quot; (T. Keranto) aims to initiate discussion on central research orientations in didactic research as well as the reason why specific studies are needed. The final article, &quot;Schuelerschwierigkeiten in der Algebra&quot; (G. Loercher), focuses on difficulties students have learning algebra and describes the development of diagnostic tests. (MNS)",

This work is meant to complement another review of NSF's investment opportunities by estabishing a sound basis for designing and carrying out assessments aimed at any of the Foundation's investments in K-12 science education, especially the new initiatives it mounts. To make ideas about assessment concrete, and to illustrate a range of activities that are not now used extensively by NSF, a pilot test of alternative assessment procedures within one area of support--informal science education--was undertaken. In this volume the findings of seven pilot-test activities are reported. These pilot assessments were  intended to illustrate how short-term assessments could help NSF deal with difficult assessment questions. The results from each pilot assessment contains numerous insights into the effects of NSF's support for informal science education. (CW)",

        "description":"In supporting science education, the National Science Foundation (NSF) is, in some instances, funding the enrichment experiences of individual students, but more often it is supporting efforts to improve complex, decentralized education systems. Many feel that the Foundation's best chance for success lies in a grant support strategy that targets NSF's resources on aspects of these systems that are most susceptible to change and appropriately addressed by federal agencies. NSF needs to know what it is supporting and accomplishing--or likely to accomplish--and why, when it invests funds in science education. Having this information will contribute to the Foundation's own planning and good management, and also help demonstrate to external audiences what NSF is doing for science  education. To serve these needs, assessment needs to be defined more broadly than conventional forms of program evaluation to include any systematc efforts to inform decision making in NSF by gathering, interpreting, and reporting evidence of various kinds. This summary report presents recommendations to NSF to guide it in assessing its initiatives in science education. The report outlines appropriate goals, procedures, arrangements, and resources necessary to establish an effective set of assessment practices that build on existing assessment activities in the Foundation, fit with agency culture and constraints, and are both comprehensive and practical.

        "description":"Deciding how to approach a word problem for solution is a critical stage of problem solving, and is the stage which frequently presents considerable difficulty for novices. Do novices use the same information that experts do in deciding that two problems would be solved similarly? This set of four studies indicates that novices rely more on surface feature similarity. However, when certain aspects of the problem structure were held constant, novices correctly identified problems that would be solved similarly significantly more often. The results suggest: (1) the distinction of surface and deep features may not be rich enough for describing categorization of word problems, and (2) novice problem solvers are capable of recognizing some similarities of problem structure. A third  level of classification of word problems is proposed to explain these results. (Author)",

        "description":"Data for this study were obtained from the second follow-up of the sophomore cohort of the High School and Beyond Study, with 14,825 students from 1,015 schools involved. Mathematics and English self-concepts were found to be: (1) uncorrelated despite a substantial correlation between mathematics and English test scores; (2) influenced by internal and external frames of reference; and (3) negatively affected by school-average achievement. The internal/external frame of reference model posits that a student's self-concept in a particular academic subject area is formed in relation to performances by other students in the same subject (external) and in relation to the performance by the same student in other academic subjects (internal). As predicted by the model, better  mathematics skills were associated with substantially higher mathematics self-concepts, but slightly lower English self-concepts, whereas better English skills were associated with substantially higher English self-concepts, but slightly lower mathematics self-concepts. School-average achievement was one determinant of the external reference in that equally able students had higher academic self-concepts in schools with lower school-average achievement. Further, this school context effect was also content-specific. School-average mathematics achievement negatively affected only mathematics self-concept, and school-average English achievement negatively affected only English self-concept. (Author/MNS)",

The teachers, from central and southern Indiana, met for a week in June, 1987 and for 3 days in June, 1988. From October, 1987, to May, 1988, workshop staff visited classrooms of the participants to help them apply workshop ideas to their specific teaching situations. A second group of teachers was added for the June, 1988, workshops. Much of the time in the June, 1988, workshops was devoted to sharing of teaching experiences among both groups of teachers. Evaluation data from the project indicate that working with teachers over an extended period of time is an excellent inservice format. Participants spoke of the  camaraderie they developed over that period and of their opportunities to try out new ideas when workshop staff were available to help with any problems. Participants who attended only the June, 1988, session found teaching suggestions coming from their peers to be realistic and useful. In addition to evaluation data, the report includes outlines of project objectives, instructional activities, project administrative activities, and recommendations for organizers of similar projects.

These two organizations approached the task of developing these models with the goal to maximize productive research collaboration between industry and academia by streamlining the negotiation process for reaching a formal agreement. Some of the intended impacts from use of the documents are: a decrease in the time and effort required to reach an agreement; partners in research programs, rather than developing a contract from scratch, will use much of the model and devote their energies to negotiating specific features; and companies and  universities new to research alliances will have a sense of what is reasonable to consider in establishing a contract. Two models are presented. For the purposes of basic research support, simple research grants between universities and companies, as illustrated in part I, may be most effective. Where complex issues are raised by the parties, a research contract will be the most appropriate instrument. A \"typical first approach\" to such a contract is illustrated in part II. (Author/CW)",

        "description":"This paper analyzes the misconceptions high school students have about force and suggests that the misunderstanding of Newton's third law is the key to these misconceptions. Clinical interview and diagnostic test data (N=104) indicates that many students have a naive view of force as an acquired or innate property of single objects rather than that of forces arising from an interaction between objects. Some students' view of objects as inherently more \"force-full\" by virtue of their mass, speed, or activity suggests that Newton's third law, which makes explicit the relational quality of forces, should play a more important role than is ordinarily granted in teaching. If students acquire a deep understanding of the third law, they may have less difficulty with both quantitative  problems requiring the identification of forces and qualitative problems such as those drawing out the \"impetus\" misconception, in which many students view force as a property of a moving object causing it to move with constant velocity.

        "description":"This paper evaluates the strengths and limitations of a computer tutor designed to help students understand physics concepts. The tutor uses a teaching strategy called \"bridging analogies\" that previous research has demonstrated to be successful in one-to-one tutoring. The strategy is designed to remedy misconceptions by appealing to existing correct intuitions, and extending these intuitions by encouraging analogical thinking. Through a pretest (N=180) and a video-taped interview study, (N=25), subjects who answered the target for which a misconception existed incorrectly with high confidence and the analogous anchor correctly with high confidence were chosen to participate. Three types of data were collected: (1) notes taken by the interviewer during the sessions; (2) a  computer trace of the tutor's actions and user responses; and (3) videotaped recordings of the sessions (which totaled 15 sessions, 3 of which involved student pairs). Results of this formative evaluation indicates that most of the subjects improved their understanding of Newton's third law. Suggestions for improving the computer tutor using artificial intelligence technology were discussed. Appendices include the program data structures and algorithm, and an example section of a trace file. (YP)",

        "description":"It is often both possible and valuable for a teacher to be a researcher in his or her own classroom. This paper describes the nature of cognitive research and focuses on two areas of research that may be of special interest to classroom physics teachers. The first area refers to misconceptions that students bring with them to their physics classes. This part includes the nature of misconceptions, some examples, and implications for classroom teaching with instructional examples. The second area deals with different ways that novices and experts go about storing and accessing information and solving problems. Topics included are expert/novice differences in knowledge organization and problem solving, results of the Hierarchical Analysis Tool (HAT) study, and some implications for  the classroom. Discussed are the improvement of instruction, the development of testing instruments, and the necessity of teacher involvement in research. (YP)",

The review begins with telephone interviews of the IRS Taxpayer Education Coordinators and Joint Council of Economic Education Center Directors to establish their roles in the promotion of the videos, their comments on the programs, and their suggestions for new programs. The needs assessment also included two field studies conducted in San Francisco (California) and North Carolina to determine the extent of secondary school use of the booklet and the videos. The findings indicate a wider use of the booklet than the videos  in the classroom. The final conclusions are that the booklet and video programs need to be promoted as complementary and that the teacher's guide should incorporate both materials. Suggested topics for the new video programs include how to complete tax forms, where does tax money go, how tax legislation is created, the history of taxation, the relationship of taxation and fiscal policy, and the taxation systems of different countries. Appendices contain: (1) the telephone interview questionnaire; (2) North Carolina Curriculum Guide (Taxpayer Education Selection); (3) Tax Profile from &quot;Tax Whys&quot; Teacher's Guide; and (4) percentage breakdown of all survey items.

In New York City in 1917-18, the Board of Education: (1) called for the unqualified allegiance of school principals and teachers to the U.S. government; (2) allowed school facilities to be used for war-related activities; (3) began vocational skills training classes for military personnel; (4) started courses in patriotism, citizenship, European history, and on the world war; (5) suspended foreign language instruction; and (6) increased English classes for adult immigrants. At the initiation of the Board, students became involved in selling Liberty Bonds. The male students ages  16-19 were given military training, and some were sent out of the city to work on farms. Since visible patriotism became a requirement for their jobs, teachers were encouraged to support the Board's policies and to enlist in the armed forces or auxiliary services such as the Red Cross. Teachers who dissented were dismissed by the Board as seen in the cases of three teachers at De Witt Clinton High School and two at Manual Training High School. (DJC)",

Its thesis is that preservation of New York State's historical records, rare printed materials, and other research materials ought to be--but is not now--a matter or urgent public concern. The state's unique research materials serve as a vast common memory bank in order to better understand the past and the present and to prepare for the future. Due to neglect, improper storage, paper deterioration, and disasters, such as fire and flooding, the physical condition of these valuable resources puts the prospects for their  future use in doubt. A well-coordinated, long-term, statewide offensive is needed to meet the preservation goals. The issues and recommendations for immediate action include: (1) identification and selection of unique research resources in New York; (2) education and training for professional and technical staff; (3) preservation standards, guidelines, and information services; (4) disaster preparedness and assistance; (5) local and statewide public awareness; (6) investigation of preservation service needs and options; (7) state financial and technical assistance; (8) national cooperation and support; and (9) ongoing preservation evaluation and planning.

The research was conducted with eight individual teachers in Israel. Curriculum analysis is the critical and systematic examination of curriculum materials in order to identify their positive and negative characteristics, potential for teaching and learning, and hidden values and assumptions. Materials-in-use are analyzed to determine strengths or weaknesses to allow for modified implementation. The analysis is guided by an instrument or a scheme which includes questions or criteria to be considered throughout the examination. This instrument is called &quot;SALTAL&quot; and includes 33 prescriptive criteria which  explicate the desirable characteristics of good curriculum materials and therefore are normative and judgmental. A description is given of the teachers who participated in the study, the SALTAL instrument, and the way the study was conducted. While substantial growth in curriculum knowledge in the eight teachers was observed, they had difficulty when analyzing familiar materials in detaching themselves from their implementation mode and regarding them objectively. The strengths and weaknesses of the SALTAL instrument are analyzed and recommendations are made for further research. (JD)",

Foremost among the concerns of the researchers were such topics as: (1) How many teachers are working outside the field? (2) How much time is spent in these extra activities? (3) What kinds of activities are teachers involved in; and (4) Why do teachers hold a part-time job? Respondents were primarily married females under the age of 40 who were married to working spouses; however few of their spouses were teachers. Thirty-eight percent of the teachers surveyed worked in order to gain extra-contractual income. Although slightly more than one-third of the teachers were involved in  extra-contractual activities, over one-half of those not working at extra jobs would work at an outside job if jobs were available in their geographic area. The jobs at which teachers worked included the usual in-school activities of coaching, bus driving, and tutoring. Activities outside the school did not fall into any category except that of low pay. Outside-school jobs included child care, waiter-waitress, sales clerk, and garbage collector. (Author/JD)",

A direct, self-report methodology was used covering various dimensions of teacher needs. Although there was a significant improvement of the teachers who had served on a multi-disciplinary staff for developing Individualized Education Programs, teachers' misunderstandings of PL 94-142 in 1980 were confirmed in 1988. While there was greater interest in teaching handicapped students, it was no better than \"neutral/mixed\". A majority of the teachers in 1980 and 1988 indicated a general need for assistance in motor behavior assessments. A majority of the teachers received encouragement and support from their  administration in 1980, however, in 1988 there was a decline in support. Both in 1980 and 1988, over 75 percent of the teachers believed that handicapped students are excluded from participation in physical education due to the \"nature of the handicap\" and \"functional ability.\" Results confirmed that teachers still lack the instructional capacities necessary to conduct physical education in the least restrictive environment.

It is argued that researchers' answers have suffered from defects both in how the question has been framed and where the answers are to be found. It is pointed out that, assuming that teaching can and should change, \"barriers\" to change have been sought, but most explanations on conservatism in teaching focus on external conditions such as finance, organizations, incentives, and the like. However, locating the fundamental barriers to change in instruction within teaching and learning, rather than outside of them, it is posited that teaching is a practice in which one human being tries to improve the ideas, capacities, emotional states, or organization of others. Efforts to make teaching more  adventurous, spontaneous, and exciting run directly counter to the conservative tendencies in instructional practice, exemplified by the understanding of teaching as an attempt to \"improve\" the student. The nature of practice itself and its social constitution, perhaps, explain why so few teachers have embraced innovations. Even if restraining conditions were swept away, the nature of practice is such that most teachers and students would have great difficulty implementing instructional reforms that encourage sponaneous discovery learning.

This program used funds from Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. An awareness campaign, screening and evaluation of children, and serving as a liaison between the schools and outside agencies serving handicapped children were the program's objectives. Data were collected by interviews with special education administrators and diagnosticians and review of records of the Child Find Office and the District Diagnostic Center. Focus was on evaluating the program's impact and effectiveness. Parents referred 165 children in the first year. The children  ranged in age from 1 year to school age; 57.64% were 3 or 4 years old. Parents found out about the program from: (1) program staff; (2) awareness campaign literature; (3) friends or relations; (4) school newsletter; (5) referral by physicians and psychologists; (6) program reports; and (7) school or day care center. Parents referred children for the following major reasons: (1) language and speech problems; (2) hearing problems; (3) behavior problems; and (4) unspecified concerns. About 16% of the children referred qualified for special education programs; parents of those who did not qualify received suggestions and activities for working with their children. (SLD)",

A total of 133 APS school personnel (118 special education teachers and teachers aides and 15 administrators) returned usable surveys--57 from elementary schools, 36 from middle schools, 30 from high schools, and 10 from area offices. Approximately 620 students in Side-by-Side, special education housed on public school campuses, participated. The program was intended to help students physically, recreationally, and socially, with an  emphasis on developing self-confidence and self-care skills. The results indicate that about 74% of the staff thought physical and recreational benefits were derived. Self-confidence increased and self-care skills improved. About 66% of the survey respondents thought the benefits of the swimming program outweighted students absence from usual instruction was well spent. These were suggestions, and they were only examples. (SLD)",

Reasons why principals assign teachers to classes when the teachers lack the state required or recommended certification were studied via administration of the Course Data Survey. This study represents an effort to verify data from the Course Data Survey (in which procedural errors were detected and corrected between the fall of 1985 and February of 1997) and to improve the accuracy of the automated system currently used to identify out-of-field assignments at the secondary level--the Teacher Certification Report. The overall percentage of out-of-field classes was 10.8% (3,314 of 30,607 classes), with  exceptional student education excluded. Out-of-field assignments were as likely in areas where the state certification is required, such as vocational classes, as they were in the areas where specific certification is only recommended. In Dade County, these assignments are higher than in other parts of Florida. At the junior high level, 13.9% of assignments are out-of-field; the percentage is lower in senior high schools. Fourteen tables show subject areas and provide comments about teacher assignment. Appendices contain instruments used to survey principals. (SLD)",

It was planned to increase the scores on standardized tests for identified students.

The average gains ranged from 5.2 to 11.6. That the average gain exceeded  the target of Goal 1.4 and was statistically significant can be attributed to teachers targeting those students with lower scores and providing instruction in deficit areas.

        "author":["Bishop, John"],
        "description":"This paper presents evidence that recent aptitude test score decline is signaling a significant deterioration in the quality of entering cohorts of workers. The impact of general intellectual achievement (GIA) on productivity; trends in the GIA of the adult populations, students, and working adults; accounting for the labor quality growth when credentials signal GIA; and the productivity consequences of test score decline are discussed. The test score decline, which began around 1967, was roughly equal to the learning that takes place in 1.25 years of high school. The resulting wage rate decline was determined to be 7.1%. New estimates of the quality of the work force are developed that take into account improvements in the quality and quantity of education. Although substantial  evidence links the decline in productivity with test score decline, the timing may seem inappropriate in linking the two factors causally. Teenagers play only a minor role in the economy; thus, a decline in their test scores cannot account for a simultaneous drop in productivity growth. Nevertheless, declines in test scores for teenagers since the late 1960s may be responsible for the non-appearance of the anticipated rebound in productivity growth forecast for the 1980s. Eight figures, eight data tables, and 81 references are provided. (TJH)",

Seventy-one percent were in kindergarten through grade 5. Over 3,000 were new entrants to the program in that year. About 1 in 5 students in bilingual education were late entrants or left the program prematurely; most of these students were in the program less than 90 days, usually because their families moved out of the district. Local districts supplied most of the program costs; the state contributed 5.5%. About 10% of the students exited the bilingual program and entered all-English classrooms. The longer students continued in bilingual instruction, the more likely they were to exit to all-English  instruction. In the lower grades, exiting students were more likely to perform at targeted levels than were high school students. The most important characteristic of these students is their extreme mobility. Several years in bilingual instruction may be needed before students catch up on English skills.

The program concentrates on first through third grades, although there are some pull-out classes for grades 4-6; and teachers use the Behavior Training Series. The effect of ATTLAS on the acquisition of English was evaluated, and the performance of 672 students who had and 213 students who had not participated in the ATTLAS program was compared. The program's effectiveness was evaluated via observations of students' performance during the 1986-87 academic year and assessing reactions of school personnel to the program. Survey data were analyzed for 38  teachers and 20 principals in the ATTLAS program (a response rate of 93% and 100% respectively). Results indicate that: (1) ATTLAS exerted a slight, positive effect on language acquisition; (2) no differences were seen in the effectiveness of different delivery modes for English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) instruction on language acquisition; and (3) school personnel reacted favorably to the program, but wanted more appropriate materials for younger grades. LEP students are not advancing through the school program as quickly as expected, but ATTLAS students are more likely to advance.

These analyses suggest that community members are more concerned about effective teaching and learning, creation of a middle school and a gifted program, motivation for learning, and classroom organization and supply. For all 71 statements, similar items were divided into 20 categories, average ratings of the statements in each category were reported, and  priorities among categories were discussed. This analysis confirms the significance of concerns uncovered by the initial analyses, and suggests that class size may constitute an additional topic of concern. However, this latter topic appears to relate to concerns about middle schools and to classroom organization and supply. The 71 needs statements and a list of the meeting participants are appended.

        "description":"This study compares the results of an indirect measure of writing ability, the Florida State Student Assessment Test, Part I (SSAT-I), and the Production Writing Assessment (PWA). Both instruments were administered to 10th graders in Dade County (Florida) during the spring of 1987. The SSAT-I is an untimed test containing a section indirectly measuring writing ability through multiple-choice items that address specific skills such as punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and grammar. The PWA directly measures writing performance by requiring students to write an essay on a given topic within one class period. A holistic scoring method (for 3,386 papers) and an analytical scoring method were used in the PWA. Results show that: (1) SSAT-I results agree with those from analytically  scored production writing only when students have fairly high levels of overall writing skill; (2) scores representing the same skills for below-average students tend to be lower on the SSAT-I than on the analytically scored papers; and (3) SSAT-I results tend to penalize students with lower levels of overall writing skills. It appears that use of the writing portion of the SSAT-I as the criterion for labeling schools deficient is, at best, debatable. Examples of holistically scored students' essays from the 1986 PWA and results of analytical scoring of the PWA are appended. (TJH)",

Program documents were reviewed and structured interviews were held with 7 TEC facilitators, 9 council members, and 12 individuals who had requested an inservice course for reasons of personal growth or professional development. The TEC also offers ancillary programs and courses. An extensive survey of 1,246 instructional personnel in the district and a limited survey of two directors of centers in other districts were also conducted. It was apparent that inservice courses were the major service offered, with 65.3% of instructional personnel  having taken at least one course. Personnel generally expressed satisfaction with TEC instructors, who are carefully selected and regularly evaluated. The only ancillary service appearing to be underutilized was the professional library. There is a perception of budget constraints among staff and service recipients; however, the TEC has been very effective in meeting the district's needs. Surveys and interview forms are appended.

The district's comprehensive plan is developed annually through a systematic district-wide process of specifying the objectives of the school system, determining the present attainment of those objectives, and selecting strategies for improvement. The evaluation is based on a self-evaluation by the respective district bureaus and offices and an independent review by the Office of Educational Accountability concerning the status of accomplishment of 23 objectives randomly selected from the total of 134 objectives. The objectives and  indicators were assessed in terms of the following categories: &quot;objective/indicator accomplished,&quot;&quot;considerable progress,&quot;&quot;moderate progress,&quot;&quot;little or no progress,&quot; or &quot;not applicable.&quot; On the basis of the two-pronged evaluation, it is concluded that the results of the independent review were generally in agreement with the self-evaluation by the bureaus and offices. Of the 23 objectives independently reviewed, 20 were in agreement with the assessment by the bureaus and offices. Ten objectives were accomplished, 5 exhibited considerable progress, 3 exhibited moderate progress, and 5 exhibited little or no progress. (TJH)",

Issues were examined by a policy analysis tool known as the convening process. Recommendations for a teacher testing policy are provided: (1) subject matter knowledge testing for teacher certification or licensure; (2) requirement of a specified certification score; (3) certification testing for all teachers regardless of other  certification; (4) limitations on temporary certification; (5) analysis of processes used in hiring, promotion, and tenure decisions; (6) review of tests and development of new tests; and (7) a writing test for diagnostic and prescriptive purposes for all new employees. Specific recommendations were made to improve the current validity procedures and test development process, including the establishment of a research and measurement unit to collaborate with the current Intern-Mentor program.

A comprehensive career ladder program was recommended, which should be: (1) related to student achievement; (2) involve a cross-section of professionals; (3) be tied to district-wide and school instructional improvement goals; (4) be tied to professional performance; (5) built on a valid, reliable, and equitable personnel evaluation system; (6) develop a  process for making career advancement decisions; (7) monitor the advancement decision process at the district level; and (8) integrate staff development with personnel evaluation. The goals of the program are to build upon and support student performance goals by improving instruction and providing incentives to teachers to remain in the profession and build their effectiveness. The program should contain a strong beginning teacher support system; serve the developmental needs of experienced teachers; and enhance professional aspects of teaching in the District of Columbia Public Schools.

Funded by a 3-year Title VII grant and implemented in six intermediate and junior high schools beginning in 1984-85, METs provide intensive elementary-level English, reading, and mathematics instruction to seventh through ninth graders. A resource specialist, five teachers, three teacher aides, a counselor, and a parent specialist move from one site to another. This study documents the nature of the instruction provided by the METs during the 1985-86 school year, and presents results of questionnaires on students' personal and school experiences and a teacher checklist concerning students' attendance and discipline patterns.  Sixty-eight students, 64 teachers, and 55 parents completed Year 2 questionnaires. As standard tests (namely, the Minimum English Competency test and a criterion-referenced math test) were found to be inadequate, a qualitative design was adopted. Results indicate that METs provide: (1) positive initial school experiences, resulting in a high level of student and parental satisfaction with the program; (2) sensitivity toward special student needs; (3) acculturation to the American educational system; (4) functional math and reading skills as well as survival English skills; and (5) services above and beyond those normally available to LEP students.

This report provides information about the success of the remedial reading program under this new organization in terms of student outcomes. Promotional &quot;gates&quot; in grades 4 and 7 were devised in 1980, with a students' promotion dependent upon meeting the criterion for that grade on the city-wide reading test. Students who failed to meet the criterion set on the California Achievement Test in reading or (for eligible limited English proficient students) on the Language Assessment Battery were eligible for the program. A total of 13,734 fourth- and seventh-grade students was eligible. Of the  12,248 students with both pre- and post-test scores, 81.5% met the criterion for their grade in August of 1985, January of 1986, or April of 1986. However, average gains were less than those made by students who participated in previous years. Patterns of achievement by promotional category were different from those of prior years. Achievement of students in an extension program continues to be problematic; gains of eighth-grade extension students, particularly, do not match those of other program students. It is recommended that the central and district program administrators review the programs for adequacy of teacher preparation and curriculum materials. Thirteen data tables are included. (TJH)",

Prepared by the General Accounting Office (GAO), the above research report covered selected years between 1973 and 1986. High-quality information on education is essential to the tasks of overseeing the use of federal resources, assessing the nation's progress, and identifying areas for improvement. In the last decade, federally sponsored research and statistical and evaluative information have declined dramatically. As less information was produced, there was also a shift from new data production to service-oriented activities. Three statistical series were evaluated: (1) the National Assessment of  Educational Progress (NAEP); (2) the Common Core of Data (CCD); and (3) the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS). The NAEP was rated high for relevance, timeliness, adequacy, and impact. The CCD was not rated highly, and the FRSS received mixed reviews. The overall picture is one of many reasons for concern about the production and quality of educational information, due mainly to the following interacting factors: (1) declines in funding; (2) the role of congressional mandates; and (3) changes in leadership and priorities. It is noted that the Department of Education does not share this pessimistic assessment made by the GAO. (SLD)",

        "description":"Diverse information is compiled to begin to address the question of how well students in Alaska are achieving. In 1987, each of the 55 districts in Alaska submitted results of its standardized testing program for Reading, Reading Comprehension, Mathematics, Mathematics Problem Solving, and Language Arts for the three school years from 1984-85 through 1986-87. Results were combined with information describing the students of each district, the nature of the school, the classroom environment, and characteristics of the testing program. State-wide results and the 55 individual school district profiles developed are included in this report. Each district description is supplemented with graphs to illustrate trends in the period. Seven major tests are used in Alaska in the various  districts, they include the: (1) California Achievement Tests; (2) Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills; (3) Iowa Test of Basic Skills/Test of Achievement and Proficiency; (4) Metropolitan Achievement Test; (5) Science Research Associates (SRA) Achievement Series; (6) SRA Survey of Basic Skills; and (7) Stanford Achievement Test. Because of this diversity, it is not appropriate to compare one district with another. With enrollment levels in the 55 districts at 98,319 in 1985, 102,756 in 1986, and 101,877 in 1987, Alaskan students scored consistently higher than the national average in almost every area for the three years studied.

        "description":"In this study 6,942 items from two standardized achievement test batteries--the Stanford (Early School Achievement Battery, Achievement Battery, and Test of Academic Skills) and the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills--were analyzed. Focus was on determining: (1) the extent to which these test batteries included general cognitive operations (GCOs) that are considered important for information processing; and (2) the relationship of the GCOs they contain to item difficulty. It was found that only nine of 22 GCOs were represented in the two tests--retrieval, reference, comparison and contrast, summarizing, inference, ordering, visual matching, transposing, and representing. When item difficulty was regressed on these nine GCOs, it was found that very little of the variance in item  difficulty could be accounted for. Three possible interpretations for this weak relationship between the nine GCOs and item difficulty are discussed. Two interpretations imply that GCOs are a valid construct and are important to domain specific tasks. The third interpretation implies that GCOs are an invalid construct since cognition cannot be separated from content. A list of 39 references is attached. Four tables present test results and intercorrelations. (Author/SLD)",

In preparation for the standard setting meeting, four areas of concern must be addressed: (1) background for certifying; (2) meeting site selection; (3) judge selection; and (4) preparation of materials for judges. At the meeting, three main areas must be considered: (1) examination background; (2) definition of an entry-level professional; and (3) setting the standard. Setting the standard requires a practice  exercise and review of the item rating process. A post-standard setting meeting is required to document the process and complete documentation.

In Program A, the first language (Spanish) is the initial medium for all instruction with a gradual phasing in of English. Program A is located in a large suburban school system in central Massachusetts, and provides full-time education to limited English proficient students. Proficiencies of 22 students were examined through interviews and written testing. The students were given the Metropolitan Survey Battery reading and mathematics tests and the Massachusetts Basic Skills Test for grade 6 as appropriate. Sixteen students were selected from Program B, with full-time instruction in both languages to make students comfortable and  competent in either Spanish or English. Program B is located in a large urban school system in Massachusetts. Similar tests were given, and scores from each program were analyzed using: (1) Model A, a norm-referenced design comparing the rate of growth for these students and others not requiring services; (2) mean standard scores during and after mainstreaming; (3) gap reduction, the &quot;catching up&quot; of program students; and (4) results after mainstreaming. By methods 1, 2, and 3, Program A was judged effective; for method 4, differences were not statistically significant. Because of the small number of students, none of the methods gave conclusive results for Program B. The study illustrates that each model answers different questions; each clarifies some aspect. Difficulties in evaluating  Program B show the need for alternative methods. Four tables and 17 graphs show test results. (SLD)",

A case study of a Puerto Rican child of an alcoholic family is presented. Although the high rate of abusive drinking that has been reported for Hispanics prompts concern for the effects on Hispanic children, it is likely that some types of Hispanic families are more likely to suffer from alcohol problems than are others. Even among alcoholic Hispanic families, particular interaction and ritual patterns  may serve to at least partially protect children from a long list of psycho-social problems disproportionately associated with being the child of an alcoholic. This is an area in need of research and research-based, culturally appropriate intervention and prevention. A list of 30 references is included. (BJV)",

        "description":"Although there is a strong experiential sense among people in the substance abuse prevention field that Hispanic adolescents may be particularly at-risk for the abuse of licit and illicit drugs, this concern has produced only limited research or culturally sensitive, ethnically targeted prevention efforts. The following factors hinder the development of an appropriate approach to substance abuse prevention among Hispanic adolescents: (1) unavailability of much research data on the mind altering substance use patterns of this population; (2) lack of culturally appropriate models for Hispanic adolescents; and (3) tendency to lump all Spanish speaking people as Hispanic, regardless of country of origin. The Hispanic Health Council's Alcohol Unit surveyed the drinking patterns of 210  Hartford, Connecticut, Hispanic adolescents and their mothers. They found that while alcohol is a problem for some of Hartford's Puerto Rican students under the age of 18, the number is small, especially in comparison with other non-Hispanic adolescent populations. The Peer Prevention Project, designed to ensure that alcohol consumption among Hispanics remained low, provided after-school training courses for students in a junior high school located in an economically depressed, predominantly ethnic minority neighborhood. Pre- and post-tests indicate that the Project had a beneficial influence on the participants: there was a notable increase in reported frequency of the use of tobacco, and liquor for the control group, but no change for the Peer Leadership group.

The final course design integrated Piagetian theory, Karplus' Learning Cycle, Whimbey's Problem Solving technique, and some of Feuerstein's Instrumental Enrichment strategies. Results indicated that the model is  highly adaptable to Hispanic populations in and outside of Puerto Rico. It also proved to be effective with a population of disadvantaged learners that is typical of those entering most private institutions.

        "description":"This study examined low birth weight and infant mortality in the 50 states and the 54 largest American cities between 1979 and 1984. Its findings confirm that progress in reducing low birth weight and infant mortality has slowed, and in some cases the progress has actually reversed. Some states and many cities had higher rates of low birth weight and infant mortality in 1984 than in 1979. The disparity in low birth weight and infant mortality rates between nonwhites and whites is great, and from 1979 to 1984 this gap increased in most of the largest cities and in many of the states. While race can be used as an indicator of low birth weight and infant mortality, the causes are more likely the result of socioeconomic factors. Although many factors contribute to problems of low  birth weight and infant death, poverty is the common element in all cases. The lack of money to purchase food, to receive proper medical care, to stay in school, and to afford adequate housing can act alone or together to harm the growth of the fetus in the womb and the growth and development of the infant during its first year. Further progress toward solving the problems of low birth weight and infant mortality must come from efforts to alleviate poverty and its harmful influence on infant health. Statistical data in tables and graphs are presented for each city and each state studied. Comparative analyses and trend analyses are presented in 43 tables and 4 maps. The appendices include a directory of sources for state vital statistics, and a list of 25 references. (FMW)",

Students served by the program to date are predominantly black (74 percent), female (68 percent), and tenth-graders (55 percent). Sixty-one percent of graduating seniors for whom follow-up was possible are attending college. Students overwhelmingly (98 percent) felt they received much individualized attention and would recommend the program to a friend. Nearly all (99 percent) gave the staff a high or above average rating. The project is now being funded by the Fund for Improvement of Postsecondary Education and the Virginia Department of Education. Three case studies written by counselors, a pamphlet soliciting contributions for the project, and  numerous samples of evaluations are included. (FMW)",

        "description":"Reducing absences is the most readily available strategy that high schools have for reducing the number of dropouts. A sample of approximately 2,000 students who entered three Oregon urban high schools in the Fall of 1983 or 1984 was studied in order to establish criteria for identifying students who were at-risk of not graduating. The group was divided into &quot;at-risk&quot; and &quot;not at-risk&quot; groups on the basis of freshman year Grade Point Average (GPA), and number of days absent. &quot;At-risk&quot; students were identified as those having a GPA below 1.6, and 15 or more days absent. Both groups completed questionnaires concerning their attitudes, expectations, and social and family interactions as freshmen, when they were freshman and again in December 1986. Findings from analysis of the  survey, GPA, and absenteeism information include the following: (1) responses to the survey questionnaire indicated more similarities than differences between the &quot;at-risk&quot; and &quot;not at-risk&quot;; (2) two-thirds of the eventual dropouts were identified by 10 days or more of absence in their freshman year; and (3) a slight improvement in accuracy of prediction could be obtained by using the average number of class absences, using a cut-off value of an average of four or more class periods absent. Twelve tables of statistical data and a one-page list of references are included. A copy of the student questionnaire, and a list of programs for at-risk students are included in the appendices.

More than 400 interviews were conducted with teachers, school administrators, central office personnel, district officials, board members, and union officials. The observations, interviews, and analyses confirm that, in most of these schools, the working conditions of teachers are bleak and would not be tolerated in other professions. Among the findings are the following: (1) physical conditions are sub-standard because of a lack of maintenance, repair, and space; (2) safety is not a serious problem to teachers, except in very depressed neighborhoods; (3) teachers do not have even the basic resources needed, let alone  access to new technologies; (4) teachers consider hiring more personnel to address the personal problems of students a higher priority than hiring more teachers to reduce class size; (5) teachers generally understand the cultural gulf between them and their students but are unable to deal with what they consider aberrant student behavior; (6) teachers perceive that they are losing control over what they teach, primarily because of district-wide testing policies although they are in control of how they teach; and (7) teachers have little confidence in supervision, staff development, or central office leadership. Characteristics of good working conditions are identified. Tables illustrate the data. Appendices compare these findings with those of other studies, provide a list of about 100  references, describe the methodology, and compare school effects. (BJV)",

Over 30 percent of America's three million homeless people are members of families, and families are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population. Perhaps more disturbing, homelessness represents only the most extreme manifestation of a more generalized, and growing poverty among families. For each homeless family, many more families are living at the edge of homelessness. Yet while both homelessness and poverty among families continue to increase, programs designed to assist those families have been cut back. The Federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program is now grossly deficient in providing even basic survival resources for poor families. This report surveys the  situation of the homeless in 25 cities. It makes the following findings: (1) between 1970 and 1987, the average value of AFDC benefits fell by 35 percent, to only 44.2 percent of the federal poverty level; (2) in 41 states, the combined value of AFDC and Food Stamps is less than 75 percent of the poverty level; (3) since 1981, federal housing programs for the poor have been cut by 76 percent; (4) in all but seven states, the shelter portion of the AFDC is less than 50 percent of the federally defined &quot;fair market rent&quot;; and (5) nearly two-thirds of AFDC families spend 50 percent or more of their income on housing.

        "description":"Evaluation of the Attendance Improvement Dropout Prevention (A.I.D.P.) program as it operated in 26 selected New York (New York) public high schools in 1986-87 raises serious questions about the effectiveness of the program. A minimum of 50 percent of the participants were to achieve the following objectives: (1) improve attendance; (2) pass at least one more subject than in 1985-86; (3) earn sufficient credits to advance to the next grade; and (4) if in the ninth grade or below in the baseline years of 1985-86, still be in school three years later. Data were analyzed from student rosters, interviews with staff, a student questionnaire, and classroom observations. Findings show that A.I.D.P. participants as a whole did not meet any of the objectives. However, most students  receiving services for the full time of the program did meet some of the objectives, and students who received all available services for the full time (core students) in particular made gains in attendance and courses passed. Statistical data are displayed in five figures and eight tables. Appendices include the following: (1) descriptions of schools; (2) summary of logs maintained during March 16-20, 1986; (3) data collection and file preparation procedures; (4) school-by-school summary of students served; (5) school-by-school summary of attendance and achievement improvement; (6) mean attendance for core and transitional students.

Data were culled from interviews with about 160 informants using a &quot;story&quot; approach as a data collection device. Thirty-three stories about successful, moderately successful, and unsuccessful adults in each of the four ethnic communities were constructed, but because of time limitations, only the stories in the moderate category were used. Adolescents in each of the groups were asked to critique a story and edit it to fit their own lives; the edited stories were then discussed, and the discussion and modified story supplied the study  data. Separate findings are presented for each of the four groups. In general, across all four groups, adolescents and youth held educational aspirations higher than their parents had achieved. They saw ethnic prejudice as a barrier to their employment success, but one that could be overcome. Only the Hmong have a refugee culture that might support long-term rather than episodic use of public welfare. Their risk of welfare dependency seems highest. The upcoming group of Hmong seems likely to bifurcate into two social groups: one middle class and the other incapable of achieving full self-sufficiency. These and other findings must be understood from the perspectives of adolescent and youth development. The non-Vietnamese Southeast Asian high school students seem to hold goals similar to  local Native American and some Black and Hispanic adolescents, while the Vietnamese students hold higher educational aspirations. Appendices present research notes, the 33 stories, and a sample of the interview worksheet. (BJV)",

The project provided a combination of literacy skills, direct work experience, and formal training to prepare young adults to enter the field of automotive repairs. It also developed a model of training which could be used as a guide in establishing similar job training programs. The 10-month program was divided into 3 phases: 4 weeks of core modular classroom training, 34 weeks of on-the-job training and classroom instruction, and 3 weeks of intensive classroom review. Youth who desired to participate were required to make application in person, fill out application forms, and schedule an interview. The  project itself was developed, field tested, and then conducted at the Faculty of Education, University of Manitoba, with participating automotive establishments in Winnipeg. Of the 39 trainees (30 original and 9 replacement trainees), 22 trainees completed the program. Most participants not only became employed but also demonstrated growth in such areas as reading ability.

As of 1981, there were between 250,000 and 280,000 disabled persons in New Zealand. The Accident Compensation Act of 1972 provides compensation for up to 80 percent of previous earnings, medical and dental treatment costs, and rehabilitation and training assistance. However, many persons seeking compensation under the act are faced with delays and, at times, failures in the litigation process. New Zealand has a reputation for its advanced attitude toward social welfare and for a variety of rehabilitation services (considering its size). Although advocates for those in need of rehabilitation services have captured the government's attention, the high costs of providing additional  services remains a significant barrier. A lack of coordination among existing government services is another problem. Neither does New Zealand have a full training course for rehabilitation professionals. One attractive feature of New Zealand's delivery system for rehabilitation services is its Disability Resource Centre.

Few states had the same reason for selecting the job  area/occupation analyzed. Reasons cited included needs assessments; economic outlook; societal problems and needs; input from business/labor, state staff, educators, enrollees; and business/labor analyses.

        "description":"A study of the reasons cited by 508 high school students for deciding to work part-time indicated that working to acquire additional spending money is only one of many reasons why high school students elect to work. Reasons for working were found to be significantly associated with a variety of situational and social factors. Academic program and grade were significantly related to working in order to save for future education versus gaining workplace skills and experience. Saving for future education was often a major factor in the decision to work. Boys placed more importance on working because their parents wanted them to, whereas girls emphasized working for the purpose of learning skills, gaining experience, and saving for future education. Teacher approval was significantly  associated with gaining skills and experience, and peers were found to be supportive of youths working to help support their families, learn skills, and save for future education. This study thus found little evidence in support of recent suggestions in the literature that high school students who are employed part-time believe that there is little to be learned from their jobs and that their main reason for working is to gain spending money.

        "description":"The concept of andragogy is posited on four key assumptions about adult learners that distinguish them from child learners and that thus abrogate the premises upon which traditional pedagogy is based. In traditional pedagogy, the role of the learner is one of dependency. Andragogy, on the other hand, recognizes the deep psychological need of adults to be self-directing, and the andragogical model encourages teachers to nurture and encourages learners' natural maturation toward independence. The second postulate on which andragogy is based is that of the valued role of the learner's experience. This accumulated experience makes adult learners capable of peer helping and learning and thus makes group teaching methods better suited for adult learners than are passive information  transmittal techniques. The third assumption is that of adults' readiness to learn, and the fourth is that of their psychological orientation to learning. In view of these assumptions, adult educators should use techniques to accelerate their students' readiness to learn, including self-appraisal, career counseling, and simulation.

The labor and skill shortages that were endemic in New Zealand in the past provided even unskilled early school leavers with easy access to employment. Thus, dropout rates were traditionally high and participation rates in continuing education were low. As the country's employment picture changes, however, there is growing awareness of the need for initiatives in  vocational education and training, both within the formal education system and at the point of transition from school to work. The country's new ACCESS program is a response to the transition problem. ACCESS is a new system of community-based transition education and training to provide for job seekers who do not choose the traditional options of apprenticeship, further study, or direct entry into the work force.

Computer-based (electronic) monitoring systems automatically record statistics about the work of employees using computer or telecommunications equipment in their jobs. Service observation refers to the practice of listening in on an employee's conversation with a customer. Automatic service observation refers to computer tracking of calls' durations and destinations. Telephone accounting refers to automatic, computer-generated records of the times, durations, and destinations of telephone calls. The use of these technologies is surrounded by controversy. Some praise  this new technology as a way of helping employers manage resources, plan workloads, reduce costs, and provide employees with timely feedback. Others fear the potential civil liberties and privacy abuses of these new technologies. Another important concern is that there are, at present, no requirements in United States law that monitoring be fair or that employees be consulted about work standards.

        "description":"The General Accounting Office (GAO) surveyed current Senior Executive Service (SES) (highly placed government civil service) employees to obtain their views regarding their federal employment, including career plans, characteristics, and opinions. The results of the survey were obtained from 348 usable responses from a sample of 430 SES members selected randomly from 6,180 total career SES members. The survey showed that responding SES members were quite satisfied with some aspects of their jobs, such as personal fulfillment; the match between their jobs and their aptitudes, interests, and expectations; and the people with whom they worked. At the same time, however, the respondents expressed a high degree of dissatisfaction with the public's negative opinions of federal workers  and various compensation-related issues. The survey showed that many respondents are interested in leaving SES. About 24 percent had sought, or planned to seek within the coming year, full-time employment outside the federal government. Half said they would accept an outside position if one were offered. About half of the respondents will be eligible for retirement in the next five years, and most intend to retire at that time or earlier if given the option. (The survey instrument is appended.)

        "description":"The General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a review to determine whether the Army effectively managed training programs conducted by outside contractors. During the review, the GAO evaluated six of the courses most commonly taught by outside contractors, examined procedures, interviewed Army officials, and visited the schools at six installations. The GAO found that the Army has not established effective internal controls to ensure that troop school funds are spent prudently and that contractors provide training that is consistent with Army standards and doctrine. Some of the specific findings were as follows: (1) programs were justified on the basis of past usage rather than need; (2) an excessive number of soldiers might have been trained; (3) some contracted courses were  not authorized by Army regulation or duplicated courses taught elsewhere in the Army; (4) some courses were inconsistent with Army training standards and contained outdated doctrine; (5) the Army lacked criteria to determine cross-training requirements; and (6) course monitoring and evaluation efforts were minimal. The GAO recommended that the Army develop guidelines that commanders should consider in conducting needs assessments, develop standardized criteria for using and evaluating the schools, and develop and implement internal controls over the programs.

        "description":"During the next 25 years, the number of Americans over age 65 is expected to reach 50 million. Although many will not experience age-related visual impairments until the age of 60 or 70, some will begin to experience serious problems by the age of 40. The types of vision problems experienced by individuals as they age include difficulty in adapting to sudden changes in lighting, reduced color and depth perception, increased difficulties in dealing with barrages of visual information, and sight-threatening diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. As older workers continue to constitute an increasing portion of the labor force, the implications of age-related visual impairments become an increasingly important issue for employers. Many responses to this problem are  possible. Improved eye care and screening techniques can help catch problems before they interfere seriously with work. Simple and inexpensive redesign of the workplace can help compensate for diminished eyesight. Retraining and closer matching of visual skills to work requirements can keep workers on the job longer. In addition, several private and government groups currently provide advice and resources for workers with vision impairment and for their employers. (MN)",

The first chapter presents descriptive data on postsecondary enrollments of students engaged in vocational and academic studies, particularly in two-year and other nonbaccalaureate institutions. For different groups of students, the chapter describes rates of entry, amounts of course work taken, and rates of completion of certificate or degree programs. The results reported are based on the transcripts of nationally representative samples of persons who graduated from high  school in 1972 and 1980. Comparison of the classes of 1972 and 1980 allows the determination of trends in enrollment and rates of completion among different groups of students, and the use of transcripts provides an accurate description of the mix and concentration of course work taken by students. The second chapter reports how states allocate grant funds from Title II of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act to secondary and postsecondary education, the spending of federal funds for disadvantaged and handicapped students, state funding of vocational education, and state standard-setting for vocational education.

        "description":"A study examined postsecondary occupational education delivery from two standpoints: (1) the workings of and main participants in instructional decision-making processes and (2) student motivation in selecting occupational programs and institutions. Site visits were conducted at 48 institutions, and another 384 institutions participated through a mail survey. Over 6,000 administrators, placement officials, departmental chairpersons, faculty, and students responded. It was found that competency-based education has improved occupational instruction in several important ways, including increased emphasis on job placement after graduation and better accommodation of special needs students. Although employers were involved in many aspects of curriculum and instruction, their degree of  involvement was not as great as vocational-technical educators would like to see. Data from all three types of institutions studied indicated a need for more-formalized and better-structured professional development activities.

A total of 287 St. Louis city service managers and supervisors were asked to assess their need for training in areas related to 12 job dimensions. The average study respondent was a white male (47 years of age) who supervised 13 employees and who was at the first level of supervision. The following supervisory dimensions were cited as the areas in which the need for training was greatest: discipline, motivation, human relations, performance management, and planning. A considerable similarity in self-reported training needs was found to exist among all of the sample subgroups when the data were analyzed by race, age, sex, level of supervision, and number of employees supervised.  Older, nonwhite, and female supervisors expressed the greatest need for management development training. Older supervisors reported a greater need for training in problem solving skills and first-level supervisors expressed the greatest need for training their own subordinates. (MN)",

        "description":"Throughout history, American women have had less access to education than their male counterparts. Because of discrimination based on traditional ideas of inferiority and subjection, female adult literacy rates did not even approximate male rates until well into the 19th century. The first important steps to improve the status of women were taken in the 19th century, although ethnicity and wealth had an important impact on access to education and quality of literacy. The suffrage movement was particularly instrumental in focusing attention on the need for greater literacy education for women. It was not until the 20th century that the need to educate women for careers and professions was recognized. More recently, feminist literature has reflected the need for education of women  that empowers or enables them to take charge of their own lives. Kathleen Rockhill views literacy as a way to gain power from men. Phyllis Safman cites social acculturation and sex role stereotyping, personal problems promoting a failure to complete high school, and institutional barriers to women in adult basic education programs as three main factors contributing to illiteracy among women today.

        "description":"Between 1981 and 1986, the U.S. manufacturing sector lost 1.2 million jobs. There is little regional variation in rates of plant closure, nor is there any correlation between cross-regional rates of industry growth and regional rates of plant closures. However, regional variation in rates of employment gains due to start-ups can be large and is highly correlated with cross-regional differences in industry growth rates. Regions with slow growth clearly have low start-up rates and limited expansions. They do not, however, have particularly high rates of plant closings. Neither does regional economic growth seem to significantly alter the likelihood of future plant closings in a region. These data argue against industrial policy as a means of slowing the pace of worker dislocation  and against concession in wages, utility bills, and taxes as a strategy for retaining local jobs. Several policy options seem viable for both national policymakers and local economic development officials, including increased federal support for takeovers of closing branch plants and subsidiaries and financial and adjustment assistance for displaced workers.

        "description":"Many dramatic changes in the U.S. labor force are projected to occur around the turn of the century. For the first time, the United States will have an age cohort in the work force with equal representation by sex, that is, 50-50 for men and women aged 16 to 24 in the labor force. It is projected that in the year 2000 there will be 2.6 million fewer 16- to 24-year-olds in the work force than in 1980. Thirty percent of all new workers will be minority group members (a 50 percent increase over 1980). If non-Hispanic white women are added to this group, the figure becomes 65 percent, thus leaving white males to account for only 35 percent of the work force. The trend toward early retirement is expected to continue. It is thus expected that in the year 2000 four out of every five  American workers will be in their middle adult years (between 25 and 59). Women will account for about three out of every five workers, with the greatest increases in labor force participation being among women in the category \"married with husband present.\" Minorities will account for two of every five workers. Another important factor is the general aging of the population. In contrast to the past, large numbers of young persons will not be available to fill all of the jobs vacated by older, more skilled workers. (MN)",

The total number of jobs in these three states exceeds the total employment in 30 other states put together. These economic changes have had a very direct effect on the geographic distribution of the country's population, which is reflected in the large migrations to these states that have occurred. According to projections, this migration should continue through the year 2000 so that these states will continue to experience population increases at the expense of those states that thrived under a manufacturing-based economy. It is important to remember, however, that the country's population distribution has the potential to change dramatically again as America  continues to move from a goods-producing to a service-producing economy. The intensive marketing campaigns that are currently being waged by many cities, states, and regions to attract new service-oriented business has the potential to alter future migration patterns dramatically. Another important factor in the population picture is the changing political power structure as areas gain or lose population, thus gaining or losing electoral votes. (MN)",

Women in their fifties, on the other hand, have increased their labor force participation rate. By the age of 60, however, their labor force participation rates also decline sharply. Although this decline in labor force participation rates is expected to continue, the large increase in the number of persons who will be in their fifties in the year 2000 will counterbalance their declining labor force participation rates, thus appearing to slow (but not actually slowing) the trend toward declining participation with age. Part-time and self-employment will likely continue to increase among older workers. Here too, however,  participation rates fall off sharply for persons aged 65 and older. The distribution of older Americans by geographic area is likely to be another important factor in the labor market picture in the year 2000. Success in bringing the older person into the work force will depend on strong, responsive, imaginative programs of assessment and testing and counseling and training, reinforced by strong job development programs focusing on job design related to kinds of work, hours and days of work, and so on.

Nearly all of the 15 million jobs that have been created since the November trough of the 1982 recession have been in the service sector. About half of these jobs pay at least $10 per hour, and those paying minimum wage or less have declined by about 25 percent. The biggest increases granted under collective bargaining for 1987 as a whole and the first quarter of 1988 occurred in the services industry. Employment in the goods-producing sector rose during 26 of the past 40 years and fell during 14. In the service sector, however, employment rose during 39 of the past 40 years. Ninety-seven percent of the increase in employment between 1947 and 1987 took  place in the service sector, and projections call for this trend to continue at least into the beginning of the next century. In the years between 1982 and 1987, the increase in employment in trade-related occupations has amounted to 20 percent. In finance, insurance, and real estate the increase has amounted to 23 percent. It should be noted that this increase in service sector employment levels coincided with the decline of the U.S. manufacturing sector, a period of peacetime prosperity, and significant increases in female labor force participation.

It opens with a review of the consequences of teenage pregnancy and the Redirection approach for addressing the problems. The monograph then discusses the sites' operational experiences. It next reviews the methodology and findings of an impact study that compared, over a 5-year period, teen participants in Redirection with a group of teens similar in all respects except that they had not received the Redirection services. These results are reported: at the 1-year point, participation in Redirection resulted in improvements in education, employment, and  childbearing; by the 2-year point, many of the favorable results had disappeared; at the 5-year point, participants had better outcomes in terms of employment and welfare dependency; and at that point, participants appeared to be more competent parents, and their children were at a developmental advantage compared to those of women in the comparison group. The monograph concludes with a summary of lessons for policymakers, program planners, and funding agencies to improve the effectiveness of programs for low-income, school-aged mothers. (YLB)",

The hearing was conducted to discuss H.R. 691, the Employee Drug Testing Protection Act, which would prohibit drug testing in the workplace except in specific incidents. During the hearing, testimony was given by two doctors, a United States Representative, a representative of the General Accounting Office, and a victim of a false-positive drug test who was unjustly fired. Testimony centered on the various tests available and the costs of each type, the accuracy of various types, and the use of the tests by employers and potential employers. Testimony in favor of drug testing focused on  the increasing use of drugs and the potential benefit to society of eliminating drug abusers from the workplace, especially when they work in safety-related occupations. Testimony against drug testing (and in favor of the bill) stressed the possible injustices of false-positive tests, individual rights, costs, and possible abuses of any regulations put on employers.

There has been much debate surrounding the relative importance of instruction, research, and community service in the overall mission of adult and continuing education in universities. It appears clear that university adult education still has a significant contribution to make. Universities need the kind of experiences and approaches in the university adult education tradition to manage their new circumstances. Industrial partnerships, community and commercial consultations, and continuing education of professionals can and do enhance the life and work of universities. Universities need older students for two reasons:  for their motivation to learn and for the financial gains continuing education programs bring universities. Besides being able to respond to changing community needs by providing a variety of course lengths and formats, continuing education can offer and revive a recurrent education market. Perhaps one job of universities from the standpoint of their continuing education programs is to help breathe new life into social movements as vehicles for learning that can, in turn, define and codefine what Great Britain in the nineties needs of its universities.

        "description":"The literature on retention of adult learners strongly suggests that previous educational attainment is closely tied to participation and persistence. Educationally disadvantaged adults are more likely to lack self-confidence and self-esteem, have negative attitudes toward education, and need mastery of basic skills such as literacy before attaining job skills that could improve their economic circumstances. Adult educators seeking to improve retention rates of economically disadvantaged individuals in their classrooms should not attempt to seek 100 percent retention. Rather, they should identify which types of retention are harmful to the vitality of their program and to student objectives. They should begin their retention efforts with recruitment, target recruiting to those  whom the program is best equipped to serve, emphasize placement and counseling early on, and follow up inactive students with phone calls. Special attention should be given to developing and using strategies to deal with students' low self-confidence, perception of social disapproval, situational barriers, negative attitudes, and low personal priority. Besides lists of specific strategies for these purposes, the literature also contains descriptions of adult basic education programs that have succeeded in retaining high numbers of educationally disadvantaged learners.

        "description":"Between 1969 and 1984, the number of adults participating in educational programs increased 79 percent and the number of adult education activities doubled. The following facts should be considered when developing instructional programs for adult learners: individuals can learn throughout their lives, adult life cycles influence learning, adults learn what they consider important, adults are often time-conscious learners, what is important varies among adults, adults generally (but not always) wish to be treated as such, and biological changes may affect learning. Creating a learning environment that meets the needs of adult learners is a key element of successful adult education programs. Some strategies for accomplishing this are as follows: establish adult-to-adult rapport,  create a participatory environment, facilitate adult independence, and provide for individual differences. Although many adult learning activities do not require formal evaluation procedures, adult learners need to learn how to identify and evaluate their own resources, abilities, and knowledge realistically. When formal evaluation is required, adult students are best evaluated by using a collaborative approach. Recommended collaborative approaches include group decision making, learning contracts, and grading contracts. (MN)",

Various factors, including rapid technological advancement and increased foreign competition, have changed this. Today's workers generally have less job security than their predecessors. Furthermore, different employers have begun requiring different attitudes and behaviors from their employees. These changes have in turn made it necessary for vocational and career educators to revise their approach to preparing students to enter and function in the world of work. This revised approach, which has come to be known as vocational ethics, is intended to (1) provide students with a framework  for recognizing and resolving internal and external ethical conflicts and (2) give students the opportunity to develop an enabling work ethic. Vocational ethics instruction is centered around two main topics: ethical reasoning skills and mediation skills (assertiveness, emphatic listening, principled negotiation, and risk taking). (MN)",

The few studies that have compared groups of survivors from other causes, however, have often not observed as many differences as expected based on the suicide survivors literature. In this study, 230 college students who had survived the suicide (N=61), accidental (N=92), or natural deaths (N=77) of a family member or close friend were asked to complete a set of questionnaires. Reactions of the survivors to the death were measured by a number of questions, the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief, the Impact of Event Scale, and the Revised University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale. Attitudes toward suicide survivors were  assessed by the Aftermath of Suicide instrument. In general, many more similarities than differences were noted for the survivors of the various causes. No significant differences between the groups were observed for guilt, shame, isolation from others, or loneliness; thinking about suicide; time to resume normal functioning; or the impact of the event currently or immediately after the death. Compared to other survivors, however, suicide survivors reported significantly more stigmatizing events and blamed more people for the death. Survivors of sudden deaths, both suicidal and accidental, exhibited greater stigma and more of a desire to understand why after the death than did natural death survivors. (Author)",

It is very likely, however, that residing on a farm has different consequences than residing in a village. The elderly in the country may be particularly disadvantaged when they are compared to their town counterparts because of their relative isolation from services and health facilities. This study examined the farm/country and village/town microecologies in terms of their characteristics and divergent impacts on the aged in Allegany County, New York, a rural area of approximately 50,000 citizens of which 6,000 are elderly. Interviews were conducted with a proportionate stratified sample of older residents  (N=456) of Allegany County. A frequency analysis revealed that the majority of respondents resided within a village or town (67%) with the remainder living on a farm or in a nondeveloped area (33%). Pearson's r's revealed many significant demographic differences between the two groups. The farm/country aged were more mobile, less depressed, more likely to be married, less educated, and younger than their town/village counterparts. In terms of knowledge and use of social services, the country aged reported less use of public services, but received greater satisfaction from them. Findings have implications for public policy issues and the delivery of social services and programs to the rural elderly. (Author/NB)",

Although the specificity and sensitivity of assessment instruments are poor, trainees are instructed to become proficient in their application. The occurrence of suicides during training confronts trainees with personal and professional limitations. The charts of patients who committed suicide while on the rolls of a large university-affiliated private psychiatric hospital, or within one month of discharge, were reviewed for relevant clinical characteristics and to assess the parameters related to training. Suicided patients were matched by age, sex, and unit of the hospital with a control selected from those admitted one or more months before the index patient. Over an 8.5 year period, 20 men  and 15 women committed suicide, the mean age was 32.7 years and the vast majority were white, single, and of low socioeconomic status. There were no significant differences between suicides and controls on race, religion, marital status, or socioeconomic status; number of prior hospitalizations; prior discharges; or length of stay for index hospitalization. There were significant differences in suicidal tendency ratings, presence and number of suicide attempts, history of suicidal ideation and treatment with antidepressant medications, and recent feelings of hopelessness. There were trends for suicided patients to have an Axis I diagnosis of Affective Disorder only and to have had more than one therapist during their index treatment episode. (Author/NB)",

Predisposition to suicide can be classified into three categories: biophysical, situational, and syndromatic. Adolescents suffering biophysical disorders are most easily identified by their deviant and dysfunctional behavior. The category most associated with social conditions is situational. The syndromatic category is associated with real or perceived change in status and may be exacerbated by the school. While a number of verbalizing, behavioral, and performance behaviors exist that typically signal an at-risk child, there is no identifiable sequence and the signs can appear together, over varying time periods, or  without warning. The most easily recognized symptom is preoccupation with death and a declaration of hopelessness. Behavioral signs are more difficult to recognize as adolescents quite normally experience mood swings. When it is suspected that a child is suicidal, intent and lethality must be assessed. The individual should be confronted in a direct, non-threatening manner. Time is critical and confidentiality cannot be considered. Schools and teachers need to help youth gain personal confidence and look to the future with an optimistic attitude. (NB)",

        "description":"Academic learning is a complex activity which is not easily modified. Several models have been used to deliver learning improvement programs, including the study skills course and the discrete skills approach. These approaches make few if any accommodations for variations in individual differences or needs. Four factors, however, indicate that individual factors may be responsible for the differential effects of skill-based programs: (1) students appear more likely to learn well when they have a personal conception of learning; (2) personal causation appears important to effective learning; (3) students who set goals appear to have a better chance to succeed and a better basis upon which to choose a course of action; and (4) understanding is developmental in several ways. These  variables illustrate the idiosyncratic influences which may affect learning improvement program outcomes. While most students will probably respond positively to well-designed group-oriented learning improvement programs, some students will require a careful clinical approach oriented to addressing unique personal needs. This paper describes a clinical approach to making decisions on learning improvement programming which provides a structured, decision-oriented model to address idiosyncratic developmental needs. The clinical approach is described, assumptions for decision-making for learning improvement programming are discussed, and clinical decision points are presented. The areas of assessment, goals, objectives, strategies, and evaluation are included. (NB)",

Questionnaires focusing on beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors related to alcohol and drugs were completed by 2,782 students. Contrary to expectations,  significant interactions were found for all three target behaviors and regardless of the age of the students. These interactions primarily involved attitudes and normative beliefs about peer substance use. Interactions involving other normative beliefs generally were not significant. Contingent consistency effects may result from greater access to tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs on the part of adolescents who have friends involved in smoking, drinking, and other durg use. A reference list and six data tables supplement this document. (Author/NB)",

Dropout services provided by state programs are classified as focusing on academic improvement, attendance improvement, personal and social adjustment, and career preparation and job training. The remainder of the report summarizes key features of several state dropout programs currently being conducted in California, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, and Washington. Other state programs designed by Alaska, Minnesota, and New Jersey to meet the needs of high-risk youth and prevent them from dropping out are briefly reviewed.

The AIDS Opinion and Information Surveys were administered to subjects between the ages of 18 and 46+, with 81.5% being below the age of 32. The 19-item Opinion survey uses a five-point Likert-type response format to assess attitudes towards AIDS on four dimensions: (1) perceived personal vulnerability; (2) perceived severity of the AIDS epidemic; (3) desire for more information about AIDS; and (4) perceived effectiveness of prevention methods. The 23-item Information survey uses an extended true-false response format. Questions focus on transmission of the human immuno deficiency virus and prevention of  infection. Subjects showed very conflicting feelings towards AIDS. Even though subjects perceived AIDS as a severe problem they did not feel personally vulnerable. Misconceptions about modes of transmission, especially from casual contact, were high. These findings suggest specific strategies for AIDS education on college campuses. (Author)",

        "description":"For the year 1987, 24.4 % of American households were touched by crime. A household is considered touched by crime if during the year it was affected by a burglarly, auto theft, or household theft or if a household member was raped, robbed, or assaulted or was a victim of personal theft, no matter where the crime occurred. These offenses, which include attempted as well as completed crimes, were measured by the National Crime Survey. One in four American households was touched by a crime of violence or theft in 1987, the same proportion as in the previous 2 years. Except for personal theft, which was slightly lower in 1987 than in 1985, there was no measureable difference in 1987 from either of the previous 2 years in the percentages of households touched by any of the crimes  measured. Households in rural areas were touched by crime to a lesser degree in 1987 than in 1986 although crime rates did not change for urban and suburban areas. A higher percentage of black households than white households were touched by crime. Households with higher incomes were more susceptible to victimization than those with lower incomes, almost entirely because of their greater vulnerability to personal theft. Households in rural areas were least susceptible to criminal victimization, while those in urban areas were most susceptible. Households in the Northeast were the least vulnerable to crime, while households in the West were the most vulnerable. In general, the more people in a household, the greater its vulnerability to crime. Black households were more vulnerable to  crimes of high concern (rape, robbery, assault) than were white households, as were households in the West more vulnerable than those in the Northeast. Trends affecting crime statistics include the move from urban to suburban and rural areas and the decrease in size of American households. The report concludes with a discussion of methodology, describing how and why statistics were gathered. (Information on publications of the Bureau of Justice Statistics is provided.) (ABL)",

        "description":"In recent years a number of models of depression have been proposed. Many of them have incorporated cognitive constructs to explain vulnerability, initiation, maintenance, and recovery from depression. In light of the wealth of experimental and clinical knowledge about depression, these models can be seen as having a limited focus and scope. Current models of depression have little implication for discriminating depression from other emotional states or disorders and they do not incorporate a developmental perspective. Finally, although some of the most recent models have begun to borrow theoretical positions from the cognitive psychology memory literature, they have done so without consideration for the nuances of different theories in memory and their implications for dealing  with the phenomena of depression. Building on previous theoretical work, this research attempts to develop a model using constructs from the memory and developmental literatures that will be useful in describing depression and in differentiating depression from other affective states. The intent is to incorporate relevant constructs that will produce a dynamic model to account for the various processes of change in the course of depression. The plan is to incorporate developmental constructs to deal with the origins of vulnerability factors and with the occurrence of depression among children. (ABL)",

        "description":"The relationship between self-monitoring and boundary spanning was investigated in this study. In an attempt to isolate the behaviors used by self-monitors to facilitate performance in a boundary spanning role, a laboratory setting was used to videotape subjects assuming a contrived boundary spanning role. Subjects (N=234) were introductory psychology college students who were divided into high, middle, and low self-monitoring groups based on scores on the Snyder Self-Monitoring Scale. After viewing two videotaped exchanges between a model &quot;Campus Escort&quot; and &quot;visitor,&quot; subjects were shown short video sequences of a visitor expressing his interest and concerns. Following each sequence, subjects role played their response to the visitor as a Campus Escort (role play condition) or  selected the most appropriate responses (multiple choice condition). No differences were found regarding the appropriateness of the messages in either condition. High self-monitoring males used more response categories during their role plays than did any other group. High self-monitoring females were rated as more extraverted. An investigation of these results showed that for males, acting ability covaried with the number of response categories used during role plays, verbal fluency, and overall performance and with females' extraversion and friendliness ratings. These results suggest that the behaviors of the boundary spanners were not determined by their sensitivity to social cues but rather by their ability to assume a role and this role may be influenced by stereotypic gender  differences. The ability to assume a role may be more important to boundary spanning roles than sensitivity and behavioral pliability to social cues. (ABL)",

        "description":"Family systems theory's contribution to the world of psychotherapy was its move away from lineal causality toward a view of human relationships as not merely multi-determined, but unavoidably and inextricably inter-related and inter-dependent. Circular causation allows the therapist to assume enormous flexibility. The rise of family therapy in post World War II America is consistent with the &quot;Protean man&quot; described by Lifton and the alienated individual described by Mead. Family theorists incorporated into their theorizing, as do all theorists, the experiences of their own lives, which in this case included the discontinuity of World War II. This is the essence of circular causation, and a concept used by a variety of contemporary therapists influenced by family systems thinking.  To move to the structural level, the &quot;aesthetics&quot; versus &quot;pragmatics&quot; debate eventually faded. It was an expression of &quot;sociological ambivalence.&quot; Its effect was to crystallize but to mislabel the fundamental conflicts of family therapy; opportunism versus idealism, and conservatism versus radical social criticism. By mislabeling the issue, it helped to obscure it, and finally guaranteed that the &quot;mystery-mastery&quot; complex remain intact, that the forces influencing family dynamics remain obscure and impenetrable, while allowing and encouraging the development of sophisticated methods of behavioral control and mystification.

Eleven annotations of articles on societal attitudes toward suicide are included. After a summary of the literature review, these conclusions are stated: (1) the necessity of education regarding the myths of suicide was recognized; (2) program development for staff to provide information and  education was recommended; (3) teachers and school personnel are in the best position to perceive suicidal tendencies since they spend so much time with adolescents; (4) sociological factors played a major part in the the vulnerability of adolescents' feelings; (5) alcohol and drug abuse, as well as depression, were found to have a significant relationship to suicide; (6) the family should be included as part of the treatment program for suicide attempters; (7) television broadcasts did cause imitative suicides; (8) tests predicting suicidal behavior were found to provide significant enough correlations to warrant use of the tests; (9) school prevention, intervention and response plans were recommended; (10) follow-up counseling for suicide attempters and survivors is needed; and (11)  there appears to be a trend of more tolerance toward suicide.

        "description":"Statistics indicate that 100,000 to 500,000 children are sexually abused yearly. Changing child abuse laws, significant attention by the media, and sexual abuse prevention programs have contributed to the explosion of incest disclosures from children and adults, including college students. Studies support the prevalence of incest victims within the U.S. college student population. Incest is a nightmare that silently screams within many college students, both male and female. The symptoms include depression, low self-esteem, poor social skills, and substance abuse. When the incest remains a secret, it interferes with many of the developmental tasks faced by college students. Positive feelings about self, productive relationships with others, and healthy life skills are frequently  hindered by unresolved incestuous memories. College campuses and student affairs professionals need to develop services and programs for adult incest survivors. Awareness workshops for student development and faculty should strive to develop a sensitivity for the symptoms of sexual abuse and to develop an awareness of prevention and intervention programs needed to respond to college student survivors. Sex education and awareness programs for students, especially abuse survivors, designed to foster more responsible sexual decision making behavior, would be productive. (Two case examples are included.) (ABL)",

The description of the methodology of the study indicates that various surveys and instruments were used to collect data at the elementary and secondary level from administrators, head counselors, in-school counselors, career counselors, district counselors, project resource teachers, school nurses, guidance aides, students, and classroom teachers. Findings of the evaluation are presented as answers to 10 questions which cover topics including philosophies of the program, level of client satisfaction, and innovative programs to better guidance programs. Twenty-two conclusions are listed which range from noting the  well-defined organizational structure, to describing counselors' perceptions that physical facilities are inadequate. Fourteen recommendations are listed which are directed to the staff and one recommendation to the board. These recommendations include initiation of a task force to develop plans and program policy and recommendations based on results of the evaluation data. Thirteen appendices to the report are presented, including a policy analysis of the counseling and guidance project, and questionnaires and surveys.

        "description":"Research on employee turnover which has examined why employees quit their jobs has identified a wide range of variables that are associated with turnover, but has provided little information about the consequences of turnover for those who remain in an organization. This study was conducted to examine whether the manner in which turnover is perceived by stayers can affect their job attitudes and their job performance. Undergraduate students (N=104) participated in a proofreading task. During a break from the task, subjects were exposed to a confederate who quit the task either because of boredom, combined with the availability of greater rewards elsewhere (inequity condition), or because of illness (control condition). The subjects then completed a second proofreading task,  followed by a brief questionnaire. Data analysis revealed that the output of the inequity group on the second proofreading task was significantly lower than that of the control group. There were no differences between the groups in quality of performance. The inequity group also rated the task significantly more negatively than did the control group. Other questionnaire data suggest these findings can be explained in terms of inequity generated in the stayer by a comparison with the leaver's new job. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"During recent decades, there has been an influx of underprepared students in America's colleges and universities. At many institutions, programs have been created to assist these high risk students through special classes and/or support services. Through application of student development theory these programs can shed the negative connotations of remedial education and can provide new models for individualized counseling and instruction. This paper asserts that research in student development provides educators with a sound theoretical foundation for meeting the needs of high risk students and that student development theory provides a framework which should serve as a beginning point for designing services for high risk students. It presents theories of moral and ethical  development, learning and perceptual modalities, personality, developmental tasks, and student involvement and explores how these theories can provide critical insights into the needs of high risk students. It is concluded that knowledge and application of developmental theory will help educators of high risk students to define and articulate their mission and philosophy, and will help them justify and perfect programs which in the future may be viewed as models for teaching and advising all students.

Recent research, however, has shown that traditional male tasks were more likely to be shared than were traditional female tasks. This study investigated further the &quot;superwoman&quot; syndrome by looking at who is doing the work in the home, as well as the trend toward traditionalism. Also, the division of labor in the homes of married persons was compared to that of unmarried persons. Subjects (N=266) were asked to specify who in the household performed 24 specific chores. Unmarried subjects were asked to predict how they would expect the chores would be divided. Results from the married subjects showed that  traditional male tasks were more likely to be shared than were traditional female tasks. Data from the singles showed that males expected to share some of the traditional female tasks, whereas females expected the division of labor to fall along traditional lines. Previous predictions about the trend towards egalitarian divisions of labor were not confirmed. Instead, women seemed to be experiencing the &quot;superwoman syndrome,&quot; having it all by doing it all. (The survey instrument is appended.) (Author/ABL)",

The extent to which remarks made by significant others and failure experiences affect how subjects feel about their bodies was examined as was the frequency of social comparisions regarding weight, self-esteem, and perceptions of the extent to which their parents consider various factors important for success. Both bulimics and dieters reported a significantly greater tendency for weight-related remarks and failure experiences to influence the way they felt about their bodies than did control subjects. Bulimics  scored significantly higher than controls or dieters on self-esteem and the tendency to make social comparisons regarding weight; dieters scored significantly higher than controls on these measures. Compared to fathers of dieters or controls, fathers of bulimics placed significantly greater importance on good athletic performance, popularity among female peers, and thinness in viewing their daughters as successful.

Statistics were provided by the United Nations for homicide, rape, robbery, burglary, and theft; the International Police Organization (Interpol) for homicide, rape, robbery, burglary, and auto theft, and the World Health Organization (WHO) for homicide. Based on these statistics, the rate of violent crime in the United States was found to be several times higher than the rates in other countries for which information was available. The rate of property crime in the United Staes was also higher than in the majority of these countries. Crimes of violence (homicide, rape, and robbery) were 4-9 times more  frequent in the United States than they were in Europe; crimes of theft (burglary, theft, auto theft) were also more frequent, but not to the same degree. Between 1980 and 1984 the difference between crime rates for the United States and for other countries narrowed because the United States' rate decreased while other countries' rates increased. Crime rates from country to country were difficult to compare because of differences in criminal justice systems, in definitions of crime, in crime reporting practices and recordkeeping, and in methods of reporting statistics to international agencies. To reduce this variability, more than one data source was used whenever possible and European countries were averaged together, as were Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.

Discrepancies that exist between what educators believe about good developmental guidance programs and what is typical in secondary schools are discussed, and widely accepted concepts about administration of effective guidance programs are described. Seven operational objectives of guidance programs are listed, and the services (pupil-inventory, information, counseling, placement, follow-up needs assessment)  needed to reach these objectives are described. Components of designing an effective guidance program are presented, including revitalizing the guidance program, assessing pupil needs, agreeing on goals and priorities, program needs assessment, and implementing the program. The roles of the principal and middle school counselor are described. Models for middle school guidance programs, including the teacher-advisor approach are presented. The role of the classroom teacher in the guidance program is described. The teacher-advisor guidance program, which is intended to provide greater emphasis upon the guidance function of the school through a well-defined structure for group guidance activities which can be specifically defined, assigned, and evaluated, is discussed in some detail.

Studies within the Army have found that the three most turbulent periods for the soldier with HIV infection are: (1) at the time of notification of diagnosis; (2) when the family and peer group learn of the diagnosis; and (3) when there is concrete evidence of failing health. In response to the challenge of medical management of high risk patients, a multi-speciality ward program at Walter Reed Army Medical Center was designed to meet and to prevent anticipated suicidal behavior. The ward program seeks to: (1) create a therapeutic and facilitating environment for the HIV sero-positive soldier; (2) screen the HIV positive soldier for psychiatric  conditions and facilitate treatment; (3) provide information about the infectious nature of the illness; (4) initiate twice-a-week support groups; and (5) transfer the acutely suicidal, depressed, or impulsive patients to psychiatric units. Self-destructive behaviors are quickly identified and addressed. The biopsychosocial approach to the HIV patients addresses the multifaceted nature of the condition. By anticipating stressors at the three crucial phases, suicidal ideation and behavior can be quickly detected and psychiatric symptoms treated.

These items were analyzed individually and also combined into a composite measure of school climate. The study revealed that 4th, 8th, and 11th grade students in schools with a better school climate--as measured by the composite measure--tended to score higher on the NAEP Reading Assessment. School climate was more positive in elementary schools, private schools, and schools with lower proportions of students participating in the federal school lunch program.  For individual school problems, reading performance was lower for students attending schools where a particular problem was rated more seriously, but association between the severity of a given problem and reading performance disappeared when the background characteristics of students were taken into account. For the composite measure of school climate, based on eight of the school problems, reading performance was higher in schools with a better climate even after controlling for student characteristics. However, the data only show that reading performance and school climate were associated; they cannot demonstrate whether better climate caused higher reading scores. (SR)",

        "description":"This paper argues that literature-centered reading programs, based on the perspective that reading is the process of bringing meaning to print, are in the best interest of the language minority students in the nation's elementary schools. After a review of basal reading systems and language-centered reading programs, the paper describes the problems faced by language minority students and limited English proficient (LEP) students in traditional reading programs. Several case studies are presented in the development of second language literacy. The paper concludes with a model of a literature-centered reading program for language minority students which is built on the premises that reading and writing are processes acquired through use; that the ability to read and write  competently in two languages is of value; and that elementary school children of the same chronological age differ widely in their interests and abilities. The model advocated in the paper has three phases: (1) core book units, in which students are provided with a thorough experience with one book; (2) literature units, to allow students to learn about literary genres, themes, and selected authors; and (3) individualized reading and writing, in which students select the books to read and the genres and topics they wish to write about. The paper also discusses the Language Experience Approach and the use of predictable books, and stories, two special intervention programs for beginning readers, whether bilingual or monolingual.

This research also shows that the reading disabled (RDs) have a significantly different perception of auditory stimuli than normal readers and that dichotic listening reveals these differences. Normal readers can be differentiated from RDs by using binaural audiometry to measure ear advantage.

Through motivation, a learner is encouraged to achieve definite goals in reading. Attention and retention by the student are important in recognizing new words whether the approach is phonics instruction, syllabication, structural analysis, configuration clues, use of picture clues, or identification of words through contextual situations. Numerous reasons are given for students lacking motivation, from poor teaching methods to inadequate reading materials. Reading teachers must use a variety of stimulating methods in teaching students, and the subject matter must be of interest to students. Quality deductive methods  to motivate student behavior may emphasize a teacher modeling analysis, synthesis, and evaluation in reading. Problem solving methods should also be utilized to stimulate student reading. Balance among cognitive, affective, and psychomotor objectives should be emphasized. A quality reading curriculum needs much planning, with careful attention to vital objectives, relevant opportunities to read, and evaluation procedures. (RAE)",

The same edition of the Iowa Silent Reading Test (ISRT) was administered to sixth- and tenth-graders in 1944-45, 1976, and 1986. The 1944-45 sample consisted of 25% of the students throughout the state, and was neither random nor stratified. The 1976 and 1986 samples were stratified and randomly chosen to represent the entire population of sixth and tenth graders in the state. For all three testing periods additional information about the teaching of reading, the organization of schools, and the students and their communities were collected. In 1986 a newer and more recently normed test, the  Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT), was administered to a subsample of the ISRT test takers to provide a means to compare ISRT test takers to recent national norm performance. Results revealed that the 1986 sample far outscored their earlier counterparts on every subtest and on Total Median Score. Unadjusted percentile averages for the Indiana tenth graders showed an advantage for the 1944-1945 sample. An adjustment for a 17-month age difference in 1986, however, indicated little change in reading performance over the four decades. The results of this study are presented in the context of the educational and societal conditions of each time period.

These approaches have emphasized psychological factors, sociological factors, cultural and social forces, and economic factors. Evidence exists that all these forces play a role in determining what becomes news. To examine how these factors interrelate to affect content, a study presented a model that describes how economic and newsroom-related variables can affect newspaper content. Data, 620 local stories involving government, public school education, business, and law enforcement, were obtained for a 1-week time period from 21 large circulation and prestige newspapers. Thirty-nine variables were coded in the content analysis of each story, and several factors were  developed to assure consistent and accurate measurement. Results showed a connection between the economic environment, newsroom variables, and variation in the content of these local news stories. Findings suggest that (1) group ownership had a relatively strong effect on staff size and, therefore, an impact on content; (2) as intensity of competition increased, the staff size for a given amount of news copy increased; (3) a positive relationship exists between intercity competition and fairness; and (4) the influence of the average reporter story load on content, while in the direction expected, was much smaller than anticipated.

The test was given in four testing sessions, each on a different day: the first for introduction and prewriting; the second for writing a rough draft; the third for revising; and the fourth for  writing the final copy. Average scores for the analytic traits at each grade level indicated that student papers districtwide were such that observed strengths generally balanced observed weaknesses; i.e. that student writing skills were developing as reasonably expected at their respective grade levels.

        "description":"A study examined how teachers change as they implement a process writing approach. Four questions provided the framework for the study: (1) How do teachers' perceptions of themselves as writers influence their writing instruction? (2) How do teachers at different grade levels implement process writing instruction? (3) What institutional and contextual factors limit and/or encourage the implementation of a process writing instruction? and (4) How do teachers change in attitude, behavior, and teaching approaches as a result of using this innovation? Subjects, four elementary grade teachers in rural northeastern Ohio schools, were chosen from participants in a summer workshop on the process approach who had been nominated by their principals as outstanding writing teachers. Subjects  were observed in their classrooms, and they completed workshop documents, questionnaires, and reflective logs during the 8-week duration of the study. Results indicated that teachers' individual ways of approaching a writing task influence how they instruct students to approach such tasks, and those aspects of the process which are easier to implement receive the most attention. Results also indicated that teacher control over the process tends to be substantial, with teachers providing most of the ideas for writing assignments and that teachers implementing this innovation do so with a fair amount of administrative support but with little support from colleagues. (Five figures and three tables are included; and the questionnaire, interviewing instruments, transcripts, observation field  notes, sample reflective logs, and student work samples are appended.

Davies (1986) have suggested that English for Academic Purposes (EAP) tests for prospective higher education students should include a component designed to measure the ability to manipulate reader-writer relations in academic texts. This paper examines the nature and scope of such manipulation and draws some preliminary conclusions about how it might be tested, both in terms of simplifying assumptions which could be made in specific situations and selecting test formats which appear particularly suitable. The process of manipulation is described from two points of view in the paper, firstly as negotiation of reader-writer power relations and assertions of identity and secondly, taxonomically, as a description of some of the strategies and devices available to  the writer. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the results of version 1 of the University of York EAP test, part of which does try to measure the ability to control reader-writer relations.

Storytelling is effective in fostering a relaxed and intimate atmosphere in the classroom. Numerous activities can be employed to build children's storytelling skills. For a classroom teacher who wishes to use storytelling, it is best to begin with a simple story with action, a definite climax, and a conclusion the students will find satisfactory, and to remember that enjoyment is the first  and chief consideration. The second consideration in effective storytelling should be to encourage exploration and experimentation with language. (Twenty-two references are attached.) (SR)",

Because of this, English teachers must be prepared to deal with students who come to them about catastrophic events, ongoing trauma, or deep hurts and frustrations. During the initial encounter, it is important to keep the student talking, to accept all feelings and statements made by the student, and to avoid asking &quot;why.&quot; In a crisis situation, if a teacher decides to stay with the student instead of going immediately for professional help, it is important to find out about the student's immediate future plans by asking low-level, factual questions to elicit specific details. With the exception of abuse of any kind (physical, sexual, or psychological), a prior understanding of  confidentiality between the teacher and student must be honored. If a student alleges abuse, teachers have a duty to report (by state law) all such allegations. In addition, any overt mention of threat of suicide must be taken seriously and dealt with immediately. In these situations, it is important to make a contract, insisting that the student agree to call someone if at any time he or she feels suicidal. It is also important to realize that there are no guarantees, and that teachers can only do what they can. (MM)",

An understanding of how children's evaluative criteria develop is critical to teachers in helping children become better writers. Subjects, 27 fifth graders attending a largely rural middle school in the southeast, were divided into low and high achievers according to their reading scores, interviewed individually, asked to comment on their own writing and constructed texts, told to rank the stories, and then were asked a series of open-ended questions designed to elicit evaluative comments about each story. Preliminary data analysis revealed (1) that there is some  evidence that the low-achieving fifth graders exhibited responses similar to those observed in younger students and in novice student writers of all ages; (2) that low achieving students tended to use more personal associations and surface features as evaluative criteria than the high achievers; (3) that low achievers tended not to respond to the craft dimension in their rankings of texts whereas high achievers did distinguish between texts as a result of the craft manipulation; and (4) that low achieving students were especially more likely to apply &quot;objective&quot; text-based criteria to other's writing than to their own.

        "description":"Staggered by some recent libel verdicts, many journalists are neglecting lessons about press freedom learned at great cost during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Journalists then learned that state power over the press, residing in the hands of either censors or judges, leads to a decrease in press freedom. In 1986, though, many media lawyers and journalists hailed the Supreme Court's Anderson v. Liberty Lobby verdict, which created a situation in which 90% of libel cases may be thrown out of court by judges before they ever reach a jury. The lesson from history, for those who wish to increase press freedom, points to the folly of relying on temporarily friendly judges. Instead, it is necessary to study the high regard juries tended to have for the press, see how that  regard was earned, and then use that knowledge to improve current journalistic practice and current popular regard for journalistic freedom. Juries carry with them a risk of runaway populism, but that risk must be taken if judicial imperialism is to be avoided. (Fifty-two notes are included.) (Author/MS)",

Subjects included a successful ninth grade English teacher at a public high school in the San Francisco area and six students representing the range of ethnic diversity, gender ratio, and achievement level of the generally academically motivated, college-bound students attending the high school. During the 7-week period of observation, all classroom activities were recorded on video and audio tape and all student writing (drafts, outlines, peer group response, tests, teacher comments) concerning the three major  papers completed were collected. Subjects were also interviewed twice. The data were analyzed by performing a descriptive quantitative discourse analysis across cases and a descriptive case study of one student across time. Results indicated that students need to participate in conferences of different lengths, with different purposes, and with different tasks. Results also indicated that patterns of dominance in the conferences shift as the tasks vary and that writing conferences promote the development of the student as a writer. Findings suggest the potential of the secondary school classroom to support dialogic learning as a means of individualizing the process of learning to write.

        "description":"The ideas of John Dewey and his fellow progressives have resurfaced in a movement called \"writing across the curriculum.\" Interdisciplinary studies are now being seen as a way to break down the artificial boundaries between subject areas. Research has confirmed that language learning and experience are at the heart of education. The implications are that instruction should be based on the personal and linguistic growth of the child rather than on the mastery of facts or concepts in particular disciplines, and subject areas should be used to provide students with the new experiences they need to broaden their knowledge. Researchers and educators propose a teaching philosophy and approach based on the concept of \"learning by doing,\" which would mean much more talking, writing, and  reading in the classroom. A number of ways for teachers to promote more language activities to help students learn include (1) organizing course content around central ideas or themes to give language assignments direction, focus, and purpose; (2) using the writing process to give teachers a more active role in their students' learning; and (3) utilizing journals, reading notes, or learning logs to provide students with the opportunity to describe and explore their own experiences. Teachers can use these and other ideas to integrate new techniques and current information into their teaching methods. (One hundred and eighty-six references are appended. (MS)",

Issues of argument and argument evaluation are considered. The paper analyzes the nature of such reasoning and indicates its importance in subject matter learning. Three situations are described in the paper in which argument-based reasoning is central in support of conclusions and also in the testing of explanations and the weighing of alternatives in decision tasks. Two experiments, designed to determine whether an individual's agreement or disagreement with a particular assertion is related to the reasons the individual is able to generate for and against the particular proposition, are described and explained in the paper's longest section. Following  this, justification of an explanation, another way in which argumentation is found in the classroom, is also more briefly assessed. The paper concludes that utilization of a person's knowledge in the context of argumentation constitutes a reasonable instructional objective. (Twenty-six references are appended.) (MS)",

In some ways argument is more cognitively demanding than narrative, but lack of experience in persuasive writing, and the interrelated nature of the writing situation and the assessment situation also play a role. A review of the literature reveals several lines of evidence which suggest that argumentative writing should not be neglected because it might be too difficult. Useful procedures for developing persuasive writing include the following: (1) topics should be on issues important to students; (2) students should be encouraged to engage in persuasive writing to teachers, peers, principals,  and others when they feel strongly on issues; (3) large and small group discussions are invaluable in developing associated skills; (4) exercises to sort out what the students think are an important bridge to argumentative writing; and (5) students in the upper elementary years and beyond should read persuasive writing for exposure to linguistic conventions. There is no good reason why this kind of writing should be regarded as a difficult form to be attempted only by older and brighter students. (Forty-seven references are attached.) (RS)",

The program, at the University of Northern Iowa's (UNI) department of Communication and Theatre Arts, was implemented in 1978 after five years of planning. The program received support from the administration but faced problems because of its phenomenal growth. The paper describes this support and a number of attempted solutions to the problems of growth. Surveys of alumni indicate UNI's communication-based public relations  degree program satisfies the felt need among students and is successful in preparing students for the marketplace.

        "description":"In 1970, the Federal Communications Commission passed the Prime Time Access Rule, which directly affected the participation of the three commercial television networks in the production, transmission, and syndication of prime time programs. The result of this decision, as modified over the years since 1970, has shaped the television industry with respect to prime time television program production. The use of the Resource Dependence Model (developed by Gerbner and modified by Turow) will help in understanding this event and media history in general, and in analyzing the various participants in the event in terms of the power roles they play. As network television developed between 1947 and 1970, the essential resource changed from programs to transmission. Facilitating this  change was the national penetration of network television and the capacity to record programs. The three networks controlled programming in order to attract or create audiences to be sold to the advertisers. The purpose of the syndication rules was to reduce the power the networks had over syndication rights for programs prior to their broadcast. The result of these rules was to alter the network's leverage over other, independent, producers and to improve their access to the audience through the exhibitor or local stations. If the model has accurately analyzed the situation with regard to power and environment it is also useful as a predictive tool and to help understand the historical development of broadcasting policies.

        "description":"Drawing on Michael Halloran's genre of public proceedings, the Iran-contra hearings can be viewed from a celebratory or epideictic perspective, with several conceptualizations of the genre combined to illuminate the functions of the hearings. The primary function of the hearings, at least from an epideictic viewpoint, was the reassurance of the community as to the continued validity of its values and system of government. The hearings can be seen as constituting a socially defined significant event, the occurrence of which is more important than the specific content. The perceived legitimacy of the hearings takes on critical importance in order for the &quot;performance&quot; of the hearings to achieve its goal of community continuance. The primary epideictic function was accomplished  largely by means of what Walter Beale terms the rhetorical performative: the mere act of the hearings, defined by our system and made by our media into a significant event, could accomplish this reassuring function. Specific content may be important only so long as it adds to the appearance of legitimacy. This rhetorical situation may represent an ultimate genre of &quot;democratic discourse,&quot; typifying the need to strengthen the community in the course of any major political/rhetorical event. The Iran-contra hearings certainly reinforced the power and necessity of epideictic rhetoric in contemporary American political rhetoric. (Sixty-five notes are attached.) (RAE)",

        "description":"Critics contend American public television has failed to realize the potential envisioned by the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television. Using Ernest Bormann's theory of fantasy theme analysis as a framework to examine public TV reveals that American public television has been unable to develop a coherent rhetorical vision or a clear consensus of its identity and its role. Unlike commercial television, which has a strong centralizing influence in the three major networks, public television's decentralized nature can be democratic to the point of anarchy. Its administering agencies--Public Broadcasting Service, a membership organization owned by the stations that distribute programming, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, an independent public corporation that  receives and distributes federal funding--are in constant conflict. It is stated that public television's byzantine structure and chronic mendicant nature make daily existence paramount over development of a rhetorical vision on a station manager's agenda. And, without such a vision, public television programs are often indistinguishable from commercial station fare. Developing a rhetorical vision for public television would require building upon existing fantasy themes from the Carnegie Commission report, which include television-as-cultural-institution and localism. As a recipient of public funds, public television must serve audiences--minorities, the disabled, children, and senior citizens--neglected by for-profit broadcasters. Other fundamental changes in the structure and mission of  the industry measured in terms of quality, rather than mass appeal, are also necessary for public television to attain a rhetorical vision.

        "description":"For the generation of Americans who witnessed and perhaps even fought against the Hitler regime, the consequences of his political manipulation had a significant and tangible impact on their lives. For younger generations it is necessary to work to understand how Hitler constructed his appeals to the German people. While a great deal of his persuasiveness came from physical violence against political opposition, the persuasive power of his rhetoric should not be underestimated. To analyze Hitler's class appeals to the German people it is important to demonstrate how he adapted the basic tenets of fascist ideology to the Prussian heritage epitomized in the medieval Holy Roman Empire, the First Reich, and the Second Reich established by Bismarck in 1871. An examination of Hitler's  appeals to the Prussian aristocracy known as the Junkers (powerful forces in the Prussian army as well as in civil government) shows that through his rhetoric, Hitler managed to intertwine the tenets of fascist ideology with Prussian ideals in such a way that National Socialism appeared to be the party of the aristocracy rather than the party of the worker. The primary tenets of the fascist ideology can be seen in Hitler's organic conceptualization of the state and the ordering of relations within it. Even today, the greatest danger for the citizen lies in the failure to recognize basic tenets of fascist ideology. (Eighteen references are appended.) (MS)",

Questions concerned past and current funding of debate and individual events teams, perceived barriers to and benefits of forensic programs, and personal assessments over the value of forensics. Analysis suggested that the number of debate and individual events programs has declined. Although the majority of administrators indicated that having forensic teams was important, data were not conclusive as to whether these personal feelings of value translated into  faculty positions or funding. A large &quot;no response&quot; rate for questions requesting information about faculty positions and budget sources and levels restricted the analysis of this area.

Most schemes are part hype and part information about how to operate some type of business, often direct marketing. Plans include &quot;sure-fire ways to beat the horses, win the lottery, sell mailing lists, arrange loans, help people get money from the  government, or peddle travel club memberships. Most established get-rich-quick companies sell nothing more than information about how to sell get-rich-quick schemes. They tell one how to write ads and select media to peddle one's own publications and how to make a million. Better information about money-making techniques is available free at the public library.

By examining the concept of text and its relationship to media and performance, it can be argued that text and performance are media-dependent. The essential characteristics of particular forms of texts, such as the narrative form, as well as the derived experiences with and understanding of particular forms, are  dependent upon the medium employed to encode or to create the text. Thus, a text and its performance are most appropriately understood in terms of the encoding elements defining the communicative experience. Towards this end, the argument of media-dependence proceeds in four steps: (1) &quot;text&quot; can be conceived as a generative, rather than derived, concept; (2) the narrative form illustrates the diverse ways in which a form can act upon and shape human understanding; (3) a media perspective identifies the relationships which exist between a communicative form such as narrative and the concept of text as a generative force; and (4) the formal features of oral, literate, and electronic communicative forms can be characterized and distinguished from a media perspective.

Most of the Church's recent statements on communication treat the theme in a general way and balance a defense of human rights in regard to communication with encouragement of greater use of the media in proclaiming the Gospel. Statistics indirectly demonstrate the favorable Church policy towards ownership: around the world the Catholic Church or Church-organizations (largely missions and mission societies) own 290 radio stations and five television stations. Church ownership of broadcast properties in the United States is mostly at the local level, and includes educational, college, and some commercial stations. In general,  policy regarding ownership of broadcast properties seems to be favorable to ownership where opportune, and to leave specific decisions on ownership and management to as local a level as possible.

The first goal was to search the literature for information concerning the use (or lack thereof) of GTAs and UTAs and to explore the potential benefits and drawbacks to their use in the basic course in speech communication. The second goal was to propose a model using GTAs and UTAs to maximize the effectiveness of instruction in the basic course. Cost-effective instruction, efficient use of faculty time, more personalized instruction, benefits to the students, increase in department majors/minors, and personal and career growth for the GTAs and UTAs all make the use of GTAs and UTAs desirable in the  basic course. An extensive use of both GTAs and UTAs was not found through the literature review. Some of the benefits of the proposed model, based on the Personalized System of Instruction (PSI) model, included being cost-effective, increasing the involvement of the faculty and administrators, and having a systematic structure to help insure that change would not adversely affect the quality of the basic course. Research has shown that this model has helped integrate GTAs, UTAs, and interns into basic courses and suggests that the students are learning more and are more satisfied with this integration.

For the first study, 813 undergraduate students enrolled in the basic speech communication course were surveyed, once during the second week of classes and again during the last week of classes (107 were enrolled in two PSI-based sections and 706 were enrolled in 28 self-contained sections). The second study surveyed 159  students enrolled in PSI-based sections of the introductory course during the third and final weeks of the course. Analysis revealed no significant differences between genders for the Students' Perceptions of Communication Abilities (SPCA) scale, for attitudes toward the course, or for self-esteem measures. However, strong differences were apparent between PSI-based and self-contained sections of the course. Students in PSI-based sections received significantly higher final course grades than students in self-contained sections. Also, females received significantly higher course grades overall than did males. Of the 59 students repeating the course, those in the PSI-based format performed better than those in the self-contained format. (Three tables of data are appended.) (MM)",

In order to examine the aspects of the basic course, such as class size, interaction, and instructional format, a study assessed differences between two instructional methods in a basic speech communication course: a modified Personalized System of Instruction (PSI) and a self-contained format. Communication skills, communication apprehension, self-esteem, and academic achievement in, perceptions about, and satisfaction with the course were compared. Data were collected from subjects, 813 undergraduates enrolled in the basic speech communication course (107 were enrolled in two PSI-based  sections and the remaining 706 were enrolled in 28 self-contained sections of the basic course), by pretest questionnaire, posttest questionnaire, and collection of grades from instructor's record books. Using t-tests to compare means and mean change scores, the PSI-based format was found to be more effective than the self-contained format. Comparing these data with an earlier study designed to compare the PSI-based method with a more traditional lecture-recitation format, the self-contained approach appeared to be a better alternative than the lecture-recitation for teaching this course, but the PSI-based model was still clearly superior to both alternatives.

        "description":"The fall of Gary Hart, brought about because of his indiscretions during the 1988 presidential campaign, should not be treated exclusively as a consequence of Hart's moral failings. Rather, the fall of Hart can be traced to a complex of factors including bad judgment, the near total control that the press exercises over the political agenda, and most important, failed apologia. His apologetic strategies would have been well-adapted to a situation in which a candidate had been accused of some moral failing about which most of the people did not care. In such a situation it would have been smart for him largely to ignore the specifics in his major campaign speeches and instead attempt to rise above the conflict. Here, however, the issue was not adultery, but bad judgment, and  Hart's strategies were ill-adapted to such a problem. An analysis of Hart's failed apologia suggests several implications for generic approaches to apologia. First, while a generic treatment of apologia has much to recommend itself, such an approach is always limited by context. Second, while any number of critics focus on the situational basis of rhetorical genres, there clearly are limits on the value of such an approach. Finally, there is danger associated with any set of general critical categories, no matter how valuable those categories may be. (Twenty-two references are appended.) (MS)",

The paper demonstrates the complexity involved in the evaluation of ad populum arguments as well as the care which must be taken in evaluating paradigms. The paper also explores the inherent deficiency of audience-centered debate paradigms and develops standards for the demonstration of arguments as inappropriately ad populum involving an emphasis on context and function. Following a consideration of the special constraints on paradigmatic evaluation, the paper concludes by applying contextual and functional standards to the ad populum appeals in the issues-agenda  and the narrative paradigm. The conclusion reached is that the ad populum appeals within this trend of audience-centered debate are inappropriate to the activity: they are descriptive rather than normative, rhetorical rather than dialectical, and interventionist rather than critical.

        "description":"Cross examination has become a standard and important feature of contemporary debate and a great deal has been written concerning its tactical aspects. Very little, however, has been written about the fundamental strategic problem which is created by the three-minute time limit--specifically, how to use that limited period of time to its best advantage. Most of the better discussions about the tactics of cross examination are so comprehensive that a debater would be unable to employ more than a small fraction of the suggestions in any given session. This creates the strategic problems of how to assess a debate in planning cross examination questions, assessing potential questions according to how much time they will require to be issued and responded to, selecting questions for  maximum effect, anticipating responses, and determining the order in which questions should be asked. A model based on a systematic paradigm that can govern the strategy of cross examination sessions is presented and discussed. The paradigm was developed by integrating two pragmatic formulas for decision management: from medicine the concept of triage, or battlefield casualty assessment; and from computer science the decision tree model of structured decision making. This paradigm and model provide a relatively simple and workable technique which debaters can employ to help them manage their cross examination sessions in a coherent, interesting, relevant, and potentially effective manner. (Thirty-one notes and one diagram of a decision tree are included.) (Author/MS)",

        "description":"A study examined how people respond to violations of F. Heider's (1958) balance principle when learning patterns of sentiments among people in a group. Subjects, 90 students from introductory psychology and communication courses at the University of Kansas, participated in the experiment, and were randomly assigned to one of three schema conditions--transcendent, nontranscendent, and balanced. Fifty-four subjects participated in the one-week recall condition, while 36 subjects participated in the 15-minute recall condition. Subjects answered questions on four stories, then were interviewed and debriefed. Results indicated that when negative sentiments were paired with parent-child unit relations, subjects processed the sentences for a longer period and remembered the information  less well; (2) that even in the nontranscendent condition, subjects sought for an explanation for unbalanced patterns and found it in the divorce schema and the religious differences schema (two of the stories); and (3) even though the apriori hypotheses were not fully confirmed, there was consistent evidence that the transcendent patterns were acquired and retained better than nontranscendent ones. Although the varying effects of the three conditions of the text variable produced significant interactions, therefore not supporting the apriori hypothesis, the notion of a transcendent explanation was strongly supported. In addition, results demonstrated that information that cannot be accounted for within a schema may not be recalled accurately, even when it receives greater processing  time. These results were best accounted for with F. I. M. Craik and E. Tulving's notion of an integrated, coherent pattern produced by deep processing.

        "description":"Some researchers have stressed the negative effects of the peculiar interactive situation of twins on the development of communicative competence; other researchers have shown early positive effects. Referential communication--one of the most evolved, intellectualized, and decentered functions of language that consists of transmitting information about referents such as objects, locations, and ideas--is particularly critical for the twin condition, where the problem of differentiation and decentralization with respect to the partner is always present. To analyze this kind of communicative performance, 16 twins (four pairs of boys and four pairs of girls) and 16 singletons all aged 5-11, were read a story that the child had to repeat to an interlocutor, were given directions for a  game that the child had to explain to another child, and were shown how an object worked that the child had to explain to another child. Results indicated that (1) referential communication abilities of twin children when interacting with each other are as good as those of single born children; (2) when a twin leaves his/her &quot;intrageminal society&quot; to interact with another child, his/her performance becomes less adequate; (3) in the first kind of game the twins' verbal accounts of story are more detailed when interacting with co-twin than with another child; and (4) in the second kind of game, even if there are no significant quantitative differences, twins' verbal explanations to other children are more frequently accompanied by gestural communication.

        "description":"Erving Goffman has made significant, sustained contributions to the understanding of human behavior. Goffman studied the minute details of human interaction and how social arrangements protect and promote those interactions. Central to Goffman's study of human interaction was the concept of &quot;self.&quot; Goffman believed that the self has two parts:&quot;official&quot; and &quot;all-too-human.&quot; Both selves are communicated by interpersonal means, where individuals choose clothing, mannerisms, and speech to influence the outcome of conversations and interactions with others. Goffman's theoretical perspective, his use of &quot;incongruent phrases,&quot; and his practice of &quot;serious ethnography&quot; or &quot;ethnomethodology&quot; are useful concepts and research techniques for the rhetoric and communication scholar. His  methods have been called empirical, but were not based on quantification--a radical stance for his time. His primary research goal was to show that the behavior considered to be common is really uncommon, when viewed from different perspectives. Goffman has attempted to avoid being classified along any one theoretical line or associated with any particular school of thought. The ability to articulate the subtle implications of how society is maintained is a powerful part of Goffman's work. At the same time, however, Goffman understood that he was a part of what he was studying, that his mere presence had an impact on how people behaved, and that the situation in which the episode occurs influences its meaning. Communication reality is a symbolic reality that is held together, because  people believe it is that way. (Thirty-eight footnotes are included.) (RAE)",

        "description":"Cross-cultural awareness in the multicultural classroom has become an important issue in recent years for two main reasons: a continued increase in the number of international students studying in the United States and an increased emphasis on faculty skills for dealing with minorities in the classroom. Faculty approaches to maintaining cultural equilibrium in the classroom are frequently mistaken for cross-cultural insensitivity. A self-reporting instrument can help faculty gauge their awareness of primary areas of cross-cultural difference in the classroom. Culture bound areas are areas that can be interpreted and emphasized in significantly different ways depending upon an individual's cultural background. The survey instrument offered in this paper is based on an outline of  culture bound areas which was created by the National Association for Developmental Education. Faculty indicate their responses to each statement in each area. The instrument focuses on teacher expectations, standards, personal perspectives, approaches in common situations, and how these areas may benefit or detract from the classroom environment. Specific analysis of the following survey areas can be beneficial: (1) teacher-student communication should be based on formal (rather than informal) interaction; (2) emotionally charged issues and conflict should be handled by never losing control over oneself or the classroom; (3) humor should be used; and (4) students should be treated the same, whether the teacher likes them individually or not.

        "description":"The testimony presented in this document outlines the productivity lag between the needs of companies and the students who will enter the work force that is evident today within the United States. Manufacturing companies are having difficulty as they try to introduce flexible manufacturing technology. A lack of skill in communication, mathematics, and reasoning, as well as inadequate knowledge of American history and culture are related to student apathy and lack of motivation. Several reasons are given to explain the discrepancy between earnings and productivity on the job. A comparison is made between the American model and the Japanese model of schooling, which reflects American lack of immediate rewards for excellence in high school, no real consequences for poor academic  performance during the high school years, the introduction of competition that is not based upon achieving a fixed standard of performance; and a situation where the teachers blame the students and parents for problems, while the students and parents are blaming the teachers. Suggestions are made to improve education: by rewarding learning with individualized learning goals, by restructuring of schoolwide and classroom recognition of that achievement, and by improving the measures of academic achievement with statewide examinations and reforms of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Footnotes, charts, and two pages of references are appended. (LMS)",

        "description":"The school improvement movement during the past decade has, among other things, provided educators with realistic data on how effective schools got that way. One of the most basic findings is that successful schools have five common characteristics: principals who provide strong administrative and instructional leadership; high expectations, including a conviction that all the students can and will learn; a school climate that stimulates learning, beginning with a building that is orderly and quiet without being repressive; a schoolwide feeling by students and staff alike that the acquisition of basic skills is urgently important; and a continuous system of monitoring student progress. The path toward excellence involves seven basic steps: (1) acquaint staff with school  improvement research; (2) select a school improvement committee, consisting of the principal and representative teachers, parents, and staff; (3) decide on goals; (4) engage in discussions; (5) specify research that addresses the school's needs; (6) draft a written improvement plan; and (7) circulate final document to staff, parents, district officials, the media, community leaders, and others.

        "description":"In 1986, the Center for Education Statistics (CES) initiated a series of meetings with a wide range of private school representatives. At these meetings, a need for more complete information on the data collection efforts of the various private groups was identified, and as a result, CES agreed to investigate the extent and nature of the education statistics currently being collected. This paper describes the lines of inquiry, the findings, and some tentative implications for data collection in the private school sector. Each of 22 organizations including 15 member organizations of the Council for American Private Education--CAPE--and the National Catholic Educational Association, (estimated to cover 90-95 percent of private school activity) were asked to send CES copies of the  forms they use to collect education statistics and examples of the reports prepared from them. A tentative set of data elements for a common system was developed, and each organization's coverage of the set was depicted in matrix form; both items were sent to all 22 organizations. A review of the materials supplied and the analysis of these and the matrix suggest that, except for the very broadest of generalizations, it would not be possible to derive a national picture from the aggregation of data as presently collected by the private school organizations. CES envisions a period during which CES and the various associations and private school representatives would negotiate the elements of a common &quot;core&quot; system and establish common definitions and procedures for data collection covering  a limited data set. This effort would be coordinated with CES's public school data collections to permit further comparisons. (MLF)",

The study was a multistage probability sample of private schools across the United States done in conjunction with a survey of library and media centers. The first stage was the sampling of 75 areas, consisting of counties or groups of contiguous counties; the second stage was the selection of schools within the sampled areas; and the third and final stage was the sampling of teachers within the sampled schools. A total of 1,174  school questionnaires were obtained from the 1,387 schools within the scope of the survey, resulting in an overall response rate of 85 percent. Among the data collected in the survey were religious orientation, enrollment size, number of teachers, years of operation, percent minority enrollment, and tuition.

        "description":"To gain an insight into teachers' perceptions of the role and responsibilities of school principals, 143 teachers from a large metropolitan area were surveyed. They were asked to respond to the following four questions: (1) What do you believe are the most important functions of the principal?; (2) What do principals say to teachers are the principals' important functions?; (3) What do principals demonstrate are their important functions?; and (4) What could principals do to make the teachers' job better? An overwhelming majority of teachers responded that the principal's chief role was that of instructional leader. Other important functions included that of building manager, public relations with parents and the community at large, and setting the tone or climate for the school.  Administrators communicate to staff that they see their role as one of instructional leader but also report that most of their day is spent in administrative and discipline tasks. There appears to be a dichotomy between what principals say are important functions and what they demonstrate, with teachers reporting that administrators are overly concerned with nonacademic matters almost to the point of neglecting the real purpose of the school, that of educating students. The suggestions made by the teachers include more visibility on the part of the principal, more concern with academic matters, more visits in the classroom, and more support in related matters.

This paper begins with a discussion of Malaysia's New Economic Policy, whose provisions include a phasing out of English as the language of instruction in favor of Bahasa Malaya, the language of the indigenous Malay majority. This policy provides a background for the massive demand for overseas higher education by Malaysian Chinese and Indian students. The second section provides a background to Australia's Overseas Student Policy, which eliminated quotas and included a full-fee-paying private student category that created a rapidly expanding market for overseas fee-paying students. The third section describes Australia's recruitment of Malaysian students, including sponsored and subsidized students  on one hand, and full-paying students on the other. The subsequent section, &quot;Matching up the Malaysian and Australian Pictures,&quot; discusses the problems created by Malaysia's growing demand for overseas education and the resulting competition over placement with Australia's local students. A discussion follows of &quot;Twinning,&quot; a promising model for overseas study that involves joint degrees between cooperating Malaysian and Australian universities. The paper concludes with observations about long-term problems and opportunities, including Malaysia's serious graduate unemployment problem, the declining standard of English in Malaysia, and the problems in Australia caused by the growing influx of Malaysian students.

The goals were to identify the principals' evaluations and perceptions of these models, to summarize the findings of the study, and to present the implications concerning the design of inservice education and the value of continuing the professional development opportunities. The inservice models included traditional university credit courses, short-term learning institutes sponsored by professional associations or by state education agencies, local school district inservices, and informal networking for personal and professional development. Survey questionnaires were sent to 250 randomly selected elementary and secondary principals in Ohio, of  whom 192 (77%) responded. The findings indicate that the least popular model is the university course and the most often attended is the professional association short-term institute. Networking was found to be the most effective approach. Administrators appear to engage in a wide variety of inservice education activities; however, many believe they need to be included in the planning of the programs.

The Congress of the United States enacted the Safe School Study Act in 1974 to ensure a safe environment for education. In response to this legislatuion the National Institute of Education (NIE) in 1978 designed a study to acquire information on the current status of safety in public schools. In 1983, another study was undertaken by the Boston (Massachusetts) Safe Schools Commission to ascertain violence, victimization, and discipline in Boston high schools, and in 1984 the U.S. Department of Justice collaborated with the U.S. Department of Education and Pepperdine University  to sponsor the National School Safety Center, which develops educational programs to promote safe schools. This reivew indicates that there is a connection between practice and research. At present California is the forerunner in establishing victims' rights and mandating principals to report all misdemeanors and felonies that occur on the campuses. The review found that small class size, a perceived fair discipline practice, a visible principal, participatory decision-making including teachers and students, and a cohesiveness among teaching staff and principal all related to less violence and vandalism.

One concern in the development of education policy is whether the money necessary to accomplish these changes will be available. First, funding increases for education reform since 1983 are examined. Second, the percentage of specified reform dollars is compared, first to total state revenue and, second, to revenue from all sources, over time. Two major data sources were utilized for this study: (1) figures on reform expenditures were collected from the \"National Education Association's Estimates of School Statistics, 1987-88\"; (2) a questionnaire was sent to the finance director for each state department of education to determine new line-item  funding and specific \"education reform\" funding. The data were then analyzed to determine how the states are funding the reforms they are legislating and recommending. Although many states enacted some form of increased graduation requirements and excellence policies, many of them set aside no additional aid for these measures. In conclusion, it is likely that education reform and education finance reform will be linked in an effort to achieve the tandem goals of equity and excellence in education.

        "description":"The Carnegie Foundation recently completed a comprehensive survey of more than 20,000 teachers in all 50 states about their involvement in shaping classroom and school policy. The report consists of a brief introductory analysis of the survey by foundation president Ernest L. Boyer, followed by 10 tables presenting, for each state, the percentages of teachers who report being \"involved\" or \"not very involved\" in decisions on 10 dimensions of classroom and school policy: choosing textbooks and instructional materials, shaping the curriculum, setting standards for student behavior, tracking students into special classes, designing staff development and in-service programs, setting promotion and retention policies, deciding school budgets, evaluating teacher performance, selecting  new teachers, and selecting new administrators. Teacher involvement in decision-making varies widely from state to state. For example, 93 percent of Vermont teachers say they are involved in choosing textbooks, whereas 61 percent of Maryland teachers so indicated. Participation in budget decisions ranges from 57 percent in Hawaii to 8 percent in North Dakota. In his analysis, Boyer recommends more teacher involvement in many decisions that effect them and their students, as well as measuring progress against each school's own performance in preceding years.

In the first case, \"Martin v. Parrish,\" the instructor was dismissed for using profanity in the class. The second case, \"Carley v. Arizona Board of Regents,\" centered on the importance of student evaluations in the ultimate dismissal of an instructor. The questions discussed are based upon the premise that teaching is an ambiguous technology. As such, with no specifying outcomes, can the means really be specified? If a university wishes to strengthen teaching, who will evaluate and on what criteria? Recommendations are offered at the institutional, collegial, and individual levels and include the following: require multiple  measures of quality teaching; have a developmental process and goals; use a system appropriate to the institutional type; and (for the individual) raise academic freedom only as an institutional claim, not a legal one, since academic freedom is, in reality, an institutional, occupational and organizational norm, not a legally efficacious construct.

Following an executive summary and introduction, section 2 describes the basic elements of a performance accountability system. Section 3 describes state accountability system variations related to primary responsibility; linkage with other state policies; indicator types; data collection, organization, and  reportage levels; reporting mechanisms; and school comparison methods. Section 4 discusses uses and consequences of performance accountability systems. Local educators' actual use of these systems does not necessarily match state policymakers' assumptions. State-controlled and locally controlled systems are briefly compared. Section 5 treats unresolved dilemmas, including balancing oversight and improvement, determining the appropriate accountability level, balancing statewide comparability with local ownership, expanding the alternatives to traditional standardized tests, making fair comparisons, and ensuring adequate capacity. In the final section, recommendations are given for designing better systems and for using accountability data to improve low-achieving schools and encourage  high-performing or significantly improving schools.

This paper outlines some basic principles by which science teachers may protect themselves from lawsuits, before and during the time that students are engaged in experiments or lab work. Courts in this country have determined that educators have the following obligations to students: (1) adequate supervision; (2) proper instruction; and (3) maintenance of equipment. Accordingly, this monograph addresses each of these concerns. The teacher has the responsibility of thinking through each step of the experiment and analyzing the possibility of harm at each point, both from the process and from the equipment. Obvious potential hazards must be removed,  since students cannot be subjected to unreasonable risk. In civil cases, teachers' actions are measured with reference to a hypothetical reasonable person under the same circumstances, or with reference to the doctrine of foreseeability. The best safeguard for today's science teachers is therefore comprehensive and explicit instruction before laboratory work. (TE)",

Four North Carolina elementary and middle schools were chosen as pilot sites. Representative adaptive/assistive devices and software were purchased, compatible with Apple II equipment. The subject area addressed was elementary-level language arts and reading. Teachers and coordinators were trained to use the products and developed learning activities with the resources.  Guidelines were developed to assist teachers in using the new technology in their classrooms. For physically handicapped students, Apple IIe keyboard modifications were implemented. Approximately 20 learning activities are described in this guide. Each activity description provides appropriate ages, level of functioning, exceptionality, skill objective of the activity, basic education program correlation, software and hardware used, and a brief lesson plan.

A total of 625 questionnaires were distributed via 24 agencies; 234 useable surveys were returned for a 39% response rate. The survey instrument contained items related to demographic characteristics of respondents, demographic characteristics of the developmentally disabled individuals, utilization of family support services, and identification of important family support services. Findings indicated that most of the developmentally disabled in the sample were between school age and young adulthood and enrolled in a day training or activity program. Major diagnoses  included multiple handicaps, mental retardation, and learning disabilities. Most respondents were mothers between the ages of 31 and 61. The most used services were financial and medical assistance, adult day program, and transportation. Family support services not used but wanted included information and referral, advocacy, parent support groups, and counseling. Identified as most important services by respondents were respite, day program, leisure/recreation programs, and information/referral. (DB)",

The project was designed to increase the number of severely handicapped students being served in integrated, age-appropriate local settings by expanding the capacity of local service providers to cooperatively assess and develop educational intervention strategies. Project premises (e.g. the importance of continuous student assessment) are identified and distinctions among &quot;multidisciplinary,&quot;&quot;interdisciplinary,&quot; and &quot;transdisciplinary&quot; are drawn. The program's assessment component involves three levels: diagnostic, educational, and daily performance assessment. TAAP transdisciplinary teams are comprised of  service providers from three different levels: the local school district team, the special education coop team, and the regional team. An &quot;arena&quot; approach to assessment provides input from many professionals while minimizing the number of professionals handling the child. Student program objectives are organized by functional domain: community functioning, domestic living (including self-care skills), vocational, and recreation/leisure. Among conclusions of the pilot TAAP implementation was the importance of preassessment preparation and postassessment analysis by team members. (DB)",

Problems in the state include a shortage of special education teachers, increased numbers of students qualifying for special education, high costs, high attrition among teachers in rural areas, and high travel demands placed on both students and teachers. The project is addressing these needs through two major components, first, identifying individuals currently working in rural districts and assisting them in pursuing initial or additional certification in special education; and second, the development and dissemination of specific information on rural education to both  students and faculty members in university departmental certification-track, supervision, and administration classes. The first component provides stipends to identified teachers enabling them to use classroom release time to attend university courses and participate in a school year practicum. An orienting seminar focuses on issues in rural special education. The second component has involved development of a faculty workshop and 8 to 10 modules on topics in rural special education.

Results indicated that occupational therapists working in both rural and urban areas reported similar educational backgrounds and years of practice and agreed on the most important preservice content areas and the needs of occupational therapy in educational settings. Rural personnel were more likely to employ  alternate patterns of service provision and to serve persons throughout their development into adulthood. Students of occupational therapy tended to lack an understanding of the educational system. All personnel need a better understanding of what educators know and are capable of doing in their classrooms and ways to more efficiently utilize available resources. (DB)",

The program's four intervention components include health care, structured group counseling, child development assessments and parenting instruction, and a volunteer role model component.  The components are delivered in such a way that the adolescent mother receives intense services during her initial involvement with the program and then less intense services as the adolescent becomes more responsible and is able to function more independently.

The paper concludes with guidelines for planning a parent night, to present the idea to parents and to provide them with opportunities to create their own games and materials to take home.  (JDD)",

        "description":"Rural teachers are confronted with the task of providing appropriate education to exceptional students, as well as addressing the added elements of language and culture issues as these pertain to handicapping conditions. Key points in the identification and instruction of these students are initial referral, early intervention, and appropriate placement within special services. This paper reviews the literature on these key points, focusing on the interrelationship of cultural and educational characteristics. The review concludes that research has clearly demonstrated the significant role played by acculturation factors in the inappropriate identification and placement of culturally/linguistically different students with learning and behavior problems. Research has also pointed  the way for modifying the referral/staffing/placement process to more effectively meet the special needs of this population. The appendix contains the &quot;CCDES Acculturation Scale,&quot; developed by Cross Cultural Developmental Education Services. The scale can be used to obtain an approximate measure of how acculturated a student is into mainstream American culture. It provides a useful piece of supplemental assessment information and may be used to substantiate decisions to provide intensive learning and behavior interventions for culturally/linguistically different students. The appendix also provides an outline of BISECT, an alternative intervention process developed as a result of this study. (JDD)",

A program was designed to provide training for field-based cooperating teachers to develop their observation, supervisory, and evaluation skills. The training consisted of three weekly sessions which included lecture/discussion activities, guided practice, and probe assessments. The practicum experience is organized around competency-based teacher education principles, and 50 target competencies must be demonstrated by the student and documented by the  cooperating teacher. University-based practicum supervisors maintain periodic contact with students and cooperating teachers, observe and evaluate students in classroom settings, and assign final grades. Proposed evaluation procedures for the project include ratings of the cooperating teachers' supervisory performance, data analysis of the competencies demonstrated by students, observation of students by cooperating teachers and supervisors, etc. (Forty-one references are listed.)

        "description":"The Competitive Employment through Vocational Experience (CETVE) Project was a 2-year, federally funded model transitional program for secondary-level handicapped students. The model involved use of competitive work experience to provide severely vocationally handicapped students with a work history prior to graduation. CETVE students were provided with supervised competitive work experience in conjunction with job coaching and written transition plans. The five phases in the service delivery model included: (1) identifying handicapped students who need CETVE services, (2) screening identified students to determine initial employment skills and deficits, (3) placing students in a competitive work experience, (4) training students on-the-job via job coaching, and (5) providing  follow-along services to ensure job retention. Of the 11 students served who were graduated from high school, seven obtained full-time employment, one acquired part-time employment, two enrolled in a community college, and one became unemployed. Factors that school systems need to consider when replicating this transitional model include: interagency cooperation, transportation, liability, and community-based training. Sample forms are located in an appendix and include a student employment screening form, a job analysis form, a job/student compatibility analysis form, and a form for supervisors' evaluations of employees.

Stressed are the importance of involving parents in decisions, the coordination of regular and special education services, the need to make adaptations to accommodate the most severely handicapped students in regular education settings, and the importance of early intervention and preschool services. Concerns of quality of educational programming are highlighted now that access to  educational services has been improved. (DB)",

Noncompliant behavior was modified through systematic and consecutive manipulations of two reinforcement systems. Responding to teacher requests within 5 seconds was reinforced within the context of math instruction in order to decrease an inappropriate social behavior while concomitantly increasing a critical academic skill. A simple A-B time series design was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. A token economy and verbal praise treatment package was found to be an effective system for reducing noncompliance and increasing math proficiency. Other factors contributing to the program's effectiveness may have included consistent  feedback in the form of charting daily behavior, goal setting, personal attention, and the student's own interest in the program. It was noted that noncompliance increased on days in which an unfamiliar concept was introduced. The concurrent increase in academic achievement was attributed in large measure to the decrease in noncompliance. (Author/JW)",

TBE is available to Spanish speakers in grades pre-kindergarten through 8 and to Vietnamese speakers in grades K-6. ESL provides intensive English instruction to students in 49 other language groups. Federal funds have been used to enhance the regular secondary program for Hispanic LEP students. Evaluation shows that for AISD-funded programs, LEP students exceeded state standards in 6 of 14 comparisons, showed high Spanish language mastery rates in grade 1 and 3, had a dropout rate twice that of the district as a whole, scored well in comparison  with national averages in mathematics in some grades, and have maintained achievement in reading and language above the 23rd percentile after exiting from LEP status. However, the bilingual teacher supply has diminished and programs from 1980-83 have not had long-term effects on retention, exit rate, and achievement. In federally-funded programs, English proficiency improved at four of six grade levels and in each of five subjects, Spanish language results were generally positive, tutoring program participants increased, and teachers supported development efforts.

Both individual employees and department heads were surveyed about perceived language training needs. Results suggest that foreign language proficiency is very important to the ministry's functioning, with the need for language skills increasing in the future. The most important languages were found to be Swedish, English, and German, with French, Russian, Norwegian, and Danish also mentioned as needed. The language proficiency of personnel was found to be insufficient, with the greatest amount of training needed in Swedish and English oral proficiency. The employees felt they needed a higher level of language proficiency for the  performance of their work than the department heads felt was required. The findings suggest that self-assessment may give more realistic information about language training needs than official assessments. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"Researchers have long debated on whether note-taking results in improved student performance on tests. Over the years, researchers have tried to verify that note-taking helps students &quot;encode&quot; the information involved and that notes are valuable as materials for review. C. C. Crawford's 1925 study concluded that taking notes was better than not taking notes, that reviewing notes was a key to their impact, and that organizing notes effectively contributes to improved performance on tests. There is growing evidence that note-taking combined with critical thinking facilitates retention and applications of the information. One study found that successful college students engaged in greater integrative processing during note-taking, and that note-taking itself &quot;enhances organizational  processing of lecture information.&quot; Other research shows that note-taking is an effective learning strategy and that the amount of note-taking is related to academic achievement. While most note-taking research continues to measure the impact of note-taking on recall as measured by tests, there is increasing emphasis on cognitive analyses that may have more explicit instructional implications in the near future.

        "description":"The borrowing of words by computer sciences from the field of English implies a widespread interest in the relationship between technology and language. To confirm the genealogy of \"technological literacy,\" it would be useful to understand better linguistic literacy. To be literate is to be able to participate in the linguistic interchanges that constitute the social life, work, art, and government of a culture. From that definition follow certain policies about the teaching of literacy. First, believing that one learns to participate in cultural dialogue by degrees, many educators argue that literacy should be taught throughout the curriculum, rather than only in introductory English courses. Second, insofar as English teachers bear a particular responsibility for literacy, many  of them try to draw students into dialogue rather than drilling or lecturing them. Third, recognizing that literacy will not automatically promote individual development and critical thinking, many English teachers now pursue those goals deliberately by leading students to take responsibility for their own topics and styles. Technological literacy should be reconceived on the analogy of linguistic literacy, as participation in cultural dialogues about and through technology. The ends of literacy can best be served by teaching the languages of technology \"as\" languages: symbolic means of understanding and controlling reality. (MS)",

The study was based on the belief that it is the words that children actually misspell in their writing that represent the words and patterns that need to be taught. The samples from this study came from three national writing assessment and four state writing assessment programs and included 21,876 writing samples from children in grades 2-8. Findings produced a set of seven word lists at grades 2 through 8 and the &quot;Spelling List Concordance: Words  Taught in Seven Major Spelling Programs.&quot; To investigate spelling avoidance in the context of composing stories a second pilot study explored the extent to which students avoid writing words because they are unsure of how to spell them. Subjects, 27 students from grades 1-5 in rural schools near a major university town in the Midwest, were asked both to tell and to write the same story in response to a picture prompt. Results indicated that most of the time there was no evidence of direct word or phrase substitution at all. However, the conclusions leave unanswered questions about spelling avoidance, and this may be because of the study's design.

Metadiscourse is defined as an author's overt or non-overt presence in the discourse in order to direct rather than inform readers--the linguistic material given to readers so they will understand what is said and what is meant in the primary discourse. Three general categories of metadiscourse--information, voice, and attitude--were added in varying combinations to a passage from a social studies textbook. One hundred twenty mostly white middle-class sixth-graders were tested for learning from these passages. Analyses of covariance, controlling for reading ability, revealed significant interaction effects involving metadiscourse and  anxiety. As expected, high anxious students showed their best performance with first person voice and no attitudinal metadiscourse while low anxious students showed the opposite effect. These results indicated the importance of studying the joint effects of metadiscourse and anxiety as determinants of textbook reading. (Four tables of data, including examples of the metadiscourse variables and a sample of the test anxiety measure, are included, and 52 references conclude the report.) (SR)",

Children were asked to write in group classroom conditions at monthly intervals and to write in individual interviews once in the fall, winter, and spring. In the first session, five common forms of writing (scribble, drawing, non-phonetic letterstrings, phonetic or invented spelling, and conventional orthography) were elicited and modelled. In this session and all subsequent sessions, children were encouraged to &quot;write your own way.&quot; Sessions were audiotaped; notes about the order of composition and  non-verbal behaviors were recorded by the examiner; and writing samples were collected. Scoring was done both on the spot and also rechecked at leisure by two researchers. Primary forms of writing in the fall were scribble, drawing, and letter strings. The primary form of rereading was the &quot;written monologue,&quot; in which both wording and intonation are like written language. Two surprising results were explored: the endurance of scribble as a form of writing, particularly with advanced forms of composition and rereading behavior; and the late and tentative appearance of invented spelling. Findings suggest that children were building a repertoire of linguistic tools, all of which would be useful in a mature model of conventional literacy.

Analogical reasoning involves the identification and transfer of structural information from a known system to a new and relatively unknown system. The productive use of analogy is often based on the recognition of some similarity in salient properties of the two systems, and not similarity in their structure, since the relevant structure of the target system is unknown. Examinations of analogical reasoning often ignore developmental questions of how children and adults acquire this mechanism, but such questions are crucial in terms of their impact on instruction. Analogical reasoning is available to children as well as  adults. What develops is not the analogical mechanism itself but the conceptual system upon which this mechanism operates.

By using DTP, students gain experience in a variety of disciplines--writing, typesetting, graphic design, printing, and computing. DTP represents a revolutionary literacy tool for schools since it encourages students to create and publish manuscripts of a high professional quality. Yet DTP does not generally exist in schools, partly because of the expense involved and the computer expertise needed. Recently, however, two inexpensive programs that run on Apple II computers--TimeWorks'&quot;Publish It!&quot; and Springboard Software's &quot;Springboard Publisher&quot;--have been released, changing teachers' options completely. To keep computers and writing in a proper balance, DTP should be  introduced in special courses designed to teach writing and desktop publishing, such as journalism courses, writing for publication courses, or literary magazine courses. DTP brings students into a new relationship with the written word. If DTP is introduced thoughtfully into the school curriculum, it can improve students' reading and writing skills, while providing opportunities for them to acquire a range of computer publishing abilities which are increasingly valued outside the classroom.

The best way to help students become more aware of their own language and to learn to assess its effectiveness is to have students hear and see their own discourse. Instructors might audio tape samples of student speeches. The students are then given evaluation forms which they must complete while listening to the tape of their own speech. In addition to listening, students  are required to make a transcript of all of their utterances used in an oral assignment. Without exception, when the students made and analyzed a transcript, they became aware of their problems. Other assignments use group work and mini-speeches to develop descriptive powers. The teacher's job is to help students learn to use language more effectively, to involve the students actively in the learning process. Instead of doing all the reflection and conceptualization for the students, the teacher must help them to learn to self-assess and extract learning principles from this assessment.

The paper focuses on five sets of cultural value orientations of the family: relational orientations, positional role behavior, authority, kinship, and ancestor worship. Chinese and American families are compared and contrasted for each set. The paper concludes that: (1) there is a close relationship between human language and culture; (2) proverbs are useful to illustrate the cultural value orientations  within the Chinese family system; (3) present intercultural communication research pays too much attention to the communication process and ignores the concept of culture itself; (4) when studying cultural value orientations, a person should understand several inherent limitations; and (5) cultural value orientations change over time.

Subjects, 50 farmers in the village of Porandla in the state of Andhra Pradesh, were interviewed and measured to see if their knowledge and comprehension approximated a constant across all receivers. The results showed that the source was not very successful in achieving isomorphism of intent with receivers. The distribution of comprehension scores revealed both low comprehension and a great variability in those scores across all farmers. Results suggest that if the objectives of the source are to be served, then it is crucial to study the message code, structure, and treatment to determine the extent to which it is capable of  producing uniform and adequate comprehension of the source's intentionality within receivers. Unless the comprehension approximates uniformity across all potential receivers, the variance in the ensuing decision which may result in variance in behavior, i.e. adoption or rejection of an innovation, will not be adequately explained. Findings, therefore, suggest a reorientation in development communication research from a study of overt behavior as the dependent variable to an examination of receiver comprehension of source messages that may be producing that behavior.

        "description":"Use of the mass media as a teaching instrument in the classroom has increased considerably at all grade levels in the past few years. The newspaper is the most widely used of the media, the direct result of a national campaign by publishers, known as &quot;Newspapers in Education&quot; (NIE). This initiative encourages the use of newspapers as an educational tool both to complement and to supplement traditional classroom texts and resource materials. There are a number of ways teachers can use newspapers to teach comprehension and critical thinking and to help students develop sensitivity and awareness of the self, the community, the nation, and the world. Some teachers have developed classroom materials using the newspaper for specialized instructional purposes, while others employ the  newspaper as a foundation for law-related courses. Still others have devised a newspaper course for older students that helps prepare them for effective citizenship in an independent world, providing instruction in global concepts such as economic interdependence, the migrations of people, environmental independence, cultural diffusion, the communication revolution, and cultural diversity. Newspapers can also prove to be beneficial for teaching adult education students and learning disabled students. For readers at all levels, the newspaper can be a versatile tool to obtain useful and interesting information while developing an individual's ability to read. (MS)",

The appeal of visual media continues to make film, video, and television educational tools with high potential impact; and (because of videocassette recorders) they are now considerably more accessible and less cumbersome to use. Film can be used as an adjunct to almost any discipline and is particularly effective in teaching different kinds of learners. Film can link disciplinary perspectives, can serve very specific courses and units, and can target and motivate writing. The mass media are an integral part of the environment in which today's students learn to read, write, listen,  speak, and make meaning of their lives. This is a major reason that a properly designed course of instruction can use film to channel a student's enthusiasm and route it to an academically useful goal. (MS)",

Subjects were 200 pupils of 11 and 12 years of age, and performances on four different oral tasks were investigated. The rating dimensions--defined as main functions of speaking--were reference, delivery, fluency and articulacy. Each main function was represented by a rating category that was selected in a pretest. Inter-rater reliabilities, correlations between panel ratings--within and between tasks--were calculated and some hypothetical models for correlations between ratings were tested. Results indicated that performances on two oral tasks were rated on the four  dimensions in a meaningful way. Performances on the other tasks were rated in such a way that only reference and articulacy were meaningfully differentiated. Furthermore, ratings on articulacy correlated highly between tasks, whereas ratings on reference correlated relatively weakly between tasks.

The written correspondence between two young scholars, Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy (a Christian) and Franz Rosenzweig (a Jew), written from their respective situations in the German army during World War I, proves to be a robust, loving, fertile dialogue between personal friends whose theological positions have often been characterized as mutually antagonistic. As a personal scholarly enterprise of inquiry, correction, and encouragement this correspondence reflects elusive yet promising tendencies as an enterprise of human interaction and reveals  persons in process more than positions in conflict. Two themes support this thesis--the first theme shows a high degree of investment of each person with the other, which nourishes and strains the dialogue. This investment is manifested not only in the backgrounds of the person and the situation of the correspondence, but also in specific features of the letters. A second theme develops around the structural variety of the letters. The results of this critical dialogue can help in understanding the arguing process. For the two writers, instead of its being a &quot;place to stand,&quot; it became a way to dwell together. (Fifty-nine notes are included.) (MS)",

The use of bilingual interpreters, when applied correctly, enhances applied interpersonal communication in this cross-cultural context. Analysis of the interrogation situation evidences the need for interpersonal sensitivity by the interrogator. There are verbal and nonverbal communication elements which are central to a successful interrogation using an interpreter. A primary verbal concern deals with the approach used by the interpreter to convey interrogator statements. Nonverbal concerns deal with vocalic (tone of voice, inflection, and intent), proxemic (the physical arrangement of the three  individuals), eye contact, and kinesic (body movements) considerations. The interpreter needs to serve as a bridge of understanding, verbally and nonverbally, between the interrogator and source. (MM)",

The early tradition of the rhetoric of music focuses on music as a persuasive medium, deriving rhetorical value from the way discourse affects audiences. However, an equally compelling case can be made for music as mimetic discourse, deriving rhetorical value from the way music reflects audiences, and examining the relationship between substance and audience. Fantasy theme analysis presents a description of rhetorical transaction which offers insight into the relationships between the content of public expression and the visions people share. Popular songs express personal  fantasies which have gone public. Audiences who accept popular songs find in them psychodynamic common ground which bonds participants into a rhetorical community. Song texts provide an excellent means for the investigation of the psychological processes of the people who share a culture. (Thirty-seven notes are included.) (SR)",

        "description":"Although research on argumentativeness appears to confirm the centuries-old &quot;commonsense knowledge&quot; that successful arguers enjoy arguing and are adept at remaining &quot;cool and rational&quot; during an argument, the empirical research itself is based on normative assumptions that underlie this Cartesian &quot;commonsense knowledge.&quot; Normative judgments have informed the direction of inquiry and the results of descriptive research, which in turn support and extend the original normative judgments. An analysis of the conceptualization and research on argumentativeness reveals the following normative and pedagogical implications: (1) the success or failure of argumentation lies in the perception of the arguer; (2) argumentativeness apparently is a learned skill as well as a trait; (3) high  trait argumentativeness is desirable in that it is correlated with many positive attributes such as flexibility, interest, expertise, dynamism, willingness to argue, and argumentative skill; (4) high trait argumentativeness has only a few undesirable correlations such as verbosity and possibly limited desirability and effectiveness in nonargumentative situations (although research has not yet investigated this line of inquiry); and (5) high argumentativeness is associated with people having a masculine (instrumental) sex-role orientation. Yet analysis reveals that these implications were implicitly present in the choice of basing argumentativeness research on traditional rather than contemporary argumentation theory. It is important to question these underlying normative/pedagogical  assumptions in order to continue inquiry with the most reasonable and acceptable normative assumptions available.

These two images have contributed to a continued pattern of underrepresentation for women in school administration. The paper argues that it is not part of the nature of things that men should manage while women teach in the schools--rather this division of labor in schools has developed over time through social negotiation and conflict. Clarification of some of the elements of that negotiation and conflict will help to understand more clearly how cultural factors can inhibit and foster change and how the images of  women as schoolmarms and tokens have functioned to maintain patriarchal traditions in school culture in the past. A number of initiatives indicate that Canadian schools are entering a period ripe with potential for changes in regard to men's and women's roles in schools. Presently some provinces have begun pay equity legislation. In other places government funding is fostering employment equity policies and programs. However, sufficient recognition of the power of cultural images and the need to understand the social processes whereby such images can be changed are necessary for boys and girls to learn how to recreate their roles in new and powerful ways which could be beneficial to society.

The DSSM can be used for both informative and persuasive speaking, and can be adapted and used in different contexts. For example, the educational system in the People's Republic of China does not emphasize creativity and independent thinking nearly as much as does the American educational system. However, the DSSM was used effectively at Northern Jiaotong University, a school emphasizing technical education. The  primary modification in this situation involved more lengthy explanations for each step of the process and what students needed to do to meet the speech objectives. This approach was especially developmental as it not only provided direction for effective speechmaking, but it also helped students develop their application of original ideas. (MM)",

        "description":"This paper investigates the reasons why teachers change school districts by examining teacher characteristics and school districts as predictors of district change. The data set traces the careers of Michigan public school teachers during the 1970s. The study is restricted to districts with stable or expanding enrollments to ensure that the job changes are voluntary and not driven by layoffs. The regression models used are built on a discrete-time maximum likelihood method. Results show that a teacher's probability of changing districts increases during the first two years of teaching, then steadily decreases. Also, older teachers move less than younger ones, men move less than women, and blacks change districts more than whites. Teachers in special education and departmentalized  secondary school subjects appeared to have more opportunities for job changes than other teachers. Perhaps the most important findings pertain to district characteristics as predictors. These variables suggest areas where policymakers can focus their efforts to keep schools adequately supplied with teachers as future enrollments increase. Teachers are more likely to leave districts that are small, have large numbers of low socioeconomic status (SES) students, or provide low annual salary increments. There is evidence that high annual salary increments can be used to retain teachers in low SES districts. Included are 13 endnotes. (Author/MLH)",

        "description":"During the 1970s, evaluation researchers realized that adoption of a curricular innovation does not ensure its implementation. This paper asks which strategies of educational policy and external support are relevant for implementing curricular innovations, particularly in the Netherlands. The first three sections discuss why and for whom implementation is a problem and describe policy instruments and support functions. Following this, section 4 summarizes available research regarding the actual effect of policy and support on implementation. In practice, policy goals are seldom carried out according to the crucial imperatives suggested in the literature. Such goals are seldom based on teachers' own knowledge concerning the need for curricular change and often lack implementation  guidelines. Implementation is in the hands of noninfluential lower- and middle-level government officials who lack systematic control over financial and external support. Section 5 outlines the Dutch education system, which is predominantly pluralistic, decentralized, and autonomous regarding teacher appointments and textbook choices. The dissemination and implementation of innovations and curricula is a perennial problem. Section 6 summarizes study results concerning implementing the Netherlands' new primary curriculum during 1975-1988. Section 7 offers conclusions concerning implementation weaknesses (particularly involving enforcement), and section 8 recommends new research directions.

        "description":"Despite growing interest in the use of anthropological or cultural research models, these approaches are not commonly understood by the higher education community. Because anthropological research differs significantly from other techniques, this paper first explains the rationale for using anthropological models to study higher education and defines a cultural approach. The paper then discusses how interpretive research diverges from the objectivist approach. Whereas an interpretive view sees organizations as social constructions formed by the interactions of their history, context, and participants' influences, an objectivist perspective assumes that organizations exist as rational entities created by individuals to support the common pursuit of specified goals. The  interviewer/observer's role in data collection, the interview process, and the presentation of data are discussed at length. Generally, the interpretive interviewers admit their subjectivity, do not set out to prove hypotheses, and assume that all knowledge, all inquiry, is value-based and ideological. Interpretive interviewers generally use open-ended or multiple interview formats and employ other instruments (participant observation, historical analyses, recording of spatial and nonverbal communication clues). When presenting data, interpretive researchers try to involve the reader more freely in summarizing and interpreting results. The idea is to provide readers with a vicarious experience of being there. Included are 39 references. (MLH)",

        "description":"The drive for improved school and classroom climate, for increased teacher and student involvement in decision-making, and for more positive teacher and student expectations are becoming prime areas for joint educational and behavioral science efforts. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a year-long classroom social competence training program (PI/PSP: Enhancing Classroom Climate through Pupil Involvement and Problem Solving with People) functioning as part of a larger Quality of School Life program to advance these goals. The program examines elementary classrooms' ability to use an eight-step problem-solving sequence and reach consensus on effective action plans. Subjects included 8 classrooms that participated in the 21-lesson program and 8 classrooms that did not. All  classrooms were evaluated at pre- and post-intervention via videotaped problem-solving sessions coded for ability to meet certain goals. Following training, program classes were significantly better than comparison classes at identifying a relevant main problem, focusing on appropriate means and ends, and reaching consensus on effective action plans. In contrast to comparison classes, program classes generated more effective solutions and fewer static responses and were rated higher on several decision-making climate indices. Results are discussed in terms of the implications of a year-long pupil involvement social competency training program. Included are 6 tables, 3 appendices, and 34 references. (Author/MLH)",

The guide aims to help schools, districts, and other educational organizations examine their leadership effectiveness. While principals are stressed, some information is provided about teachers, students, and superintendents. Intended for use by practitioners, the guide briefly discusses leadership assessment issues, reviews over 40 assessment tools, and discusses the importance of examining school leadership. It next explores definitional and measurement issues, comments on the current state-of-the-art, and explains how to select a leadership measure. Of the 15 published instruments reviewed, only four were developed  specifically for use in education. Almost all the research, undocumented, and state instruments focus on educational settings. Most of the general business instruments focus on leadership styles, while education instruments stress specific skills, behaviors, and traits viewed as important for principals. Most instruments are self-report surveys designed for self-assessment or training sessions and are easy to use. Appendix A contains 13 long and 2 short reviews of all published instruments and commercially available procedures. Appendix B provides 11 short reviews of research instruments. Appendix C briefly reviews 11 instruments lacking supporting technical information. Three additional appendices provide an outline of state activities and resources, a summary table of leadership  instruments, and a checklist for selecting a leadership measure.

        "description":"This document outlines a practical teacher evaluation system that avoids the fatal invalidities of present methods. The recommended approach treats teachers as responsible professionals undertaking to perform certain duties while retaining considerable autonomy in discharging them. While teachers acknowledge a need for accountability and systematic professional development, they also deserve full protection against the use of an arbitrary, invalid, unjust, or noninformative system. The discussion first explains why commonly used approaches are invalid, highlighting teaching as a profession, the limits of negotiation (or political compromise), administrator accountability, the lack of serious administrator evaluation systems, professional development connections, summative  evaluation versus development support, and the need for a comprehensive evaluation system. The paper then shows the underlying fallacies of research- and judgment-based tests and of management-by-objectives approaches. The duties-based model is presented as a valid alternative that divides teacher merit into four major categories and considers a teacher's worth to the district. Finally, an exhaustive list of minimally required teachers' duties is presented and the new rules and sources of evidence explained. The inclusion of student test data, the teacher portfolio containing self-evaluations and personal development plans, and &quot;footprint&quot; data (exit interviews with graduating seniors) more fully depict a given teacher's contribution.

This report recommends that policymakers review existing communcation channels between public educators and home schooling parents.

        "author":["Bishop, John"],
        "description":"Since about half of all youth neither complete high school nor opt to go to college, schools need to decide what form of occupationally specific education and training (if any) should be offered these youth. This paper first provides a literature review organized around several questions concerning: (1) the economic benefits of occupationally specific education; (2) the number of youth getting training-related jobs; (3) reasons why the occupationally specific skills learned are not used on the job; (4) whether vocational education generates noneconomic benefits or lowers dropout rates; (5) substitution of basic skills for occupational skills; and (6) whether higher rates of skill obsolescence have drastically lowered the payoff to occupationally specific training. Research  clearly implies that occupationally specific education very positively influences labor market success when training-related jobs are obtained. If jobs are unrelated to training, high school graduates receive no economic or noneconomic benefits from their vocational education. Part II of this paper discusses policy implications for high school vocational education. Although some opinion leaders want job-related training to be phased out of high schools and made the responsibility of postsecondary institutions or even employers, in practice this is unfeasible. Occupational specific education offers dropout-prone students a chance to succeed at something difficult and superior to fast food restaurant work. Ways to organize and pay for this education are discussed at length, and  recommendations are made to ensure success. Included are 15 endnotes and 34 references. (MLH)",

The data were reported by state education agencies to the Center for Education Statistics (CES) through the Common Core of Data (CCD) system.

Although the number of officials and administrators increased by roughly the same amount as did teachers (4,200 to 5,800), the percentage increase was much larger for officials and administrators--2.3 percent compared with 0.3 percent for teachers. All other categories of staff personnel decreased: guidance counselors by 1.2 percent; librarians by 1.1 percent; and all other support personnel by about 2.0 percent.

However, in recent years, educational leaders in a number of countries along with policy analysts in the donor community have proposed a number of arrangements for decentralizing education. This paper draws primarily on the experience of Sri Lanka to examine the potential of several examples of educational decentralization. The first section describes the components of educational systems in Sri Lanka and discusses the availability of resources and services, and the ways these are mobilized. This is followed by a discussion of decentralizing policy options, with reference both to school level and distribution of resources and services in various developing countries. The next section reviews  the historical circumstances in the developing nations that gave rise to centralized education systems--the requirements for national competitiveness, social stability, and equality of access. Arguments for and against decentralization follow, along with a discussion of the political economy of decentralization, and of the cluster concept as an intermediate reform for coordinating programs and facilitating communication among isolated rural schools. The paper concludes with 12 recommendations to guide the decisions of educational leaders in the development of policy options. (TE)",

Accordingly, this review analyzes the historical development of apprenticeship models used in the preparation and continuing education of practitioners in medicine and law, in order to discover commonalities and differences in underlying assumptions with the field of educational administration. Topics discussed include (1) the historical relationship between apprenticeship and employee training; (2) the development and assumptions of legal education; (3) the history of medical education; and (4) the trends and issues in medical education. The subsequent section presents analogies and differences between the assumptions  governing education and training in law and medicine and those that characterize the field of educational administration.

Second, it analyzes the role of curriculum change agents in schools that are locally autonomous and have little or no external support system. This study looks at the curriculum-in-use in three neighboring British Columbia Christian schools: Agape Academy, Bethel Christian School, and Covenant Christian School. One set of questions in this study focused on the programs taught in the locally-controlled Christian schools. A second cluster of questions focused on the significant factors and change agents influencing curriculum implementation in Christian school settings. Three major factors affecting implementation  of change are highlighted: (1) how each school's environment influenced its curriculum; (2) the characteristics and behavior of change facilitators; and (3) the nature of both the old and the new programs. The goals and philosophies of these schools are also discussed. Future research needs to explore whether or how the lives of Christian school graduates differ from their public school counterparts.

First, it determined the perceptions of Alabama public school principals regarding the degree of importance and extent of implementation of 21 specific educational reform recommendations from 7 major national reform proposals issued in 1983. Second, it discovered the perceptions of these same principals regarding the overall effect of recent reform efforts on students and teachers. Third, it specified perceptual differences or similarities based on level and type of school. The researcher developed a questionnaire distributed to 250 randomly assigned principals, of whom 210 (84 percent) responded. The instrument incorporated three Likert-type scales; used frequencies to measure the percentage of responses to determine the  perceptions of principals regarding the importance, implementation, and overall effect of reform; and applied Fisher's Exact Test of Independence to categorize significant differences in the perceptions of groups of principals. Generally, the principals believed that the reforms were important for improving education; however, a sizeable minority felt that they did not have a therapeutic effect on students or teachers nor have they been widely implemented in the state.

        "description":"This paper discusses the effective restructuring of schools to accommodate at-risk children. Broadly, it addresses some issues of school structure and management for meeting the educational needs of this large and increasing group of students. Specifically, it defines and analyzes effectiveness within the accelerated schools model developed by Stanford University researchers to accelerate the academic progress of disadvantaged learners. It mentions the disadvantages that school districts face in the absence of such a model, suggests to administrators and policymakers how to shift district-based organizational decisions to school-based ones, and lists the advantages associated with this new arrangement.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to assess the present instructional program of public education and to present recommendations for changing schools that will enhance the effectiveness of instruction. The midsixties to the late seventies are described as periods of equity and reform in the areas of rights and entitlements. Beginning in the late seventies, a shift in educational policy resulted in the current generation of reforms centering around quality, productivity, efficiency, and performance. The document speculates about the themes of the next generation in the areas of changing patterns of society, community and family; the lack of engagement in learning; and the professionalism of teaching. The focus then shifts to the central problem of school effectiveness, which is the  constructing of various domains of authority and responsibility under which teachers and students operate. The domains discussed are the classroom, the school, the school within the school system, and the school system and their communities. Finally, five radical proposals that educators might pursue are outlined: (1) dramatic reductions in the scale of schools; (2) choice of the technology of instruction residing with the school; (3) choice of internal organization residing with the school; (4) choice of school by clients and educators; and (5) creation of policy &quot;free zones&quot; in which whole sets of existing regulations are waived for specific settings on conditions of performance. Appended are 10 references. (SI)",

Four potential options for integrating young children with handicaps and normally developing children are outlined, including mainstreamed educational programs, mainstreamed noneducational programs, integrated special education or reverse mainstreamed programs, and nonintegrated special education programs located in regular elementary schools. Sample programs within each option are briefly described.

        "author":["Bennett, Adrian T."],
        "description":"An ethnographic study of the intake process involving the formal assessment, placement, and educational programming of 12 Hispanic deaf/hearing impaired children, aged 3-8, in both a private school for the deaf and the New York City public schools, was conducted over a 2-year period (1984-1986). Participant observation, interviewing, and electronic recording were used to monitor the intake process which included formal assessments, case conferences, parent/teacher meetings, written reports (including Individualized Education Programs), correspondence with state education officials, as well as both home and classroom interactional settings. Gaps were found to exist between policy/legal guidelines and actual practice, especially concerning the active participation of Hispanic  parents in decision making, and the accurate assessment of the social, communicative, and educational abilities and needs of the deaf children. These gaps appeared to result from social and cultural rather than individual or psychological factors. In order to foster the provision of improved services for Hispanic families and their disabled children it is recommended that: (1) certain changes in legal guidelines and organizational structures within special education systems be explored; (2) training programs for policy makers and educators in special education systems be instituted; and (3) training and information programs for Hispanic parents be developed. (Appendices constituting over half the document provide: (1) plans for further analysis of data and dissemination of results; (2) a  description of a national survey used in the study with a summary of results; and (3) an extensive annotated bibliography for researchers and educators interested in applying the ethnographic perspective. Two resarch guides are also appended.) (Author/DB)",

Self-concept was assessed with the Student Self-Assessment Inventory: General and Visually Impaired Forms. Visually impaired students and 76 of the sighted students were tested with the inventory's oral format (with slight additional modifications for the visually impaired) while the remaining sighted students received the written format. Visually impaired students were all residents at special schools for the visually impaired. The measure evaluates student self-knowledge, self-esteem, and self-ideal in the areas of physical maturity, peer relations, academic success, and school adaptiveness. Results indicated that differences in self-concept scores  for normally sighted and visually impaired students were small and not influenced significantly by such factors as grade level, test format, or testing procedure and provided little support for the notion that visually impaired students have lower self-concepts than sighted peers. On some measures (e.g., physical maturity self-ideal) scores favored the visually impaired students. The differences that did exist between groups showed the area-specific nature of self-concept.

The naturalistic inquiry methodology involved open-ended and semi-structured interviews with the subject open-ended and semi-structured interviews with the subject special education director, other administrators, and special education teachers. Intensive field observations of the subject at work over a 3-day period were made and all special education teachers in the subject's district were surveyed. Analysis indicated that the  director's work includes two functions, management and supervision, with the director's &quot;staff office&quot; position constraining the exercise of direct control over special education services at the building level; thus the director relies primarily on &quot;expert power&quot; processes to accomplish supervision. Advantages of such an organizational system to the district include visible involvement of principals in the special education process and little conflict between principals and director. Disadvantages include the unmet need of teachers for both closer supervision by the director and stronger advocacy with principals and the unmet need of the director for more direct control of special education services at the building level.

        "description":"The training manual was developed as a result of a summer training institute held in 1986 for teachers of low-incidence populations (those made up of students with severe and multiply handicapping conditions). The institute aimed to provide teachers with the latest information and technology to assess and develop early communication skills, and the manual was written to provide teachers with a framework for developing appropriate programs. The first chapter provides an overview of communication development including the impact of a disability on communication. In Chapter 2, a sequence of assessment activities outlines the entire assessment process from start to finish. This chapter also provides information about the responsibilities of an educational team. Chapter 3 explains the  stages or levels of communication development and the components of a communicative act (content, form, and function). Chapter 4, the longest chapter, details the assessment process itself, including guidelines and specific assessment instruments. Finally, Chapter 5 presents procedures for turning specific assessment data into an Individual Educational Program. Appendixes provide a reprint of an article, \"A New Curriculum for Tommy,\" and descriptions of seven instruments currently available. (DB)",

An additional 95 students received indirect services in a program of classroom discussion and job development. Students receiving direct services spent 12-89 hours each in volunteer work experience. Formal recommendations were made for each student to the family, teacher, and adult service agencies for referral and job placement services. Additional project achievements included: (1) full- or  part-time paid job placement for 20 of the participating students; (2) cost savings to the local school district as a result of early graduation for students; (3) local vocational rehabilitation and mental retardation/developmental disabilities policy changes to provide more complete services to the severely disabled; (4) development of a formal interagency agreement for transition between the schools and adult service agencies; and (5) awareness raising at the local and state levels due to the advocacy of and information provided by project staff. Recommendations for similar projects are included, and appendixes include samples of initial and final individual transition plans and of a vocational evaluation report; an interagency agreement for transition; teacher and employer  questionnaires; a copy of the enabling legislation for the project; and a list of businesses toured and jobs tried.

Science  modifications cover areas such as the following: magnetism, light and sound, seeing and hearing, the seasons and the weather, animals, plants. Among language arts are: nursery rhymes, language usage through the writing process, biographies, leisure time reading, poetry and word play, letter writing, and oral communication expression. Social studies modifications include local history, the United States in the Twentieth Century, Canada, and the Middle Ages.

While students appreciated the opportunity to attend mainstream college classes and felt they were succeeding academically, they also experienced separation and even isolation within the mainstream class. This isolation stemmed from three major kinds of constraints, including the grouping of deaf students, the use of support services, and students' perceptions of themselves and others. In their social interactions and relationships, deaf students tended to rely on social networks of deaf peers and participate largely in deaf clubs and social activities. Their explanations for these friendship patterns included the increased opportunity  presented at RIT for meeting deaf peers, the ease and comfort of interaction with deaf students, the importance of group identification, and the negative influence of social prejudice. Interviewees perceived both themselves and hearing students as lacking the motivation to pursue relationships with each other. (Author/JDD)",

Yet, software developers often have designed elaborate graphics and unique characters in lieu of sound instructional programming. Many instructional programs for learning-disabled students do not provide appropriate reading levels, the opportunity to make decisions, logical and detailed instructional formats, correction procedures in the case of error, recordkeeping options, or imaginative programming. The following essential features should be included: immediate reinforcement of student responses, individual pacing, non-emotional input during needed repetitions, undivided attention during input, reduction of distractions, nonjudgmental responses, intrinsic motivation, and student  control as well as computer control. An evaluation screening tool is presented that can quickly and successfully determine the usefulness of a software program through examination of its instructional content, educational quality, and general quality. Suggestions are offered for encouraging software development by companies, institutions of higher education, and computer-user groups. A list of 28 software evaluation sources and directories is presented. The report concludes with a list of 69 software programs recommended for use with the learning-disabled, in the areas of microcomputer instruction; typing; quiz or lesson generators; word processing/integrated programs; cognitive, perceptual, spatial skills; mathematics; language arts and reading; and teacher utility programs.

The use of the Student Study Team is suggested in the student referral process; such teams combine regular education teachers and specialists working together to  develop an intervention plan emphasizing parent and student involvement. A detailed comparison of bilingual and special education law is presented. Specific legal requirements of California bilingual laws and special education laws are paralleled to assist in efficiently implementing the legislation. The handbook then presents administrative steps that combine two separate laws into one single procedure from the point of referral to placement. Appendices discuss: (1) methods for ascertaining legal compliance, and (2) sunset program provisions for five California special education and bilingual education programs. (JDD)",

The first section, called \"The Nature of Bilingualism,\" discusses the diversity of bilingual students and their dynamic use of two languages, focusing on simultaneous and sequential bilingual children, first language acquisition in bilingual children, language varieties, language loss, codeswitching, and cognitive development in bilingual children. The section entitled \"Second Language Development\" explores the role of primary language interference; the similarity between the processes of first and second language acquisition; the rate of second language acquisition; and the factors of age, access to  peers, cultural group membership, personality and individual strategies, motivation and attitude, and formal instruction in English as a second language. The final section, \"Language Proficiency,\" examines relative language proficiency and language dominance, presents a model of bilingual proficiency, and reviews the problems of comparably limited bilingual children.

School systems must find valid means to assess linguistic minority students and must offer instructional approaches that can facilitate growth and development. General guidelines for assessment include understanding the referral question, selecting assessment tools based upon reliability and validity, using caution in interpreting test results, employing more than one measure, and avoiding inferences not warranted by the tests. The guidelines are applicable when using such assessment tools as observations, interviews, objective personality inventories, or projectives. Sociocultural influences are likely to have a major impact on  the student's performance on intellectual assessment, on evaluations of learning disabilities, and on the measurement of socioemotional adjustment. Care must be taken so that assessment procedures accurately measure the characteristic of interest rather than sociocultural factors. Teachers can provide an educational atmosphere that enhances the growth and development of all students by understanding their own as well as their students' cultural backgrounds, by incorporating ethnically diverse teaching materials in class, and by helping parents to become actively involved in the education of their children.

Data were collected from three sources: observation of school staffing committee meetings (designed to address serious problems of referred students), 17 school personnel interviews, and 14 interviews with ninth graders, including 5 identified as LD. It was concluded that orientation activities and academic scheduling procedures were not effective in integrating students quickly into high school activities or sustaining them throughout the school year. In addition, the energy and resources expended  on problem students referred for staffing far exceeded that which was expended on incoming ninth graders before problems were reported. Further study of the high school experiences of ninth graders in relation to the dropout issue is planned. (JW)",

Data submitted annually to the Office of Special Education Programs (U.S. Department of Education) by each of the 50 states, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico provided information on numbers of handicapped students served in each of six different educational placements: regular class, resource room, separate class, separate day school, separate residential school, and home/hospital. Results indicated that approximately 6 percent of special education students were being educated in segregated day or residential schools, and an  additional 24 percent in separate classes. Rather high state-to-state variation in type of placement indicated fluctuating service patterns, even though the overall use of separate educational environments has remained relatively stable over the past decade.

        "description":"The report documents evaluation by the Office of Educational Assessment of first year (1983-84) implementation by the New York City school system of the Least Restrictive Placement Personnel Training Program. Program goals were to develop and field-test training materials for a population of approximately 700 special and general education teachers, school administrators, and clinical staff. The &quot;turn-key trainers&quot; model in which a core of volunteer teachers are trained to provide training for building colleagues was implemented. Training consisted of a sequence of individual sessions exploring themes related to the movement of handicapped students to less restrictive environments. Analysis of participant interviews and questionnaires indicated participants (N=700) had favorable  responses to the usefulness of the information presented and the opportunity to exchange and express their ideas. Recommendations for increased program effectiveness include: (1) expand the turn-key trainers model to include more target schools; (2) provide more intensive training for trainers; (3) schedule meetings after regular school hours and compensate turn-key teachers for their time.

The program objective was that 80% of the students would master 80% of their individual short-term objectives. Data analysis indicated that achievement fell slightly below the objective (78.1%). However, 72.5% of the students mastered all of their objectives and student achievement was positively correlated with attendance. Major strengths of the program were the individualized nature of activities, flexibility, and ongoing educational assessment and planning. Recommendations included: (1) continue to emphasize short-term individualized educational  objectives; (2) continue to work with agency staff regarding attendance, student problems, and site-specific issues; (3) invite representatives from a wider range of occupations to speak to students; and (4) increase the number of field trips to local businesses to expose students to the day-to-day activities of various occupations.

Barriers to linkage between and among prenatal, perinatal, followup, referral, and early intervention services were noted. The work group recommended: standardized data collection among agencies concerning indicators/predictors of poor pregnancy and developmental outcomes, feedback to health care providers who make referrals to early intervention programs, prenatal and parenting classes for expectant parents, provision of community services information to  parents prior to hospital discharge of their newborns, effective preservice and inservice training, collaboration with media to disseminate information, etc. An appendix indicates the lead agency that each state has designated for implementation of Public Law 99-457, Part H, and outlines the legislation's 14 components essential to a comprehensive system of care for children from birth to 2 years and their families.

Also investigated were the relationships among the levels of engagement employed by the elementary or junior high students and their self-perceptions of social acceptance, behavior/conduct and self-worth, and general intellectual functioning as evidenced by IQ scores. Dyads were established by matching the disabled and nondisabled subjects with same-age, same-sex nondisabled partners; dyads were asked to choose one topic from a list of five topics and discuss it for 10 minutes. Study results provide partial support for the hypothesis that the conversations of nondisabled  subjects, as compared to those of disabled subjects, exhibit a wider range of engagement levels in terms of both responsiveness and information, as well as generally higher levels of responsiveness and information overall. Although the learning-disabled subjects could and did employ engagement-producing and maintaining utterances similar in sophistication to those of their nondisabled peers, they did so less consistently and with less frequency. Possible explanations for the study's results are presented. (JDD)",

Each subject received individual criterion-based training in self-instructional strategies. Training emphasized the student's role as an active collaborator in the learning process, with responsibility for recruiting and applying strategies gradually placed upon the student. Strategies were explicitly and overtly modeled in context. Subjects' scores on one-step word problems in addition and subtraction significantly improved following training. All subjects showed that the skills were generalized across settings  and were maintained 3-5 weeks after training. Subjects were more confident of their ability to complete the word problems following training, though they had overestimated their pre-training ability. The four students and their teacher evaluated the self-instructional strategy training positively. Inspection of students' papers collected when probes were administered provided concrete evidence of post-training use of the instructed problem-solving strategy. (JDD)",

Twenty-four special education teachers and 54 regular education teachers also participated. The quantitative nature of instruction was measured by gathering data on instructional ecology and student responses. The qualitative nature of instruction was measured using an integrative rating system based on observations, teacher interviews, and student interviews. Few differences were found in how the handicapped groups of students were instructed. More often, differences found were between  handicapped and nonhandicapped students, or between regular education and special education settings. There were no differences over the entire school day in the tasks handicapped students were assigned or in the nature of their responses. Within special education settings, educable mentally retarded students' instruction was rated lower than other groups on instructional presentation, checking for student understanding, and task relevance. Considerable variability was found within categories on both quantitative and qualitative aspects of instruction, in both regular and special education. (JDD)",

        "description":"A study examined whether students of business English in a private university in Puerto Rico experienced oral communication apprehension and how it was related to their proficiency in English. Two tests were administered to 180 students: McCroskey's Personal Report of Communication Apprehension and the Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency. Results indicate no significant correlation between total English proficiency scores and communication apprehension, but some significant correlations between proficiency subtest scores and apprehension ratings. The 24 communication apprehension variables were distributed into four common factors, and cognitive and bodily responses to speech were found to account for most of the language proficiency variance. It is concluded that  students' level of communication apprehension does not affect English proficiency; further study of the oral communication apprehension construct is warranted; and anxiety may result from an individual's inability to identify behaviors and responses expected to lead to successful outcomes.

Data were drawn from audio and video recordings of internal and external communications obtained inflight and from observation and physiological indicators of stress and workload. The factors observed included the official relationship of the crew members, the physical organization of the task and setting, the organization of information available to the subjects, the social organization of the work setting, and the collaborative nature of the work. Language use aspects examined included evidence of crew hierarchy, teasing, rates of initiation of non-operationally relevant new topics by each crew member,  mitigation levels, and requests for information. Analysis of the data suggested that while there was evidence of the social hierarchy in the helicopter, the language of the speakers was not entirely predictable by their positions in that hierarchy, but reflected momentary changes in their relation to each other, dictated by changes in the task situation. Implications for other collaborative work settings were found in these results, and further research on authority negotiation in collaborative work settings was recommended. (MSE)",

Stimulus words were categorized as easy (familiar) words, expressions about ways of talking, school-related words or expressions, expressions of power or dominance, and words in common use. Responses were categorized as gender-neutral (even distribution of &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; responses and 25% &quot;both&quot; or &quot;don't know&quot; responses) or statistically significant. The results indicated that both boys and girls tended to assign positive qualities to their own sex and negative qualities to the opposite sex. This tendency was more marked among  girls.

Students are asked to volunteer their words, one at a time, to be written on the board. The words can then be categorized or used in sentences as a completion of the exercise. The benefits of this kind of exercise are that it prepares the students to go to work, alerts them to the day's topic, develops high-level cognitive skills such as analysis and synthesis, improves vocabulary and usage, allows student ideas to be supported, gives the students a degree of responsibility for their learning, and allows  them to assimilate a linguistic and cultural pattern of the English-speaking world. Follow-up activities such as poetry, debates, and mystery story writing can enhance the usefulness of the exercise.

These two constraints often diminish student motivation. An interactional, learner-centered reading comprehension course has been developed for advanced ESL students of science and technology. In this course, student interest and knowledge of a specific content area are used to create both the motivation to read and an authentic task to complete: the preparation and presentation of an oral report. The success of this approach depends on the teacher's willingness to (1) adopt a non-authoritarian  attitude and genuinely respect the student's interests, preferences, and specialized knowledge; (2) invest time and effort beyond that required by conventional teaching; (3) acknowledge ignorance of certain subjects and enjoy learning from students; and (4) work out and adhere to a detailed schedule of student conferences and presentations in advance.

Affective and cognitive concerns must be considered in the implementation of behavioral objectives in addition to recognition and respect of the target culture's values and behaviors if constructive learning is to be fostered. In such an environment, the learner takes control of his own learning after an initial period of high-degree teacher initiative. Current research indicates that differences in language aptitude result in differences in the extent to which students can acquire second language skills dependent upon active instruction, whereas motivational differences influence the extent to which the student acquires  skills to be used in communicational situations. This \"integrative\" motive to acquire a second language for purposes of interacting with the foreign language community requires a particular combination of attitudinal-motivational components to facilitate linguistic exchange, in which the focus is on linguistic production.

Students complete a project for each week of attendance in the course, and all projects relate to a local shopping center and to weekly instructional modules. Each student takes home photocopies of all of the projects completed by his class for future  reference.

It is also found to be unusual in that it sometimes subordinates traditional linguistic objectives to cultural, content, cognitive, and social learning objectives.

Similar questions were then developed and asked of preschool and early elementary children. The children either read the questions themselves or were asked them by an adult, and responded orally or by pointing to a picture on the computer screen, the database developed  for the test. Students were asked to explain their responses to validate their understanding of the questions. Characteristics of the students' interactions with the database were recorded and analyzed, and are reported. Further research on higher and lower levels of performance and refinements of the test are planned. (MSE)",

        "description":"The increased interest in FLES (Foreign Language in the Elementary Schools) programs has prompted many foreign language educators to consider the impact of program articulation on the development of a successful K-12 language program. Program articulation is the process of providing a smooth transition between foreign language classrooms, and can be viewed from two perspectives: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal articulation focuses on teaching objectives, strategies, and materials, and aims at maintaining continuity between FLES classrooms at the same level. Vertical articulation refers to the direction of the curriculum between schools and stresses that secondary schools must provide foreign language classes appropriate for those students who have experience in FLES  classrooms. Specific successful models of program articulation include that of Ferndale High School (Michigan) and Cody Elementary Academy (Michigan). Such successful programs result from ongoing communication and cooperation at all levels, and from a realistic recognition of all the issues involved. (DJD)",

        "description":"The number of limited-English proficient (LEP) students in U.S. schools has increased dramatically in recent years. One type of instructional approach that offers promise in helping LEP students develop academic competence while also developing English proficiency is sheltered English. Students in these classes are &quot;sheltered&quot; in that they do not compete academically with native English speakers since the class includes only LEP students. In sheltered English classes, the variety of teaching methods employed includes: (1) extralinguistic cues (visuals, props); (2) linguistic modifications (pauses, repetition); (3) interactive lectures; (4) cooperative learning strategies; (5) focus on central concepts rather than on details; and (6) development of reading strategies (mapping).  While sheltered English programs can be either monolingual or bilingual, English instruction is the key element in both. A model suggested by Weinhouse and Krashen describes sheltered English as a program of instruction for LEP students which consists of three components: sheltered English instruction, primary language instruction, and mainstream English instruction. Teachers for sheltered English programs are drawn from the regular teaching staff, but may also include teachers of English as a Second Language (ESL). Sheltered English programs can contain elements of three other instructional approaches: bilingual education, immersion education, and content-based instruction. A reference list is appended. (DJD)",

For each issue, the association's perspective on the problem is summarized and a recommendation is made. The recommendations are that: (1) the highest level of tax credit apply to all charitable donations to higher education institutions, not just to the largest; (2) further consideration be given to proposed limits on faculty pension plan donations; (3) the government remove the limit on the transferability of the tuition tax credit to a supporting  parent or grandparent; (4) employers be required to remit income tax deducted at source within 7 days of normal payroll dates or be compensated for the increased cost of administering the payroll deduction system on its behalf; and (5) the definition of research under the income tax legislation be amended to include research in the humanities and social sciences.

The data were collected during the first 2 years of SDSU's Assessment Program. The three reports included in this document cover surveys of students, assessing the general education requirements, and assessment and admissions. The freshman profile survey includes reasons for attending college, family background, high school background, self-perception, future events and goals, and social, political, and moral issues; the senior profile covers characteristics, level of satisfaction, student growth,  college experiences, and curriculum and issues. The section on assessing the general education core curriculum requirements focuses on methodology (areas to assess in the general core areas, objectives, methodology to accomplish the needs identified, future recommendations to meet university needs, and literature cited), and baseline data on SDSU freshmen and sophomore American College Testing Program results. The potential contribution of assessment at SDSU admissions and recommendations for future research are also reported. It is concluded that there is a need for valid, long-run assessment data at SDSU, and that it must be organized, analyzed, and evaluated in a manner that is meaningful to university planners and decision makers.

It was intended to develop a time-series/causal model for credit-hour and headcount enrollment projections at the campus, institution, and system levels to better predict University of Alaska facilities construction needs and to aid in statewide master planning, academic program planning, institution accreditation, budgeting, and estimation of tuition revenues. The report begins by describing three categories of forecasting  technique (judgmental, time-series, and causal) and outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each. It then describes the problem on which the study focuses, outlines its methodology, and presents the results and conclusions. The greater part of the report is devoted to graphs and charts representing the enrollment projections and environmental scan for the system as a whole and for each state institution.

Traditional planning models are weak in identifying environmental changes and assessing their organizational impact. The proposed approach does not lead decision makers to conclude that the uncertainty they perceive in the external environment has been reduced. It enhances their capability to deal with a changing environment by making the uncertainty they perceive explicit (via analysis and evaluation of alternative future states of an organization's environment and the source of change within it). Topics of discussion include: environmental analysis and forecasting; issue identification; environmental  scanning; structuring issues; forecasting; cross impact analysis; alternative scenarios (demonstration, driving force, and system change); policy analysis; and action plans. A case study illustrating the application to the strategic planning process of a two-year college is provided. It looks at the participants in the process (drawn from across the college's administrative and instructional staff), scanning the external environment from a variety of sources, forecasting external changes, refining the forecast, developing the cross impact model, developing alternative scenarios, conducting the policy analysis, incorporating the strategies into the college's ongoing activities, and benefits and limitations. Problems, issues, and needed research are noted. It is concluded that by using the  best available information, it is possible to anticipate plausible alternative futures and limit the number of unanticipated possibilities to the smallest possible set.

The sessions were analyzed in terms of time use (percentage of talk time for tutor and student on and off task, and silence) and questioning (frequency count for tutor and student, categorized as preparation, process or review). The results revealed a consistent pattern of tutor dominance in that: tutors talked about three times as much as students, asked about six times as many questions, devoted most of their time  presenting information, asked few questions, and provided little time for students to ask or respond to questions. Probable reasons for the students' passivity are discussed, including the safety offered by silence and passivity and the reinforcement that may be provided by the tutors. Contains 13 references.

Of the 838 students who received questionnaires, 430 (52%) responded; the final sample consisted of 294 responses. Results, which are compared  with those of the Worthen and Roaden study (1971), included the following: (1) 44% of the research assistants (RAs) were female, and 55% male, ratios that were similar to those of the graduate student pools at the universities; (2) 72% of the assistantships lasted between 4 and 12 months; (3) 81% of the RAs reported that their assistantships had been created to provide support for a research activity, and 17% gave \"training for the RA\" as the reason; (4) financial support and desire for research experience were the predominant reasons for seeking an assistantship; and (5) although RAs are involved in research activities, it does not appear that they receive complete training, and their participation in research is far less than in the 1971 study. The results are considered more  provocative than conclusive, but suggestive that assistantships may be falling below their training potential.

        "description":"State colleges and universities (SUs) are being forced by critics of higher education to reassess themselves and redirect their efforts. There is a movement to discover a simplistic and valid means of measuring excellence in higher education. Measuring student outcomes cuts through all the difficulties created by more standard attempts to find a reliable indicator of the educational effectiveness of institutions. However, the organization, funding, objectives, and directions of many SUs are ill-suited to the outcomes movement, and they react with hostility to any attempt by a state board or accrediting agency to measure their worth on a one-dimensional scale (since it seems unfair to make &quot;what students learn&quot; the basis for judging institutional quality and effectiveness). The  future may bring a compromise in which outcomes measurement becomes an important factor in the financial formula by which SUs are supported. An examination of the reasons behind the University of Louisville's reluctance to embrace the outcomes movement is presented to shed some light on the way other SUs might react to such a situation. Some of the suggestions for narrowing the gap between advocates of student outcomes assessment and those reluctant to adopt it are: successful measurement requires an atmosphere of openness and informality; multiple measures of student education must be used; and outcomes can be measured in all of the activities of an institution. It is noted that improving education is unlikely to be the road to fame for any institution. (SM)",

Included are statistical indicators of the status of higher education in a particular sector. The indicators adjust for the size of a sector where size is alternately defined as the number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) students or the number of full-time faculty. Several indicators are also adjusted for the size of the population served. Each state-level statistic is accompanied by an index that is  the percentage difference between the state statistic and the national average for the statistic. Chapter 1 presents the national data (FTE enrollments, revenues, expenditures, and degrees awarded, by type and level of institution), and Chapter 2 provides the state ranking tables (FTE enrollment, average faculty salary, revenues, expenditures and appropriations). Chapter 3 presents a statistical profile for each state. Appendix A provides information on sources of data and definition of terms, and Appendix B gives a classification of institutions by state.

The following significant aspects of the program surveyed were identified: at least one faculty member takes a leadership/coordination role for the program; the pharmacy school administration supports the program; most programs fund baccalaureate and doctoral courses from general operating funds, although outside monies contribute to postdoctoral activities; the faculty leader enlists faculty in pharmacy and other disciplines to teach courses;  freestanding 100% geriatric pharmacy courses enable students to move from basic knowledge to application; didactic courses are elective, but 30% draw 30 or more pharmacy students per year; four programs require a geriatric clerkship at the doctoral level; a variety of clinical settings are utilized; and seven programs enroll students from other health science disciplines in a geriatric pharmacy course.

It chronicles briefly the history of the lay board and the reasons for its continued use in modern institutions. Criticisms and defenses of lay trusteeship are examined, including those concerning the nature of the public interest in higher education, the contributions of boards to serving that interest, the legitimacy of trustees, and their competence to govern. The theoretical and actual responsibilities of governing boards are compared, and ways in which faculty and administrators can share authority with boards are discussed. It is concluded that senior administrators can influence a  board's work by communicating with trustees, controlling board agendas and background information, influencing the selection and development of trustees, motivating desired behavior, and establishing strong relationships with faculty and other constituents who legitimate administrative authority. Faculty influence on boards derives from boards' and administrators' desire to share authority with faculty and from faculty's own authority within the institution. (MSE)",

Changes in the patterns of master's degrees conferred, by discipline, are examined, and problems associated with the proliferation of degrees are noted. Diversity in curricular models is cited as a source of concern because it makes comparison of programs, fields, and credentials difficult. It is suggested that the master's degree may be becoming the first professional degree, reflecting contemporary society's increased interest in more utilitarian and measurable objectives. Issues in assessment of program quality are addressed, including the roles of accreditation, state oversight, and institutional self-study. Major issues in program  design are outlined, the principal one being the balance of theory and practice. Other issues include specialization and multidisciplinarity, admission and degree requirements, access and standards, and modes of instruction and delivery. Factors motivating and inhibiting change in the master's degree are examined. It is concluded that the master's degree must be approached as a class of degrees rather than as a generic model, and as a credential sought increasingly for its own merits rather than in relation to the bachelor's or doctoral degree.

It may be a formal program or an ad hoc agreement negotiated with the institution. The most common incentives include severance pay, liberalized actuarial reduction, annuity enhancements, bridging benefit payments, partial or phased retirement, and other basically nonmonetary perquisites. Most institutions offer more than one incentive. Key factors in program development include faculty's role in the planning process, consideration of institutional characteristics and history, and federal and state regulations. Although observers do not agree unanimously on the effectiveness of such programs, most evidence supports their  use. Effectiveness must be viewed from the perspectives of the needs and interests of both faculty and institution. Faculty acceptance is found to be higher than anticipated, but a possible disadvantage is the loss of valued faculty members.

Corporate education is structured similarly to collegiate instruction, facilitating transfer and student mobility and making possible a variety of cooperative efforts. Corporate programs have also opened channels of  communication between business and schools concerning educational content and methods. The growth of corporate education is a stimulus to both internal collegiate debates and public policy-making.

Information about students' learning style can help faculty become more sensitive to the differences students bring to the classroom and can guide the design of learning experiences that either match students' styles or stimulate learning in new ways. Information about learning style is also helpful in counseling and orientation and in staff utilization and development. The most pressing research needs are in the areas of (1) the learning styles of minority students and in the development of measurement instruments that take cultural attributes into account, (2) the effects of incongruence between teaching methods and students' learning styles, and (3) the  relationships between learning style, developmental stage, disciplinary perspectives, and epistemology. More effective learning can be promoted through (1) professional development activities on the application of the concept of learning styles, (2) encouragement of classroom research, especially using the concept of learning styles, (3) developing curricular experiences that help students learn to learn, and (4) in hiring faculty, considering candidates' understanding of teaching-learning practices that take into account individual differences.

        "description":"Since many senior academic administrators of colleges and universities first trained for academic careers in research and teaching, they have had minimal management training. Both academic and nonacademic officers with administrative experience find they must quickly develop the different knowledge and skills needed to manage an institution when they move into senior administrative positions. In surveys, organization and planning skills are seen by administrators as the most important, human skills are placed second, and financial management and control are ranked third. Professional development for management is accepted in business, industry, the military, and government. Although the benefits are easy to identify, value is difficult to quantify beyond anecdotal evidence. The  benefits of professional development must also be balanced against the drawbacks of participating, including career timing, obsolescence of training, costs in time and money, and the issues of selection, integration, evaluation, and feedback. However, the evidence that does exist on the benefits still outweighs the disadvantages for many administrators. Effective professional development experiences must be part of an integrated, comprehensive organizational plan that links development activities with the actual tasks and responsibilities of the job.

The central theme is that although colleges and universities are affected by trends in the external environment, they can plan, respond, act, and organize themselves to improve their stature. The report examines the dimensions of stature and then looks at the dynamics of enhancement: the coordinated actions that institutions can take beyond marketing and public relations to address forces in the environment while simultaneously educating the public about important goals, purposes, outcomes, and benefits of postsecondary education. Stature is seen as the product of an environment in which multiple forces influence the exchange of resources  between universities and different constituencies; inputs in the form of constituents' needs and expectations; attributes of organization and performance; a conversion process that transforms inputs into decision; outputs to multiple constituencies; formal and informal communication about outputs to constituencies; and feedback in the form of public perceptions of the outputs. It is concluded that institutions can enhance their stature by four strategies: strategic assessment, resource allocation, outcomes assessment, and image management. (MSE)",

The goals of the program were to identify systems that were effective in increasing student attendance and achievement, and in improving student and staff attitudes toward CAI. The program was assisted by the vendors of 10 CAI instructional systems, who placed their systems in appropriate schools and offered staff development, equipment maintenance, and support during the evaluation period. An assessment of the initial impact of each of the systems on student and staff attitudes indicated that school administrators, program coordinators, teachers,  paraprofessionals, and students were all generally positive about the systems with which they were involved, and program results suggested that consistent use of any well-structured computer programs dedicated to mathematics and/or reading remediation benefits students in need of extra help. It was recommended that further evaluations be undertaken to determine whether test scores and attendance records support participants' feelings. Descriptions of the programs at each school include detailed descriptions of the use of each of the instructional systems utilized as well as student, teacher, and administrator attitudes at each school.

Students used the lesson and completed evaluation questionnaires. The lesson was also presented to faculty, who completed evaluation questionnaires. Students found the visual images of the video lesson helped to explain the physics principles, and also found that it was helpful to be able to control the pace and review segments of the  lesson. They also found the lesson to be enjoyable. Faculty agreed that laser video technology could be used in their courses, but were concerned about the availability of videodisks for a variety of subject areas.

The following general findings common to all three sites will serve as a basis for the evaluation plan: (1) participants spoke of the enhanced opportunities for individualized instruction; (2) teachers commented on improvements in both the quality and quantity of students' writing resulting from the ACOT experience; (3) students,  administrators, and teachers spoke of the strong and positive effect of the ACOT experience on students' attitudes towards school; (4) teachers and administrators spoke of the changes in students' problem-solving abilities as a result of the ACOT experience, but had difficulty articulating the nature of the changes; (5) teachers noted dramatic increases in the amount of spontaneous peer teaching and cooperative learning; (6) changes in teachers' roles and instructional planning and goals were also noted; (7) teachers were surprised at what students were able to accomplish with the computers, and both teachers and students had grown in their feelings of confidence; and (8) both teachers and administrators spoke of the positive home-school communications brought about by the ACOT  experience. Several possibly negative findings include teacher burnout, curricular imbalance, too much emphasis on the play or fun aspect of computer learning, and feelings of deprivation after students leave the ACOT environment and return to traditional classrooms.

The conclusions are based upon a study of staff developers and teachers who took part in the Bank Street College Mathematics, Science and Technology Teacher Education project. Participants completed questionnaires designed to both evaluate the training experience and identify direct evidence of changes in teaching method. In addition, on-site evaluations, observations, and interviews were undertaken. It was found that teachers recognized and appreciated the value of the inquiry strategies during training, but that these strategies were not taken up immediately. However, observations showed that the multimedia program,&quot;The Voyage of the Mimi,&quot; which was used by the teachers, did provide opportunities to open up lessons in a positive fashion. In addition, local constraints served to inhibit transitions to new approaches planned by teachers after their training. Finally, it was found that successful implementation was more often the result of cooperative and collective growth and development than the work of one person. It was concluded that the instructional models and measures must be designed to take into account these system-wide features. (10 references) (EW)",

        "description":"TAIGA (Twente Advanced Interactive Graphic Authoring system) is a system which can be used to develop instructional software. It is written in MS-PASCAL, and runs on computers that support MS-DOS. Designed to support the production of structured software, TAIGA has a hierarchical structure of three layers, each with a specific function, and each layer is supported by an editor. Level 1 involves the structuring of course contents with a module editor; Level 2 includes the structuring of instructional interactions with an episode editor; and Level 3 provides for the specification of course contents with a text/graphics editor. The system also includes a facility that allows external programs to be incorporated into the courseware, thus permitting experienced programmers to  implement simulation and gaming courseware. TAIGA consists of four main subsystems: (1) Copro, a production subsystem which is used to create and edit the courseware; (2) Codis, the distribution subsystem which is used by students to access the courseware; (3) Comas, which is used to supervise access to other subsystems and perform elementary database functions; and (4) Coeva, which accesses the student log file produced by Codis, and produces summaries for evaluation purposes. Several utilities are also available, including Codoc, which produces a listing of the courseware. A detailed description of the functioning of the system includes examples of menu screens. Several diagrams are included as well as information on hardware requirements and how to obtain a copy of the software.  (EW)",

        "description":"Designed to provide change agents with a framework for planning and implementing successful teletraining systems, this paper discusses strategies for the introduction of sophisticated teletraining technology into corporate training programs without adversely affecting a client organization's social environment. Teletraining is defined as an integrated system for the planning, delivery, and management of corporate training programs through the use of advanced telecommunications services; such systems allow corporations to deliver interactive training from instructor-led locations to students at remote sites around the world. It is suggested that a change agent's efforts will be facilitated by: (1) knowledge of a client's training needs and how these needs are being addressed in  the client's current training environment; (2) an understanding of how teletraining differs from other innovative training delivery methods; and (3) an awareness of the educational and psychological factors that affect the implementation of a teletraining system. These factors are discussed within the framework of Hall's concerns-based adoption model. (13 references) (EW)",

It argues that the underlying pedagogical approach is to make latent knowledge manifest by using different forms of quantitative modeling: (1) simulating physical processes; (2) simulating expert problem solving, including strategies for monitoring and controlling problem solving (metacognition); (3) modeling the plans behind procedural behavior; and (4) forcing articulation of model inconsistencies through the Socratic method of instruction. Proceeding chronologically, examples of intelligent tutoring systems are described in terms of their internal knowledge representations and the evolving pedagogical  theory. It also argues that, although these programs are generally only research projects, examples of what they can do make abundantly clear the long term scientific and software-engineering advantages of the new modelling methodology.

Six areas crucial to dealing with a changing academic library environment are analyzed as they relate to internal and external change factors. These factors, which focus on meeting the information needs of users for a new century, include: (1) the need to identify the requirements of the new information technology age; (2) an assessment of user needs for the information age; (3) an analysis of human resources; (4) how the administration perceives library change and its relationship to the mission of the institution; (5) need for additional training and/or education for librarians and staff; and (6) availability of financial resources needed to adopt and adapt to changes in  information technology that will best meet the needs of users. Models are used to explore changing roles for librarians, expanded programs and services to a broader scope of users, increased use of performance measures, and the need for staff to improve personal and professional skills. Appended are an organizational chart of the library and diagrams of two of the models discussed in the paper. (16 footnotes and 8 references) (CGD)",

Questionnaires were sent to 846 public libraries; the response rate to the survey was 98%. The sample included 540 main and 306 branch libraries, and data were collected from individual library buildings rather than from library systems. Survey items included: (1) availability of young adult sections in libraries and kinds of materials they contain; (2) staff resources for young adults; (3) availability and use of library services for young adults; (4) amount of library cooperation with schools and other youth-serving organizations; and (5) perceived barriers to  increased use of the library by this age group. The key findings included: (1) one out of every four public library patrons in 1986-87 was a young adult; (2) only 11% of U.S. public libraries have a young adult librarian; (3) 84% of the libraries offer a section or collection of materials specially designated for young adults, and in 74% of these libraries, the young adult materials were moderately or heavily used; (4) libraries with a young adult librarian are more apt to report moderate or heavy use of library services by young adults; and (5) in libraries without a young adult librarian, this group is primarily served by generalists. Findings are summarized in 15 tables, and a copy of the questionnaire is attached. (CGD)",

        "description":"This report discusses an ex post facto study that was done to examine the effect that the implementation of automated systems has had on libraries and support staff, labor costs, and productivity in the cataloging divisions of the library of the University of British Columbia. A comparison was made between two years: 1973, a pre-automated period when a comprehensive set of job descriptions for library positions had been written; and 1986, when an in-house automated cataloging system was in place. A discussion of certain assumptions and limitations that apply to the study is followed by an extensive review of the related literature. The experience of the library's cataloging divisions with automation is then reviewed in an attempt to answer seven research questions. Data required  for the study were obtained from library and personnel department records. Analyses of these data indicated that automation in this library had the following effects: (1) an increase in the number of librarians; (2) a decrease in the number of support staff; (3) an increase in the ratio of librarians to support staff; (4) changes in duties and responsibilities of librarians and support staff; (5) apparently reduced labor costs; and (6) increased productivity. Appendixes contain organization diagrams for 1973 and 1986 as well as 12 tables displaying the results of the data analyses. (51 references) (CGD)",

Data were gathered by manual searches of library-oriented indexes and a computerized search of ERIC using the PROBE retrieval program. The published literature for the target dates included 61 items, of which 20 focused primarily on doctoral programs, 21 on doctoral dissertations, and only one on doctoral graduates; seven reported on both doctoral programs and dissertations, three on doctoral programs and graduates, and one on doctoral dissertations and graduates;  and seven examined all three areas. Publications on doctoral programs are analyzed in terms of admissions, courses, competencies, degrees, examinations, committees, faculty, recruitment, objectives, history, ranking, contribution to the profession, and issues and problems. Analyses of doctoral theses focus on statistical data, subject/topic, methodology, length of time to complete, published format, citation patterns, value/importance, shortcomings, and bibliographies/lists. Data on doctoral graduates are discussed in terms of socioeconomic factors, educational background, position held, prior professional experience, salaries, professional membership, and publications. Appendixes include a table of categories of doctoral programs, theses and graduates and a list of bibliographies of  library/information science dissertations. (77 references) (EW)",

        "description":"This report presents the results of two surveys undertaken at the University of Rhode Island (URI) Libraries over a 2-year time period, one addressed to URI library student employees, and the other to their supervisors. Of the 171 students and 20 staff supervisors who received questionnaires, 144 students (84.21%) and 19 supervisors (95%) responded. The questionnaires sought information on: (1) who the typical student employees are; (2) the conditions of their employment as perceived by the students themselves and the staff who hire, supervise, and train them; (3) whether this sizeable workforce is being utilized effectively; and (4) whether any questions posed or conclusions drawn from the URI library student employee experience can be applied universally to similar situations  in other academic libraries. Staff members were asked specifically about the initial hiring of student employees; their training and supervision; their retention; and benefits/disadvantages of student workers. The results of the two surveys are summarized and compared with the results of previous studies reported in the literature. It is concluded that academic libraries, rather than mismanaging the student workforce as reported in most of the literature, are investing the optimum amount of resources necessary to assure the continued effective and efficient functioning of the institution. Appended are copies of student and staff questionnaires; a student performance evaluation form; and a memorandum to student library employees. (9 references) (CGD)",

The next section describes Rural AGE, highlighting the following activities: (1) community college gerontology teams were formed to serve as links between the  staff at KSU and the community colleges and to develop courses and curricula; (2) five conferences were held to monitor progress, disseminate project materials, and permit face-to-face contact between participants; (3) community college teams were encouraged to attend gerontological conferences to consult with other professionals in the field; (4) $500 awards were provided for purchasing course and curriculum materials; (5) annual site visits were conducted; (6) six of the community colleges held mini-conferences; (7) a guide, \"Developing Gerontological Curricula: A Process for Success,\" was prepared; (8) information about the project was disseminated in newsletters and conference presentations; and (9) the project was evaluated. Next, project results are enumerated for each year of the  project, indicating that at least 35 courses serving 1,887 learners are now offered on a repeated basis at the colleges.

In addition, this chapter offers a brief history of the college and a description of its administrative and instructional structures. Chapter II presents a statistical portrait of Vanier's employees, including employment figures for top administrators (cadres), lower-level management positions (gerants), non-teaching professionals, faculty, and  support staff. The chapter concludes by identifying the employment categories and disciplines in which women were concentrated. After chapter III identifies the jobs in which women were underrepresented at Vanier, based on the availability of qualified women in the labor force, chapter IV describes the college's policies and practices with respect to recruitment and selection, employment and salary classifications, employee training and professional development, evaluation, promotion, working conditions and employee benefits, and personnel planning. Chapter V presents study findings concerning the perceptions and recommendations of Vanier's faculty and staff with regard to these policies and practices. Finally, chapter V presents a series of recommendations for Vanier's affirmative action  program. (AAZC)",

All full- and part-time PVCC faculty were asked to complete a survey form for each course they taught, indicating to what degree each of 22 general education objectives was covered in the course, whether the objectives were unclear, and whether the objectives were appropriate to the course. Study findings, based on a 63% response rate from the full-time faculty, included the following: (1) few instructors indicated that any of the objectives were unclear to them; (2) there seemed to be general agreement that the objectives  were appropriate to the courses taught, but faculty for 88 classes felt that the objective \"to develop an appreciation for the arts\" was inappropriate, \"to sharpen all senses and learn to make aesthetic judgements\" was inappropriate for 73 classes, and \"to develop the body, through physical education, testing its limits and learning new skills, in order to bring mind and body into a graceful and harmonious unity\" was inappropriate for 148 classes; (3) social science and humanities courses tended to cover the objectives most completely, though health technology courses had the second highest level of coverage; and (4) there were no major differences in the coverage of the objectives between full-time and part-time faculty.

Questionnaires were distributed to mathematics chairs at 950 two-year colleges nationwide, requesting information on the department's hiring history and practices, the characteristics of faculty members who had left the college recently, qualifications for adjunct faculty, opinions concerning the existence of a shortage of qualified faculty, effects of hiring increasing proportions of part-time faculty, the educational background of current faculty, the most important areas of preparation for faculty, and professional development needs. Study findings,  based on responses from 200 department heads, included the following: (1) the number of mathematics faculty employed in two-year colleges between fall 1984 and 1985 remained generally stable, although there was a slight increase in the number of full-time faculty; (2) although colleges did not report any severe difficulties in finding qualified individuals for their full-time positions, respondents perceived no surplus of candidates; and (3) data and opinion seemed to indicate that there was a shortage of qualified part-time personnel, and many colleges were opting to hire less than qualified applicants for some positions.

        "description":"Within the context of trends in minority student education, this paper urges community colleges and historically black colleges and universities to cooperatively encourage the enrollment, retention, graduation, and continuing education of black students. First, the paper points to such alarming trends as a sharp decline in the number of associate degrees awarded to black students, declining enrollments in historically black colleges and increasing enrollments of blacks at community colleges, and high dropout rates among black community college students. Next, the paper describes a study conducted at Florida Community College at Jacksonville (FCCJ) and Edward Waters College (EWC) to determine influences on students' choice of college and FCCJ students' plans for transfer. The  study found that cost and location were major factors in college choice, and that most FCCJ students were not considering EWC or any other black college as a transfer institution. Next, the paper describes the articulation agreement that was initiated in May 1987 between FCCJ and EWC, whereby FCCJ's general education core curriculum is recognized as the basis for the acceptance of transfer students at EWC. The final sections examine other articulation plans between historically black colleges and universities and community colleges, including the agreement between Cuyahoga Community College and Wilberforce University in Ohio, and between Tidewater Community College and Norfolk State University in Virginia. Recommendations for further development of FCCJ and EWC's articulation plan  conclude the paper. (AJL)",

As the end of the century approaches, these needs and the challenge to build and strengthen community life represent great challenges for community colleges. By the year 2010: (1) students of color will make up a large percentage of the two-year college population; (2) colleges will increasingly become involved in community affairs; (3) colleges will not only enroll more students of color, but will assure that they are empowered for success; (4) students will be carefully oriented to the college setting; (5) increasing priority will be given to the development and employment of top quality  faculty, and to increasing the number of role models, faculty and administrators who are Black, Hispanic, and Asian; (6) the top curriculum priority will be language and the development of communication skills; (7) core curricula will be developed; and (8) every state will have developed coherent collegiate student transfer agreements, coordinated academic calendars, common course numbering, and sequential curriculum planning.

Using a research model developed specifically for use by public rural community colleges, the study drew upon data compiled from college records, local government sources, as well as from a survey of CCC students, staff, and faculty. Questionnaires, soliciting information on demographic characteristics and expenditure patterns, were distributed to all full- and part-time faculty and staff and a random sample of day and evening students. Study findings, based on available data and survey responses from 215 faculty/staff members (a 56% response rate) and 724 students (a 28% response rate), included the following: (1) CCC generated a total business  volume in the surrounding communities of $55,213,335 for 1986-87; (2) while local property taxes paid in support of the college totaled $7,003,052 in 1986-87, personal income to local individuals in the communities resulting from college-related jobs and business activity was $75,951,900; (3) 4,241 local jobs were attributable to the presence of CCC; (4) the value of durable goods purchased with income from college-related jobs and business activity was $9,873,747; (5) college-related deposits in local banks contributed $7,482,192 to the local credit base; (6) the value of local business property committed to college-related business was $8,649,581, and the property taxes paid on that local business property totalled $3,248,830; and (7) 83% of the college's expenditures were spent  locally.

        "description":"In fall 1987, a study was conducted at Central Community College (CCC) to investigate patterns in student course withdrawals at the college's three campuses. At CCC, students may enroll in a \"whole\" course (i.e., all credits represented by one listing on the schedule) or in one or more parts of the course by individual units. For example, enrolling in Accounting 101.0 is equal to enrolling in Accounting 101.1, 101.2, and 101.3, each of which may be completed separately. The fall term resulted in 1,398 whole courses, and an additional 2,311 courses were offered as individual units. Study findings included the following: (1) by the end of the term, all students in 549 courses had withdrawn; (2) 3,194 withdrawals from 1,417 courses were recorded, representing the loss of 4933.5  credits; (3) 1,292 students withdrew from at least one course, including 905 students who had received some type of financial aid; (4) 48.06% (N=621) of the students enrolled at the Hastings campus withdrew from at least one class; (5) the Hastings campus offered seven courses that had 20 or more withdrawals; (6) 166 students withdrew from college altogether; (7) of the students who withdrew from at least one course, 962 or 73% re-enrolled for the spring semester; and (8) the returning students re-enrolled in 30.3% of the courses they dropped in fall.

        "description":"Though bound by a number of political, economic, and institutional constraints on options for staff development, Niagara College (Ontario) made a commitment to design a formal human resource development strategy to meet the needs of all college staff through the 1990s. In 1982, a Human Resource Development Committee was mandated to assess current practices and policies, develop an in-house training system for employee development, identify new sources for staff development, and prepare training materials. As a first step, the committee began to assess the &quot;knowns and unknowns&quot; of human resource development at Niagara. Three study groups were formed to survey the needs of different staff groups. Data from the surveys, recommendations, and a demographic profile of the staff were  organized into briefs related to major committee agenda items. As cohesiveness and momentum developed, the committee established a problem-solving process which included information review, identification of relevant internal and external parameters, formative design, drafting and editing. One of the most difficult challenges was the creation of a guiding Statement of Human Resource Development, supported by an infrastructure of policies and procedures that became known as the Niagara College Human Resource Development Portfolio. A second pivotal step in the developmental phase was the conceptualization and acceptance of a career development model that categorized the human resource development needs of staff members in terms of different career phases, and developed policies and  opportunities related to each phase. Though the system was formally adopted in 1986, the college still has administrative and financial barriers to overcome in demonstrating institutional commitment to the system and implementing it fully.

        "description":"In 1987, a study was conducted to develop a profile of high school students who were currently enrolled in advanced placement, accelerated, or honors coursework in Utah, based on data reported by students who registered to take the American College Testing (ACT) Program exam. ACT responses obtained from 13,605 of the 20,930 students who graduated from Utah high schools in 1987 indicated that 59.7% of the responding students were enrolled in an advanced program. The ACT scores of these students were considerably above those of students who were not enrolled in advanced coursework (20.9 versus 15.6). The advanced students also had higher grade point averages, expressed more satisfaction with their educational experience, and were more apt to choose an out-of-state college than  other college-bound students taking the ACT. For several years, Snow College has responded to the need for high school cooperation by providing concurrent enrollment opportunities for academically able high school students. In response to the difficulties experienced by its small, rural feeder high schools in developing advanced programs, the college offers appropriate courses on the high school campus as part of the daytime curriculum. Course registration results in the establishment of a college transcript, and course completion earns college credit applicable toward degree programs. Snow College's newly revised guidelines for its College Level Program are included in the report, explaining the nature and rationale for the program, general regulations, and criteria for the selection of  students.

        "description":"Most people do not associate community colleges with the terms \"scholarship\" and \"research.\" One reason is that the mission statements of community colleges rarely include these terms when discussing teaching excellence. Another is that most people within higher education still hold the antiquated view that scholarship is simply research leading to publication. Other efforts such as addressing professional audiences at regional or national meetings, designing and conducting workshops and symposia, and preparing articles for respected professional journals are neither noted nor appreciated. If a broader view of academic scholarship were generally accepted, encompassing professional activity, artistic endeavor, engagement with novel ideas, community service, pedagogy, and research  and publication, it would be more widely recognized that scholarship takes place at community colleges. Scholars at community colleges tend to be among the most devoted of the institution's instructors, for they make time for research while teaching a heavy course load, and are often not financially supported for their research by the institution. To encourage scholarly activities, the New Jersey Department of Higher Education recently sponsored a statewide conference to showcase two-year college scholarship. If scholarly activity is to prosper, community colleges must begin to value and stimulate scholarship from their faculty. (AJL)",

First, introductory material discusses the concomitant problems of decreasing state appropriations and increasing student enrollments and community demands; summarizes legislation related to district enlargement, expansion, extension, and annexation; and reviews the charge to and activities of the Advisory Committee on Annexation. Next, the report analyzes various options to improve the annexation code, including the adoption or modification of: (1) state mandated service  areas; (2) a statewide ad valorem tax; (3) chargeback systems; (4) uniform out-of-district fees; (5) a policy to expand districts to include all state property in a college tax district; and (6) a revised code. Both advantages and disadvantages are explored for each option. Next, 10 changes to the current education code are recommended, and a discussion and rationale are offered for proposals related to service areas, annexation, disannexation, and enrollment caps.

Following introductory arguments that the secret of retention is in the development of communities committed to education rather than retention, the paper discusses several major causes of student attrition, including academic difficulty, problems in adjusting to college life, lack of clearly defined goals, uncertainty about career aspirations, and unwillingness to make academic commitments. Special attention is paid to the relationship between persistence and experiences that tend to integrate the individual into the college community, the incongruence between what the individual needs and the college provides, and student isolation. The next section  underscores the need for institutional assessment as a beginning step in the formulation of an effective retention program. Next, features of effective retention programs are identified, including: (1) an emphasis on the communal nature of college life; (2) a commitment to students; (3) a commitment to education; and (4) clarity of educational mission. The final sections consider limitations on institutional action and issues related to resource allocation. (AJL)",

Following a summary of college goals, anticipated program changes, enrollment projections, and needs in student services, the introduction describes the planning process undertaken by the community college system and its results. The next section describes the environment in which the community colleges function, focusing on changes in economic and employment structures, the labor force, technology, population demographics, family structures, and public attitudes regarding equal educational opportunity, the social welfare system, the quality and effectiveness of  education, and literacy. The implications of these trends for the colleges are also discussed. The next section states the mission and goals of the community colleges with respect to transfer education, changing workforce needs, literacy education, educational quality, and college opportunities. After identifying goals and anticipating changes related to enrollment, programs, and budget, the report offers summary planning statements for each of the 27 colleges in the state system, focusing on environmental influences, educational needs, and priorities.

        "description":"In light of growing concern for the measurement of educational effectiveness, this paper advocates institutional research at the community college level in California's community colleges to answer crucial questions concerning students, programs, and communities and urges trustees and administrators to use research results to inform decision making and policy formation. Sections I and II discuss increasing demands for accountability, point to external and internal benefits of institutional research, and identify questions concerning student and institutional success that community colleges must be able to answer. Section III underscores the value of research to trustees in making informed policy decisions. Section IV summarizes the six areas encompassed by the institutional  research function: information systems use, program evaluation, survey design and implementation, research and analysis, research critique, and formulation of emerging issues. After section V identifies three basic ways of organizing a research office (i.e., institutional research and planning office, institutional research committee, individual or group research), section VI considers desirable qualities for an institutional researcher and for research reports. Finally, section VII discusses the need for continuing institutional research in the future. (AJL)",

The study sought to identify indicators of institutional success and appropriate measures for each indicator. Surveys conducted at the 1987 CACC Convention and the April 1988 CACC Research Conference solicited information from a total of 34 students, 95 trustees, 179 faculty members, 163 college administrators, and 91 district administrators. Study findings included the following: (1) faculty effectiveness, positive faculty/student relationships, and student satisfaction with the quality of instruction were considered the most important indicators of quality; (2) process  measures were considered more important than outcomes measures; (3) all groups rated faculty effectiveness as the most important indicator in both surveys, except the 1988 student respondents who rated student satisfaction with services as most important; and (4) measures for faculty effectiveness were identified as course retention rates, student achievement of stated course objectives, and student perceptions of faculty effectiveness.

Four intact economics classes were selected for the study; two were designated as the experimental group and two the control group. Each student completed a demographic survey and tests of reading and mathematics achievement. Microcomputer-assisted instruction was given to the experimental group, while the  control group experienced traditional lecture/discussion instruction. Significant pre-experimental differences between the control and experimental groups prevented substantive comparisons and conclusions about the effectiveness of the microcomputer-assisted instruction. Demographic variables had very low relationships to learning outcomes, while prior achievement in mathematics and reading comprehension proved to be powerful predictors of economic learning. The demographic survey instrument, the economics pre- and post-tests, the mathematics skills assessment test, and a course outline are attached. (Author/AJL)",

The study used end-of-quarter data to determine retention rates based on headcount and full-time equivalency. Rates were also calculated by full-/part-time status, freshman/sophomore status, academic program, degree goal, sex, race, age, and place of residence. Study findings, based on data for winter and spring 1983-84 through 1987-88, included the following: (1) 52.1% of the full- and part-time students enrolled in fall 1987 returned and completed the winter quarter; (2) winter-to-spring retention rates were 88.1% for full-time students and 48.6% for part-time  students; (3) sophomores returned at a slightly higher rate than freshmen (i.e., 69.4% vs. 65.5% for fall-to-winter 1987-88); (4) retention of full-time, unclassified students was higher in 1987-88 than in 1986-87; (5) retention rates for full-time black students were 15% to 20% lower than those for full-time white students; (6) place of residence did not affect retention; (7) continued enrollment among part-time students was typically correlated with enrollment in a degree program and studying on campus during the day; and (8) retention rates for programs leading to Associate of Arts degrees were similar to those for Associate of Applied Science degree programs.

The workshops were intended primarily as in-service training to help foreign language teachers: (1) improve their oral proficiency in the language they teach; (2) increase their security and confidence in speaking that language; (3) develop skills in current foreign language instructional methodologies appropriate for novice and intermediate students; (4) develop an enhanced repertoire of instructional activities and materials to encourage students' oral participation in class; (5) gain cultural information; and (6) use the computer to generate instructional materials. Recruitment activities  focused on foreign language instructors in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, foreign language consultants and program directors in other major cities in Texas, and foreign language departments in every secondary school in Texas with an enrollment of 150 or more. Registration priority was given to teachers in minority-populated schools, teachers who had never traveled to the country in which their language was spoken, and new and reassigned teachers. The project report describes the content and outcomes of the workshops, providing pre- and post-test data on the achievement of objectives. Program evaluation data are appended. (AAZC)",

When applying for the presidency of a college, the applicant should be sure to follow all directions; submit a typed, letter-perfect application; prepare a letter of application specifically for the position; pay careful attention to the profile developed for the position; avoid unexplained gaps in employment  history; list a current supervisor as a reference or explain why not; keep the letter of application concise; and be selective about applying for positions. During the interview, the applicant should refrain from criticizing his/her current president, be him/herself, be a good listener, avoid condescension, and be prepared to take the position if it is offered. Though following these suggestions will not guarantee that the applicant gets the position, they may help him/her avoid making needless errors. (AJL)",

Each phase of the project was to last 3 years. Phase One (July 1983 through June 1986) concentrated on the collection of baseline data from which possible subsequent intervention strategies would be recommended. Phase Two (July 1986 through June 1989) focuses on center-based intervention strategies. Phase Three (July 1989 through June 1992) proposes to work on the involvement of parents in center activities. Between 1983 and 1986, four data collections were carried out on a sample of pupils aged 3.5 to 6 years from 40 local preschool centers. The chosen  subjects were tested on a range of language, mathematics, cognitive and social tasks. Children attending private kindergartens were generally found to score better on most tasks, especially on the English Language Tasks. On most cognitive and mathematical tasks, the gap narrowed for the older students, although this change was not demonstrated on the English Language Tasks. The results suggest that there is a strong case for intervention in English at the pre-school level for Phase Two. (RJC)",

A total of 24 boys and girls between 3.5 and 5.5 years of age were individually required to provide both requests and refusals in a controlled context. The context provided was a negotiation session in which an aunt puppet and a child puppet (same sex as the subject) were having a disagreement and the child puppet would ask for the subject's help. Involved were four episodes that varied in two dimensions: (1) the Aunt Jenny puppet, who gave reasons, versus the Aunt Margaret puppet, who did not; and (2) suggestions for requests of the aunts versus suggestions for refusing the aunts.  Children were given the opportunity to provide second and subsequent suggestions when their first request or refusal was not successful. Main questions of interest were: (1) Do differences exist between requests and refusals? (2) What are the effects of the use of reasons by the adult party? (3) Are changes made from subject's first to subsequent responses? (4) Are there sex differences in negotiating behaviour? (5) Are there age progressions? Findings suggested an overall picture in which younger subjects did not differentiate greatly between requests and refusals whether or not the adult party provided a reason. Older children tended to use two types of requests and could increase politeness. (RH)",

Pregnant women from a low-risk and a high-risk pregnancy clinic helped to recruit their male partners into a prenatal program. The men were randomly assigned either to a control or experimental group. Interviews and measures provided data on family background, father attitudes toward infants, father perception of infants, father knowledge of when certain infant behaviors could be expected to occur, couple dyadic adjustment, father social support, and father self-image. The experimental group received two 1.5 hour sessions which provided information about the behavioral capacities of the unborn or newborn, and of infants in their first months. Fathers  were videotaped postnatally with their infants during a feeding interaction. Scores of the experimental group on posttests of their knowledge of infants were significantly higher than those of the comparison group. A list of 52 references is included. (RJC)",

Evaluations of approaches to delinquency prevention are reviewed, promising approaches are identified, and suggestions are made for applying early and continuing long-term  educational and behavioral management programs to reduce delinquency.

The data are derived from the principal and teacher surveys in the 1985-1986 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which covered a representative national sample of reading, mathematics, and science teachers of seventh-grade students from schools in all regions and types of communities in the United States. The report  finds that seventh-graders in middle schools with sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, in comparison to seventh-graders in junior high schools with seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, are somewhat more exposed to organizational structures and teaching practices that are in theory more appropriate for higher-order learning and social development.

Concluding discussion focuses on two issues: whether greater higher-order learning can be achieved without sacrificing some of the other content now covered in the  middle grade curriculum; and whether a mass education system such as the nation's middle grade schools can actually develop the staff expertise and implement the activities needed to greatly upgrade the learning environment for higher-order skills.

Six groups of variables that concern homework were examined: homework time; homework appropriateness; student attitudes; teacher practices regarding parent involvement in learning activities at home; parent abilities and resources; and other student and family background variables. Although findings seemed to be counterintuitive, they indicated that at the elementary school level, low achievement in reading and mathematics, in comparison with high achievement, is associated with more time spent doing homework, more minutes of parent help, and more  frequent requests from teachers for parent involvement. Thus the findings serve as a good example of the inadequacy of correlations to address questions of effects on students. Questions are raised about ways in which elementary school homework can be designed, with parents' help, to prepare students for the skills needed in the upper grades. (RH)",

Based on elements derived from a review of 26 recent U.S. and international empirical studies of homework, the model emphasizes the need to consider many variables in order to reach an understanding of the design and conduct of homework assignments, homework completion, and the effects of the two activities on student learning and development. Specific independent variables included in the model concern student and family background, teacher background, school organization and policy, classroom organization and classwork, and core independent variables of homework assignments by teacher, homework completion by students, and homework return and follow-up. Dependent variables concern effects on student  learning and development, and effects on teaching practice. Each variable is particularized in detail. The model is offered as a complete, realistic theoretical model that can be tested as a measurement model in new research. Variables, or subsets of variables, can be tested with cross-sectional or longitudinal data, in recursive or nonrecursive designs and analyses, and using qualitative or quantitative data to address new and needed questions about homework assignments, completion, and impact.

The analysis, which employed a social-psychological model of the early schooling process, identified some of the personal, interpersonal, and situational factors that influence cognitive development during the period of transition from home child to school child. Gains on standardized tests of verbal and mathematical competence were the achievement criteria used. Black children's lower initial report card marks and slower pace of cognitive growth indicated that they experienced more transition shock making the move into full-time schooling than did white children. The processes that determined the achievement of the two  groups were also different. Personality and temperament variables turned out to be very important for early schooling, and evidence was also found for the efficacy of parents as significant others. Self-expectations had effects only on verbal test performance, and there was no indication of peer influence during the settling-in period. Implications of these findings for models of development and for understanding the social psychological basis of achievement are discussed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This study examined one urbanized Southeastern county school district's experience in attempting to implement an educational reform program that called, among other things, for higher standards. By focusing on standardized norm-based and criterion-referenced educational tests administered to students according to grade level, this school system had: (1) been misled about the magnitude of educational improvements produced by its emphasis on high standards; (2) increased grade retention; and therefore (3) plausibly increased the risk of the school dropout and other varieties of adolescent problem behavior among the community's youths. Retention was especially extensive in grades 9 (33 percent, two-thirds of students promoted), 1 (25 percent), 10 (23 percent), and 7 (22 percent).  The percentage of students still in school who were of ninth-grade age who were actually in ninth grade or a higher grade was only 47. Because grade retention is a very potent predictor of dropout, high rates of dropout are to be expected in this district when students age beyond the compulsory school attendance age. The study also shows that precisely what one measures when holding educational institutions to high standards may determine what the institutions produce, and that what one leaves unmeasured may open the door for undesired outcomes of a reform until these outcomes become painfully obvious.

Program evaluation efforts involved the administration of sub-tests of the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills to kindergarten children and first-grade  students, and the use of locally constructed surveys of staff and reading assessments of students. The attendance criterion of 97 days was met by 156 kindergarten children and 1,118 first-graders; of these, 991 pupils received pre- and posttest administrations of the achievement test.

The ADKP was instituted in Columbus' public schools in January, 1972, to provide a full day of instruction for underachieving kindergarten pupils. The overall goal of the program was to prepare pupils for first grade by providing an extra half day of instruction to pupils needing additional help and attention. In the 1987-1988 school year, 18 teachers served in 18 Chapter 1 eligible elementary schools. Each provided daily instruction for two groups of 15 pupils. For evaluation purposes, the ADKP provided 123 days of instruction. Pupils included in the final pretest-posttest analysis attended at least 98 of those days. Data were collected in five areas: (1) pupil  census; (2) standardized achievement test scores; (3) teacher census; (4) parent involvement data; and (5) inservice evaluation. The overall normal curve equivalent (NCE) gain for the program averaged 20.3 NCE points for the 6-month treatment or 3.4 NCE points for each month of treatment. Based on the evaluation results, it was strongly recommended that the ADKP be continued in the 1988-1989 school year. Results are discussed and specific steps for improving program effectiveness are described.

Five families were selected from each of the four possible sibling pairings (e.g., older sister-younger brother, etc.). The mother, older child, and infant of each family were observed four times at approximately monthly intervals, although only data from the last three observations were reported. The behavior observed in the children was divided into three categories: direct prosocial interactions, indirect prosocial behaviors, and antisocial  interactions. Doll play or pretend play was also observed. The maternal behaviors observed were divided into direct maternal socialization of baby care or nurturant behaviors, mothers talking to the child about the baby, and gender relevant statements. The results indicated that girls demonstrated more nurturant interaction with and interest in their baby siblings than did boys. However, the observations indicated that mothers were rarely directly socializing baby care in their children, and there was no indication that daughters were socialized more than sons.

        "description":"The prevalence of subtle handicapping conditions, such as learning disabilities, behavior problems, and recurrent illness, in a population of 88 high-risk infants was investigated when the children reached 9 years of age. Infants had had birthweights of less than 1500 grams or had required prolonged mechanical ventilation in the neonatal period. When the children had their ninth birthday, the Rutter Behaviour Questionnaire (RBQ), Rutter Child Health Form, and a School Achievement Questionnaire (SAQ) were sent to parents by post. With parental permission, the RBQ and the SAQ were sent to each child's teacher. Parents of 88 children, and 70 teachers, responded to the survey. Data were descriptive and represented preliminary findings. In general, the children were found to be in  good health, although an increased risk of asthma was evident. Health was generally good, but a high percentage of children were either experiencing learning difficulties or exhibiting behavior problems. Thus the medical problems of infancy appeared to have been replaced with educational and behavioral problems in the school years. It is concluded that the perinatal, developmental, and social antecedents of these problems require further investigation. (RH)",

        "description":"A study was made of how Australian mothers feel about having their children in day care, with particular emphasis on mothers' feelings about separation from their children. A total of 10 mothers and 1 father participated in the pilot study. All but 1 parent had a child in day care at least 3 days per week. The children, who were between 4 and 22 months of age, began attending day care prior to their eighth month. Data were gathered using a structured interview consisting of 23 questions and 2 questionnaires: the Maternal Separation Anxiety Scale and the Revised Infant Temperament Questionnaire. Interviews were conducted in the family home by an interviewer who was unnaware of the expected outcomes of the study. Pilot results suggest that Australian women experience day care for  their infants as a loss, and hence show a grief reaction which needs to be expressed so that it can move toward resolution. The conflict about infant day care may be most acute for Australian mothers who do not have a financial motivation to return to work, or at least do not perceive economic factors as primary reasons for their return to work. It is concluded that these findings have policy implications for maternity leave, work-place day care services, and day care practice in general. (RH)",

Each group was stimulated by a novel test object that differed from others in visual qualities, tactual qualities, or visual and tactual qualities. Findings were inconclusive in regard to whether infants processed information about colors and temperatures of objects they explored. Experiment 2 explored ways in which infants responded when presented with an object that was a novel compound of previously experienced colors and temperature. A total of 18 children between 27 and 30  weeks of age participated in a procedure in which each infant received two familiarization trials with an object of a different color and temperature in each trial. In two test trials, experimental subjects were first exposed to a novel compound of stimulus characteristics presented during familiarization and then to a representation of a familiarization object. For control subjects, the order was reversed. No evidence was found for infant memory of visually and haptically specific object features following bimodal exploration. (RH)",

The GAO was charged with: (1) determining the current availability of work-site child care services for civilian employees at the installations; and (2) surveying employees at McClellan Air Force Base and Fort Sam Houston to determine how many would be likely to use an on-base child care center. In response to the first charge, interviews were held with officials of the Department of Defense, the military installations, and employee unions. In response to the second charge, McClellan and Fort Sam Houston civilian work forces were surveyed. The GAO also interviewed local and national child care experts and operators of work-site day  care centers, and reviewed research on child care issues. The review found that little information had been developed on the issues. Civilian employees' access to child care services at the seven installations varied. Six of the installations had child care centers for children of military personnel. Although military child care centers served children of civilian employees when space was available, military dependents had priority.

It was found that the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps had a combined capacity to serve about 62,000 children at one time at the 215 installations responding. This figure included the number of spaces available in both child development centers and family day care homes, the two programs where child care is most often provided. Department of Defense operating costs for the child development center program worldwide totaled 134.3 million dollars in fiscal year 1987. About one-third of these costs were met with congressional appropriations, and two-thirds with nonappropriated funds, such as parent user  fees. Although military child care programs have grown significantly over the past few years, installations cannnot adequately respond to all requests for center-based care from service members on active duty. Of the installations surveyed, 185 maintained lists that contained the names of about 25,000 children waiting for care.(RH)",

        "description":"Now is the time to \"retrofit\" policies and practices and reach for the goal of a just system of early education and care for all children and their families. The current social landscape of early care and education is filled with individual programs that are manifestations of disparate visions. While rich in variety, such a social landscape lacks a comprehensive vision and an integrated strategy. To construct an improved social reality, effective strategies must emanate from thoughtful visions. Such visions cannot emerge without a confrontation of pressing issues related to the pedagogy, structure and philosophy of early care and education, or without recognition of the legacy of the nation's historic approach to child and family policy. This paper identifies issues that must be  confronted in the development of early care and education policy. In its consideration of historical policy conflicts, the paper explores the consequences of crafting services in the absence of a unified vision. Also addressed are the prospects for development of a unified social strategy in view of the evident current readiness to conceptualize policy in a new and broader way. Concluding remarks cover principles for conducting inquiry and developing strategies that quash discontinuity, fragmentation, and inequity in early care and education policy and programs. (RH)",

The children were from three cultures: native French middle class, immigrant North African Moslem, and immigrant Black African. Demographic, socioeconomic, medical, biological, interpersonal, and family variables were systematically examined for possible correlational relationships with toddler language status, as assessed by licensed psychologists. Findings indicated that paternal education level and optimal mother-child relations, but not father-child relations, were significantly correlated with normal language development. Stress in the family, for fathers as well as mothers, regardless of culture group membership,  was associated with delayed or retarded child language development. Culture group membership per se was not associated with normal or impaired language development. Thus familial variables, but not cross-cultural, medical, or demographic variables, were implicated in children's language development. Supportive and educational efforts with immigrant families may not only improve their living conditions, but may also help increase language adequacy of very young children in these families.

Chapter 2 concerns selecting a problem, gathering facts, focusing a response, and preparing for action. Building support, the topic of chapter 3, is discussed in terms of encouraging parents to speak out, informing public officials, responding to legislation, influencing administrative decisions, testifying at  hearings, becoming involved in political campaigns, talking with employers, and contacting the media. In chapter 4, discussion centers on joining with others to reach goals, a topic that is explored in terms of collaboration with other groups, means of working effectively with others, and ways to reach out to the community.

At the federal, state, and local levels, schools are emerging as a focus for school-age care policy and program initiatives. This trend is a reflection of a growing pressure for more responsive schools. However, school boards are reluctant participants. Concern exists about fiscal liability if financing can't be assured. It is feared that parents will pressure the school board to fund the programs. Financing and program quality are major problems. Yet another problem of programs provided by schools is market equity. In several states, providers have sued schools on the grounds of unfair competition. Unless public  education redefines its boundaries to include child care, a two-tiered approach will continue to characterize school-based child care, with the school-age programs constituting a second tier of services that families want and schools try to provide. Issues surfacing in school-affiliated school-age care include salary differentials, staff retention, and affordability. Concluding remarks offer recommendations for state and local public school involvement in school-age child care. (RH)",

Also proposed is the development of a series of models to illustrate ways in which schools and communities can begin to redirect their resources to implement child advocacy. The Center's plans involve four major goals: (1) stimulating and guiding a national dialogue on the issues and specifics of the new concept; (2) articulating children's fundamental needs and rights and child advocacy principles; (3) delineating a series of systematic approaches, processes, and models  expressing the concept of school as child advocate; and (4) developing a community needs assessment instrument and planning handbook as a resource for communities to use in restructuring their schools to the requisites of the new role. It is believed that vigorous discussion of the issues will raise the national consciousness and lead to fundamental changes in planning for children. It is also believed that those changes will have far-reaching implications requiring systemic changes in schools as they are presently known. (RH)",

Contacts were made when children were 4- to 5-months-old (usually before the mother had resumed employment), and when children were 11-, 18-, and 36-months-old. Mothers were seen at all contacts, and children were seen at all except the contact at 11 months. At 18 and 36 months, most nonparental caregivers were also visited. Data were collected by a variety of methods, including developmental assessments of children, observations of the child at home and in the nonparental child care setting, questionnaires about child temperament and social  behavior, diaries covering children's activities for a week, and interviews with mothers and nonparental caregivers. Findings indicated a high level of discontinuity, both in mothers' employment status and in child care arrangements, during this period. Placements with relatives and childminders were more liable to change than were placements in nurseries. It is argued that discontinuity should be seen as being substantially the product of various features of social context in the United Kingdom. These features include governmental and employer policies, and dominant ideologies about parenthood and child care. (RH)",

States mentioned include Alaska, Kentucky, Arkansas, Connecticut, Maryland, California, Missouri, and Minnesota. Of these, the last two have enacted recent legislation that provides for statewide family support and education programs. Individuals have used the states' experiences to identify issues that must be addressed in the crafting of policies on family support and education programs. The experience of pioneering states  suggests that family support and education programs offer states a powerful way to build new support for families. One concern is that the impetus for government agendas regarding the welfare of young children and their families will shift before policy and action can produce programs that help families nurture children to realize their potential.

        "description":"This ERIC Digest provides an overview of school-age child care (SACC) programs and suggests reasons for their growth. Discussion points out that escalating interest in SACC has paralleled the raising numbers of children left on their own, and that educators are only the latest in a parade of civic and professional groups which have gone on record as opposing the growing phenomenon of latchkey children and supporting the expansion of child care for school-age children. While research is suggestive rather than conclusive, educators recognize that the way children spend the hours out of school has always been an important aspect of their development. High quality SACC programs provide children with a comfortable environment and a great deal of freedom to move about and choose  activities. These programs have a balanced schedule that includes child- and teacher-directed time, as well as opportunities for children to be in large or small groups or concentrate on something by themselves. Ingredients of successful SACC for older children include community service, a chance to earn money, and an understanding of the adolescent's heavy involvement in peer culture. (RH)",

Sections of the discussion focus on: (1) when and how language is learned; (2) oral language components; and (3) nurturing language development. It is argued that teachers can help sustain natural language development by providing environments full of language opportunities. General guidelines for teachers, parents, and other caregivers include: (1) understand that every child's dialect is worthy of respect as a valid system for communication; (2) treat children as if they were conversationalists, even if they are not yet talking; (3) encourage interaction among children; (4) remember that parents, caregivers, teachers, and guardians are the chief  resources in language development; and (5) continue to encourage interaction as children come to understand written language.

        "description":"During the past two decades, rural America has undergone substantial restructuring that affects both rural education and prospects for rural economic development. Rural restructuring has made rural America more economically dependent and more economically and socially diverse, has replaced relatively autonomous communities with regional units of social and economic function, and has triggered the incorporation of rural services into national systems. Prospects for growth in natural resource and goods producing industries (those that rural economies are most dependent on) are dim, but service employment will likely continue to grow. New rural development strategies should consider the job-creating potential of small business and entrepreneurship, especially in finding and filling  local &quot;niches,&quot; the importance of knowledge-based enterprise, and the need to create new networks and partnerships to support avenues of alternative development. To these ends, rural schools must provide sound basic education and train students to be innovative, to have multiple skills, and to work as members of small problem solving teams. There are also needs for continuing education, educational attention to the locality, and educational partnerships to improve both education and community development. School Based Development Enterprises have produced school-community economic development partnerships in rural areas across the country. Contains 117 references. (Author/SV)",

        "description":"This paper reviews current educational research and philosophy on effective school characteristics and discusses how to put them into practice. Prevailing beliefs among educators have advanced from &quot;there are good and poor learners&quot; to &quot;there are faster and slower learners&quot; and now to &quot;most students are similar in learning ability, rate, and motivation, when provided with favorable learning conditions.&quot; Cognitive and affective entry behaviors account for about 75% of differences in student learning outcomes. Therefore, instructional quality has little chance of overcoming the effects of entry behaviors unless the instruction takes into account cognitive or affective deficiencies. It follows that effective schooling should involve high expectations of students' performance,  instructional assignments based on continuous assessment of student learning, consideration of the role of self-concept, sharing by staff and students of responsibility for successful learning outcomes, and varied time for learning according to student needs and task complexity. The paper presents: (1) Cruickshank's listing of leadership, efficacy, and efficiency dimensions of effective schools; (2) Stutz's comparison of the &quot;model&quot; change process concepts of the 1950s with those now found to be more effective; (3) Champlin's critical factors in organizational change, and basic components of a comprehensive plan for change; and (4) necessary changes in instructional process, curriculum organization, intentional school and classroom practices, and organizational structures.

The paper calls for new solutions to rural education and economic problems, even though the problems themselves may not yet be readily apparent. He cites a rising drop-out rate, suggesting that education officials broaden their mandate and link schools more closely to economic development and the community. He suggests that schools use their resources to serve other social needs in the areas of food service for the elderly, recreation, transportation, communications, library services, job training, and career  counseling. Formal classes, traditional textbook study, the school day and school calendar are criticized as archaic. The paper notes that developments in telecommunications can totally change the concept of schooling. Leaders in educational change are asked to consider community needs and resources.

The chapters are organized into five sections. The opening chapter of section 1 emphasizes that teachers must understand and respect the cultures and backgrounds of their students, an attitude essential to a bilingual and multicultural approach to Indian education. Other chapters in this section (1) outline the historical background of Indian education; (2) discuss tribal language policies and the ingredients of a successful bilingual program; and (3) examine multicultural education goals and the value of cultural relativism for minimizing ethnocentrism and eliminating racism. Section 2 (1) describes the stages of oral  language development and the role of the first language in second language development; (2) provides practical suggestions for teaching English as a second language; (3) discusses necessary elements for reading comprehension; and (4) presents a whole-language approach to language arts. A section on teaching Indian literature discusses the inadequacies of basal reading textbooks, examines the use of storytelling in the classroom, provides a motif bibliography, and lists sources of culturally appropriate books for different grade levels. Section 4 makes specific suggestions for teaching social studies, science, mathematics, and physical education to Indian students. The final section discusses the parents' role as first teachers, a positive working relationship between parents and teachers,  theories concerning self-efficacy, and means to empower Indian students.

The guidelines, prepared by a committee of local educators appointed by a tribal business committee, examined the anticipated needs for future generations of the Sac and Fox people. The document includes a summary of current Indian education programs available to the Sac and Fox. The guidelines call for improvements in twelve areas: (1) higher education preparation; (2) scholarships and fellowships; (3) vocational training plant and services; (4) tribally controlled primary school; (5) library expansion; (6) tribal youth leadership; (7) tribal youth employment training; (8) fundamental educational training for business committee  members; (9) language/cultural retainment; (10) substance abuse program; and (11) planned parenthood (sex education). Each of these areas is broken down into goals, suggested programs of activity, guidelines and procedures to be followed, potential funding sources, and a suggested time frame for completion of the goal. There are also discussions, recommendations, and concluding remarks for each area. The document asserts that relevant educational activities and services should be imperative as the Sac and Fox tribes enter the 21st century. Recent trends in Indian education suggest that government funding for Indian education will be more limited in the years to come. This prospect means that the Sac and Fox Nation must become more active in public school education if it is to achieve  results and improve the education of its children. (TES)",

        "description":"Crime problems in rapidly growing communities have been viewed from a number of different theoretical perspectives. This paper offers a structural analysis that focuses on the density of acquaintanceship. When a small and stable rural community suddenly experiences rapid growth, one of the expected consequences can be a significant decline in the community's density of acquaintanceship, i.e., the proportion of community members who are personally acquainted with one another. Variables that affect density of acquaintanceship include community population, length of residence, anticipated length of residence, diversity, and segregation. From the structural perspective, evidence of disruption should be visible in three areas of social functioning: socialization of the young, caring  for a community's weaker members, and the control of deviance. Examination of existing studies shows that in 20 of 22 comparisons between changes in population and changes in crimes or arrests, the annual percentage increase in crimes was clearly greater than the average annual percentage increase in population. On average, crimes rise three to four times as rapidly as population, depending on the analytical approach used. The paper suggests the importance of performing similar analyses in other areas, and suggests that a structural perspective that focuses on a community's density of acquaintanceship can offer a superior explanation of the available data on rapid community growth.

        "author":["Pomedli, Michael"],
        "description":"Seventeenth century Jesuit analysis of Indian attitudes toward dreams was largely negative. While Indians looked on their dreams as ordinances and oracles, the Jesuits criticized reliance on such irrational messages. Jesuit critiques fell into three categories: the dream as a sign of diabolical possession, the dream as illusion purporting to be reality, and the dream as a form of madness. Jesuits explained native attitudes toward dreams in terms of their own European epistemology and psychology. To the extent that dreams were not part of a perceptual field, observation and judgment, the Jesuits tended to regard them as unreal. Following an examination of original Jesuit sources, this paper contends that what is offensive about Indian dreams to the Jesuit is not primarily that  they are a religious affront to belief and morality, but that their very nature calls into question the rational foundations of belief and morality. To find the basis of truth in dreams is to invert the origin of commonly accepted knowledge, thus questioning the foundations of belief and morality. As a rational critique of dreams, the Jesuit account detached them from their cultural matrix and prejudged their intent and content. Such a critique was appropriate for Jesuits who saw natives driven to fulfill the barbaric imperatives of those dreams. (DHP)",

The report studies community attitudes in relationship to age, education, social status, sex, employment, and  community size. Over one-third of the respondent group had family members who had been victims of crime within the past year. The great majority of these crimes were property-related, with 6% of the households having individuals who had fallen victim to violent crimes. The overall rate of criminal victimization was somewhat higher than reported in earlier national surveys. Crime victimization was somewhat greater in urban communities than rural communities, especially in regard to property victimization. In terms of general trends, the likelihood of being victimized was highest for people up to age 29 and declined with each successive age group. The lowest incidence of total victimization occurred in the lowest educational category and moved up with each successively higher educational  bracket, with the exception of a very minor drop between the &quot;post high school&quot; and &quot;college&quot; categories.

Section A discusses the major goals of a records management program, defines relevant terms, suggests tribal policy covering responsibility for records, and describes the life cycle of a record. Section B outlines the basic steps in setting up a records management system: (1) inventory determines what records are on hand and what purpose they serve; (2) appraisal considers the administrative, fiscal, legal, and historical value of records and sets the retention and disposition periods for each record series; and (3) the retention schedule  is a written plan for the disposal, temporary storage, or permanent retention of various records. Section C describes the establishment and use of a storage facility for inactive files and a tribal archives for permanent records, offers guidelines for defining vital records, suggests sources for copies of missing vital records, and discusses record preservation and disaster planning. Section D provides record inventory and record retention forms, as well as sample retention schedules for records of the tribal council, chairman, administration, and court, and for records concerning business, education, finances, housing, human services, personnel, and police.

The case study literature on refugees concentrates primarily on Southeast Asians. The review of the literature in this paper also concerns the economic  and social adaptation of refugees and undocumented workers. In reference to refugees, the report details 6 recommendations on the following topics: (1) English language skills; (2) use of public assistance; (3) types of services available; (4) support systems; (5) U.S. placement policy; and (6) quality of immigration statistics.

        "description":"Representatives of six Appalachian states and of various relevant constituencies identified barriers to adult participation in postsecondary education in their region and strategies for removal of those barriers. An extensive review of the literature and committee member reports and surveys suggested policy, dispositional, situational, and institutional barriers. Many barriers to adult education in general were also barriers to rural adult learners: cost, lack of child care and transportation, inflexible scheduling, lack of information, and restrictions on financial support. Major rural impediments to adult participation were the absence of a cultural appreciation of education's value, compounded by the Appalachian sense of fatalism; and poor high school preparation for  postsecondary learning. Other regional barriers included the problem of enrollment driven funding formulas in sparsely populated areas, poor roads, long commuting distances, and lack of employment opportunities upon completion. Central to all barriers was the lack of public awareness of rural issues and lack of legislative support for rural concerns. Committee members agreed that state intervention is probably essential for social equity. They recommended that an Appalachian rural education center be established to conduct research; cultivate the support of public officials; encourage local, state, and regional cooperation; and generally focus attention on and advocate for the needs of rural adult learners.

Section 1, &quot;State-level Administrative Activities,&quot; describes the role of the state migrant education office and its capabilities for monitoring, record-keeping, staff training, and data transfer. The section also discusses the Migrant Education Regional Offices (MERO), whose staffs are responsible for inservice education, coordination of state-level projects, facilitation of parent involvement, and development and distribution of materials.  Section 2 discusses the &quot;Eligible Student Population,&quot; focusing on aspects of family mobility, migration patterns, and other state demographics. The section also includes break-downs of the migrant children population in terms of living status, the time of year they attend school programs, and their ethnic background. Section 3 presents an account of the number of children who actually received instructional or support services through the migrant education program during the 1986-87 school year. It further defines the served population using characteristics described in state law. Section 4 discusses student achievement statistics. Section 5 looks at &quot;Statewide Services and Special Programs,&quot; particularly in the areas of health, special education, and preschool programs.

These national projections, based on 1982 population estimates, show what the future Spanish-origin population would be under various assumptions about fertility, mortality, and net immigration trends. Three different assumptions were made about the possible future course of each of these components of population change. Review of the assumptions yields the conclusion that these projections may be somewhat conservative with respect to the future size of the Spanish-origin population. The report suggests that the Hispanic population may double within 30 years and triple in 60, with most of the growth occurring among older  persons. It predicts that even without international migration, the Spanish-origin population may grow more quickly than most other major population groups with immigration.

The number of people living in rural areas of the United States in 1987 was 63.8 million, with about 4.9 million of these living on farms. Farm residents represented 30.2% of the total population in 1920 but by 1987, that figure had fallen to 2%. Half the farm population lived in the Midwest, with the South containing 29 percent of the population, according to the 1987 figures. There was a higher proportion  of Whites and lower proportions of Blacks and people of Hispanic origin on farms as compared with the nonfarm population. The median age of rural farm residents was 37.6 years in 1987. About 69% of farm residents age 15 or older were in the labor force in 1987, compared with 65% of the nonfarm population. Farm residents of both sexes were much more likely to be self-employed or unpaid family workers and less likely to work for wages and salaries. Money income for the year 1986 was generally lower for households and families living on farms than for those in nonfarm areas. The median income was $21,655 for farm households and $24,979 for nonfarm households.

In late 1986, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) proposed to turn over all BIA schools to the states, if affected tribes refused to contract for their operation. Indian reaction to this proposal was strongly negative. S. 1645 as introduced placed BIA schools under Congressional &quot;protection&quot; and froze certain education regulations in place. The Committee substitute bill simply prohibits transfer of BIA schools to non-tribal entities without tribal or Congressional consent, and it establishes regional panels to review BIA education regulations. The amended bill  also (1) adds a small formula grant to tribal supplemental programs for early childhood education; (2) rewrites scattered authorizations to create a single document covering the entire Indian Education Act; (3) clarifies eligibility requirements for Indian students in public schools; (4) establishes Gifted and Talented Centers at two tribal colleges; (5) requires that Indian preference be used in employment at the Office of Indian Education, Department of Education; and (6) proposes a White House Conference on Indian education. The report includes background and legislative history of S. 1645, section by section analysis, a cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, letters of strong opposition from the BIA and partial opposition from the Department of Education, and the texts of  all changes to existing laws made by S. 1645.

        "description":"This study examined the incentives and obstacles to instructional improvement perceived by 27 rural elementary teachers who participated in a cooperative school district/university language arts staff development project. Participants were almost all female, and averaged 42 years of age and 12 years of teaching experience. Most had lived in the rural area where they taught for most of their lives, and they had a record of commitment to professional growth. Courses in the project used several \"bridging\" activities to aid the transition from discussing curricular change on campus to making changes in the classroom. During coursework, participants kept running journals in which they informally recorded their observations, reactions, insights, and plans. These comments frequently  noted the obstacles and incentives teachers perceived in their past, present, and planned attempts at instructional improvement. Researchers analyzed such passages, identified common themes, and designed a survey which was mailed to participants the following semester. Ten subjects also participated in followup interviews. Major obstacles to change included lack of financial resources, an already crowded curriculum, and isolation from peers with similar interest. Professional self-esteem was the most prevalent incentive to project participation, and collegiality among participants was a strong force during coursework. Back in the classroom, teachers reported that interest and enthusiasm from students and parents were major sources of maintenance support. Most administrators were  supportive, but only a quarter were actively involved in the implementation process. Contains 17 references. (SV)",

        "description":"This report summarizes the deliberations of the Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel's Committee on Data Needs for Monitoring Labor-Market Conditions for Engineers. The purpose of this report is to help the profession make existing data bases on engineers more complete, accurate, and compatible. The report is also intended to help funding agencies with their data collection and analytic efforts in the 1990s. The current data bases were evaluated in terms of occupational mobility and flow dynamics, technical currency, international flows of engineers, and the role of underrepresented groups in engineering. Two major conclusions were reached: (1) current data bases are quite valuable in understanding engineering labor markets; and (2) the value of data bases can be  increased significantly by improved cross-correlation, dissemination of unpublished materials, and the increase of their longitudinal nature. Fifteen recommendations are included. Four appendices are included. The first is a background paper by Engin Inel Holstrom which includes an overview of engineering databases, specific data on databases produced by 10 organizations, and outlines of engineering taxonomies. The remaining three appendixes provide the agenda, a list of 60 participants, and an 11-page summary of discussions of a Workshop on Data Needs for the 1990s, held March 28, 1988. (ML)",

        "description":"Students of reasoning have long tried to understand how people revise systems of beliefs. This paper maintains that people often change their beliefs in ways driven by considerations of explanatory coherence. In this report, a computational model is described of how experimental subjects revise their naive beliefs about physical motion. First, instances in which subjects changed their beliefs while learning elementary physics are presented. Each of these cases involved an individual's attempt to explain a surprising observation. Next it is shown how their belief revisions can be modeled using ECHO, a connectionist computer program that uses constraint-satisfaction techniques to implement a theory of explanatory coherence. The resulting simulations even captured temporal  characteristics of the observed changes in beliefs. Finally, the model's representational sensitivity and procedural robustness are discussed. The paper concludes by showing how ECHO can be used to generate empirical predictions about subjects' current beliefs. (ML)",

Hawaii teachers spent more time explaining homework. Classroom discipline was a greater concern for Hawaii teachers than for Tokyo teachers. Calculators were used much less in the Tokyo classes than in the Hawaii classes. Several other significant differences were found. It was noted that the instruments given to the Tokyo and Hawaii teachers were similar but several questions differed. Also, the comparisons were based on both public and private schools in Tokyo and  only public schools in Hawaii. Finally, a random sampling of the Tokyo schools was used whereas all Hawaiian schools were invited to respond. (MVL)",

When these chemical compounds, composed of sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide, react with water vapor, the result is sulfuric acid and nitric acid. The eastern portion of North America and the northwest section of Europe are especially susceptible to acid rain. Acid rain has damaged buildings, forests, crops, and soil; polluted thousands of lakes, rivers, and streams; and injured millions of fish and other forms of aquatic life. The purpose of the second edition of this bibliography is to provide a list of recent articles, books, and documents available in the Robert E. Kennedy  Library of the California Polytechnic State University (San Luis Obispo) on the problems of acid rain published since 1984. This bibliography is organized under the following headings: (1) \"The Causes of Acid Rain\"; (2) \"The Effect of Acid Rain on Soils, Plants, and Forests\"; (3) \"The Effect of Acid Rain on Lakes, Ponds, and Aquatic Life\"; (4) \"The Effect of Acid Rain on Health\"; (5) \"Effects of Acid Rain on Materials\"; and (6) \"Acid Rain: Laws and Regulations.\" A total of 362 citations is provided.

The total scientific process should be involved in the development of a project which results in a science fair exhibition. The student should learn to recognize problems, plan an experiment, gather and analyze data, and draw conclusions. In doing this, students gain self-confidence and the respect of their peers and often spark a life-long interest in science. Fairs also help to strengthen the links between the school and the local community.

Prior to the course, the faculty coordinators designed the modular structure of the program and wrote some input/output routines. The course was held, but was plagued by a shortage of students. This caused delays, as the program was not completed during the course. The software was finally completed through a variety of methods, including adapting existing numerical programs, using graduate students to write parts of the program as  master's degree projects, and hiring graduate students to write parts of the program. The computer program, Phase Plane Graphics for Ordinary Differential Equations, is listed in an appendix; it will be commerically distributed. (Author/MNS)",

Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) scores for the years 1984 through 1988 for ten students in each of the grades 4th through 8th (as of May 1988) were analyzed. The average gain for all subjects during the two years before WICAT (pre October 1986) was 0.85 grade equivalents (G.Eq., national norm=1.00) per year; and the average gain for all subjects for the two years with WICAT (post October 1986) was 1.17 G.Eq. per year. Using a median split, students were grouped into high ability and low ability groupings. The high ability group showed an average pre-WICAT gain of 0.97 G.Eq. per year, and an average post-WICAT gain of 1.19 G.Eq. per year. The low ability  group showed an average pre-WICAT gain of 0.72 G.Eq. per year, and an average post-WICAT gain of 1.15 G.Eq. per year. This result suggests that the WICAT CAI was beneficial for all students, but was particularly effective for students below the median. (Author)",

Propositional Logic Test (PLT), error patterns of students' interpretations of logical proposition, and developmental patterns of the error type are described. Examined is the relationship between logical reasoning ability and school science grade in tenth-grade Western Australian students (N=226). The PLT, Test of Logical Reasoning (TOLT) and Nonsense Syllogisms Test were used for measuring the logical reasoning ability. Correlations of grade in science with the PLT (.57) and the TOLT (.63) were high and the three reasoning tests together explained approximately 45 percent of the variance in science grade. An error analysis was undertaken for each  subtest of the PLT, conjunction, disjunction, biconditional and implication across three ability groups. A discussion of the use of the PLT success rate differences is included. (YP)",

Participants in the study were 10 elementary education majors and 9 mathematics majors or minors who were preparing to teach high school. Results discussed in this paper focus on the concept of division, examined across three mathematical contexts: division with fractions, division by zero, and division with algebra. Although many of the teacher candidates could produce correct answers, several could not, and few were able to give mathematical explanations for the underlying principles and meanings. Their knowledge was also fragmented. The results challenge  assumptions about the subject matter preparation of prospective elementary and secondary mathematics teachers. (Author)",

It was found that when students move from elementary teachers they percieve to be low in support to junior high teachers they perceive to be high in support, the intrinsic value of math is enhanced, while students who move from teachers they perceive to be high in support to teachers they perceive to be low in support experience a sharp decline in both intrinsic value and perceived usefulness and importance of math.

        "description":"Current statistics on arrests, convictions, and prison inmates and recent studies on violence by women indicate that the number of women who commit violent crimes is rising. Violent crimes include murder, rape, terrorism, gang participation, domestic violence, and prostitution. The first section, &quot;Women Who Kill,&quot; discusses women who murder their partners in response to physical abuse. In &quot;The Female Rapist,&quot; women are shown to be the aggressors in sexual assaults. Another violent crime, rarely associated with women, is terrorism. Recent studies show that female terrorists are displaying extreme viciousness and cruelty. As women struggle to meet their economic needs, their participation in gang activities that include muggings and thefts has increased. The physical abuse of  children and partners by women appears to have surpassed the incidence of domestic violence by men. Violence that stems from prostitution involves the prostitutes' need to support their chemical dependency. Studies reveal that the increase in violence is not restricted to adult women, and the number of female juvenile offenders is also increasing. Four reasons are cited to explain violent women: (1) premenstrual syndrome; (2) the women's liberation movement; (3) economic pressures; and (4) substance abuse. Six suggestions are included for curbing violent behavior. (DJC)",

        "description":"Rising housing costs, increased homelessness, and the debate over illegal immigrants residing in publically assisted housing have renewed media and public interest in immigration's contribution to the Los Angeles, California area's problems of scarce low-cost housing, homelessness, and housing code violations. Recent data suggest that immigrants are disproportionately both the victims of and contributors to the housing crisis, although the problems are also aggravated by commercial conversion of low-cost housing, stagnating federal aid, and diminished tax and loan incentives. As the Los Angeles percentage of poverty-level residents has risen, the area's low-cost housing has become more scarce and increasingly costly. Mexico's and Latin America's problems continue to encourage an  increase of immigrants, whose powerlessness has allowed unscrupulous landlords to rent properties to them that violate codes of safety and zoning. Suggestions for improvements include: (1) increased coordination between immigration and urban development policies; (2) rigorous immigrant screening for publicly assisted housing entitlements; (3) a national level concern and assistance; (4) policies to help ease the clustering of immigrants in major urban centers; (5) a reduction in low-wage, labor intensive urban industries that depend on foreign labor; and (6) stronger anti-housing discrimination laws, housing code enforcement, and assistance to newly legalized citizens in asserting tenants' rights.

Seventy percent of recent U.S. immigrants have settled in California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, and Illinois. Estimates of the distribution of immigrants from 1950-1980 indicated that these six states had 16 more Congressional seats in 1980 than they would have had in the absence of immigration. California gained six seats through immigration, which represented 40 percent of its total representation increase. With a net immigration of 450,000 persons yearly, the six major immigrant receiving states will increase their share of Congressional seats from 161 in 1985 to 179 in 2010, with  seven of these 18 added seats attributable to immigration. A net immigration number of 750,000 yearly would enable the six receiving states to increase their share over the next three decades to 184, 12 seats more than they would have had without immigrant settlement. California would gain the largest number of Congressional seats as a result of either projection, receiving by 2010 four seats through an annual immigration of 450,000 or seven seats if immigration is 750,000 per year.

Businesses today require employees who can communicate effectively, solve complex and unanticipated problems, and exercise tact and judgment. If the workplace requires that the majority of high school graduates be creative, intellectually flexible, team players, strong communicators, and steeped in a core of common knowledge, then schooling will have to change radically. The old literacy has a mechanistic quality; it can be broken down into little parts and taught one part at a time. The new literacy or thoughtfulness is organic and can only be acquired in social contexts and through  social interaction. From the perspective of current educational practice, this new literacy appears to be very difficult to manage or measure and impossible to individualize or standardize. Restructuring of the current school system offers little hope, if society does not believe that the characteristics of the new literacy are essential to education. (DJC)",

The statistics indicate that illegal immigration has declined across the southern U.S. border, that there is scattered evidence that aliens are leaving, and that only 800,000 aliens have applied for legalization under IRCA. It is still too early to discern the IRCA's impact on the labor  market, and little evidence has emerged concerning agricultural losses or unusual wage increases that opponents to the law feared would occur.

        "description":"This booklet contains two papers on Western European countries' attempt to deal with illegal immigration through employer sanctions. In &quot;Deterrence without Discrimination,&quot; Mark J. Miller discusses the sanctions employed by France and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). Evidence from the early years of enforcement reveals that due to poor interagency cooperation, insufficient enforcement personnel, and mild penalties, the sanctions appeared to have failed. However, in the early 1980s, when France and the FRG toughened their enforcement, the evidence indicates that job discrimination against North African Arabs did not increase, and Europeans now regard the sanctions as necessary to combat the exploitation of illegal immigrants. Malcolm R. Lovell, Jr. draws on Miller's analysis  in &quot;Europe's Lessons for America&quot; and perceives the European experience as an important lesson for the United States. In the United States, the Department of Labor, the Social Security Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service need to play major roles in the enforcement of sanctions, while employer cooperation with these agencies is vital. The U.S. Immigration and Nationalization Service must be fully supported by Congress, and the re-evaluation of fines and penalties must occur on a regular basis. A conclusion of both papers is that employer sanctions are not a cure-all for the complex problem of illegal immigration in Europe or the United States. (DJC)",

The study was undertaken to clarify and direct future research studies on citizenship education. The 321 CUFA members, of whom 103 responded, were questioned about their preference for one or more of the eight citizenship instructional approaches identified by Dynneson and Gross. The eight approaches included citizenship as: (1) persuasion, socialization, and indoctrination; (2) contemporary issues and current events; (3) the study of U.S. history, civics, geography, and related social science courses; (4) civic  participation and civic action; (5) scientific thinking; (6) a jurisprudence process; (7) humanistic development; and (8) preparation for global interdependence. The respondents were also asked to give their assessments on the influence and impact of citizenship education on students and society, to assess perspectives on the eight approaches, and to address a definition of citizenship education. The most important recommendation originating from the survey was to shift the focus away from teacher education and move directly into the classroom environment in order to identify and attempt to measure what transpires within the school. Each of the 24 questions is reproduced with an analysis and accompanied by a graph. The appendix explains how the data were analyzed. (DJC)",

The process began with a struggle in Congress between those who favored the document, or the Federalists, and those who opposed it, or the Antifederalists, and the battle continued at the states' conventions for ratification. Delaware was the first state to ratify the new government with Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut soon following. None of the remaining eight states promised such easy victory. Through political maneuvering by the Federalists, the document passed in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maryland, and South Carolina. The Antifederalists  focused their arguments against the documents in Virginia and New York, from where the strongest opposition had come during the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, but these states soon joined the others. Only North Carolina and Rhode Island refused to call conventions and sustained from ratification until the new government was already functioning. (DJC)",

Human beings are sign givers and symbol makers as they look for the sacred meaning in their lives. Through a college humanities course, some of the symbols that artists employ in fiction, poetry, drama, and film are explored to find the significance of their sacred reality. The example used in this paper to illustrate literature and symbolism is James Baldwin's \"Sonny's Blues.\" Sonny is compared to a modern biblical Isaiah, a suffering servant who finds spiritual expiation through his music. Because the story portrays a relationship between this world and another, students have a witness to a truth about human nature and the role of  the humanities. A syllabus for a college humanities course entitled \"The Sacred and the Profane: The Human Search for the Spiritual in Fiction, Drama, Film, Poetry, and Painting\" is included. (DJC)",

The qualitative studies that are reviewed are the McCutcheon Study (1981) on elementary school teachers' planning, the Rogers and Uhrmacher report (1986) on citizenship education, and the Thornton study (in press) on the relationships between what teachers plan to teach, what ensues in the classroom, and what students learn. The second issue, geography education, is discussed through an analysis of discipline-based geography, and the Thornton and Wenger study is compared to the above studies on  educational criticism. The findings from the Thornton and Wenger study indicate that teachers teach social studies rather than geography as a discipline with attention focused on sequential learning and concepts. Educational criticism appraises educators of what is being taught and how instruction is conducted while it assures that policy and practice are mutually informed. A 27-item bibliography is included.

Civic education involves the development of skills in making decisions about public issues and participating in public affairs and encompasses the preservation of core democractic concepts and values. Civic education has become an established part of social studies curricula and has increased as a result of a national trend toward law-related education (LRE). However, evidence suggests that over one-half of young adults lack the knowledge, attitudes, and skills that lead to responsible citizenship. Improvements in civic education might be achieved through: (1) an increase in the number of  courses and time spent on lessons and in the depth and breadth of topics; (2) classroom environments that are conducive to open and free exchanges of ideas; (3) the teaching of public affairs issues in history, government, and LRE classes; (4) increased student participation in extracurricular activities; (5) less authoritarian school environments; and (6) the use of LRE programs to foster student interaction, to present all facets of public issues, to involve resource persons and school administrators, and to encourage staff development.

They tend to conform to state departments of education and large local school districts' curriculum guides and to be the dominant instructional medium in high school courses.

This ERIC Digest investigates government textbooks in terms of (1) distinctive characteristics; (2) major weaknesses; (3) criticisms of textbook treatments of the U.S. Constitution; and (4) recommendations for textbook improvements. Publishers produce government textbooks that conform to national curriculum patterns, that are similar in content, style, and format, that are designed for passive  learning, and that tend to be visually appealing. Major weaknesses include: (1) superficial and simplistic coverage of material; (2) abstract or lifeless treatment of ideas and events; (3) idealistic and unrealistic presentations of society; (4) fragmentation of subject matter; (5) avoidance of controversial topics; and (6) emphasis on low-level cognition. Recommendations for improving these textbooks include the need to: (1) emphasize the concepts and values of U.S. constitutional democracy; (2) highlight critical issues of constitutional democracy; (3) utilize case studies; and (4) develop critical thinking and decision-making skills.

It is concluded that recent state  policies which place strict limits on the number of education courses in students' programs may be misguided given the currently weak knowledge base regarding the quality of academic and professional program components.

The quota system at MSU, set in 1986, restricts the number of candidates admitted to the program in a given academic term. Comparisons were made between students who, entering in 1985, would and would not have been admitted to the program when judged by fall, 1987, standards. A second sample of students who were admitted after the quota system was established were compared with these two groups. The investigation sought information on the academic abilities and credentials of the subjects and their attitudes toward teaching as a career and their educational beliefs. Data were  gathered from student surveys and academic records. The results suggested that it is reasonable to assume that higher program admission standards will improve teacher candidates' academic competence to some extent, but will not diminish overall levels of enthusiasm for teaching nor have a perceptible impact on educational orientations or beliefs.

The West now extends beyond the borders and across the vast Pacific Ocean to the entire Pacific Rim. Characteristically, these countries are growing economically, politically, and socially with major world-wide influence. While this leadership and evolving dominance was not based on these countries' leisure influence, the rich history, culture and the melding of technological advances in the leisure industries of this region--to create high-quality leisure experiences--suggests that these Pacific Rim countries (e.g., Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, People's Republic of China, Tiawan, Australia, New Zealand, etc.) have  much to offer the world through their leisure influences. The World EXPO in Australia with its theme, \"Leisure in the Age of Technology,\" is but one example. This conference session chronicles the recent advances in leisure awareness and how leisure educators in the United States are networking to influence and be influenced. The role of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education and Dance and similar associations with liaison to the World Leisure and Recreation Association will be explored. (Author)",

Modifications of the curricula and organization of  summer institues are suggested. Particular attention is focused on developing action research plans by teachers in all NWP-sponsored summer institutes.

Three patterns were discovered: (1) not only was the number of new certificants  sensitive to the demand for classroom teachers, but also their choices of subject field was sensitive to demand; (2) there was a difference between blacks and whites in the relationship between NTE scores and the probability of entry into teaching in North Carolina; and (3) the predicted probability of entry into teaching in North Carolina increased over the decade for black certificants while it declined for white certificants.

The first-year teachers provided the release time for the experienced teachers. The project was undertaken collaboratively by Wellesley College, Wellesley Public Schools, and the Boston Latin School. The report is in the form of a case-study combined with lessons and recommendations drawn from the year's experience. The planning phase, project seminar, mentoring work, and the experiences of the first-year teachers and the experienced teachers  (Fellows) are described sequentially. Discussions of problems and recommendations are interspersed throughout.

Data for 1984--2 years after the subjects graduated from high school--were included. Out of 10,613 students, a sample size of 4,000 was assumed for the purposes of statistical testing. After controlling background variables and sophomore outcomes, total participation was significantly and favorably related to 17 of 22 senior and postsecondary outcomes (e.g., social and academic self-concept, educational aspirations, coursework selection, homework, absenteeism, academic achievement, and subsequent  college attendance). However, there were significant non-linear components to most relations indicating that participation in too many activities produced diminishing returns. The benefits of participation also differed substantially depending on the particular activity. Participation in sport, honor societies, student government, school publications, school subject-matter clubs, church organizations, and community service organizations was consistently beneficial, but participation in some activities had mixed or predominantly negative effects. A 39-item list of references and eight data tables are included. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"Based on telephone interviews with educational officials from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, an overview of the use and impact of standardized tests in the United States during the 1986-87 school year was developed. In addition to interviewing officials from all state departments of education, officials from 56 sample school districts in 38 states were questioned. This FairTest survey focused on the use of standardized achievement, competency, and basic skills tests. Additional information was gathered by examining recent surveys documenting the use of standardized exams, including intelligence tests, behavioral tests, readiness tests for young children, and placement tests. During 1986-87, the sampled schools administered more than 7.8 million standardized tests to  over 5.7 million students to meet local testing mandates--a rate of 1.33 tests per student. Results indicate that: (1) the number of states mandating testing has greatly increased in recent years; (2) southern states and larger school districts test more often; (3) flaws in construction, validation, administration, and use undermine claims of objectivity and produce test results that are inaccurate, unreliable, or biased; (4) racial, ethnic, and sex bias along with bias against groups of low socioeconomic status are the most prominent forms of test bias; (5) American public school have begun to treat standardized tests as the all-purpose answer for promoting school improvement and insuring accountability; and (6) tests heavily influence curriculum development. An agenda for test reform is  outlined. An overview of the study methodology, an annotated bibliography, and a press release are appended. (TJH)",

MMs in education emphasize: verification of student achievement results; objective procedures; alignment of learning opportunities with test items; teaching toward precise objectives; and test validity and reliability. It is contended that this reliance on test scores, the most common method, provides precise results but gives rise to rigid, formal curricula. PS procedures emphasize: learning by doing; students as active participants; actually learning and not just memorizing/mastering; students working in committees; and integrating school curriculum with life. Emphasis on PS skills  represents a life-like approach in curriculum development and provides students with the ability to deal with a vast amount of information regardless of the temporal or physical location. DM strategies emphasize: the learner as the focal point of instruction; students individually choosing activities/experiences; learner responsibility for selecting/completing tasks; students governing their classroom behavior; and teachers accepting/encouraging student DM in the curriculum. DM paradigms, particularly those emphasizing the moral dimension, focus on self-evaluation and weighing the effects of ends, means, and appraisal on the self and others. (TJH)",

Subjects were 28 first, 30 third, and 24 fifth graders attending an elementary school in Corvallis (Oregon). The JSMS consists of 24 yes/no items and is scored in the direction of high self-monitoring. Individual items reflect the domains of self-monitoring developed by M. Snyder (1979). These domains include concern for social appropriateness, attention to social cues indicating appropriate self-presentation, control over one's self-presentation and self-expression, strategic use of these abilities, and situational specificity of self-presentation and expressive behavior. Subjects' levels of introversion-extraversion,  neuroticism, and psychoticism were assessed via the Eysenck Personality Inventory after administration of the JSMS. Results indicate that the JSMS is a reliable measure that can be used to assess self-monitoring in grade-school children. Used in conjunction with its adult counterpart, the JSMS can help determine the relationships between children's self-monitoring orientations and those of parents of siblings. The JSMS is appended, and four tables conclude the document. (TJH)",

Thus, dissertations are thoroughly studied by the program review teams periodically hired by boards of higher education in most states. The present paper explores seven errors in quantitative analysis in both published literature and dissertations. They are associated with beliefs concerning statistical significance testing, multivariate statistics, chi-square analysis, covariance statistical corrections, stepwise analytic methods, the psychometric integrity of instrumentation, and presentation of statistically nonsensical or impossible results. The errors are described using references to works by other authors and small hypothetical data  sets to illustrate problems. Concrete examples of the errors as they occur in dissertations are cited to make clear that the errors are not hypothetical. Ten dissertations, completed since January of 1985, are cited as examples, although pseudonyms are used. These common methodological errors in dissertations may reflect poor training in research.

Independent variables studied included credibility, involvement, and role groups. More specifically, the research was designed to address three questions concerning: (1) the occurrence of peripheral involvement persuasive effects regardless of the impact of the evaluation report on its readers; (2) the occurrence of evaluator peripheral credibility cue effects independently of involvement effects; and (3) the differential sensitivity of high-level administrators and licensed evaluators to peripheral cue information. Subjects included 20 administrators working with local educational agencies in Louisiana and 51 program evaluators. The subjects' responses to  simulated evaluation reports and questionnaires were assessed. Results indicate that evaluator credibility is perceived by report readers and that these perceptions may even affect counterargumentation. Furthermore, counterargument may lead to inaction or delay even when dealing with favorably received recommendations. The findings also indicate that issue-involvement intervention did not directly affect the perception of involvement; attitude change is a function of the extent and direction of cognitive responses; and program evaluators and high-level administrators are more similar than dissimilar in their perceptions of evaluation information.

Data sources included the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS), a data collection form developed for the study, and scores from tests accompanying each module of the computer-enhanced curriculum. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (1984). Analyses of variance were conducted on selected variables. The computer-based instruction used was found to be effective and showed superiority to traditional classroom instruction for the remedial students in the program. All comparisons showed significant gains  on the CTBS, with the exception of the tenth-grade gain for subtest concepts and applications. The average gain for all students on total math was 4.772 normal curve equivalents. The magnitude of progress is still in question as the CTBS gain scores may not be representative of the math curriculum and the module unit tests are not norm referenced. GRI administrators need to reexamine in-depth the use of classroom aides, evaluate the module test items for sex bias, check the program screening process for racial bias, assess student gains for various racial categories, and assess any standardized assessment instrument used for evaluation of the project for criterion-related validity before use. Ten tables are provided. Lists of software and primary instructional materials, and the GRI Math  Lab Data Collection Score Report and Demographics Forms for 1986 are appended. (TJH)",

Segregation of housing is a key mechanism for maintaining the subordinate status of blacks. Housing policies and practices have been a leading cause of the nation's decaying central cities and fractured metropolitan communities. This essay discusses the development of racially segregated housing patterns and the nation's limited efforts to achieve open access to quality housing. Starting from the beginnings of black immigration in 1619, the paper sketches housing patterns during the slave years, and reviews the slow pace of change during the first half-century after Emancipation. Black migration accelerated in the years surrounding  World War I, and Jim Crow came north in the form of tactics to create and sustain racial residential segregation. During the civil rights era, here identified as 1941-88, efforts to change the segregated character of housing have been few and weak. Opportunity exists for public programs to increase the availability of integrated residential life for all Americans in the future, and thus to transform the race and residence patterns that will prevail in the twenty-first century.

The responsibility for creating schools that serve all children falls to both the state and local school districts. A state level initiative must be combined with local district effort. This report provides recommendations for correcting the problems faced by poor and minority students that were identified and discussed in three previous studies. Major recommendations include the following: (1) schools must improve the connection between the home and school environments; (2) schools must adopt a philosophy that all children can learn, that schools can serve all children, and that public schools are responsible for educating all children; (3) state government  should require local schools to collect and report information to determine the quality of education provided poor and minority children; (4) tracking and ability grouping must be eliminated; (5) authoritarian school discipline, such as corporal punishment and suspension, must be eliminated; and (6) it is the state's right and responsibility to require accountability of local school districts to ensure that public funds are used to provide quality education.

The introduction includes an extensive discussion of the problems of choosing dependent variables for use in desegregation studies. The potential study population was chosen based on the percentage of the minority groups in the school district population, and whether the desegregation plan used a magnet-voluntary or a magnet-mandatory structure. Twenty school districts were chosen for study from that population. The following characteristics were examined: (1) decrease of the white population (white flight); (2) interracial exposure; (3) racial imbalance; and (4) net balance. The analysis suggests that a magnet school plan based  primarily on voluntary transfers will produce greater long-term interracial exposure than a mandatory reassignment plan with magnet components. This is probably due to greater white flight from the mandatory plans. Thus, adding magnet schools to a mandatory reassignment plan does not make it competitive with a voluntary plan. Twenty-two notes, and a list of 38 references are included. Six graphs and six tables of statistical data are included in the appendices. (FMW)",

        "description":"This report recommends that the Social Security Act Title XIX be amended to include a 24-month extension of Medicaid to families who become ineligible for cash assistance under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. This amendment accompanies the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987 (H.R. 1720), which is proposed to replace the AFDC program of the Social Security Act Title IV. The objectives of the amendment are the following: (1) encourage former AFDC recipients to work and to remain working; (2) reduce the number of working poor families with no health care coverage; and (3) complement and encourage existing State efforts to make health care coverage available to the uninsured. The loss of Medicaid coverage is a major obstacle to working for women with  children on AFDC. Under the current law, Medicaid coverage may vary from 4 to 15 months depending on the income a family was earning at the time it lost AFDC cash benefits. The amendment also requires States to extend coverage for six months to families who lose AFDC benefits as a result of child or spousal support. A cost estimate and an inflationary impact statement are included. The proposed amendment is supported by various committees and legislators. Dissenting views express concern that the proposed extension will encourage increased dependence on welfare, and discourage employers from offering health care benefits. (FMW)",

        "description":"This report recommends that Title I of the proposed Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987 (H.R. 1720) be replaced with a Fair Work Opportunities Program. H.R. 1720 is proposed to replace the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program of the Social Security Act Title IV. The purpose of the proposed amendment is to assure that needy children and parents obtain the education, training, and employment which will help them avoid long-term welfare dependence. One of the chief criticisms of the present AFDC program is that it provides disincentives to recipients to obtain paid work. Recognizing the importance of education for welfare recipients, the amendment authorizes a comprehensive range of educational services to help participants prepare for employment. Work and training  experiences would be coordinated with the existing Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). The legislation would include demonstration programs to address early childhood development, provisions for child care, and encouragement of parent participation in children's learning. Cost estimates and an inflationary impact statement are included. Dissenting minority views are also included. (FMW)",

Workers' lack of basic skills is creating an inadequate labor force for the United States to compete in a world economy. Three personal narratives illustrate typical at-risk students. The Federal Government has decreased its financial commitment to education. Federal support is required by the following groups: (1) low-income children in need of preschool education; (2) students in need of remediation; (3) children in need of bilingual  education; and (4) youth in need of job training. A survey of 49 states and the District of Columbia reported efforts in the following areas: (1) early identification and remediation; (2) career exploration and vocational education; (3) dropout prevention and school-to-work transition; (4) dropout retrieval and second chance programs; and (5) equal funding. The barriers to assisting at-risk youth are the following: (1) failure to perceive their need; (2) resistance to institutional change at the state and local levels; and (3) absence of leadership at the federal level. The appendices include the following: (1) summaries of the reform efforts of 14 states; (2) a chart of the Federal Program Budget Authorization by State, 1986 and 1987; and (3) a list of State contacts.

A list of the objectives is included in Appendix A. The program is designed to prepare inner-city 4-year-olds from diverse backgrounds with the skills needed for kindergarten. Parent involvement is an important program component. A screening test is used to select participants. The Prekindergarten Saginaw Objective Reference Test (PK-Sort) was used to measure achievement on 13 of the objectives measured. Findings include the following: (1) attainment of six of the nine objectives in the cognitive skills area; (2) attainment of one of the four  objectives in the psychomotor skills area; and (3) overall attainment of seven (53.8 percent) of the 13 objectives measured. Results also show the attainment of all three of the remaining objectives that deal specifically with the Parents as Partners program component. Review of this evaluation and a separate process evaluation indicate areas for improvement in the 1988-89 program. Statistical data are included on six tables. The appendices also include a comparison of the percent of students at post-testing attaining mastery on PK-Sort objectives by school building for 1987-88, and a summary of the number and percent of prekindergarten families attaining objectives of the Parents as Partners component by school building for 1987-88.

        "description":"The Self-Identity Development Model of Oppressed People (SIDMOP) is a synthesis of several areas of psychology, including developmental, cross cultural, and spiritual literatures. SIDMOP provides an all-inclusive model of identity development for oppressed minorities in the United States, regardless of ethnicity. The model was formulated from the following sources: (1) the authors' personal narratives; (2) clinical and anecdotal accounts; and (3) research literature. In addition, a male or a female were interviewed from the following groups: (1) Black; (2) Hispanic; (3) Asian American; (4) American Indian; (5) Jewish American; (6) Physically Disabled; and (7) Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual. The SIDMOP process moves through the following: (1) absence of conscious awareness; (2) transition  from absence of conscious awareness to individuation; (3) individuation; (4) transition from individuation to dissonance; (5) dissonance; (6) transition from dissonance to immersion; (7) immersion; (8) transition from immersion to internalization; (9) internalization; (10) transition from internalization to integration; (11) integration; (12) transition from integration to transformation; and (13) transformation. Graphically the process can be likened to a spiral that moves along an infinity sign, illustrating the repetitive, never-ending progress through ascending levels of awareness. A table illustrates the parallels between SIDMOP and other identity development models, as well as a graphic representation. A list of references is also included. (FMW)",

        "description":"The STOP Abusive Behavior Syndrome (STOP ABS) Project attempts to implement a community-based discipline model for inner-city elementary schools that avoids both physical and emotional abuse by teachers and students, while contributing to the students' overall development. Prevailing disciplinary models either relate to children as objects to be changed (coercive), or allow children to do as they want (liberal). Based on the work of psychiatrists Franz Fanon and Wilhelm Reich, STOP ABS believes that the optimal learning environment empowers children with the tools they need to collectively change oppressive and limiting social conditions, and in the process radically refashion their own constraining social roles. A pilot program was implemented in grades 3 through 8 of the  Barbara Taylor School, an independent multiracial, daycare and elementary school in Harlem, New York City (New York) that appears to have lessened incidents of abuse. A second year-long pilot project was also implemented with a class of 4- and 5-year olds. Preliminary outcomes indicate that children can articulate creative possibilities for non-abusive behavior. Goals for the 1988-89 school year include the following: (1) research into how children are socialized into an abuser-abused world view; (2) refinement of the discipline model; (3) integration of the discipline model with the curriculum; and (4) involvement of parents and community.

The projects' goal is to empower people to continually develop throughout their lifespans. Basic tenants include the following: (1) emotions are a social practice; (2) individuals can produce, organize, and reorganize social practice; (3) individuals can produce social change by breaking out of social roles and breaking social rules; and (4) conflict is a key tool for development. Based on the work of psychiatrists Frantz Fanon and Wilhelm Reich, STOP ABS believes that people are abusive because of deep and hidden shame and humiliation caused by the pressure of brutal life  conditions, and because violence is practiced and condoned on a national and international level by those in power. The first STOP ABS campaign began in the Bronx (New York) in 1987. Activities included the following: (1) grassroots publicity and a door-to-door survey of attitudes towards abuse; (2) individual, family, and small group free screenings to begin the process of dealing with abusive behavior; and (3) large group, monthly seminars to teach how to respond to stress and crisis in a non-abusive manner. The second STOP ABS project is underway at the Barbara Taylor School, an independent multiracial day care and elementary school in Harlem (New York). Its goal is to implement a non-abusive, developmental discipline model. A list of 11 references is included. (FMW)",

Its intended audiences are elementary teachers, elementary language arts consultants, technology teachers who work in a team with elementary teachers, and technology consultants who advise elementary teachers. The first section elaborates on the conceptual-theoretical positions of the monograph. Part 1 discusses the monograph's three conceptual bases: (1) selected theories of language acquisition; (2) the rationale for technology in the elementary school; and (3) an empirical study of child language in an elementary school technology context. The purpose of Part 2 is to sensitize the teacher to  the language development potential of elementary school technology (EST) activities. Parts 3-5 (under II) blend theoretical principles with practical applications in the EST context. Part 3 summarizes the steps necessary in implementing an EST project that fosters language development. Part 4, addressed to teachers who need assistance in initiating the EST component, provides guidance in selecting a learning activity, planning its components, and implementing it with children. Part 5 addresses the need for interactive planning to capitalize upon opportunities for language development in the context of EST activities. The monograph is illustrated with 20 tables and figures; it concludes with a bibliography. (YLB)",

        "description":"Case studies were conducted in industrial enterprises of varying sizes and a university library in Hong Kong that have introduced advanced technology. The studies investigated the management of technological change, vocational training, and human resources development at the workplace, as well as the repercussions on work attitudes, the occupational and skill structure, the educational background of the labor force, the government's labor force policies, and the macro labor market of advanced technology. The studies also focused on the problems of formulating public policies on personnel planning and training at the national level. Analysis of the case studies showed the risks of mismatch between skill supply and demand when the match is administered by a central program, because  skill supply requires long-range planning, whereas demand is affected by short-run cyclical variations in export-oriented economies. The analysis also showed another problem that attends the application of modern advanced technology: the specificity of skills, so that enterprises that develop their own mixes of technology and skill may find it increasingly difficult to use external or government-sponsored training facilities at the national level. Finally, the studies pointed to the strategic importance of responsive and flexible training systems in order to avoid imbalances between skill supply and demand. (KC)",

Although the relationship is generally perceived as negative, some people suffer fewer negative consequences of unemployment than others. Potentially negative aspects of unemployment include reduced income, life restrictions, fewer goals, smaller scope for decision making, diminished opportunity to develop and use skills, an increase in psychologically threatening activities, insecurity about the future, restricted range of interpersonal contact, and changes in social position. Factors influencing the impact of unemployment include employment commitment, age, length of unemployment, social class, and sex differences. In addition, some jobs have \"bad\" components that make  some workers better off unemployed--so-called \"good\" unemployment. Since unemployment is likely to be high in the future, some people may have to reconstruct their perceptions of unemployment to move into \"good\" unemployment, overcoming some of the negative features of unemployment by attitude change. Job restructuring such as part-time work and job sharing also may help to mitigate the impact of unemployment, but will require attitude change. (KC)",

        "description":"A study investigated the ways in which vocational education is related to high school graduation requirements in Minnesota and several other states (Ohio, Virginia, and Washington). A review of literature showed the historic development of high school graduation requirements, the role of vocational education in secondary schools today, and vocational education's relationship to graduation requirements. Data for the study were collected through extensive telephone and in-person interviews at state offices and selected local school sites in Minnesota and the other states. Review of the data revealed a variety of ways in which vocational education related to high school graduation requirements. For example, in many cases, vocational agriculture or principles of technology courses  were used to meet the state-mandated science requirements. Some schools discovered problems with such an arrangement because of confusion over whether academic or vocational teachers should teach such courses. Another option was to have academic teachers teach applied mathematics, science, and communications courses, rather than use vocational courses to meet graduation requirements. Concerns were voiced in several areas that increased graduation requirements would draw students away from vocational education, unless ways were found to use vocational education to meet requirements or to rewrite requirements in terms of competencies rather than credit hours. Policy questions regarding evaluation of vocational education courses were raised. Twenty-nine references are listed; the survey form  and interview protocols are appended. (KC)",

In phases 1 and 2, the task inventory and DACUM approaches were used to identify future changes in the technology used in the publishing industry and the resultant changes in jobs in the industry. The task inventory and DACUM approaches were then compared in phase 3. Both methods realized their planned results. The DACUM process required less staff time (17.2 versus 47 days). Furthermore, the task inventory demanded research personnel who were unnecessary for the DACUM workshops. However, DACUM requires more money for accommodation and travel expenses. Although  both methods achieved their goals, there were subtle differences between them. Both DACUM and the task inventory gave good overall pictures of the occupation. Yet DACUM made the new technology in the publishing occupations more visible. Moreover, the task inventory required more time and costs than did the DACUM method. Since efficiency is a key element of cost-effectiveness and since the the DACUM method proved to be the more efficient method, it can be considered more cost-effective than task analysis. (MN)",

It attempts to describe some important ingredients for case management and some key steps common to case management systems.

It is an interview with Leo Delaney, a Boston-based practitioner who, in 1984, founded a case management program for  court-involved youth. The conversation with Delaney focuses on the issue of how to make case management work and how to create a multi-institutional system that guarantees youth access to services from a variety of agencies when they need them. Delaney's answers come from his experience with one approach--a providers' collaborative that developed a common referral system and clear agreements on access to the services of a number of employment, education, and social service agencies. &quot;CHR Notes&quot; describes some comprehensive programs for disadvantaged youth.

In the studies, the relationship between social isolation and efficiency in distance education was observed through three sets of variables: (1) two different concepts of education and learners' perception of social isolation; (2) types, quality, and quantity of social relations and impact of social isolation on distance education; and (3) individual psychological characteristics in relation to the impact of social isolation on the effectiveness of distance education. Although the studies are not directly comparable, they lead to several basic findings (which cannot be generalized). For example, review of the  studies showed that the learners' approach to education can predetermine their expectations. Learners who feel they must be taught are more likely to feel deprived of social relations if they study at a distance, whereas learners who have self-confidence and believe they can get the knowledge by themselves function effectively. Learners who lack good social relationships also may not function effectively in distance education. Finally, learners with low self-confidence appreciate distance education because they do not have to perform in front of peers. (KC)",

Each year, 7 percent of Californians enroll in adult or noncredit courses. They are the most diverse of any students in the state. In 1981, the Legislature established 10 categories of instruction that would be eligible for adult school and community apportionment: elementary and secondary basic skills, English as a second language (ESL), citizenship, substantially handicapped, parent education, programs for older adults, short-term vocational education, home economics, health and safety, and apprenticeship. The problems of enrollment restrictions, inadequate cooperation, lack of accountability, and inequitable  funding have led the California Postsecondary Education Commission to offer six recommendations: permit funding for ESL and basic skills to be on an on-demand basis, request the establishment of a task force to prepare and submit a 5-year plan for California adult education, equalize funding for adult and noncredit education, remove the prohibition against the offering of adult education by communities that did not have programs in place before Proposition 13, require the development of a plan for a comprehensive and comparable adult and noncredit education information system, and continue the current categories of funding.

Most were established or activated after passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Such committees can be an important tool when used as part of a comprehensive effort to achieve safety and health in the workplace. In the United States, labor-management committees are unlikely to have substantial authority or power. Rather, they are generally advisory in nature--usually reviewing, commenting, and making recommendations. They could play a substantial role, however. To be substantially empowered, labor-management committees would need to be represented by top-level management and well-placed union representatives who have adequate training and expertise in  the field. Management representatives would also need the backing of corporate leadership. Many innovative labor-management activities are succeeding in improving the work environment. Included among them are the joint labor-management committees that exist at the Madison office of Wisconsin Bell; Horace W. Longacre, Inc., in Pennsylvania; Georgia Power's Vogtle plant; General Motors; and the Eugene (Oregon) Water and Electric Board.

        "description":"The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes the official unemployment rate on the first Friday of each month based on a sample survey of 59,500 households called the Current Population Survey. Unemployment data for states and local areas are published monthly by the BLS in cooperation with the state employment security agencies. The primary basis for calculating local area unemployment statistics is the count of residents claiming unemployment insurance benefits under state law. State employment agencies use a formula methodology to measure the labor force because not all workers are covered by unemployment insurance. Local area unemployment data are often produced for small areas that the BLS concedes are subject to large relative error. A study of the accuracy of the  official unemployment rate revealed several major flaws in the method used to calculate it. The BLS actually calculates seven rates of unemployment. Unfortunately, the U-5, i.e., the figure commonly called the &quot;official unemployment rate,&quot; excludes discouraged workers and individuals who are part-time workers for economic reasons. These persons are, however, counted in the U-7 rate. Specific problems also exist with respect to measuring unemployment in urban and rural areas.

        "description":"Base Christian communities (also know as base-level ecclesial communities or CEBs) are small groups of Christians, mainly Catholics and mainly in Latin America, that come together for scripture study, prayer, and fellowship. They frequently turn their attention toward social ills and address problems existing within society. The origin of CEBs can be traced to religious developments within the Brazilian Catholic Church in the late 1960s, when a shortage of Brazilian clergy and calls from the Vatican for greater spiritual development among the people led to the development of prayer and education groups led by laypersons. Twenty years later there are over 100,000 CEBs in Brazil alone. Although CEBs have been looked upon favorably by the church hierarchy from their inception, there  is some concern that they might become an alternative to institutional Catholicism. CEBs have also been linked to liberation theology, a view of theology that has developed primarily in Latin America over the past 20 years and that rejects the abstract and theoretical nature of theology. The pedagogy of Paulo Freire has also had an important effect on the shaping of CEBs, particularly with his concept of conscientization. CEBs also pose a challenge to adult education in the United States. (MN)",

This section indicates that every linkage needs a catalyst and that the role of the Ohio Industrial Training Program is to be such a catalyst. The issues and concerns of which the company must be made aware are discussed. The next section provides tips gained from the experiences of a joint effort by the United Auto Workers and General Motors at the Mansfield-Ontario Plant. Training requirements, course content, and student/trainee issues, such as counseling, grading policy, and employee assessment are considered. Some practical tips are suggested for pushing to get the most out of the partnership. Tips from a  technical college's perspective are offered next. These include suggestions for facilities and equipment, a customized course development process, faculty/staff requirements, student services, financial management, and marketing of training programs. The paper concludes with Ohio Board of Regents background information concerning EnterpriseOhio, a statewide network of Ohio's public community colleges, technical colleges, and university branch campuses, which is intended to develop a productive and technologically advanced work force for Ohio's industries and businesses.

Three concrete examples of workers' education in different Asian countries are presented and discussed in detail: in free trade zones, in  the plantation sector, and with women workers. Critical aspects of workers' education in each of these three areas are listed. A brief overview of workers' education in Nicaragua is followed by a section that highlights key issues, such as the purpose of education, its meaning, issues of living, the methodology of education, and cultural hegemony.

Section 2 discusses issues that emerged as central to work in literacy, including literacy, democracy, and empowerment; images of literacy and the illiterate; technical/pedagogical goals versus political/ideological goals; role of teachers in literacy; illiteracy in industrialized countries; women's experiences of literacy; Unesco's vital role in literacy; how high a priority literacy really is; literacy actions by NGOs; and a research agenda for literacy. Section 3 summarizes these reports to the Task Force: International Council for  Adult Education Needs Assessment Survey of Member Associations, a project proposal for a video-based resource package linking the theme of peace to literacy; a proposal to create a special book for ILY written by literacy learners; and proposals to educate and mobilize world public opinion about literacy through the arts. Chapter 4 sets forth the framework of a common strategy for ILY. Components are identified for five broad areas: creating public awareness, creating and strengthening literacy structures, stimulating a &quot;great debate&quot; on literacy, encouraging literacy research and evaluation, and ITFL Coordinating Office activities. Outlines of plans of action of international NGOs prior to, during, and beyond ILY 1990 are appended. (YLB)",

        "description":"Basic principles of quality control and resource allocation are regularly practiced in the management of higher education organizations. The principle of seeking the best \"fit\" between institutional capabilities and available markets has gained importance as the demographics of U.S. higher education enrollments have changed to include more older students. In the past, the higher education community has responded to similar diversification of the undergraduate student body. For adults in particular, colleges have altered the method of program delivery and the method of measuring educational attainment. The literature suggests three categories of change models: rational, irrational, and individual. The model of organizational adaptation can be combined with these models to create a  conceptual framework for guiding change in a liberal arts college. This framework suggests that each model is more or less relevant at particular stages of the change process. If a private liberal arts college wishes to adjust its academic delivery to induce adults to enroll, it must prepare for change and consider why change is necessary. Finally, the college needs to attend to what needs to be changed, namely the place, time, and instructional technique of its class offerings. (An 11-page list of references is appended.) (YLB)",

To protect U.S. farmworkers, the law requires that they be given first opportunity for jobs and that their wages and working conditions are not adversely affected by the use of H-2A workers. The Department of Labor (DOL) relies on two types of surveys to set minimum wages for U.S. farmworkers--a Department of Agriculture (USDA) nationwide survey on farm labor wages and selected DOL-sponsored, state-conducted area surveys of prevailing wages. A General Accounting Office evaluation of the USDA survey  indicated that, although the survey is generally sound, it has a potentially serious flaw as used by DOL to set hourly wage minimums. The precision of its wage estimates is unknown and potentially unreliable, and some of the prevailing wage surveys include practices that create potentially erroneous wage estimates. The DOL's practices were also found to provide weak nonwage protections for U.S. farmworkers. Measures for correcting the flaws identified were formulated.

Students enrolled in proprietary and private not-for-profit institutions were more likely to be females than were those students in public less-than-2-year or public 2-year institutions. About 15 percent of proprietary school students were black versus about 9 percent of public 2-year college students.

About one-third  of proprietary school students paid $3,000 or more in tuition, whereas over one-fifth of public 2-year students paid less than $250. Ninety percent of public 2-year students had no loans, whereas about one-fourth of proprietary school students had loans of $2,500 or more.

The study questionnaire was given to 633 nonvocational 11th-grade students from 5 randomly selected southwestern Ohio high schools. One month after the student questionnaires were administered, a random sample of 16 parents was contacted by telephone to obtain their views on vocational education and to authenticate data collected from the students. School demographic data were also collected from research coordinators at each participating high school. The top five reasons why students chose not to participate in vocational education were (1) the belief that academic programs would better  prepare them for college; (2) they never even thought about vocational education; (3) they did not wish to take the vocational programs offered; (4) they felt vocational education would keep them from participating in extracurricular activities in their home schools; and (5) joint vocational schools had poor images in their community.

The study entailed two years of extensive data collection at the state and local levels. In addition to the inherent structural barriers to coordination between vocational education and JTPA, the study uncovered other barriers to coordination that were related to potential threats to agencies' autonomy, resources, basic identity, and public image. Both JTPA and vocational education officials appeared to fear that serving too many hard-to-employ clients would weaken their credibility as effective job preparation agencies. The study also included many analyses attempting to construct a structural model of coordination. No significant relationships  among the state and local variables could be found, however. Nor was it possible to combine the variables into a structural model with acceptable parameters. The data collected were, however, sufficient to formulate a set of tentative guidelines for initiating and improving coordination. It was determined that someone must take the lead in coordination, there must be mutual benefit for the cooperating parties, mutual accommodation is almost always necessary, and communication is the most important element in any coordination effort.

Information for the study was obtained from national and regional officials of the Microelectronics Education Programme (1981-86), teachers, inservice trainers, and other interested parties. Although widely acknowledged as being innovative, the microelectronics program's impact was determined to be very patchy from the standpoint of teaching and learning strategies used in the schools, and it failed to provide adequate support for teachers involved in the program. Scotland, on the other hand, appears to have initiated a more promising method of CIT. Scottish  schools emphasize using computers in ordinary school subjects versus England's decision to confine computers to computer studies departments. After examining these and other initiatives and practices related to CIT, the researchers formulated 16 specific proposals for incorporating CIT into YTS programs. The importance of allowing CIT developments to be used differently according to region, industry, area, or local interest, the value of local support groups, and the need for local negotiations over development and implementation were emphasized.

Of the 52 programs for which data on the time spent on CIT were available, 12 offered 5 days or less of off-the-job training with little other instruction, 27 offered 10 days of off-the-job training, and only 8 offered more than 2 weeks' worth. Those providers that delivered CIT as one element of a series of training components found their greatest handicap to be the restricted amount of time available for CIT. Three variables proved critical to training effectiveness: the quality of the trainers, the tutor-trainee ratio, and the amount of resources available. The 61 programs examined  trained slightly in excess of 6,000 trainees, with most large providers having 1 computer per trainee. The amount of CIT training offered varied widely from provider to provider. Assessment and certification proved to be key elements of training effectiveness.

It was determined that the overall purpose of CIT in the YTS should be to develop an information technology capability in each trainee. Because vocational relevance can be a powerful motivator, CIT training in YTS activities should emphasize the practical applications of information technology. The precise content and level  of the CIT component of YTS should focus on trainees' prior interests, their YTS experience and its context, and the type of CIT qualifications being sought. The existing position of CIT as a component of transferable core skills should be maintained, and programs should be encouraged to develop an overall approach to CIT training that includes both off- and on-the-job training.

        "description":"A study examined the role of computer and information technology (CIT) instruction in the Youth Training Scheme (YTS). A number of successful local YTS training schemes and initiatives were identified and analyzed. One phase of this analysis focused on standards, accreditation, and progression in the CIT component of the YTS. Special attention was paid to the following components: progression into YTS, computer awareness, general certificates of secondary education, the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative, certificates of prevocational education, achievements in CIT at school, and methods of taking account of prior learning. It was concluded that, besides being technically sound, good assessment must also be practicable, comprehensive, dynamic, and unobtrusive. Because  assessment is not an exact science, assessment processes need to be judged against how they are intended to be used rather than against absolute criteria. This is especially true in YTS programs, where primary importance is given to CIT's role as an enabling technology and where transferability of training and context-dependent analysis are emphasized. (Appendixes include discussions of accreditation of prior learning experience in information technology, a case study of a typical computer studies scheme, reviews of a typical awareness certificate, standards for grades, certificates of prevocational education, vocational qualifications with an embedded CIT component in the clerical and retail fields, learning outcomes and assessment for scheme modules, and two assessment schemes.)

However, women still earn much less than men and are more likely to live in poverty than their male counterparts. Schools also have changed, as equity in education has been mandated. At present, excellence in education is being stressed, but equity is needed first. Although widely believed myths suggest that girls and women have more verbal ability and are more successful in school, research shows these ideas to be false. Girls start out ahead, but receive lower scores as they advance in an educational system that is built on the model of the male learning style. However, schools are enrolling more girls and women in nontraditional  courses, and these programs may lead to higher-paid employment for women in the future. Many of the jobs of the future will be in service and highly technical occupations. In particular, more opportunities for technicians and for entrepreneurs will open up. If the education establishment is to keep up with these trends, educators must interact more with business leaders in order to keep abreast of change in the job world. More adults will retrain and many people will continue to learn throughout their lives. Schools must meet the challenges caused by these new realities. (KC)",

Sexual harassment has been defined as a continuum of behaviors, with physical sexual assault at one extreme and nonverbal, sexually suggestive behavior at the other extreme. Studies suggest that more females than males are victims of sexual harassment. Sexual harassers are usually males in a position of authority who can force the cooperation of the victim by coercion. Sexual harassment leads to fear, anxiety, guilt, and anger for the victims; many victims feel they should have done something to prevent the harassment. Persons who  feel they are being harassed should take immediate, firm steps to stop the behavior. They should document the incidents in case a suit is filed. They can complain to the appropriate officers in their organization or to the state or federal agency that has jurisdiction in the matter. Some organizations have published written guidelines forbidding harassment and specifying the actions that should be taken by persons who feel they have been harassed. (KC)",

In addition to such programs as the Free Enterprise Project at the Auburn Career Center (Lake County, Ohio), some vocational schools, including Auburn, offer optional, short-term entrepreneurial programs. Entrepreneurship training in secondary educational institutions is becoming more widespread, reflecting the overall increase in self-employed individuals. In addition to educational and risk-taking characteristics, people who become entrepreneurs had early exposure to business ownership through family role models, were fired at least once, are customer-oriented, and feel that working hard is the key to success. The 1986 Tax Reform Act makes business ownership extremely attractive from a tax standpoint. Women  entrepreneurs seek the opportunity to make more money than they might make working for someone else. They also go into business for the same basic reasons men do and have the same general characteristics and backgrounds as their male counterparts. Female-owned businesses sometimes have the advantage over businesses owned by white males, because they are considered a minority and get local and state assistance. Women business owners' support groups are found throughout Ohio. Management assistance is available from many governmental agencies in Ohio that long have been at the forefront in recognizing changes in employment and business. (Contact information is provided.)

        "description":"Career preparation, of which formal vocational education is only a part, must be integrated into handicapped students' education. To prepare handicapped students for employment, their disabilities and abilities need to be identified and understood and their skills and interests should be matched to appropriate training and employment. Meaningful work is necessary for psychological well-being, and handicapped youth deserve opportunities to achieve self-actualization through challenging and fulfilling work. Factors that interfere with successful employment include outdated attitudes, negative self-image, and a lack of positive, handicapped role models. The most underserved individual--the disabled minority female--should be targeted for the most aggressive services. Over the past  several years, federal legislation has had a substantial impact on opportunities for disabled individuals. Ohio has been aggressive in addressing the mandates by developing a continuum with four levels of programming. An overwhelming need exists for schools to emphasize transition services, to adopt a more functional and less developmental curriculum, to increase real job experiences, and to follow up program leavers. These changes imply the need for revisions in preservice and inservice education and for complete infusion of career education into the special education classroom. (YLB)",

Respondents (N=127) were asked to respond to 12 test segments by editing a printed passage or other material following a video presentation of a situation or information in the field of child care. The edited paragraph or material was then hand scored using a scoring template or scored more quickly by using a microcomputer. A study examined the potential of the TRT as an approach to assessing higher-order thinking and knowledge use within a specific domain and practice area relevant to vocational education. Results of the pilot tests conducted to assess the TRT indicated that it  successfully focuses on the totality of situations rather than on only one or two aspects of a situation, reflects expertise in an identified body of knowledge, avoids the potential for test-wiseness being reflected in responses, and is reliable and valid at levels accepted for classroom use, program evaluation, and potential development as a standardized test. It was thus deemed to be a promising approach to determining contributions of vocational education to developing higher-order thinking skills in students that is relevant to work roles and contexts.

The plan also calls for continuing implementation of the state's vocational instructional management system. Other major goals stipulated in the state plan include implementing a system of vertical articulation, increasing the role of vocational education in the state's economic development activities, developing a systematized approach to developing equipment replacement plans appropriate to each vocational program area,  improving and expanding career guidance and counseling programs, and improving and updating consumer and homemaking education programs in the state.

While the major part of the study was concerned with the issues and problems confronting the parents and stepparents, this report focuses on the problems faced by children when their parents remarry. Discussions center on typical issues of stepfamily living, citing results from the study and describing components of the program which addressed those issues. Issues covered in the report include: (1) lessening of closeness between the child and his/her natural parent; (2) feelings of  resentment; (3) sexuality; (4) step-sibling rivalry; (5) behavior and discipline; (6) access visits, or times the child spends with the noncustodial or joint custodial parent; and (7) anger and sadness that the child may experience. A summary section suggests ways that counselors and other practitioners can help individuals adjust to life in a stepfamily. (NB)",

Emphasis is placed on the need to give physicians guidelines for deciding to whom to prescribe, what to prescribe, how much, and for how long. Chapter 1 provides an introduction and chapter 2 gives an overview of changing trends in the use and misuse of psychoactive drugs. Common patterns of inappropriate use in developing and developed countries are identified and different methods for assessing levels of use are critically compared. For each class of drugs, information is provided on dependence liability, therapeutic value, and social benefits. Chapter 3 explores factors that influence prescribing practices.  Chapter 4 outlines the principles of rational prescribing as these pertain to patients complaining of life stress, to patients whose complaints are related to disease states, and to &quot;doctor shoppers.&quot; Chapter 5 suggests alternatives to psychoactive drugs. Chapter 6 focuses on the role of medical education in promoting rational prescribing and chapter 7 considers the role of continuing education. Sources of information are identified in chapter 8 and chapter 9 looks at information dissemination. Chapter 10 describes assessment of the effectiveness of interventions. The final chapter provides recommendations for institutions concerned with medical education. (NB)",

Subjects read a vignette describing a police report of an assault and completed questionnaires measuring subjects' perceptions of the crime, attributions of blame, attributions to the victim, and attributions to the attacker. The results revealed that attacks of high similarity victims were perceived as less frequent than those of low similarity victims. Active males and passive females were perceived as having more frerquent  attacks than passive males or active females. The victimization of similar females and dissimilar males was perceived as being more serious than the victimization of dissimilar females or similar males. Subjects assigned more blame to the attacker when the victim was passive rather than active. Dissimilar victims, female victims, and active victims were more likely to be blamed for their attacks.

Most chronic delinquents referred to VisionQuest by the juvenile court had failed under prior placements and were candidates for commitment to the California Youth Authority. VisionQuest programs consisted of rustic wilderness camps, wagon trains, and extended sailing and bicycling expeditions. All programs emphasized physical conditioning, accountability for one's actions, and overcoming personal and physical challenges. In 1981, the San Diego Juvenile Court began placing delinquents in VisionQuest; this placement was opposed by the San Diego County Probation Department. A study was conducted to determine why the court and the  Probation Department held such divergent views on the potential risks and benefits of the program and to examine how recidivism rates for VisionQuest graduates compared with those of comparable youth from other programs. This document reports the findings of the VisionQuest evaluation and contains an introduction and sections on the history and characteristics of the San Diego VisionQuest program; the evaluation design and data sources; characteristics of the program sample; differences in post-release criminal behavior; and conclusions and directions for the future.

It argues that, since the decisions that are reached are often group decisions, or are at least strongly influenced by groups, an understanding of group decision-making processes can be helpful to the college admission counselor. Several formats that counselors might use to facilitate a family's decision-making and to identify factors which either promote or impede the decision-making process are described. Six steps of the reflective thinking process are explained: (1) problem identification; (2) problem analysis; (3) criteria; (4) possible solutions; (5) evaluation; and (6) selection of the best solution. Counselors are  encouraged to keep the steps of reflective thinking in mind when attempting to facilitate a family's discussion. An alternative to the reflective thinking method, the single question method, is also described. Five steps of the single question method are listed and the purpose of the approach is explained. A section on team research discusses recent research on team effectiveness and how results of that research might be used by counselors when assisting a student and his/her family in making a college selection.

Scales of job stress, family stress, and strain reactions (job dissatisfaction, depressed mood, psychological disturbance, self-esteem, and negligent health practices) were completed by 40 fathers in single-worker and 46 fathers in  dual-worker families. No significant differences were found in magnitude or components of job and family stressors or on psychological health outcomes. Significant interactive effects of joint family and work stress were found on three of the five outcome measures: the interaction of high family and high job stress had an adverse effect over and above the impact of the combined direct effects of these stressors, but only for men in dual-earner families.

Scales of job stress, life stress, and outcome measures of job satisfaction, self-esteem, depressed mood, psychological disturbance, and physical illness were administered to 150 clerical and 61 service workers. Results indicated occupational differences in patterns of stress, in patterns of strain reactions, and in the prediction of specific negative  consequences from particular stressors. Clerical workers appeared more sensitive to task insignificance and work environment discomfort while service workers were more affected by lack of autonomy and role overload.

This study examined the effectiveness of a stress management program in a child protection agency.

Subjects participated in one of three groups: a stress intervention program for an extended time; a stress intervention program for a short time; or a no-intervention control program. All subjects completed a self-report questionnaire before and after interventions which assessed demographics and included all three subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, four subscales of the Work Environment Scale, the General Health Questionnaire, two  scales assessing perceived role conflict and role ambiguity, and a scale of global job satisfaction and intent to turnover. The results revealed that the long-term and short-term intervention groups reported lower levels of physical and psychological complaints and a more favorable perception of their work environment than did the control group. The pattern was more pronounced for the long-term intervention group. It appeared that the basic components of the program had some impact in improving peer support, reducing levels of somatic complaints, improving a sense of personal accomplishment, reducing work pressure and role ambiguity, and improving job satisfaction.

        "description":"American schools might improve their performance by emulating certain successful businesses that, while distinctly American, have much in common with Japanese corporations. William Ouchi attributes Japanese business success to worker involvement; the typical Japanese corporation, he asserts, unifies its employees around a corporate philosophy transmitted through a corporate culture. Most American businesses, by contrast, are plagued with instability, as workers seek career growth at the expense of the company. American &quot;Type Z&quot; corporations, however, have attained prosperty and stability because, like Japanese corporations, they are people-centered and purposeful organizations. Meanwhile, despite growing criticism of American education, school effectiveness research has found  examples of highly successful schools. The &quot;Type Z&quot; school is a new model that draws on both these analyses. The characteristics of such a school include: (1) a clear philosophy stressing excellence, equity, and enrichment in an optimistic environment; (2) a curriculum reflecting community goals and values; (3) classroom practices congruent with the school philosophy; (4) a sense of community among and between teachers and students; and (5) a strong principal providing symbolic leadership, instructional leadership, and group facilitation.

Starting with the profiles of the ideal principal developed by two groups of school-based practitioners, researchers modified the resulting profiles through interviews with 90 principals, producing a four-stage growth profile of effectiveness. Within each of the four arenas of principal effectiveness (goals, factors, strategies, and decision making),  researchers found four descending orders of roles, the highest being systematic problem-solving, followed by program management, humanitarianism, and administration.

This study addresses interference (categorical and core local program conflicts) and cross-subsidy (categorical fund misuse) problems at district, school, and classroom levels in terms of pervasiveness and intensity. Telephone interviews in 48 school districts, and site interviews in 10 of those districts obtained demographic, financial, and operational, as well as interference and cross-subsidy data. Findings reveal that all districts experience both problems, not only in the face of multiple categorical requirements, but also when schools administer programs imposed by another government agency. At fault are federal program  structuring and local administrative habit, both of which encourage separation of categorical and core programs, thus adversely affecting services to disadvantaged children. Solution recommendations include not assigning to separate categories students who can be assigned to regular classrooms. An appendix of success stories and references follow. (KS)",

This paper explores the impact of selected federal programs on minority employment patterns and focuses on the factors accounting for variation in racial staffing patterns among public, Catholic, and private schools. The study concludes that the combination of minority enrollments and a higher proportion of students participating in compensatory education programs explains most of the the variation in minority employment from school to school. The number of minority teachers is also a function of the demographic and fiscal dynamics of school environments. Growth is associated with greater employment of minorities. As the number of minority students participating in  compensatory education and bilingual education programs increases, the number of minority teachers employed also increases. Recent federal and state movement toward block incentive grants will diminish the positive effect of government aid on minority employment. (MD)",

Results suggest that, among other characteristics, nonreligious private schools, following the market model, generate clientele and support by emphasizing distinct educational goals, whereas religious schools, following the traditional model, stress local constituents' commitment. Conversely, rational-legal norms of public schools make social support irrelevant, demand collection and evaluation of standard, aggregated data, and support differentiated decision-making structures which limit constituent  involvement. One contrast from previous findings is the suggestion that public and religious schools do not possess different organizational environments. Still, the rational-legal norms of public schools constrain their abilities to generate commitment through means used by traditional and market-oriented systems. Further, an organizing norms-governance practices &quot;fit&quot; is important to members' involvement.

Using intervention effect studies as replication models, researchers first estimate costs, then compute cost-effectiveness ratios (size of effect for each $100 of cost per pupil). Among alternatives in the area of math achievement, for example, two tutoring interventions show the largest effects per $100 of cost per pupil, while increasing instructional time by one-half hour daily has the smallest effect per cost. Peer tutoring and computer assistance reveal almost equivalent cost-effectiveness ratios for reading.  Conversely, increasing instructional time appears to be a poor choice for both.

        "description":"Job loss through technological advancement, particularly technologies based on microelectronics, is increasing for all economic sectors in a nation already hard challenged in world and domestic markets for goods and services. But assessing technology's employment impact remains difficult not only because of its direct and indirect effects and income and price effects, but also because of the net impact issue. Whether technology destroys more jobs than it finally creates is unclear; it may simply lower employment growth. One factor is clear, however: past labor displacement has resulted from a reduced demand for specific services, from the introduction of machines, or from a substitution of foreign for domestic goods. Between 1972 and 1980, employment in 50 out of 235 occupations  declined by 2 million jobs, and in 1983 Atari laid off 1,700 American workers and moved production overseas. But technology has also created jobs, especially in computer-related industries. Nonetheless, much evidence suggests that types of jobs both eliminated and created are generally low-skill and low-wage, and that new technologies threaten even more job displacement, both skilled and unskilled. One forecast estimates 20 million job losses by the year 2000. Whether economic growth can offset the trend cannot be predicted. (KS)",

Personnel and parent representatives agree on influences behind curriculum change patterns. First, teacher reductions have led to larger and fewer sections of classes, decreasing students' scheduling options. Legislation requiring proficiency tests for graduation, as well as legislative and board demands for basic skills development, have also affected course offerings. There are, in addition, losses in materials, equipment, and support services. Specific course casualties include music and driver education, and while special education and remedial offerings have grown, many offerings that extend beyond core requirements have been eliminated. The  result is that the old enriched academic experience may only be available to those enrolled in private schools. In the year since the study, legislated curricular changes (additional fine arts courses required for graduation, for example) have combined with brightened economic circumstances, but the effect on either the nature or flexibility of the curriculum remains uncertain.

Growing numbers of principals outside Massachusetts, having attended the center as visiting practitioners, are founding centers in their own areas; the Harvard center itself is creating a national network of centers to strenthen individual development attempts. Additionally, the center is contributing to the little known area of leadership characteristics. Among its findings are these: (1) that principals are seen and see themselves as leaders, not learners; and (2) that nonprincipals identify the skills they believe effective principals should possess. The center is striving to alter both concepts by helping  principals to reflect upon and analyze their work in order to understand better their own styles and schools. Conditions associated with enrichment seem to include recognition, voluntary participation, a protected setting, participant diversity, principal-centered programs, knowledge sharing, and varied activities for various learning styles. Yet the center faces dilemmas, among them the question of individualizing an organization with over 5,000 members. Finally, the center is important because it legitimizes the idea that there are conditions under which practitioners will voluntarily engage in activities promoting leadership growth and thus school improvement.

Level one focuses on educational systems' service functions; level two involves adjustments of educational politics; and level three entails conditions of conflicts about education falling within states' general politics. Politicization refers to conflict expansion; under low politicization conditions, educational systems experience decentralization--a greater dependence upon societal norms than upon governmental intervention. Educational and political relations shift, however, when internal conflicts move beyond education's borders to become national issues--teacher/administrator conflicts in the United States, for example, leading to collective bargaining legislation. A second politicization  source stems from states' redefining educational objectives. Further, one can conceptually distinguish internal educational from general state politics to provide process dimensions for comparative analyses of education and politics across different countries. Still, there remains a high correlation between the two. Selected references are included. (KS)",

The conclusions reached, to be modified on the basis of local experiences,  are that a successful teacher evaluation system should: (1) suit the educational goals, management style, conception of teaching, and community values of the school district; (2) have top-level commitment to, and resources for, evaluation; (3) match the purpose of the district; (4) have efficient use of resources to achieve reliability, validity, and cost-effectiveness; and (5) have teacher involvement and responsibility.

        "description":"Twenty-five second generation deaf signers (6-16 years old) participated in three experiments measuring their ability to classify fingerspelled and signed words and attend to the individual handshapes within fingerspelled words. Results revealed that Ss could discriminate fingerspelled words and decompose fingerspelling into the handshapes that map into English orthography. Even the youngest Ss demonstrated full metalinguistic competence in these tasks. Findings suggest that there is a possible link between the signer's natural language and reading, and that deaf Ss have the ability to capitalize on this link. The link may help them decode words into fingerspelling in the same way spoken language allows decoding into sound. (CL)",

Disabled students were characterized as aloof, introverted, lazy, submissive, ingenuous, and unassuming. Questionnaires completed by 24 disabled and 45 able-bodied students in study 2 revealed that disabled students tended to be older than the average college student and that they had many more able-bodied than disabled friends.

        "description":"Event-related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded to both auditory and visual stimuli from the scalps of nine autistic males and nine normal controls (all Ss between 12 and 22 years of age) to examine the differences in information processing strategies. Ss were tested on three different tasks: an auditory missing stimulus paradigm, a visual color discrimination, and an auditory tone discrimination task. The brain electrical activity was recorded and analyzed (both trial by trial and averaged waveform) for one thousand milliseconds following the target stimuli. Results indicated that the amplitude of the averaged P300 component was significantly reduced in the autistic group compared to the normal group. The N100 component was also smaller in amplitude, but it did not reach  statistical significance. The latency of components was not significantly different among groups during the visual tasks; however, the latency of the P300 component was significantly longer in the autistic group during auditory tasks. The accuracy of performance with the operant button press and the appearance of the N100-P200 components in the autistic group suggested that the autistic individuals were attentive to the task. The sporadic occurrence of the P300 (when analyzed trial by trial) indicated that the autistic group was not consistently engaged in active stimulus evaluation at the higher information processing level. The delayed latency of the P300 component during auditory tasks in the autistic group hinted that there was more time required to complete stimulus evaluation in the  auditory modality at the higher processing level than was required of the visual system at the same level. Results are consistent with the view that autistic learners show higher order processing deficits as displayed by their profound language defects and problems with complex thoughts. (Author/CL)",

Identification is the focus of chapter 2 which covers such topics as screening tests, CREST talent search, planning and placement information, and providing information to parents. (Sample project forms are included). The third chapter addresses curriculum design, with emphasis on types I, II, and III enrichment activities (based on the Enrichment Triad Model--general exploratory  activities, group training activities, and investigations of real problems). Typical elementary arts experiences are contrasted with the CREST enrichment approach. Administrative issues, including staff and consultative roles are explored in chapter 4, which also presents a management timeline. The fifth chapter provides instructional models for dance, drama, folk music, creative writing, and calligraphy. Planning individualized programs is the subject of chapter 6 which includes sample individual education plans and interest inventories. Chapter 7 focuses on evaluating creative behavior and offers sample rating scales in the areas of creative communication, drawing, folk music, modern dance, and poetry. A final chapter summarizes the kinds of changes in students who have participated in  the CREST program. (CL)",

In addition, school variables (such as total student enrollment and enrollment of handicapped students by grade) were analyzed. On the average, handicapped students were scheduled to spend very little time in regular education classes, with only 3% to 7% of students assigned to regular academic classes. More than one-third of the handicapped students were assigned to classes below their grade level. Further, only 39% of the  handicapped students had assignments to all of their regular education classes that were for the full sequence of sceduled instruction.

Information was to consist of updated daily records of instructional activities and of the individual student program in each subject area in both regular and resource classes. Quarterly reports address site development activities, computer systems information, data collection and analysis tasks, and computer software information. Teachers had access to an individualized education program system which enhanced daily lesson planning, and were trained to use two software programs: a reading assessment and progress evaluation program and a math  assessment and tutorial program. Among major findings were that teachers were able to record and monitor student academic performances via microcomputers; that teachers readily accepted and used certain non-time consuming software programs; and that a math achievement software program contributed to significant achievement improvement of mildly handicapped middle school students.

Trends are then examined which are considered unlikely to come to pass, including massive employment for disabled persons in the computer industry, the reindustrialization of America, and the obsolescence of liberal arts as a course of study. The changing labor market is analyzed, and five areas of opportunity (general services, special services, sales, information services, and entrepreneurship) are described in which  people with severe physical, sensory, and mental disabilities are most likely to find and keep jobs. Personal characteristics, such as tolerance for routine, educational attainment, and inner vs. other-directedness, are considered in terms of the five areas of opportunity.

The play group was designed to facilitate any positive social interactions, either verbal or nonverbal.

Toys were selected for a play group lesson with consideration of four features--realism, structure, responsiveness, and functional complexity.

It was hypothesized that child/adult interaction would increase the child's awareness of how his or her actions influence adult behavior and would lead the child to discover strategies of encoding objects and actions in gestures and vocalizations. Three aspects of child/adult interactions were examined over a 2 1/2 to 3 year period: (1) frequency of reciprocal interaction during play, (2) child responses to adult requests, and (3) spontaneous verbalization. The data were consistent with the hypothesis. Reciprocal interaction seems to increase the child's awareness of himself or herself as an  active participant in social interaction, capable of influencing and directing adult behavior. (SW)",

        "description":"This monograph presents a synthesis of information on the education of Hispanic handicapped children. The problem is set forth in Chapter 1 which also covers approaches used to obtain information on issues and trends in the field. Assessment issues are focused on in Chapter 2 which reviews basic assumptions underlying assessment as well as criticisms of testing practices, discusses criteria for non-biased assessment, and explores alternatives to standard testing procedures (such as culture fair tests). A chapter on language assessment addresses such topics as cognitive learning style, examiner characteristics, and teacher attitudes. Placement litigation touching on over- and under-representation of minorities in special education is reviewed in chapter 4 which also presents  standards for placing limited English proficient students. Training issues and statements of teacher competencies are highlighted in the fifth chapter's discussion of personnel preparation. Issues in the delivery of services including the controversy over native vs. English-language instruction and linguistic considerations, are examined in chapter 6. A concluding chapter points out areas of information gaps (assessment, personnel preparation, delivery of services) and considers topics in need of research. (CL)",

The ESCS was designed to assess three major communicative functions (social interaction, joint attention, and behavior regulation) and to be conceptually linked to the sensorimotor/cognitive stage model. Results revealed substantial validation from the cross-sectional data analysis in conjunction with an adapted version of the Uzgiris-Hunt Scales. The social and cognitive measures were found to be relatively independent of such non-cognitive factors as age and level of motor development.

The study was conducted in two phases: (1) selection and assessment of a sample of mainstreamed and non-mainstreamed students (grades 2, 3, and 4), and (2) an examination of mainstreaming decisionmaking processes through the use of a structured interview with school personnel. Students were administered a battery of academic and behavioral instruments and teachers reported on behavior problems. Ss were further compared with non-mainstreamed peers.  Results of achievement data indicated little difference in reading scores of mainstreamed and non-mainstreamed second graders, although differences increased markedly with increased grade level. There was a large number of non-mainstreamed Ss who possessed behavioral attributes reported to be needed for mainstreaming but who were not mainstreamed. Structured interviews in phase 2 revealed that mainstreaming decisions were based on academic and behavioral strengths and weaknesses and identified patterns of participation by teachers, administrators, parents, and support staff in educational planning team meetings. Findings indicated high participation levels for special education teachers and administrators but low levels for regular educators and support personnel. (CL)",

Ss were dichotomized into visually handicapped only and multihandicapped groups for purposes of analysis. Results indicated that visually handicapped only infants spent more time attending to stimuli, but no preference was shown by either handicapped group for type of stimulus or method of presentation. In addition, Ss improved on the visual acuity measure over an 8-week period, regardless of handicapped group or an 8-hour exposure to binaural sensory aids. Finally, a disordinal  interaction occurred among binaural sensory aid, stimulus type, and handicapped group; and mere exposure to the binaural sensory aid without specific training was judged not to be effective in a program of visual efficiency training for infants 6-24 months old. Visual stimulation procedures as utilized with older visually handicapped children are questioned as applied to infants 6-24 months old. (Author)",

The development and revision of a 35-item questionnaire on nondiscrimination in evaluation for Hispanic students and on proportionate numbers in special and gifted programs are described along with information on its completion by 101 administrators of special education in four states (Texas, New Mexico, Florida, and  Massachusetts), and two cities (Philadelphia and New York). Findings are discussed in terms of Hispanic enrollment patterns and protection in evaluation procedures (with summaries of such accommodations as those for language dominance and language proficiency, culture fair tests, criterion referenced measures, and activities to improve Hispanic students' test taking skills). Among conclusions reported are that contrary to findings of other research, a majority of local educational agencies proportionately enrolled Hispanic students in special education as a whole, and to a lesser extent, in programs specifically for learning disabled and educable mentally retarded students; Hispanic students were grossly underenrolled in gifted/talented programs; there were differences in subcultures; and  the majority of administrators frequently made adaptations in assessment procedures to ensure protection in evaluation.

        "description":"Recent cognitive research concerned with training of word recognition skills and vocabulary skills in English monolinguals has implications for second language learning theory and the teaching of English reading skills to native Spanish speakers. Researchers in reading development, cognitive psychology, and second language proficiency assessment have found that good readers master the fluent recognition of all the codes making up a written text. Second language training for word analysis skills might focus on improving recognition of letter units forming words, the syntactic functions of words, and the meanings referred to by words, in both a top-down and bottom-up fashion. The situation is made more complex by the likely transfer of skills from the native to second language.  Specific techniques for training automatic word recognition in English that can be adapted for use with native Spanish speakers include Frederiksen's \"Speed\" and \"Ski-Jump\" games, which use both the top-down and bottom-up approaches. Activities to strengthen vocabulary skills can be developed based on the considerable cognitive research currently under way, especially Sternberg, Powell, and Kaye's three-phase instructional system focusing in turn on morphological cues for meaning, inference of unfamiliar words through morphological cues, and integration of skills for analyzing morphological structure and meaning.

Three critical factors in implementation are teacher training, the development of good teaching materials, and a plan for evaluating program effectiveness. Attempts to meet the need for good language-based teaching materials illustrate the difficulties and possible solutions in a language modernization situation. Literacy materials begin to address the problem, but are often developed for adults and are not suitable for school instruction. Vernacular literacy materials have been developed in some cases, but no complete program of study is now available. Researchers have developed guidelines for literacy material design based on recent  experience with literacy curriculum. When producing content area materials, authors must first use creative processes rather than consulting existing materials to avoid duplication. In addition, care must be taken to integrate effective but possibly alien instructional strategies with vernacular material, a process in which the skills of language planners and linguists are needed.

The hypothesis suggests that specific forms of processing of events may result in the formation of more exact perceptual descriptions and thus more distinctive records in memory. The two experiments reported address shortcomings in previous research on distinctiveness by comparing various forms of distinctiveness and their effectiveness in long-term recall. In one experiment, subjects were given one of four forms of data on 20 specific words: (1) the word, its definition, a word link for memorability, and the word link used in a sentence; (2) the word, definition, and the request to use the word in a sentence; (3) the word and definition; and (4) the words to be learned and their definitions,  scrambled. The fourth condition was the distinctive one. After 20 minutes, a multiple-choice test was given. The first three groups performed significantly better than the fourth group. In the second experiment, the same subjects were asked to retake the earlier multiple-choice test without the earlier preparation. The same results were obtained. It is concluded that a distinctive, unfamiliar form of processing words may require additional learning time or may result in limited recall. Further research is recommended to examine the role of greater processing time, prior knowledge, and individual processing rapidity. (MSE)",

        "description":"In an experiment using a conditional logic task, subjects were given a set of cards defining a particular conditional relationship. The subjects were required to determine the rule and predict the outcomes of the rule. Rule structure was varied by providing subjects with either a suggested rule, a partial rule, or no rule for each set of cards. Other factors that were manipulated included problem type (use of negations in syllogisms) and problem dimensionality (level of task difficulty based on number of choice items). It was found that when task difficulty was low, subjects with the most rule structure used a matching strategy and showed higher error rates than those with less rule structure. When task difficulty was high, all subjects showed the matching strategy. Qualitative  differences were found in the errors made by the two groups, suggesting the need for further research on both qualitative and quantitative differences in conditional problem solving. Appended tables present statistical data from the experiment. (Author/MSE)",

Job-specific training is not included in this component, which is designed to enable refugees to function better in any entry-level job in the United States. The component includes training  in three areas: basic job skills, vocational English as a second language, and cultural orientation. The basic skills segment covers generic job skills such as sorting, assembling, weighing, and following a diagram, as well as cognitive skills such as literacy, computation, counting, and measuring. The vocational English segment focuses on language used for clarification, feedback, following directions, safety, and social interaction on the job. The cultural segment includes both attitudinal and behavioral aspects of functioning on a job with employers and co-workers. (MSE)",

        "description":"Data are presented on the recipients of Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) fellowships, a federally-funded program supporting specialist training at the graduate level. The information comes from two surveys, one of FLAS recipients who earned a Ph.D. between 1967 and 1979, and the second a sample of those who received FLAS fellowships between 1962 and 1978 and who either chose not to earn a Ph.D. or have not yet completed their doctoral studies. The study's purpose is three-fold: (1) to present a profile of fellowship recipients, their background characteristics, type and depth of graduate training, employment history, and the extent to which they currently use their language and area studies training; (2) to explain differences in the extent of language and area studies  usage across occupational categories, world areas, degree cohorts, and academic disciplines; and (3) to identify the policy implications of the findings. It was found that although the training of the specialists has remained relatively static, major changes have occurred in employment and skill utilization patterns. The majority of recipients are currently teaching in colleges and universities, but the proportion has steadily decreased over cohorts, raising questions about whether or not recipients will be able to use and disseminate their skills. It is suggested that the program is in a transitional period and may need to be reshaped to reflect the current situation more accurately. Notes on data collection and the survey questionnaire are appended. (MSE)",

        "description":"The focus assigned to sentential negatives is investigated in 7- and 10-year-olds and adults. Two cues are considered as pragmatic indicators of the sentence component(s) to which the negative operator is applied. One is the articles: it is proposed that an indefinite noun phrase is taken within the scope of a negative and a definite noun phrase outside it. A second cue is position: based on previous work, subjects may be expected to take the second noun within the focus of a sentential negative regardless of the articles. The present study sampled a larger variety of sentence structures than a previous, related study, and used multiple experimental techniques. In two experiments, subjects made picture selections for sentences of the form \"A Noun1 isn't V-ing the Noun2,\" The  Noun1 isn't V-ing a Noun2,\" and their passives. In a third experiment, 10-year-olds described the scenes of the sentences of the prior experiments. It was found that position was used as a cue by all age groups, and that all groups took the definite article within the scope of the negative, with the effect being strongest in adults and weakest in the 7-year-olds. Developmental differences in the use of the articles are related to the development of mastery of these linguistic markers. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The creation of new words through the novel combination of English words or morphemes (e.g., \"map ball\" to refer to a globe) was studied and compared in 40 preschool children, 40 grade school children, and 40 adults. These made-up words or lexical innovations were collected while subjects attempted to name pictured objects and were evaluated in terms of incidence, communicative effectiveness, novelty, semantic accuracy, and certain linguistic characteristics. Communicative effectiveness was established by asking naive judges to guess the intended referent of the made-up word. It was expected that the preschool children's innovations would be wild and referentially opaque. Instead, the preschool children's innovations were as frequent and as communicatively effective as those of  the grade school children and adults. Grade school children produced the highest proportion of innovations with semantic inaccuracy and contamination, whereas preschool children constructed more innovations containing redundant elements. This finding suggests that preschoolers may construct made-up words from a limited set of highly familiar terms, whereas grade schoolers may rely more on partially known terms. Both groups of children are able to circumvent gaps in their lexicons by creating communicatively effective lexical innovations as often and as well as adults. (Author/MSE)",

The study provides a more accurate and complete record of classroom life than previously provided as a framework for dialect interference study. The site school was in northeast Washington, District of Columbia; observation occurred in the kindergarten and fourth and sixth grades. The dialect spoken was Black English. The focus traditionally placed on children's language ability in the classroom was placed on language functions. Evidence of dialect interference in communication was not found, although a clear  awareness of dialect diversity was found in both children and teachers. Also, a wider range of language functions and a greater volume of student talk occurred in settings where dialect features occur and appear to be acceptable. The results raise further questions about dialect use in the classroom, and further research is recommended.

        "description":"An examination of materials development for independent study in listening comprehension of English as a second language (ESL) begins with an outline of current directions in second language instruction. The discussion that follows has two parts. The first is a review of some changing perspectives on the role of listening in language learning and teaching, including historical notes, the distinctions emerging in the field during the 1970's, and the 1980's' emerging focus on the importance of listening. Part two presents guidelines for developing materials and examples of special listening activities designed for a segment of a self-study aural comprehension curriculum. The materials are intended for adult and teenage ESL learners at elementary and intermediate levels, and are  designed to focus intensive attention on selected listening tasks in two broad categories. One is functional listening and vocabulary building, with an emphasis on understanding message content and intent in building vocabulary. This category is further divided into notional/informational listening and situational/functional/informational listening. The second category of tasks is structural analysis listening, with an emphasis on analyzing sound patterns, spelling patterns, and some grammatical elements. This category is subdivided into discrimination-oriented listening practice and sound-spelling listening practice. A bibliography is included. (MSE)",

Priorities were assigned to the activities conducted by the three universities by all Arizona legislators and trustees, and random samples of registered voters, senior administrators, faculty, and students from the universities. Respondents also indicated how well they believed these activities were being performed. After describing the 10 missions identified by respondents, attention is directed to a breakdown of the relative importance assigned to the missions by external groups (outside of the universities) and groups internal to the universities. The missions in  order of priority are as follows: teaching programs and services, educational and cultural services, research and technical assistance, health care for teaching and research, improving quality, student support services, broadening access, optimizing revenues, special emphasis on women and minorities, and intercollegiate athletics. Additional information about the activities assigned to each mission and their factor loadings is appended.

Some of the internal and external factors that affect the way an institution approaches reallocation are discussed, including: duration of the fiscal crisis, degree of management flexibility available to the institution, diversification of institutional revenue sources, historical level of  recurring program support, and ability of the institution's administration to communicate with all of the institution's constituent groups. Important elements that must be considered in developing an effective reallocation process are also addressed: faculty and constituent involvement in reallocation, assessment of institutional role and mission, quality of academic and support programs, and long-term versus short-term costs and benefits associated with reallocation.

Questionnaires were administered to determine graduates' high school experiences, home background, employment experiences, reasons for not entering or for leaving the vocational agriculture teaching profession, reasons for staying in this field, the value of the student teaching experience as preparation for teaching, and skill areas that are relevant to educational  training. Findings include the following: 61.4 percent had entered vocational agricultural teaching directly after graduation; a total of 69.8 percent had taught vocational agriculture at some point after graduation; in 1982 only 18.6 percent were teaching vocational agriculture; farming was the present occupation of about 25 percent of the graduates, followed by vocational agriculture teaching, agricultural sales, banking, and agribusiness management.

It was concluded that the Federal Government has played a significant role in promoting each  type of institutional arrangement by providing: support of basic and applied research at universities to build excellence in science at the frontiers of industrial technology; contract support for research and development (R&amp;D) at spin-off high technology firms; seed money to stimulate creation of cooperative R&amp;D centers plus continuing project support by grants and contracts; and both seed money and continued funding of extension services.

It is noted that Commission findings show that the low-income and minority students have been greatly affected by reductions in student financial assistance. The Commission also found the response to the reduction in and elimination of social security benefits grossly inadequate. The Commission concludes that the federal financial aid program does affect college access and choice. Specific findings and recommendations are included. (SW)",

Testimonies are offered by two witnesses representing the American College Testing (ACT) Service and the New York State Educational Services. Statistics taken primarily from ACT's profile of financial applicants for 1983-1984 funds are quoted. It is noted that 58 percent of the dependent-student applicants have financial need averaging about $3,200 each, and 31 percent are  independent students under the current federal definition. Information is included on the student study population's marital status, average income, average age, family size, and parent financial contribution. A New York State survey of student perceptions of how they financed their education is also considered. It is noted that over 55 percent of the 8,700 students are highly dependent on financial aid. Differences in utilization rates and patterns by level of study, sector, and income are also discussed. (SW)",

The activity of the Department's Office of Inspector General in the area of student loan defaults and collections is summarized. The amount outstanding in the National Direct Student Loan program is over a billion dollars. The Guaranteed Student Loan program has about a $1,300,000 default; about $2 billion totally in default payments have been made to guarantee agencies by the  government. The Department is shifting loan collection functions that exist in three regional offices--San Francisco, Chicago, and Atlanta, into the San Francisco office. Under the Debt Collection Act, the Department is allowed to report defaulted student borrowers to credit bureaus. Under provisions of the Department Collection Act, the Department has used computer matching to identify federal employees who are in default in student loans. (SW)",

        "description":"Hearings on the proposed federal fiscal 1984 budget are presented that focus on proposals for federal student financial assistance. One of the major recommendations of the Reagan administration's budget is to eliminate funding for the Pell Grant, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, and State Student Incentive Grant programs and to create instead a self-help grant program with a maximum grant of $3,000. Students would be required to provide 40 percent of their educational costs. Additional recommendations are: to increase appropriations for the College Work Study program by 57 percent from the fiscal year (FY) 1983 level of $540 million to $850 million for FY 1984; and to double the origination fee for the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program from 5 to 10 percent for  graduate students, and to implement a needs analysis for GSL students regardless of income. In addition, federal funding for the National Direct Student Loan program would be eliminated, and an educational savings account would be created to encourage family savings toward college costs. The Department of Education proposes a major philosophical shift in federal student aid to return to the traditional emphasis on parental and student contributions as the basis of meeting college costs.

        "description":"Hearings are presented on H. R. 2144, a bill to amend Part C of Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish an endowment program for developing institutions, and for other purposes. This change in legislation would permit use of authorized funds to assist Title III institutions to build or enhance institutional endowments and would allow use of challenge grant funds for endowment building at a one-to-one federal-to-institution dollar match. The endowment program is designed to provide additional incentives to promote fundraising activities by the developing institutions, and to foster increased independence and self-sufficiency. The endowment grant to an institution in any fiscal year would not exceed $200,000 nor would be less than $50,000. The eligible  institutions would therefore contribute a minimum of $50,000. Proceeds from the endowments would be available for institutions' use to enhance their educational product and its delivery. Criteria for receipt of a grant under this program are outlined. In addition to the text of the bill, the views of the Department of Education concerning the proposed legislation are provided, along with the outlooks of representatives of professional organizations and colleges.

Sallie Mae was established by the Education Amendments of 1972 to provide liquidity for Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) lenders by purchasing GSL portfolios from lenders or making loans on GSL loans held by lenders. In 1982, Sallie Mae had total cumulative interest earning assets in excess of $5 billion. Currently, the Association also consolidates student loans, serving as a direct lender in areas where there are inadequate loans available from commercial lenders. Attention is directed, in the course of the hearings, to the Association's operations, its financial structure, its status in the private sector, and its future operating plans. Details are provided on its growth and assets,  earnings, and dividends. Attention is also directed to new authorities of Sallie Mae, including the bankruptcy priority, the consolidation authority, the purchase of a savings and loan company, the question of whether it is subject to state taxation, and other state-related concerns. It is noted that the Association is both a quasi-governmental private corporation that has corporate responsibilities to its shareholders, and, on the other hand, a public purpose or a public responsibility to insure GSL access to students.

Relationships among these ideas and computer applications are also examined to elucidate the general process of nonlinear modeling. Two examples are presented along with a discussion of bifurcation, catastrophe, and maximum likelihood estimate methods. The first example concerns administrators' responses to innovation and uses a verbal description of events. The model is developed based on variables such as the amount of voluntary effort committed to the innovative project and the level of funding agreed to by the institution. An equation consistent with the hypotheses is presented. The second example starts with a mathematical model of promotions within an  organization and shows how to go beyond the verbal statements. It is concluded that many observed phenomena in institutions are suggestive of nonlinear dynamics models. A number of standard types of dynamic behavior are well understood mathematics (catastrophe, periodicity, stochastic effects) and may be used to construct plausible models. (Author/SW)",

Retention status was studied for a 5-year period for two subgroups: remedial versus regularly admitted students, and males versus females. Data were collected on race; sex; retention status; Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores; high school class rank; and noncognitive data, including motivational variables (e.g., extent of studying, ambition, satisfaction with grades). Higher multiple correlations between  retention status and the various combinations of predictors were found for remedial students 4 of the 5 years after entry and for males as opposed to females in the fourth and fifth year after matriculation.

Implications of the differences in the student groups were considered with attention to college marketing, retention,  and curriculum policies, as well as educational and student services offered. While adult students sought colleges with qualified faculty, a wide range of academic programs, and low tuition, barriers to their college attendance included the cost of attending college and the conflict between responsibilities of job, home, and college. The availability of courses as well as the time the courses were offered were two large institutional barriers for adult students. (Author/SW)",

The results refute the trajectory theory and indicate there are different participation patterns for noncredit, credit degree, and credit nondegree students and very little crossover from noncredit  to credit. The total population exhibited a high degree of institutional loyalty, with credit nondegree students being the most likely to study from more than one institution. Credit degree students were the most active participants over time, and noncredit and credit nondegree students showed similar participation rates with the highest percentages being low participants. It is suggested that either specific curricular plans should be developed and evaluated to initiate a trajectory or else that these markets should be targeted separately. (SW)",

Unique characteristics of universities in Southern Africa are also identified, including the fact that department heads have only limited decentralized authority over issues such as admission, personnel policy, and finances. Project goals were as follows: to encourage and support a group of department heads in analyzing and restructuring their posts as department heads at the University of Orange Free State (UOFS), to encourage and support this group of department heads to decide on and participate in a structured development program, and to determine the results of such an effort. Forty-three department heads participated in the 3-year project. Information is provided on the scope  of the investigation, which included questionnaire administration and interviews, as well as problems that occurred during the implementation of the project.

        "description":"The relationship of students' certainty about academic and career plans to student retention and persistence to graduation was investigated. The effect of race was also considered. In fall 1979 a survey was administered to 3,277 freshmen entering a major, public, research university. Respondents indicated reasons for choosing a college, their career and educational plans, and their high school and family background. The survey data were combined with data from the university's student retention file to create a longitudinal database. Yearly updates have recorded each student's retention status and cumulative grade point average through summer 1983. For research purposes, educational maturity was linked to a student's certainty about a college major and career choice. It was found  that mature students persisted at a rate slightly lower than the rest of the freshman class. The small group of educationally immature students had a higher retention rate than did the mature students. A corollary finding was that the educationally mature students were more likely to be suspended (primarily for academic ineligibility) than were their more immature peers. Differences in persistence and educational maturity for black and white students were also assessed, with inconclusive results. This research, it is admitted, has not demonstrated the purposes for which it was intended. The relationship between persistence in college, race, and educational maturity remains an intriguing one, however, and future research appears to be indicated. (SW)",

        "description":"A model of student persistence that considers the role of student finances and student financial aid was investigated in 1980, with a focus on federal campus-based aid. Linear Structural Relations (LISREL), a more versatile technique than traditional path analysis, accounted for 42 percent of the variance in the persistence of 343 new freshmen financial aid recipients at a major urban university in the Southwest. The results indicate that financial need, student residency status, and noncampus-based loans and grants have direct effects on new freshman persistence regardless of the type or amount of campus-based aid awarded. The direct effect of each federal campus-based program on persistence was significant and positive. The effect of Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants  on student persistence was about half that of National Direct Student Loans and the College Work Study program. The model accounted for about 23 percent of the variance in academic performance; high school rank had the largest direct effect on cumulative grade point average. Implications for administrators and researchers are discussed. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"The development and use of a campus-based computerized faculty staffing model is described. In addition to considering market demands for current and proposed programs, decisionmakers need to consider how program development, modification, and elimination affect the total college faculty resource base. The application of computer technology, specifically spreadsheet analysis, is demonstrated as a means of simulating the outcomes of a variety of academic program decisions. This type of application is important because it provides immediate answers to complex programmatic interactions that are otherwise not recognized. The end result is a significant decrease in the amount of hand calculating required in analysis, and a major increase in the quality of information available for  informed decisionmaking. The three components of the computerized faculty staffing model are as follows: the number of majors registered within each of the undergraduate and graduate programs at the college; an impact matrix of the average student credit hours taken by each major within each of the academic disciplines by course level; and translation of full-time-equivalent (FTE) students into FTE faculty required within each discipline. The model is related to the formula budgeting approach, known as the 40 Cell Matrix, that is applied to the State University of New York System. (Author/SW)",

The objective was to broaden and develop the knowledge base and technical skills of the office as a whole, as well as to benefit individuals. A unique aspect of the program was the development of an in-office training program to supplement opportunities available elsewhere. The suggested paradigm involves: assessing needs, identifying opportunities and constraints, matching needs to resources, developing an in-office program, implementing the program, and evaluating the program. For the needs assessment, staff members were asked to evaluate their present level of knowledge and skills and to identify five areas of professional development that interested  them. Sixteen sessions were held as part of the formal in-office program, including the following offerings: word processing, personal computer usage, and finance and budget. Informal portions of the professional development program included a variety of individual and group experiences (e.g., individual efforts to become familiar with the microcomputers and software). Program evaluation involved assessment of costs and benefits and achievement of objectives. (Author/SW)",

The performance of students who took general physics lecture and laboratory concurrently is compared to the performance of those who took them separately. Five years of data are analyzed, covering 1,997 students. The educational outcomes investigation uses the AID3 program to examine a variety of independent variables, including Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, physics lecture grade, student major, student level, high school rank, and student sex. The AID3 analysis indicates that the importance of the concurrent laboratory depends strongly on when in the analysis it is considered. The demographic measures that make a difference in  explaining grades in physics class include: overall grade average, SAT math score, high school rank, and the year in which the student took the course. Finally, some nonadditive interactions occur in the data. It is demonstrated that the research method allows researchers to consider a large number of variables as possible explainers of course performance without making the restrictive assumptions required by other techniques.

        "description":"Factors affecting changes in net tuition revenue in private colleges were studied, and a model accounting for these factors was tested using 1976-1977 and 1977-1978 data. Analysis focused on the influence of tuition price, financial aid, and enrollment. Secondary consideration was given to those institutional characteristics that may distinguish private institutions. Data were obtained from the Higher Education General Information Survey and the College Entrance Examination Board. The primary variables considered were those involved in the direct calculation of net tuition revenue: (1) change in net tuition revenue; (2) change in enrollment; (3) change in financial-aid expenditures; and (4) change in tuition price. A system of four linear equations (one equation per primary  variable) was structured (Fig. 2) to relate pairs of variables, with the aim of computing their total effect on net tuition revenue. Three major steps in data analysis were as follows: testing the assumption that reported gross tuition and fees revenue is equal to the product of full-time-equivalent enrollment and the undergraduate tuition price; testing six assumptions about relationships between changes in net tuition revenue, tuition price, financial aid, and enrollment; and examining signs of other relationships between change variables and institutional characteristics.

After briefly introducing price theory and its use in demand studies in higher education, the major expository articles are reviewed, and major analytical methods used by researchers are examined. Examples from studies that typify these approaches are included, and important facts learned from the literature are summarized. Whether the research was done with multiple regression or with conditional logit analysis, price was seen as an important factor influencing student demand; as price goes up, demand falls. The effect of price varies, however, depending on both the type of student and type of institution. Other factors, such as  student's sex, can moderate the effect of price on student demand. Price was significant in explaining female full-time-equivalent enrollment. The impact of a price change affects students differentially depending on their income and ability levels. The impact also differs across types of institutions. Attention is directed to use of the following analysis techniques: regression analyses with different demand functions, linear probability models, and logit analysis. (SW)",

Sixty percent of the 45 respondents to the state survey (27 states) indicated some use of the HEGIS finance data, but many of these indicated that the uses were quite limited. The inconsistency of the universe of institutions reporting in HEGIS from state to state was revealed. In addition, states varied significantly in strategies for providing student assistance. Variations occurred in the  manner of state funding and in the reporting practices associated with central boards, offices, and commissions. Concerns regarding central support services, debt service, and capital acquisition financing were also addressed. Data are provided on direct student aid provided by states for 1977-1978 and 1978-1979.

Image assessment is the process of finding out what others think about an organization. It is proposed that when image assessments are approached objectively, the results can help determine constituent needs, anticipate vocational trends, survey private and public funding patterns, discover shifts in demographic patterns, and detect inaccurate perceptions so they may be corrected. Since internal factors affect external images of an institution, image assessment efforts should be directed not only to outside constituents, but also to students, faculty, and staff. Assessment zones or circles of assessment influence that surround an institution can be analyzed in terms of prestige,  resource, recruitment, impact, and commorancy (the town, city or suburb in which the institution is located). In addition to goal setting, image assessment should involve systematic categorization of information needs. Within internal and external environments, academic and support items may be grouped according to their essential qualities (i.e., cost, administration, evaluation, maintenance and repair, and expansion). Research techniques for collecting data are identified, and the use of image-assessment results for institutional decision-making is discussed. (SW)",

Marginal costs, as defined in economics, is the change in total cost associated with producing one additional unit of output. In higher education, the most frequently selected unit of output is a full-time-equivalent student or, alternatively, a student credit hour. After reviewing several aspects of the microeconomic theory of costs, detailed analysis is provided of the three basic methods of estimating marginal costs: the regression method, the fixed- and variable-cost method, and the incremental-cost method. For each method, definitions and examples of cost calculations are provided, along with information on data and analytical requirements and strengths/weaknesses. In addition, a  literature review is included that indicates the following: the use of statistical costs analysis in which marginal costs are estimated is essentially the same sort of undertaking in higher education as it is in other enterprises, such as business and industry, hospitals, and primary and secondary education; the typical approach to developing specific costs functions has been pragmatic; and basic elements of the microeconomic model are seldom realized in applied work.

The following institutional perspectives are addressed: current fund revenues, sources of revenue, fund balances, and unit revenues. Investor-consumer dimensions that are covered include: the federal government's share, the state and local government's share, voluntary support, the institutional share, the student and family share, and the total amount of resources going to higher education. For each topic, a brief overview of the concepts  involved is provided, along with information on the specific data issues having to do with calculations or derivations, and data problems (e.g., errors, omissions). Tables and figures that provide basic data in different contexts (e.g., current versus constant dollars) are included. Appendices include: the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems taxonomy of colleges, the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS) on finance, and instructions and definitions for the HEGIS survey.

Different methodologies for studying price changes as they might be applied to expenses facing the student are examined, especially the Laspeyres-type index, whose methodology is comparable to the Consumer Price Index, The Higher Education Price Index, and other price series. Tuition trends at lower-priced and higher-priced institutions are also examined. Additional areas of analysis include:  differences between public and private institutions in room and board charges, regional pricing differences, and other student expenditures (books and supplies, personal, and transportation).

A chart is provided of potential data sources concerning student financing, and the capabilities and limitations of the sources. Student financing data obtained from the National Longitudinal Surveys of 1972-1976 and the Cooperative Institutional Research Program annual survey are analyzed. The findings describe the total population in terms of student, nonstudent, nonresponse, missing data, and invalid data categories. In  addition, the findings provide a time-series profile of how selected students have financed their education, and detail student net prices using two calculation methods. The four major categories of student financing data are student savings and earnings, family support, scholarships/grants, and loans. The survey data are analyzed by sex, race, socioeconomic status, parental income, academic ability, high school program, siblings in school, and institutional level and control. (SW)",

Several issues are addressed to help administrators who are interested in increasing the organization's rational decision-making. The five models are as follows: the rational model, the collegial model, the political model, the bureaucratic model, and organized anarchy. In the case study, five criteria essential to the rational approach are compared to the budget events of 1970-1979. These criteria are: values and objectives, alternatives, centralization of decision-making, understanding of consequences, and value-maximizing choice. It is suggested that prior to implementing rational  decision-making, administrators should be aware of the need for certain organizational conditions: a firm definition of values, a sense of stability, and consistency in decision-making. Administrators also need to be alert to the issue of centralization/decentralization and to the differences among strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. The 18-month budget cycle used at Stanford University is outlined in chart form, and the results of a regression equation that used priorities to predict departmental budgets are included. (SW)",

Recommendations are offered about the goals of undergraduate education and about practical steps for achieving them, including seven recommendations for increasing student involvement, eight recommendations for realizing high expectations, and  four recommendations for assessment and providing feedback. Also included are two recommendations to graduate schools, four recommendations to external agencies (state and system-level officials, accrediting agencies, state legislatures, and boards of trustees), and one recommendation to the research community. Advice to students concerning student involvement in learning, expectations, and role in assessment of higher education is also provided.

        "description":"The historical development of the liberal arts college in the United States and its status in the 1980s are discussed. Although for nearly 300 years, liberal arts colleges have been a dominant force in North American higher education, in the 1980s they have come to constitute a small and decreasing portion of postsecondary education. The position of the liberal arts college began to recede after World War II. At least two factors contributed to the maintenance of the English form or pattern in America: American colleges were designed to serve a particular constituency and were relatively isolated from one another; and they were responsible to local boards of control consisting of lay persons. By the 1920s the liberal arts college had accepted a combination of basic education and  specialized education. The curriculum continued to expand, and so did the degrees, until by the 1970s, 650 bachelor's degrees could be identified. Debates have continued over the proportions of the curriculum to be devoted to general education, the major, and electives. The critical element is the ability of liberal arts colleges to retain their historic orientation while adapting to the expectations of the contemporary student. Some liberal arts colleges stand between the purely comprehensive and the purely liberal arts types. (SW)",

Three elements that account for their character and unity are: a commitment to academic values, distinguished faculties, and considerable resource bases and resource flows. Research universities have been classified by different criteria, including those of the Carnegie Classification. In addition to about 20 institutions that are the most prestigious and most involved in high-dollar, big-science research, there is a second tier of research universities that can be distinguished as having generally smaller departments and graduate programs that are not top-ranked in national quality rankings. These institutions can be designated as regional research universities. A third  group of research universities (but not necessarily a third or lower tier) consists of flagship state universities, land-grant universities, and large private universities that undertake large amounts of research, but also have substantial amounts of undergraduate teaching. Undergraduate teaching and research at 20 top-ranked research universities are discussed, along with academic values and resources. Current finances at the schools and undergraduate education are also discussed. (SW)",

The several models of organizational effectiveness compared include: the goal model, the system resource model, the internal process model, the strategic constituencies model, the competing values model, the legitimacy model, and the model of ineffectiveness. Questions are identified that force investigators to make decisions about the  key sources of controversy regarding organizational effectiveness studies and to help channel debate into more productive avenues. These questions deal with the perspective from which effectiveness is judged, the domain of activity being considered, the level of analysis being used, the purpose of the assessment, time frame, type of data gathered, and the referent used to make judgments. In addition, characteristics of effective administrators are detailed. They include such things as sensitivity to how decisions are made, establishing a &quot;risk neutral&quot; culture, nurturing critical support groups, acting responsibly, increasing communication, and maintaining an organizational image.

It is noted that a more detailed synthesis of the research has also been published (IR 011 208). Research topics covered in the booklet include computer literacy and the use of microcomputers in general learning and for instruction in mathematics, music, reading, science, and typing. For each of the 22 studies listed, information is provided on authors, date of publication, topic, population studied,  methodology, and outcomes. A survey by Henry Jay Becker, concerned with the distribution of microcomputers in schools in the United States, is described in more detail and information is quoted directly from the Becker study on the typical micro-owning elementary and secondary school. It is concluded that instructional microcomputing has been demonstrated to be a valuable educational tool and most effective as an adjunct to traditional instructional tactics. Also provided are bibliographic citations for each of the research studies tabulated and lists of the advisory board members and regional exchange staff of the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory.

        "description":"A three credit undergraduate course, offered through a University of Texas Gifted and Talented Program to qualified high school students, used material objects in a museum to promote visual thinking. Fourteen students were enrolled in the course, which included four interacting units of study: (1) using the operations and strategies of visual thinking; (2) responding to the visual elements in artworks and artifacts; (3) interpreting artifacts in their historical context; and (4) designing small exhibits. A formative evaluation used a written test matched to course goals which was administered prior to, at the midpoint, and at the end of the course. Results indicated that students emphasized fact-seeking in the questions they applied to objects, and that they could respond to  visual elements in describing objects but could not apply those same elements to object exhibition. The most demonstrable contribution of the course to student learning was in thematic awareness. The study suggests developmental stages for the ideation and communication of imagery. These stages assume that skill develops from the following: (1) exposure to models of expressed imagery; (2) practice in seeing wholes and parts and opportunities to repattern perceptions; (3) activities in graphic ideation which consciously remove existing labels; and (4) efforts to replace the old labels with new ones that communicate mental impressions through visuals and words.

A brief, historic overview of educational computing is followed by a review of the Becker (1983) survey, which concerned the distribution of microcomputers in education in the United States, and of several other survey studies that provide a framework for viewing the research. Differences in research using microcomputers and main frame computers are outlined. Case studies and reports suggest the types of microcomputing efforts that are representative of the major areas of emphasis in instructional microcomputing. Specific research studies on microcomputers are then grouped by the following content areas: general learning,  computer literacy, mathematics, music, reading, science, and typing; a summary is provided for each content area. Conclusions based on the research reviewed indicate that instructional microcomputing can be a valuable educational tool; that affective factors such as motivation and self-esteem are enhanced through the inclusion of microcomputers in an instructional setting; and the use of instructional microcomputing is most effective as an adjunct to traditional instructional methods.

Two meta-analysis reviews of CAI have been completed at the University of Michigan, one on secondary school teaching and one on college teaching, and their findings have been independently verified by independent meta-analyses. Conclusions are that CAI (1) has real potential as a tool in improving student achievement in precollege classes; (2) fosters positive attitudes toward the computer; and (3) can produce substantial savings in instructional time. Findings on CAI outcomes are very robust, with differences in instructional environments, samples of students used, and methodological designs of studies having no substantial  effects on outcomes of CAI and conventional teaching. The effectiveness of CAI may be limited by its use as a complete replacement for conventional instruction and enhanced by the use of up-to-date programs and computers. A safe conclusion is that the computer can be used to help learners become better readers, calculators, writers, and problem solvers. Six references are listed. (LMM)",

An analysis of the responses from 1,082 (68% of the sample) microcomputer-using, public and non-public, elementary and secondary schools surveyed between December 1982 and March 1983, suggests that where schools locate microcomputers does have an impact on how they are used. Keeping microcomputers solely in classrooms has largely negative consequences, although equity of use is improved for secondary schools, while putting computers into a laboratory situation has generally positive consequences, except for equity. Locating computers in libraries may improve equity in elementary schools and increase use by secondary teachers and students, but  has little impact on learning or social and organizational outcomes. Rotating microcomputers from room to room is generally positive for secondary schools and improves equity and access at elementary schools, but allows insufficient time for student learning with the computer. Dispersing microcomputers among several locations has negative consequences for elementary schools, but provides increased microcomputer access to larger groups and a broader range of activities in secondary schools.

Preliminary results indicate that districts vary greatly in microcomputer implementation, although little variability in implementation strategies has been found among principals. Almost all principals favor instructional use of microcomputers and give teachers much of the responsibility for expanding the school computer program, although few principals have much microcomputer-related knowledge. Teachers coordinate  computer uses with other instructional materials and with the curriculum, though the type or degree of coordination varies for different reasons. Three phenomena seem to characterize successful integration of computers in instruction: individualized assignments, group computer activities, and teachers' examination of feedback on students' computer activities. Microcomputers are more likely to be integrated into ongoing instruction--and used in different ways--when they are inside or directly accessible to classrooms. Elementary schools are more apt to put microcomputers inside classrooms, while secondary schools frequently favor lab type arrangements. However, differences among teachers seem most prominent in how computers are used for instruction. Courseware knowledge rather than  hardware and programming knowledge appears most important for teachers who wish to vary modes of instruction and student grouping, and to match courseware to individual students.

The first section covers the project's experiences with conducting three satellite teleconferences, which were originally designed as work sessions to involve project staff and state team members in the development of video modules and other awareness/training materials. Problems in the perception of the medium as a presentation medium rather than a communication medium are discussed, and some general thoughts, perceptions,  and rules-of-thumb about video teleconferences are offered.

It is comprehensive because it attempts to look at a variety of concerns facing all types of library resources in Pennsylvania. The goal of the study, which was undertaken in October 1981, was to review the major issues of resources, technology, and access which affect the users of libraries. In February 1983, the State Library sent out 4,308 questionnaires--of which 32% were returned--to sample members of various  organizations and interest groups represented on the Planning Council to ascertain their reactions to the proposed courses of action. After choosing the most important and politically feasible courses of action, the Planning Council reached consensus on the 19 recommendations that became the basis of this plan. This report divides the final recommendations into three broad areas: quality of service, materials and resources, and management practices. Eight appendices provide further details about the study and the library survey form. (DMC)",

The report, &quot;Public Sector/Private Sector Interaction in Providing Information Services,&quot; prepared by the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS), Public Sector/Private Sector Task Force, was used as a core document. In addition, NAC commissioned a concept paper by Glyn Evans, Executive Director, SUNY/OCLC. Discussion groups were formed to explore how the principles and recommendations of the report to NCLIS related to special services provided by either a public or private sector agency. The groups concluded that while equity of  access and preservation were of concern, these services could, with appropriate safeguards, be supplied by either sector. In addition to the report of the meeting, this document includes a list of the NAC members, an executive summary, and four appendices: (1) a background reading list; (2) a review and summary of the NCLIS task force report by Robert M.

        "description":"A controversial issue involving online computer searching is the effect of patron presence during the computer search. The purpose of this research was to determine the attitudes of university librarians toward patron presence. A survey was used to explore variables related to the search process and searcher characteristics. Also considered was the degree to which a searcher believes that patron presence contributes to searcher nervousness. Three-hundred eighty online searchers, representing 85 libraries, were willing to participate. Of the 201 surveys (52.9%) returned, 198 were usable. Eleven Likert scale items were used to estimate attitudes along a five-point continuum of &quot;strongly agree&quot; to &quot;strongly disagree.&quot; The relationship of searcher experience and the attitudes  reflected in the Likert scale items were measured by four additional variables. Overall, 77% of the searchers indicated a preference for patron presence during the computer search. Empirical research is necessary in order to understand how the variables of presence, nervousness, and ability to refine the search are related. The conclusions about searcher attitudes and beliefs about the search process resulting from this study can provide direction to research that focuses on the actual search process, and the dynamics of the searcher-patron relationship.

        "description":"For the remainder of the century, large numbers of students will transfer from two-year to four-year colleges. In light of this, two- and four-year mathematics faculty need to sharpen their understanding of each other and to plan improved interaction. The problem in communication between two- and four-year mathematics faculty comes from living in different and separate worlds and a tendency to stereotype the other--two-year faculty are seen as being without standards and as pseudo mathematicians; while the four-year faculty are viewed as aloof and ineffective with undergraduate students. Both groups need to recognize that the other has unique and important contributions to make in a dialogue. The two-year faculty members need to visit the four-year campus to teach, work, and  experience the environment that their students will encounter. The four-year faculty must recognize the outstanding teaching that generally takes place at two-year colleges. Both have to work together on projects that benefit them mutually and their students. In particular, they need to discuss curriculum and standards, the entry-level preparation of incoming students, and details of mandated common state curricula where these exist. Both groups should begin by treating each other as equals and should interact, particularly at the local level, to develop mutual respect as the foundation for future cooperation. (Author/HB)",

        "description":"During the 1960's and 1970's, basic math programs were established at many two-year colleges after the influx of poorly prepared students, which resulted from a weakening of the exit criteria at the secondary level and of the entrance requirements at the postsecondary level. Though the success of these remedial programs is a matter of debate, depending on the standpoint and criteria adopted by those making the judgement, there are major ways of making these programs more effective. Some guidelines for increasing program effectiveness include: (1) providing an appropriate curriculum that focuses on the skills that will be needed in college and on the job; (2) ensuring that students who need help get it; (3) developing programs that respond to the special needs of the students; (4)  providing each program with sufficient resources to carry out its work; and (5) protecting the integrity of the program and the college degree. Reducing the need for remedial math programs will involve broad policy decisions which might include raising entrance requirements in the two-year colleges, strengthening the math component of the secondary school curriculum, and allowing students to bypass basic computational skills by using calculators.

Chapter III investigates course efficiency patterns among the college's academic disciplines, assessing disciplines according to the percentage of students who passed courses with a grade of C or higher and those who received no grade or withdrew from the courses. In chapters IV and V, results are presented from a survey of the perceived educational and personal needs of students, and a survey of their evaluations of college programs and services.

        "description":"These two papers present opposing arguments regarding the issue of using market factors to determine faculty salaries. In the first paper, Thomas E. Wagner begins by outlining factors that are relevant to determining faculty pay, including years of service, academic rank, teaching ability, research and scholarship, community and institutional service, type and location of the college, and market value of the professor's discipline. Next, five approaches to determining institutional salary rates are highlighted and the applicability of the principle of &quot;pay for market value&quot; to each of the models is discussed. Finally, Wagner describes the method of determining faculty salaries used at Oakland University, which uses a combination of years of service, rank, market value, and merit  component. In the second paper, Billie Wright Dziech argues against market value salary structures, indicating that the current competition with business and industry is a temporary, rather than a permanent condition. She urges colleges to be cautious about institutionalizing the practice, stressing that community colleges cannot compete financially with business and industry, that these institutions lack the flexibility to respond to fluctuations in the market place with salary cuts and lay offs of tenured personnel, that wide gaps in compensation promote internal conflict, and that devaluing the salaries of humanities faculty undermines the intrinsic values of higher education.

        "description":"Since 1975, the Center for the Study of Higher Education, the Pennsylvania State University, and the National Council of State Directors of Community and Junior Colleges have cooperated in an annual review of state legislation affecting two-year colleges. The purpose of the reviews has been to identify and analyze pertinent legislation throughout the United States and to probe the issues which attract public policy action and attention. An analysis of 1983 legislation, based on information provided by state officials in all 50 states and 4 U.S. territories, revealed that: (1) 1,127 pieces of legislation encompassing 1,198 relevant issues or topics were reported; (2) of these, 54.4% had been enacted, 23.9% were pending, and 21.7% were not enacted; (3) finances and administrative  issues were the major legislative concerns, representing 29.6% and 28.3% of the legislation introduced, respectively; (4) 17.4% dealt with personnel questions, with the most frequently addressed issue being employment benefits; (5) the amount of legislation increased by 28.7% over 1982, showing a tenfold increase since reporting began in 1976; and (6) when state directors were asked to rank the importance of various pieces of legislation, financial issues comprised 37.2% of the items deemed important.

        "description":"This supplementary report presents testimony on the community college transfer function given to the California Postsecondary Education Commission's Ad Hoc Committee on Community College Transfer. First, Paul Elsner discusses developments related to transfer and articulation with four-year institutions within the Maricopa Community College District (MCCD). Following background information on the district, Elsner discusses MCCD involvement in national projects conducted to develop transfer programs and improve humanities instruction; describes transfer developments in Arizona; and examines the district's course equivalency system, honors programs, and a transfer opportunity program at South Mountain Community College. He then responds to the Committee's questions regarding  tuition, remedial programs, counseling, adult education, trends in student interest and course openings, and Hispanic enrollments. Next, Arthur Cohen begins his testimony by underscoring the importance of the transfer function in light of the fact that community colleges serve as the first point of entry to higher education for many who would not otherwise be able to attend college. He then considers problems in assessing the effectiveness of the transfer function, distinguishes transfer programs from liberal arts programs, discusses ways in which the transfer function can be enhanced, and suggests ways the Ad Hoc Committee could serve its purposes. Finally, minutes of the June 11, 1984, meeting of the Committee are presented. (HB)",

The major components involved in achieving this goal are: (1) becoming a community with a strong core of shared values based on behaviors that enhance the work environment, such as trust, honesty, fairness, cooperation, creativity, and risk taking; (2) encouraging staff to become more responsible with respect to their own behaviors; and (3) creating more options and more time for growth using strategies such as setting aside work days during which administrators read,  write, and plan for professional growth; using resource consultants to provide logistical support for administrators; developing a comprehensive council structure to encourage grassroots involvement in decision making; and encouraging free-forming groups to pursue innovative and creative activities. As the District personnel focus on their values, become more self-aware, and develop more options for professional growth, they are becoming a community capable of stimulating and supporting each other. &quot;A Commitment Statement of the Dallas Community College District: Organizational Values&quot; is appended.

        "description":"Drawing from recent research, this paper attempts to refute some of the commonly held assumptions about the inevitable decline of intellect as part of the aging process and point to ways educators can expand educational opportunities for older adults. After exploring some of the myths and stereotypes about senile, disoriented, helpless, rigid, unproductive, and slow old people, and explaining that these myths are believed by older adults as well as their children, the paper examines recent research findings that belie these assumptions. Among these findings are the following: (1) barring illness or disease, aging is associated with a slowing down of information retrieval functions, but not with a loss of intellect or an impaired ability to learn; (2) when older workers are  allowed to self-pace the intake of information, they can use their experience in problem solving and exhibit as much or more competence as their younger colleagues; (3) society's negative view of the elderly fosters erosion of self-reliance and internal locus of control; and (4) studies of the television viewing habits of older adults indicate that these people are not disengaging, but rather want to remain informed and involved in life and human affairs. The final sections address ways that educators can help increase the involvement of older people in education, suggesting that they be offered activities and pursuits appropriate to their abilities.

First, information is presented on the hearing and its objectives, together with a list of presenters, and the development of the position paper is described. The next section begins with statistics on vocational education nationwide and the community college's prominence at the postsecondary level and then summarizes hearing presenters' views on the current state of vocational education. Highlights are the community colleges' responsiveness to quick-start training requests from state departments  of commerce; worker retraining and technical assistance to business and industry as major vocational education functions; changes in career counseling; and a sound funding base for vocational education. The next section summarizes the presenters' perceptions of the future, noting the need to equip people to adapt to a variety of jobs; the continuing demand for engineers and engineering technicians; the likelihood of close national scrutiny; and employer demand for advanced level skills from two-year college graduates. Finally, a compilation of the changes suggested by the presenters is provided, including the need to decrease student waiting lists, eliminate governance problems, upgrade technical faculty, and increase company-specific training.

Data were collected on transfer and occupational-technical offerings from 160 public two-year colleges that enrolled fewer than 2,500 headcount students, identified themselves as rural, and offered associate degrees in both transfer and occupational programs. An index of comprehensiveness was constructed to measure both the breadth and depth of curricular offerings in transfer and occupational programs. Study findings included the following: (1) with the exception of professional work in architecture, engineering, and agriculture, the majority of the small rural colleges offered a  wide variety of transfer programs, courses, and course sequences; (2) larger community colleges were able to offer more diverse transfer programs than their smaller counterparts; (3) differences among institutional types in occupational-technical programs were much more pronounced, with curricular comprehensiveness increasing with size; (4) there was a wide range of program diversity among institutions of similar size and setting; (5) small rural community colleges received special considerations from funding agencies; and (6) a number of instructional practices, curricular designs, cooperative ventures, and staffing plans were identified as means of offering additional courses.

        "description":"Statistics indicate computer use is increasing in homes, schools, libraries, recreation centers, camps, and parks. However, the relative effects of computer use on children with ready access to computer-based technologies and on children who have only limited experience with such technologies is at question. The source of impact is the computer software that touches children's lives. Various authors have argued that children can reach the stage of formal operations within certain content areas while remaining in the stage of concrete operations in others. The use of &quot;general-purpose&quot; computers can give children power and control resulting from their mastery of command structures to direct the operation of the computer. The roles of patterning, sequencing, and conditional  reasoning in the creation of programs; in the use of general purpose software; and in the acquisition of programming skills are important. Contrary to general-purpose computer software, &quot;canned programs&quot; direct children's attention toward specific goals, and the child's interaction with the program requires the use of some fixed set of responses to achieve those goals. Computers are currently being used to simulate activities and provide skill drills. Incidental effects of these programs will include higher levels of expectation of graphic, textual, or sound reward for good performance and, possibly, heightened awareness of computer capability.

        "description":"This discussion highlights the findings of the National Employer Supported Child Care Project, which was conducted in 1981 by the Administration for Children, Youth and Families and the Child Care Information Service (of Pasadena, California). Statistics are also cited on the increasing general demand for child care, especially for children under age 3. Among the project findings summarized are data on employers who provide day care, the sorts of programs they provide, and the characteristics of program users. About half of the 415 firms reported benefits such as reduced turnover and absenteeism, improved productivity, enhanced recruitment, and improved public relations. While these reports are based on anecdotal evidence, corroborating evidence from current studies is mentioned.  The future direction of employer supported child care is discussed in terms of five major trends: (1) decentralization of planning, which may produce integrated child care systems tailored to the needs of individual communities; (2) greater flexibility in personnel policies, which may provide greater options for parents; (3) flexible benefits programs, which may include child care; (4) growing national awareness of work/family issues, which may be translated into more sophisticated child care systems; and (5) continuation of the federal government's role in creating tax provisions and disseminating information that will facilitate employers' child care efforts.

The two major issues addressed by the study were (1) Who receives compensatory education (CE)? and (2) How effective is CE? Related to these primary issues were a number of secondary questions: (3) What is CE? (4) What is the nature of the process of classroom instruction in elementary education? (5) What happens to the achievement of students when their CE services are discontinued? (6) Is there an optimal duration and period for receipt of CE services? (7) What happens to student achievement over the summer, and is summer school effective? (8) What is the nature of the home environment of elementary school students? and (9) What  are the relative contributions of socioeconomic background and schooling toward school achievement? To obtain answers to these questions, a large amount of data was gathered through a complex design. Five substudies were initially planned: a longitudinal study assessing educational achievement for 3 consecutive years; a study of successful instructional practices in high-poverty schools; a study of participant characteristics and relationships among economic status, educational need, and instructional services received; a cost-effectiveness study focusing on resources and services to which students were exposed during reading and math instruction; and a study of the effectiveness of summer school programs. A sixth substudy was added later and involved following a limited sample of  students into their high school years. Numerous instruments were used to gather data from students and teachers.

(EPM's are statistical formulas that produce scoring systems used to distinguish applications likely to result in excess benefits from applications likely to be accurate.) A sample of 2,480 cases from the National Evaluation of the School Nutrition Programs (NESNP) database was used in the analysis: 1,984 cases were used to develop the model, and 486 were set aside to test the model after its development. The statistical procedure used to generate the initial EPM, sequential search, made use of the Automatic Interaction Detector program. Although analysis of the NESNP  data successfully produced an EPM, the model had two major deficiencies. Therefore, data from the 1981-82 Income Verification Pilot Project (IVPP) were used to continue exploring EPM development. The random sample consisted of 741 families from 54 schools participating in Phase 1 of the IVPP. Results showed that the model developed from the NESNP database was validated on in-home audit data. The goal of producing a simple but effective EPM also was achieved. The resulting scoring profile was found to be capable of selecting a subgroup of applicants who have a 70 percent probability of receiving excess benefits. (RH)",

        "description":"Presented in this report are selected findings of the Income Verification Pilot Project (IVPP), an investigation examining misreporting of applicant income and family size on applications for government-sponsored school meal benefits. As reported here, Phase II of the project provided for a comprehensive assessment of specific quality assurance procedures in a national sample of school districts during the 1982-83 school year. Participating were 16 states and a sample of 114 school districts: 29 experimental sites where seven quality assurance procedures were tested and 85 control sites. After the first chapter's brief introduction, chapter 2 explains the various quality assurance procedures examined. Chapters 3 and 4 describe the research design and data collection procedures.  Chapter 5 presents findings concerning the feasibility and effects of free and reduced-price school meal applications that were developed specifically for use in the IVPP. Findings on feasibility and effects of requiring income documentation with the free and reduced-price school meal applications are reported in chapter 6. Chapter 7 presents findings on the feasibility and effects of quality assurance procedures used after school meal applications are processed. Finally, results and conclusions of the pilot project are summarized in chapter 8. Appendices include the IVPP application for free and reduced-price school meals, a summary of experimental school districts' characteristics, a measurement of quality assurance procedure costs, and a nonresponse analysis.

        "description":"Part of a 10-year project that will follow five waves of educationally advantaged children from preschool through the fourth grade, this study examined the immediate effects of attending preschool on social competence. Once in the year prior to kindergarten entry and again near the conclusion of kindergarten, trained testers completed the California Preschool Competency Scale for all 104 subjects during two half-hour observations of the subjects in a group setting. Seventy-three of the children had attended a university preschool for at least two semesters prior to attending kindergarten. The control group had been applicants for the same preschool but had not been chosen to attend by a random selection process. Children who attended preschool were rated as more socially  competent than those who did not. In addition, children were rated as more socially competent at the end of kindergarten than prior to attending. There was evidence that preschool attendance is of particular value in developing the social skills of young boys. Finally, it was suggested that further study and aggregation of new waves of data will be needed to determine how enduring the influences of preschool experience are in the lives of educationally advantaged children.

        "description":"This paper reports preliminary findings of a 3-year study examining the ability of qualitative and quantitative measures of the home environment variables (HEV's) to contribute to the prediction of third- through fifth-grade students' achievement and growth scores in reading and mathematics. Data were obtained for 198 parent/student pairs from four rural and small urban Wisconsin communities. Three sets each of achievement and growth scores were regressed on selected variables derived from parents' responses to a half-hour telephone interview. Each regression equation also contained a measure of the child's academic aptitude as the predominant predictor. Several HEV's provided significant and durable additional predictive capacity to that provided by the aptitude index. These  included (1) hours of maternal employment (negatively associated with all students' and boys' achievement in both reading and math); (2) family socioeconomic status (positively associated with all students' and boys' reading growth and all students' reading achievement); and (3) parents' feeling that the school's greatest strength was the quality of its academic programs (positively associated with girls' reading and math achievement and math growth). Also examined was the indirect link between home environment and academic attainment through HEV associations with self-concept variables related to achievement. In this case, no substantial link was identified. (RH)",

        "description":"Reported in this paper are the findings of five meta-analyses assessing the relationships among children's interpersonal cognitive problem-solving (ICPS) skills, training, and behavioral adjustment. Five hypotheses were examined: (1) Adjusted children score higher on ICPS measures than do nonadjusted children; (2) Children trained in ICPS skills demonstrate a higher level of ICPS skills at posttesting than do controls; (3) Teachers' posttest behavior ratings are more positive for trained children than for controls; (4) Social behaviors observed at posttesting are more positive for trained children than for controls; and (5) A direct relationship between increased ICPS skills and improvement in behavioral adjustment can be substantiated. Findings indicated that effects exist for  the first three hypotheses. Magnitude of difference for the fourth and fifth hypotheses was not large, and the small magnitude of effect for the fifth hypothesis casts doubt on the application of the analytical theory. To extend the analysis, boundary conditions were investigated, and studies involving only special populations were examined. It was concluded that while the meta-analytical model and interventions delineated by Shure and Spivack (1979, 1980, 1982) do show reliable, if not always large, effects across studies, continued replication and refinement are needed.

        "description":"While forecasting what the sociopolitical climate will be like in the year 2000 is extremely hazardous, it is possible to discuss some long term societal trends and to offer a personal list of items that, it is hoped, will be on the agenda for education. Long term trends which will probably continue to influence society include the increasing similarity of the sexes, particularly in such areas as child rearing functions and responsibilities, the increasing sophistication of children, and the steady raising of criteria for what constitutes the \"good life.\" Education in the year 2000 can also be approached by formulating answers to questions of what will then be conceivable, possible, feasible, practical, and desirable. However, these answers are amorphous due to our lack of  knowledge about future conditions and are highly individual because they are colored by our personal values. A list of desirable agenda items for education includes (1) the quality of life as a focal variable, (2) assessment of children on a measure of thriving, (3) emphasis on aesthetics, (4) development of interethnic and interracial harmony, (5) emphasis on the development of social competence, (6) development of interest in something outside of the self, (7) parent participation in child care, and (8) improvement of public understanding of child development and education.

Subjects, divided almost equally by sex, were mostly white and primarily middle-class. Questions were specifically designed to elicit information regarding (1) why and how friendship termination occurs; (2) the perceived frequency of termination in the child's peer group; and (3) the child's personal experiences with termination, including details on when the event occurred and on the child's affective and behavioral reactions. Results indicated that the experience of friendship termination is perceived as a meaningful event in a child's life. Only a few grade differences emerged in the reactions to  termination, and sex differences were inconsistent across questions. Girls were more reluctant than boys to initiate breakups, and girls in general also appeared to be somewhat less casual than boys about breakups. Though they did not differ from boys in their affective reactions to termination, girls were more likely to discuss the event with others, and they were also more likely to tell their partner explicitly that they had decided to terminate the relationship.

A central registry/clearinghouse operation provides an automated capability that establishes, for a common purpose, records containing entries of data relevant to cases serviced within a jurisdiction. The central registry/clearinghouse allows CSEP users to collect, classify, record, store, track, and distribute information for child support enforcement activities. Chapter I of this publication indicates basic characteristics of the  registry/clearinghouse, points out benefits, and discusses alternative approaches to designing a statewide system. Chapter II explores issues for state program administrators to consider in planning to adopt a central registry/clearinghouse. Chapter III provides program overviews focusing on how Oregon, Missouri, and Nevada have operationalized the registry/clearinghouse concept and how programs have addressed many of the implementation considerations presented in chapter II.

        "description":"Illustrated with examples drawn from the experience of one teacher educator, ways of providing prospective teachers at the college level with active learning experiences based on developmental principles are discussed. The discussion draws parallels between three approaches in early childhood education and these same approaches to teacher education. Specifically examined are behavioristic-learning, cognitive-developmental, and developmental-interactionist approaches. Core features of each approach are identified, differences between approaches are indicated, and the implications of each approach for educational practice and the individual development of teachers are pointed out. The behavioristic-learning theory approach is viewed as the basis of traditional approaches to teacher  education and is, therefore, only briefly discussed. Emphasis is given to the cognitive-developmental and the developmental-interactionist approaches, which differ mainly in that the latter includes the dimensions of affective and social development. Much discussion of the two developmental approaches focuses on strategies for establishing learning situations that promote individual growth. Particular attention is given to workshops, which encourage increased involvement, and to teacher-made worksheets, which enable students to work independently. Subsequent to a discussion of affective dimensions of workshop experiences, concluding remarks focus on risks involved in using the developmental approaches and on grounds for preferring developmental approaches in early childhood teacher  education.

        "description":"Described in this document are three stages in the emergence and acceptance in West Germany of the situation-oriented approach to education for &quot;kindergarten&quot; children (ages 3 to 6 years). In brief, this approach stresses learning in real-life situations within the community and values the contributions of children, families, and communities. Specifically discussed are three variants of the approach: the situation approach, the situative approach, and the situation-oriented approach. Respectively, variant approaches emphasize the social sciences; the socialization process; and the integration of socialization, situation, and social sciences. Criticisms of these variants are reviewed, and arguments for the priority of social education in early childhood are offered. It is  concluded that (1) the situation-oriented approach and its instructional materials have legitimized preschool education as an academic field and have given it an educational perspective in its own right; (2) research has validated the approach, and criticisms resulting from economic crisis and political conservatism therefore carry little weight; and (3) materials associated with the approach are ready for use in any developed country, and associated methodology may be used for curriculum development throughout the world. An appended chart lists characteristics of each of the variants of the approach. (RH)",

        "description":"The subject of grade retention has generated substantial theoretical, empirical, and practical attention for almost a century. However, few conclusive statements regarding this widespread practice can be made, and the literature has generated mixed results. Reviews of the literature prompt many questions: Does retaining a child in grade increase subsequent academic performance? What are children's perceptions of retained peers? Do retained children have expectations different from those of their nonretained counterparts about performance, school, and teachers? and, Is children's self-esteem affected by grade retention? The first section of this discussion summarizes available data about effects of grade retention on children's academic performance. The second section presents  information about the social behaviors of children who have been retained, including information on how perceptions of others can influence children's school performance and interaction with peers. The third section summarizes data regarding effects of grade retention on children's self-esteem. The fourth section offers suggestions for future research, concluding that grade retention can be beneficial if certain conditions are met. Such conditions concern selection for retention, time of implementation, assessment of academic progress, and emotional support. (RH)",

Researchers in the area have amassed evidence suggesting that cognitive style affects the way students learn, the way teachers teach, and the way students and teachers interact. Focusing on cognitive style and children's learning, this paper (1) provides a brief overview of the field dependence/independence dimension of cognitive style; (2) defines that dimension; (3) describes the most popular instruments used to measure cognitive style; (4) discusses the advantages and disadvantages of cognitive flexibility; (5) identifies the relationship between cognitive style and intellectual functioning, including academic achievement; and (6)  describes students' learning styles and teachers' teaching styles.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to examine the theories and research concerning social comparison and goal setting processes in education and to discuss implications for educational practice and future research. Social comparison and goal setting are important contextual influences on children's task motivation, self-evaluations of capability, and skillful performance in achievement settings. Both processes provide a performance standard against which children can compare their present performance level. Young children's social comparisons with peers focus on practical concerns, such as similarities and differences, equitable shares of rewards, and securing correct answers. The effects of goals depend upon specificity, proximity, and difficulty level. Proximal goals are especially  influential with young children, but will not promote performance if there is no goal commitment. In general, the effects of both processes on motivation, self-evaluation, and skillful performance in achievement settings depends on children's developmental level as well as on process characteristics. Thus, it is important that individuals working with young children view these processes developmentally. Future research should explore the operation of the processes in classrooms to determine how they can be systematically employed to enhance children's task mastery and sense of personal competence.

The first section discusses literature concerning the amount of time students spend in school. Specific attention is given to the quantity of schooling, the allocation of school time, student engagement in academic tasks, and the relationship of these three variables to learning. The second section describes the kinds of activities elementary school teachers typically conduct in their classrooms. The literature reviewed focuses on the format of lessons (especially the recitation format), the relationship between activity format and behavior, characteristics of lesson formats, the signal system of lessons, pacing of lessons, the structure of the school day, and activity  segments. The final section examines two of the major management issues faced by classroom teachers: the management of transitions between activities and the development and implementation of teaching plans. Subtopics discussed in the final section include reducing the length and chaos of transitions through advance preparation, establishment of clear boundaries, use of routines, movement management, and preactive planning.

Subjects were randomly selected from 39 Midwestern and Northeastern companies and hospitals offering no services, on-site or off-site child care, or information and referral services. Results indicated that provision of on-site and off-site child care services by the employer had a positive effect on users' turnover rates; their morale; their perceptions of their job performance; and their decisions to accept and continue employment, to recommend their employer, and to work  overtime. Information and referral services did not have as positive an effect as provision of child care. Other issues discussed in the report are the growth of corporate child care services and their limitations, the extent to which a corporation's public image is enhanced by providing day care, and the government's role in promoting information on corporate day care.

The replicable health communication program consisted of five 5-minute radio episodes, each discussing one risk factor and its symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The episodes centered around a young doctor whose mission was to help his community learn to prevent the three health risks. The final episode urged participation in a subsequent health fair. The episodes were broadcast twice a day over five days on a popular Spanish radio station in  Richmond/Rosenberg, Texas. Pre- and post-tests with groups of adult Hispanic females and follow-up conversations with health fair participants indicated that most listeners were more concerned with obesity than with hypertension or diabetes, but that listener concern with all three problems rose as a result of the programs. Also, listeners' knowledge rose significantly in some areas but not regarding symptoms. Among listeners, 39% took action regarding their health. Listeners were more likely to attend the health fair. Researchers concluded that radio messages can be an effective health education strategy. (SB)",

Like youth in other parts of the country, the students had high educational aspirations. All aspired to high school completion; over 94%, to some additional education; and over 66%, to college or graduate degrees. Females had lower aspirations than males, whites had lower aspirations than blacks, and rural youth had lower aspirations than city and town youth. The students' actual educational achievement fell below their aspirations. By 1972 88% had completed high school,  54.5% had obtained additional education, and only 14.9% had college degrees. Differences in aspirations and achievements were largest at the lower and higher educational levels. Differences in achievement between males and females were greatest in the high school and vocational education categories, although more females than males had college degrees. Differences in achievement between blacks and whites were largest for the high school diploma and college degree categories. Place of residence had little effect on educational achievement. (SB)",

        "description":"A literature survey of more than 800 sources, approximately 140 of which were judged to be relevant, assessed problems Alaska Natives and American Indians experience in learning English language skills required for survival and success in a modern, technological culture. Since the survey was to guide the adaptation and development of instructional materials for elementary and junior high school reading presented by computer, results emphasized receptive rather than expressive language. To some degree the problems of phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics identified were problems facing not only American Indians, but any students learning English as a second language. Morphology problems included American Indian use of inflections to indicate syntatic role of words, use of  gender, and representation of noun modifiers by inflections in nouns. Semantic problems concerned concept development rather than vocabulary growth, particularly in color words and words concerning coercion and duty. Recommendations included providing computer practice with selected minimally constrasting vowel pairs; selected minimally contrasting consonant pairs; final consonants and consonant cluster; selected phonemes that do not exist in some American Indian languages; irregular plural noun forms; selected verb tense forms; determiners; third person singular pronouns; semantic implications of juncture; prepositions, verb-preposition combinations, and idioms; passive and wh- transformations; and basic vocabulary.

        "description":"A literature survey of more than 800 sources, 80 of which were judged to be relevant, assessed the problems Native Alaskans and American Indians experience in learning elementary and junior high school mathematics, and focused on problems amenable to solution through computer presentation of mathematics materials. Empirical evidence indicated that American Indians are 1.7 years behind the national norm in grade 6 mathematics achievement and 3 years behind the norm at grade 12 and the proportion of Indian students with special needs in mathematics rises from 32% in grade 2, to 41% in grade 4, and to 46% in grade 6. Three clusters of problems American Indians experience with mathematics in school concern terms and concepts, time estimation, and student attitudes. Accordingly, it  was recommended that computer presentations of mathematics materials to American Indians should provide practice on mathematics terms and concepts; include units on time estimation; and capitalize on the inherently motivating, \"gaming\" capabilities of computer interaction. The strength of computer presentation is its ability to provide practice that is: entertaining, motivating, and interactive; perceived to be culture-fair and private; easily transported and exactly reproduced; and individualized on an item-to-item basis.

Attended by gypsy representatives, teachers, teacher trainers, inspectors of education and ministerial representatives from eight European states, the seminar also allowed comparison of the schooling problems of other nomads. Discussion focused on gypsy illiteracy, the cultural inappropriateness of gypsy schooling, the place for gypsy culture in education, the environment as a determining factor in schooling, and teacher training. The seminar report includes summaries of two introductory addresses which deal with the schooling of gypsy children and the  relationship of local and regional authorities to gypsies. Summaries of three talks given by gypsy representatives, which dealt with socio-educational problems of gypsy and nomad children and the responsibility of teachers of those children, are also included. The report further contains reports of two study groups on gypsy culture, environment, stereotypes, teacher training, and schooling and on schooling of nomadic Lapp children in Norway and of gypsy children in France, Sweden, and Italy. Finally, 13 recommendations regarding the education of gypsy children conclude the report. (SB)",

        "description":"Operating under a grant, the University for Man (UFM) in Manhattan, Kansas, tested the transferability of the UFM free university/community education model using four existing statewide delivery systems (public libraries, a private college consortium, a state cooperative extension service, an office of rural affairs) in five states: Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Iowa, and Missouri. A review of results showed that Kentucky and Oklahoma successfully replicated the UFM model or a variant through delivery systems. Both states are continuing their replication efforts through existing state agencies. The college consortium in South Dakota and Iowa was moderately successful in introducing the concept of adult learning to the target audience and minimally successful in actually  disseminating programs. Missouri failed to meet project criteria, having chosen not to replicate the model through a delivery system but to survey the state's adult education activities and extrapolate the success of the model. UFM concluded that with enthusiastic staff, proper training, and a firm commitment from a delivery system in advance, the model can be replicated successfully through existing statewide delivery systems. Appendices, which form the bulk of the document, include supporting materials, reports, and evaluation forms from the states; workshop materials and announcments; and conference announcements and proceedings.

The MMCS consists of eight 3-item subscales designed to measure the attributions of success and failure to ability, effort, context or luck. Correlations between achievement motivation and expectancy of success were also examined using the Achievement Motivation Scale (AMS) and Academic Expectancy Scale (AES). At the same time the MMCS was administered, the AMS and AES were randomly administered to  students within classrooms so that 102 students (56 Native Americans, 46 Anglos) received the AMS and 109 (56 Native Americans, 53 Anglos) the AES.

GAO's review of 178 grants and contracts disclosed that the BIA continues to have problems administering and monitoring Indian programs and accounting for federal funds. Repeating the substance of its 1978 recommendations that the BIA revise its policies, procedures, and practices pertaining to contracts and grants with Indian tribes to improve  accountability for federal funds, GAO also suggested that the Secretary of Interior direct the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs to consider three possible alternative organizational structures for the BIA to separate program and procurement functions. This change would eliminate inherent conflicts between those responsible for implementing services and programs and those responsible for monitoring and reporting on tribal grant and contract performance and further the objectives of the Indian Self-Determination Act. GAO also urged Congress to require the Secretary of Interior to report on the progress made in implementing GAO's recommendations. (ERB)",

The 10 contiguous southeastern states which composed the research sites are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Data were collected in late 1981 through interviews with heads of households and examined six major areas: demographic characteristics; occupation characteristics; community and life satisfaction; agency utilization and client satisfaction; attitudes, values, and beliefs; and consumer behavior and  income. The median age for respondents was 45 years or over; more white than black heads of households were surveyed in most states; and fewer than 50% of the heads of household had completed high school, except in Virginia (55%). This basebook provides a history of the project and a description of how the project was conducted. Descriptive tables report frequency distributions within each of the 10-state samples. Numerous subsections within each of the six major areas provide narrative, tables, and information about the survey instrument, where applicable.

Following an introductory chapter, chapter 2 discusses a number of typical problems leading to computational modeling from the viewpoint of the scientific or engineering discipline in which they arise. Areas considered include: hydrodynamic systems; chemical systems and combustion; plasma physics; particle physics; condensed-matter physics; geophysical applications; meteorology; astrophysics; structural mechanics; nondestructive testing and tomographic reconstruction; mathematical models in the biological sciences; and electronic components.  Chapter 3 examines several of the problems from the viewpoint of the computational and mathematical difficulties that arise in connection with them. These difficulties include larger numbers of degrees of freedom, different time or length scales, or singularities of various types. Chapter 4 focuses on the numerical algorithms involved in the computations, such as various discretization methods, continuation approaches, and splitting techniques. Increased support for computational modeling and applied mathematics, computing facilities, and for education and manpower development in these areas is recommended. (JN)",

Following an introduction, the report is organized into two main sections. The first section provides an overview of the Interindustry Forecasting System (IFS) that was used to generate employment projections of SET personnel. It presents pertinent assumptions underlying four scenarios chosen for analysis, and reports total and defense-related employment requirements through 1987. These requirements are presented separately for scientists (computer systems analysts and social,  physical, mathematical, and life scientists), engineers (electrical/electronic, mechanical, aeronautical/astronomical engineers), and technicians (computer programmers, drafters, and science and engineering (SE) technicians). The second section describes the DauffenBach/Fiorito/Folk (DFF) labor supply model, presents information on the importance of various components of the SE labor supply, and provides comparisons of demand and supply projections to assess potential labor market balance. An assessment of projected labor market balance for SE-support technicians is also presented in this section. Information on the IFS and DFF models and supporting data (presented in 20 statistical tables) are included in appendices. (JN)",

        "description":"A random sample of fourth, eighth, and eleventh grade Illinois students has been tested annually since 1976 by the Illinois State Board of Education. This testing program is called the Illinois Inventory of Educational Progress (IIEP). This report presents mathematics achievement results of a random sample of fourth (N=6,103), eighth (N=10,026), and eleventh grade (N=16,264) students tested in 1982, factor analysis results, and teacher survey information. The 1982 testing focused on students' knowledge of mathematical measurement. As such, a three-factor model was developed that provides for three types of measurement units (nonstandard, metric, and conventional), five categories of measurement skills (estimation, conversions within, comparisons between, selecting and/or reading  instruments, and problem-solving), and five types of measurement attributes (length, area, capacity, mass, and temperature). Major findings are presented in separate chapters for each grade level. Two conclusions emerge from these results: (1) students perform at roughly the same level in all aspects of mathematical measurement tested by the IIEP and (2) students are weak in measurement. In addition, students have considerably less problems with the metric system than many people think. (Copies of test instruments, correct answer keys, a sample teacher survey instrument, and other information are included in appendices.) (JN)",

        "author":["Baroody, Arthur J."],
        "description":"Accurate and automatic production of the basic number combinations is a major objective of elementary mathematics education. Typically, it is not an objective that is easily and quickly attained. Indeed, teachers regularly lament about how difficult it is to get their students to master the basic &quot;number facts.&quot; This problem may be due, in part, to educators' misconceptions of how children learn basic number combinations and how number combinations are represented in adult long-term memory. This paper first outlines the historical debate on how number combinations are learned or internalized and then critically reviews the empirical evidence for and conceptual adequacy of current models of how number combinations are represented in and efficiently produced from long-term memory.  An alternative view is offered that argues that, while adults may retrieve some number combinations from associative memory (a &quot;reproductive&quot; process), many combinations can be accurately and automatically produced from stored rules, algorithms, or principles (efficient &quot;reconstructive&quot; processes).

Materials in the kit are suitable for a wide range of grade levels and can be used in indoor and outdoor settings. These materials include a booklet and a set of 15 classroom activities. The booklet, written at an approximate fifth grade level, contains descriptions of 58 threatened and endangered plants and animals in Illinois. Information provided includes how and where the species lives and for what reasons it is facing the possibility of near or complete extinction in Illinois. The descriptions are arranged in sections according to the habitats in which the species are found. These habitats include: (1) prairie and open field; (2) forests; (3) wetlands and  water; (4) dunes, cliffs, bluffs, and caves. Each section begins with a brief description of the physical characteristics of the habitat and the forces that in many cases are rendering habitats unsuitable for the species that depend upon them for survival. Instructional strategies and support information are provided for the 15 activities (which may be duplicated for student use). Activity topics include ecology studies, bird appreciation, a transect study, and others. (JN)",

An instrument was developed on which respondents placed their own choice of best and worst possible careers as endpoints on a 10 point scale. Forty-five additional careers, including careers in science teaching, science, and teaching of subjects other than science were then rated by the students with respect to the endpoints. Careers in teaching were generally rated low by the respondents with the exception of physical education and mathematics teaching. The respondent's race and educational aspirations were shown to have a significant relationship (0.05 level) with the ratings of some science teaching careers. Additionally, the relationship between the type of job held by  the respondent's parents and the rating of science teaching was also significant in some cases. The most obvious result of this study was the verification that eighth grade students do not rate science teaching as a desirable career. Therefore, the shortage of science teachers seen will not likely diminish unless science teaching is made to be a more attractive career goal. (Author/JN)",

Chapter One reports on the status and problems of biology education in India, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Topic areas considered are biology in the school curriculum (including biology content and curriculum development efforts), instructional and curriculum materials, teacher competencies, and teacher education. Chapter two considers new trends in biology education, such as a shift from teaching botany and zoology as separate subjects toward a unified  course of life sciences. The contributions that biology can make toward environmental education programs and the design of instructional materials for students and for teachers are also considered in light of the trends identified. Chapter three provides short descriptions of three teaching and training units. Topic areas of these materials include practical/laboratory techniques for teaching environmental factors, freshwater ecosystem and water pollution, the cell cycle, environmental biology utilizing field studies, types of variations, and the possibility of gamete formation in a dihybrid cross.

To begin that study, one topic, fraction knowledge, was explored in depth as it occurred in natural teaching settings. Fractions are one of the more difficult topics in elementary arithmetic; much of this difficulty is attributable to the complex relationships among the meanings and representations of fractions and basic arithmetic operations. Despite these difficulties associated with fractions, many teachers are quite proficient at teaching children to perform operations with fractions. The content and organization of expert teachers' knowledge of fractions was investigated using interviews, card sorting tasks, and  transcriptions of videotaped lessons. Semantic networks that reflected their knowledge of fractions were developed for individual teachers. Comparisons of these semantic networks showed that there were wide disparities among the knowledge of expert teachers. Some teachers displayed relatively rich conceptual knowledge of fractions while others relied upon precise knowledge of algorithms. Implications of these knowledge differences are discussed.

        "description":"A questionnaire was mailed to 50 major chemistry departments, 112 smaller chemistry departments, and 25 chemical engineering (CE) departments. The survey (included in an appendix) consists of a series of questions on two broad subjects--the current inventory at the surveyed institutions and the needs for instrumentation. Responses were received from 32 major and 71 smaller chemistry departments, and 13 CE departments. (Due to the low response rate from the CE departments, data on these departments does not form part of this report.) Among the findings reported are those indicating that: (1) the median value of on-hand instrumentation at major institutions was $3.3 million while at smaller institutions the median was $104,000; (2) the instruments most commonly mentioned as being  either on-hand or most needed are gas and liquid chromatographs, infrared and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometers, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass, and atomic absorption spectrometers; (3) 15 percent of the instrumentation is not fully operational at smaller chemistry departments and 9 percent at major ones; and (4) NMR instrumentation is needed by most of the chemistry departments. One recommendation noted is that funding agencies should enlarge support for instrumentation purchases, for both research and instruction. (JN)",

Some performance that provides persuasive evidence of understanding was chosen, and hypotheses about cognitive structures and processes that cause the performance to occur were developed. Performance was analyzed on two tasks in high school geometry, developing proofs and checking proofs. For developing proofs, thinking-aloud protocols were obtained from six students who were interviewed approximately once a week during the year they studied geometry. Proof-checking problems were given to 15 different students during interviews in November and May, and a group of 15 college students also were given instruction on proof  checking to ascertain whether it could be acquired. Two characterizations of knowledge that can be adopted as objectives of instruction resulted, one on structural understanding and one in understanding the principle of deductive consequence. (MNS)",

This paper reports an empirical study of six middle-school children who judged the equivalence of three sets of three-term arithmetic expressions with an addition and a subtraction operator. Analyses of thinking-aloud protocols on this task reveal that the students (a) use several different methods to parse and judge the equivalence of such expressions, (b) sometimes use a different parsing or judging method with the same expression, depending on which expression it is compared against, and (c) are able to work with different conceptual interpretations of expressions. Additional results are provided  about specific errors that were made and trends in the students' application of these methods. The results are discussed briefly along with three comments on their educational implications. (Author)",

        "description":"Only by recognizing that class is not gender neutral can the processes of class formation and reproduction be understood. Class is defined as a process in which human beings take an active part, rather than a structure of categories into which individuals may be inserted. Gender organizes or structures class in many different ways. For example, capitalist class structures have always been divided by gender through the sexual division of labor in both paid and unpaid labor. Wages are also gendered. In every wage-based society women earn less than men, and women's jobs have lower wages than men's jobs. Images of work and labor are intertwined with images of gender and sexuality in ideologies that support the class structure. These ideas become incorporated, in the process of  experience, in core images of the self that then inform further action, becoming part of the complex process of maintaining class structures. In the same process, gender inequalities are also reproduced. A gendered conception of class provides a better understanding of women's economic situation than does a theoretical approach that separates the problems of class oppression and sex oppression.

A science with poor concepts will, therefore, be incapable of producing powerful scientific theory. When commonly used social science definitions of society and culture are evaluated according to standard rules for the formulation of definitions, they are found to be fundamentally unsound as scientific definitions. Because the very foundations of the discipline have been poorly constructed, the social sciences have failed to develop elegant scientific theories. The old concepts must be replaced with a set of firmer concepts. Working from a base definition of system, definitions for society and culture are  reformulated. Related concepts are also redefined. The new definitions are proposed as foundations for an alternative social science paradigm. (Author/RM)",

Subjects included 111 individuals from 64 black families living in 9 white suburban communities of a large metropolitan region in the Pacific Northwest. Families completed questionnaires and scales were developed to measure assimilation, pluralism, and marginality. Items in one group of variables--school attitudes, neighborhood attitudes, structural assimilation, and school participation--were conceptualized as assimilationist attitudes and behaviors. Items in another group--pluralist beliefs, uneasiness with whites, anxiety, pluralist behavior total, and the presence of other  black and white individuals in an individual's life--were conceptualized as indicators of pluralist attitudes and behaviors. While this study indicated that most of the subjects valued their interactions with both blacks and whites and tried to live bicultural lives, results also show that the more positive subjects felt about blacks and the more active they were in the black community, the more negative they felt toward predominantly white institutions. Conversely, the more positive subjects felt toward predominantly white communities and the more active they were in them, the less pluralist they were in both attitudes and beliefs. (LH)",

Following a review of past textbook studies and a brief discussion of textbook treatment of foreign policy, the paper uses four major topics (propaganda, U.S./Latin American relations, the war in Vietnam, and nuclear war) to illustrate problems found in textbooks related to peace and security issues. In an examination of 45 textbooks, grades 8-12, the overall treatment of propaganda was rated very good considering the influence of nationalism. However, the topic tended to be ignored after World War II coverage. Overall  textbook coverage of U.S./Latin American relations was rated as poor, although nearly all texts offered some criticism of U.S. policies. Moreover, the perspective of Latin countries was given little mention, and the cultures of the region were ignored. Similarly, in an analysis of coverage of the Vietnam war, only 1 of the 10 textbooks reviewed provided any background about Vietnamese cultural settings, with most focusing primarily on political and military aspects of the war. Additionally, the author reports very slight coverage of nuclear war issues in comparison with other topics in his review of 19 U.S. history textbooks. The paper concludes with recommendations for achieving goals stated in NCSS curriculum guidelines. (LH)",

Similarly, the following section describes obstacles to economics teaching, primarily the lack of adequate treatment of labor, unions, and economic views differing from mainstream capitalism. The final section presents a pedagogy for world economics, emphasizing the importance of controversy and critical skepticism, scrutiny of ideology and nationalism, alternative teacher education and professional socialization, the use of diverse and provocative materials, collateral efforts of professionals, and legal support  for academic freedom.

According to the radical perspective, the ultimate social ideal and the purpose of education is the emancipation of all people. Social studies should concentrate on ideas emphasizing the significance of dominant interests, struggles for autonomy, contradictions, and the social construction of knowledge. Education should generate action toward emancipation. Strengths of this radical perspective include educational objectives that stress long-term social goals, immediate personal agency, cooperative discourse, and an approach to reform that respects the culture of local teachers and students. Weaknesses of  the perspective include its ideological substance; relative silence about pedogogy for dealing with ambiguity, contradiction, and criticism; and neglect of organizational constraints on teaching. Intellectual work and research necessary to resolve concerns that mainstream educators have with the radical perspective include conveying a coherent vision of the social alternatives to be pursued, examining how structures of schooling might be revised, and identifying teaching approaches that guide encounters with ambiguity, contradiction, and criticism.

        "description":"There are ways to meet the need for social studies reform and revitalization other than adopting an &quot;agenda of inquiry&quot; which would incorporate the potentially appealing aspects of the radical perspective, as proposed by Fred M. Newmann. As a result of recent reform reports, many educators have already taken action to improve educational quality. For example, two reform proposals, the Carnegie Report and the Paideia Proposal, are being piloted in some school districts, and professional organizations in the social studies and the disciplines are attempting to influence what is happening in American schools. An agenda of inquiry, if defined as the process of active learning and critical thinking and discourse which will help students become more humane, insightful, and active  citizens, is supported. There are, however, problems with trying to take a radical approach to education: (1) radicals begin with conclusions; (2) radical writing contains mystifying jargon and abstract and deterministic analyses; (3) teachers are not equipped to use the Socratic dialogue; and (4) teachers and academics are not the only ones who can make decisions about curriculum content and teaching methods.

        "description":"This argument for process analysis in moral education focuses primarily on social developmental processes and educational processes that influence the development of moral reasoning structures. The descriptive-developmental approach, the developmental-ethical approach, and the developmental-process approach to moral discourse are briefly described. Based on a ten-year investigation of the nature of moral discussion-based interventions, the author reports that \"transactive\" forms of discussion lead to higher levels of moral understanding by expanding upon, critiquing, or integrating the reasoning of a co-discussant, thus increasing the likelihood of developing more adequate forms of reasoning. Because only about 15 percent of such discourse takes the form of the most  developmentally productive type of transactive discussion, the author proposes that moral and social education in the future look to monitoring and training in social interaction skills in order to maximize the developmental benefits of such programs. Four other future concerns for moral education are presented: (1) theoretical and empirical knowledge of the relationship between moral reasoning and moral behavior must be integrated into moral education practice, (2) the role of affect in moral functioning must be addressed, (3) moral education must be defined more broadly than classroom-based phenomena, and (4) value-based moral education must be integrated with structural \"value-free\" approaches.

This descriptive study is based upon on-hand observations by the author during the course of the program. Thirty eighth-grade students were paired with retired persons who lived in a retirement village. The students collaborated with their partners in a number of tasks, focusing primarily on relationship building. Through a mixture of classroom and field experiences, student activities centered around the themes of communication, history, the aging process, and careers. Specific activities included oral history interviews, daily journal keeping, movie viewing with partners, large and small group discussions, communication  training, readings, reports, simulation, a book-binding project, and party planning. Students received English and history credit for their participation in the six-week partnership program. This curriculum is viewed from the perspectives of academic coursework and collaboration, relationship building and collaboration, and caring and collaboration. Evaluations of the program were positive on an academic as well as an affective and attitudinal basis. Collaboration allowed the children in this program to gain a different view of history, improve communication and listening skills, and learn to cooperate and work with others. (LH)",

Section 1 deals with the conceptualization and development of the Articles of Confederation. Section 2 focuses on delegates who played major roles in the convention. Sections 3, 4, and 5 present three conflicting proposals (the Virginia Plan, the New Jersey Plan, and Hamilton's Plan) which later resulted in the &quot;Great Compromise&quot; (section 6), bringing delegates significantly closer to agreement on a constitution. Section 7 describes the first draft of the Constitution, from which the final document would result some 5 weeks  later. The Federalists (who supported the Constitition) and the anti-Federalists (who opposed it) are described in section 8. Section 9 discusses the Constitution's ratification and section 10 traces the development of the Bill of Rights. Section 11 focuses on measures taken to protect the original document. The final section, the text of the Constitution, presents 7 articles and 26 amendments of the U.S. Constitution.

        "description":"When tracing the status of females in education over the last 200 years, it can be seen that while schools reflected the sexism of the larger society, they differentiated by gender far less than institutions such as the family, the labor market, and government. Although women's access to educational institutions varied by their race and class, middle and upper class women were able to take advantage of the structural integration of educational and employment institutions to gain access to formerly male preserves. Recent literature on the sexism of the schools tends to focus on portrayals of gender in readers such as the absence of females and role differentiation, the channeling of children into stereotypical occupations, and male bias in college admissions and financial awards.  However, a case can be made for the relative androgyny of the schools. As the use of educational credentials became influential in hiring decisions, women were able to lay legitimate claim to more occupations. Women's access to schools, combined with the growth of credentialism, enlarged employment options available to women. Finally, since women's access to education varies by race and class, the growing importance of education for jobs may be linked to a reduced importance for gender and a heightened importance for race and class in structuring employment opportunities.

Section 1 emphasizes the value of primary health-care procedures--midwifery, maternal education on breastfeeding and weaning, vaccinations, oral rehydration of victims of diarrhea, and antibiotics against respiratory infections--in lowering infant and child mortality in developing countries. Part 2 links the availability of clean drinking water and human waste disposal to diarrheal, tropical, and parasitic diseases. Barriers preventing sanitation development in developing countries are outlined and cost figures are presented. Parts 3 and 4 suggest that the toll of heart disease and cancer in middle age can probably be halved with diet modification and the control of  smoking. Educational campaigns for reducing fat and cholesterol consumption, coupled with taxes on tobacco and restrictions on public smoking, are recommended as a way of extending millions of lives into old age at favorable costs. Section 5 offers the best hope of low-cost cures to high-cost diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, and the cancers and diseases of the heart. The document concludes that the implementation of the above strategies deserves a high priority because they will effectively and cheaply save the largest number of lives.

        "description":"Designed for use in a one-semester course in U.S. history or literature at the intermediate or secondary level, this collection of the Civil War letters of Lewis Bissell, a Union soldier, is divided into two major parts. Part I (chapters 1 though 5) covers the period of time Bissell spent guarding Washington, District of Columbia. Each chapter corresponds to a change in locale. Part 2 (chapters 6 through 9) covers the time Bissell was involved in combat and is divided by specific campaigns. The firsthand accounts of the war provided in these letters offer students an insider's view of the Civil War as well as insights into human nature, the experience of war, and Northern society. Where relevant, chapters are introduced by historical background information, overviews of the major  themes in the letters, items for identification, materials for supplemental study, and background information for using the letters in the literature course. Additional notes to the teacher outline possible texts to use in conjunction with the letters and recommendations for course planning. Appendices contain &quot;An Appeal to the Men of Connecticut,&quot; army command structure, a diagram of the armies of the United States, and a &quot;rebel letter.&quot; Although designed as a one-semester course, excerpts from this collection can be integrated into intermediate and secondary social studies or humanities units on the Civil War.

In the first part, four main curriculum components (knowledge, values and attitudes, skills, and social participation) are discussed in terms of specific teaching goals. Charts tag curriculum components to generalizations, concepts, and facts from the social science disciplines. The next part of the guide discusses the organization of a secondary program around the following strands: global studies, U.S. studies, and behavioral studies. Samples include a course guide using the economic concept of  scarcity to highlight elements of a guide, a course outline using history content to show ways a course can be thematically or chronologically organized, and lesson plans using content from citizenship education to chart exemplary lessons in detail. Next, essential elements for planning a secondary curriculum are given, including a list of strategies for effective teaching and learning and suggestions for measuring student performance. The final part presents general objectives for social studies, matching objectives with organizing concepts and grade level. An appendix provides a sample program evaluation checklist, textbook evaluation criteria, and a supplementary evaluation form. A 12-page annotated bibliography concludes the document. (LH)",

Educational structures are needed that not only accept individual differences but also offer explicit recognition of their value to a democratic society. Young people growing up in the information society are going to have to know how to locate information when they need it, and how to analyze, synthesize, interpret, and apply information as it relates to their individual interests and potentials. The long-term improvement of education must be achieved by slow, complex actions built up through community support and strong leadership at the local level. Lifelong learning must be the goal for all educational systems. With this imperative, the rise of community  colleges is significant. The challenge to community colleges is to prepare students for their future as lifelong learners and to instill positive attitudes toward learning. Such colleges can demonstrate to students that they are capable of learning and that learning is a useful, satisfying skill that will serve them well throughout their lives. Community colleges can provide the cognitive skills that serve as the basic tools for lifelong learning. (JD)",

The most ignored fact in the recent reports on excellence is that Black students are better prepared for this period of reform than ever before: Black students' test scores are improving nationwide; the gap between Black and White students' test scores is closing dramatically, though not at the expense of White students; and participation of Black students in demanding academic courses has increased significantly. Many organizations representing minorities have concerns about testing, assuming that if Black students perform less well, the test must be biased. First, test publishers must make sure that the test is indeed not biased; and if it is not, it should be used to  focus public attention on unequal educational opportunities. Several recent trends should be considered warning signals: increasing high school dropout rates among Black students, declining enrollment of Black students in higher education, and the continuing gap between Black and White students' test scores. Vigilance is needed to ensure that the drive for excellence will protect and enhance the hard-won gains in equality of the last 30 years. (BW)",

The data from a national administration of the Mathematics Usage subtest of the ACT Assessment was used in the investigation.

The students were those who had been administered the Louisiana Basic Skills Test in 1982 and who had received remedial services in 1982-83. For students who were retained in Grade 2 the posttest was the 1983 Grade 2 Basic Skills Test; promoted students were administered a parallel test developed for the program's evaluation. All of the analyses controlled for students' pretest  scores. In general the results showed no difference in performance after remediation between students who had been promoted or retained, those in special or regular education, those receiving or not receiving Chapter 1, and those provided with remedial services at different times during the school year. Students who qualified for remediation in both subject areas had lower post-program performance than those who qualified in a single subject. (Author)",

Case analysis of a recently completed National Institute of Education Project (Action Research on Change in Schools) has generated several possible responses to this major question. These responses include how the university researcher: contributes to an effective and efficient group process; establishes a norm of support for risk-taking and role-changing; and broadens individual perspectives by probing the practitioners' experience bases. Other subquestions explored in similar fashion include: What responsibility does the  researcher have to the reality and practicality of the research to be undertaken? What responsibility does the researcher have to limit the team's research to that which has generalizable results, and to identify and/or ignore side issues which are introduced? (BW)",

The goals of the study were (1) to provide background information regarding the contribution of in-school assessment scores and external examination scores to higher education admissions decisions, and (2) to provide information on the external examination essays evaluation process. The first goal addressed questions of bias introduced in each evaluation procedure by the student's socioeconomic background and geographic origin by comparing the average score achieved in school with the average score achieved in the external examination. Informal interviews were undertaken to pinpoint some of the reasons for the differences observed between the two  modes of evaluation. The second goal addressed questions of the validity of teachers-examiners' assessment of essay-type papers in the national examinations. It involved a comparison of the average score assigned by the two official examiners with the average score assigned by two other independent teachers. (BW)",

        "description":"Coleman, Hoffer and Kilgore's claims regarding the effects of Catholic schools on cognitive achievement have evoked much controversy. Critics have argued that the cross-sectional testing data Coleman et al. used could not distinguish differential sector effectiveness from selection effects, i.e., that Catholic schools enroll students of superior academic competency. The First Follow-Up (1982) of the High School and Beyond Base Year Sophomore Cohort allows a stronger design for studying this issue. Using sophomore test performance to control for input-level differences in competency while predicting senior year test performance in several cognitive domains, the &quot;common school&quot; effect found by Coleman and his colleagues disappears. The omission of such input controls leads to a  substantial upward bias in the estimate of Catholic sector effects on achievement. The best estimate of the Catholic sector effect on cognitive growth from the sophomore to senior year, using aggregate sophomore-to-senior year change in performance as a yardstick, is about two-thirds of a year's growth. Differences of this magnitude are judged to be substantively trivial because they correspond to less than .1 standard deviations in test performance. Sector differences in test performance are too small to warrant the attention they have received. (Author/BS)",

Self-efficacy refers to personal judgments of performance capabilities in a given domain of activity. Students enter classroom activities with various aptitudes and prior experiences, which affect their initial sense of self-efficacy for learning. During task engagement, students may assess self-efficacy by utilizing cues made cognitively salient by educational practices and which convey information about their capability to acquire knowledge and skills, such as performance outcomes, attributions, situational circumstances, outcome patterns, perceived model similarity, and persuader credibility. In turn, heightened learning self-efficacy enhances motivated learning, or  motivation to acquire knowledge and skills. Research findings are presented showing how different educational practices affect self-efficacy. Future research needs to determine how students derive efficacy information from multiple cues and to specify in finer detail how the cognitive processes involved in understanding instruction and appraising self-efficacy influence one another.

After the administration of the test by English teachers (not aware of the research), the students' self-scored sections were checked for accuracy by an independent counter. Analysis results indicated sizable student error (94 counting errors were of magnitude 10 or more) that could definitely change the shape of a student's interest profile. Factors contributing to scoring error were not isolated. Suggestions for survey administrators to reduce self-scoring error include: provide  adequate time; carefully supervise the students' pin hole placements and scale use; have students recheck their counts; or use the machine scored version.

The second is a latent trait method recommended by van der Linden (1981); it is computationally complex, but has a number of theoretical advantages. The third method, the agreement statistic proposed in this paper, parallels the latent trait method in many respects; but it is computationally simple, like the pretest-posttest procedure. A total of 81 distinct data sets were simulated; and the three item selection methods were applied to each data set for the purpose of studying relationships among the methods. The correlation between the latent trait method and  the agreement method was substantial, suggesting that the latter might be recommended as a practical alternative to the former for classroom use. The results for the pretest-posttest method tended to confirm its reputed limitations. (Author/BS)",

A rating scale (Attachment 1) was developed to expedite a systematic comparison among possible achievement tests, and to allow a weighting of the factors to be rated according to the school system's needs. Five groups of experts (parents, teachers and principals, testing staff, central administration, and the board of trustees) have varying responsibility for rating the five factors critical to making the best choice: technical soundness; logical feasibility; instructional validity; financial affordability; and  interpretational ease. The Fatal Flaw Principle (occurring when an essential factor is rated unacceptable) can eliminate a test outright, and the Shoo-In Principle (occurring when a clearly superior rating is given on a critical factor) will select a single test outright. An outline of eight procedural steps for the selection process and the contexts in which they are appropriate is attached. (BS)",

By so doing, it removes the contaminating effects of ability differences from the assessment of item fairness. The approach is capable of identifying rare individual instances (outliers) of unexpected differential item performance (that can sometimes be attributed to unfair content), as well as differences on groups of  items which might be attributed to the fact that these items are measuring different attributes in different subpopulations.

This paper addresses these issues by estimating a latent-construct causal model of mathematics achievement with a mixed matrix of tetrachoric, polyserial, and product-moment correlations. This model of mathematics achievement is a block-recursive model. Mathematics achievement of high school seniors is considered to be a function of sophomore mathematics and verbal abilities, attitudes toward mathematics, and exposure  to mathematics. The model was tested using data from the first follow-up of the nationwide, longitudinal study &quot;High School and Beyond.&quot; Based on a covariance-structures model of the process of mathematics achievement and appropriate measures of the associations among the variables in the model, it was found that this process differs for men and women.

Since evaluation procedures can ultimately lead to teacher dismissal, it was incumbent upon the district staff to ensure the appropriateness of the APT and its technical quality for a population of teachers wider than those for whom the instrument was designed. A study was conducted on approximately 250 teachers to examine the inter-observation and inter-rater reliability of the APT for various groups of teachers: special education teachers, Chapter 1 teachers, elementary, middle and high school  teachers, black teachers and white teachers. Agreement indices were calculated for individual items to identify teacher behaviors which reduced reliability and for which observers need additional training and practice. Other local concerns addressed by the study focused on differences in the ratings of principals versus district staff and ratings of observers evaluating teachers within their own field of certification versus observers evaluating teachers in fields outside their own.

In evaluating these standards, test developers must keep in mind the purpose of the test being developed. They should also realize that these two standards imply that including multicultural material will ensure that major subgroups will see material familiar to them and thus score better on the test  (an assumption that is unproven). Research addressing this assumption must study items with two characteristics: (1) that differential performance has been detected on these items, and (2) that the context of the items can be changed to a context relevant to subgroup culture without altering the essential task. This is almost impossible. The fourth draft of the Standards revised these two standards. Standard 3.13 (now 3.5) was made more general and less prescriptive; and the two standards were separated.

In order to estimate such models it is desirable to obtain multiple manifest measures of the latent constructs. Many researchers restrict their models to two manifest measures per latent construct for reasons of economy, but doing so assumes, in the absence of external information, that all of the covariance between the within-variable measures is reliable covariance. Such an assumption may or may not hold in practice. The present study empirically investigated the extent of within-variable, between-occasion error covariances among nine socioeconomic variables typically included in models of educational achievement  using data on 1064 white respondents from High School and Beyond. Little evidence was found to support the claim that reliability estimates for social background variables are inflated due to correlated errors of measurement. (Author/BS)",

EB methods are tailored specifically to the analysis of data with a hierarchical structure. For instance, investigators may be interested in discovering how effects within schools (e.g., the relationship between student social class and achievement) vary as a function of differences between schools (e.g., policies and practices). Similarly, meta-analysts often wish to find out how differences between experimental and control groups within studies vary as a function of differences between studies (e.g., how treatments are implemented). Developmental psychologists care about how children's  intellectual growth rates vary as a function of different pre-school experiences. In each case parameters at one level (within schools, within studies, and within children) vary as a function of parameters at another level (between schools, between studies, between children). This paper explains how the EB strategy works when the central goal of an investigation is to estimate the second level parameters (i.e., the between-group parameters), and an important ancillary goal is to assess the adequacy of a hierarchical linear model for fitting such hierarchical data.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to explore differences in the nature of classrooms where students perceive high and low amounts of differential teacher treatment between high and low achievers. The Teacher Treatment Inventory was used to measure students' perceptions of the frequency of 30 teacher behaviors towards a hypothetical male or female high or low achieving students in twelve classrooms, four each at grades 1, 3, and 5. In addition, teacher expectations were measured and the classrooms were observed. Hypotheses concerning the differential occurrence of variables affecting the formation of students' self-evaluation were supported to a greater extent at grade 5 than at grades 1 and 3. The operation of quantitative structural and interaction variables is enlightened by  qualitative field notes which allow for an understanding of the dynamic interaction of variables within the larger context.

The primary purpose of both the CSEI and the CSEQ is to determine the extent to which a school displays seven school effectiveness characteristics: safe and orderly environment, clear school mission, instructional leadership, high expectations, opportunity to learn and student time on task, frequent monitoring of student progress, and home-school relations. The CSEI is a 67-item instrument, with its items grouped by characteristic. Responses to each item are coded along a five-point descriptive  continuum. The CSEQ is a 100-item instrument, with content parallel to the CSEI. It is a paper and pencil technique in which the respondents respond to each item along a Likert-type scale. Items are not grouped by construct, but are randomly dispersed throughout the instrument. Reliability and validity studies indicate that the current forms of the CSEQ and the CSEI do provide accurate and consistent data. Multitrait-multimethod analysis provides preliminary support for the identification of the seven school effectiveness characteristics as measurable constructs. (BW)",

Data from 25 elementary teachers and 300 of their students showed these scales to be weakly correlated, and the concordance of their A-B classifications to be only slightly above that expected by chance. Weak agreement was found even when teachers and students rated the same Type A behaviors, suggesting that variability in content is not the principal reason for the lack of agreement between these measures. This study also assessed the interrater reliability of the MYTH while controlling for the effects of different classroom environments on Type A responding. Whereas the mean interrater agreement was fairly high, considerable variation was found across the  seven pairs of raters. Finally, this study examined the association between the Hunter-Wolf and the student version of the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS). Data from 393 high school seniors revealed a moderately strong correlation between the Hunter-Wolf and the JAS. The results of this study strongly suggest that the youth measures of Type A behavior not be considered interchangeable. (Author)",

        "description":"Two variables, expectations and self-efficacy, were investigated to illuminate their relationship with achievement. The school was the unit of analysis chosen, and three levels of subjects were evaluated--students, teachers, and principals. Students, teachers, and principals within high achieving schools were hypothesized to evidence significantly higher levels of expectations and self-efficacy than those subjects within low achieving schools. Two samples of ten public elementary schools each were drawn from Michigan; one sample from high achieving schools, one from low. Measures of expectations and self-efficacy were administered to all groups within each school. When students, teachers, principals were examined separately, only students' self-efficacy and teachers' expectations  were significantly different across high and low achieving schools. However, examination across groups within each school demonstrated a strong trend indicating that as more than one group evidenced high expectations and self-efficacy, a greater likelihood existed that the school was high achieving. These results suggest that expectations and self-efficacy are important variables, particularly with students and teachers. (Author)",

They are set against the results of three studies in which teachers in the United Kingdom evaluated five programs which were used in reading or English lessons. A comparison of the checklist criteria with the case study data was made using Stake's (1967) matrix of evaluation concerns. This suggested a heavy emphasis on antecedents in the checklists and on transactions in the case studies. In general, neither checklists nor case studies devoted great attention to empirically measured outcomes. A possible interpretation of the results is that while the checklists focussed on intrinsic evaluation, the case studies themselves focussed on practical classroom issues, notably attention and motivation.

These evaluations have primarily focused on the impact of the policy change on retention rates and retainee achievement, attitudes toward retention, and the success of various interventions in helping retainees. Because retention is an individual decision, the evaluation should focus on the success of individual students--not on group averages. This year's evaluation will study the success of a sample of individual retainees, based on teachers' opinions, parents' opinions, and achievement test  scores. In addition, the achievement of students in schools with high and low retention rates will be compared. (BW)",

The development of a district-wide ninth-grade math exam for General Mathematics I (GMI) in the Charleston County School District, South Carolina, is used to illustrate how a study of the instructional process conducted during the early phases of test development can benefit the curriculum and strengthen the match between instruction and assessment. The GMI curriculum was divided into four nine-week grading periods. Teachers reported on the levels of instruction and student mastery of each stated objective. Reports on the students' progress were submitted quarterly and analyzed with regard to the Rasch  model, which was used to generate item difficulties and fit statistics and to link the four sets of test forms. Analysis of the data found much variability in student mastery of course objectives. Comparisons among the four tests showed significant differences which have implications for the interpretation of the correlation coefficients. Topics for further research are outlined. Appended are the objectives covered by the GMI test. (Author/EGS)",

This paper describes two studies that explore the behavior of cubic splines in order to determine their appropriateness for use in test norming. The first study uses data from the Curriculum Referenced Tests of Mastery (CRTM) and employs two smoothing techniques in determining distributions of percentile ranks (PR). Method 1 calculated PR values from cumulative frequency counts of raw scores values and then smoothed them to create a continuous distribution. Method 2 smoothed the raw frequencies to create the continuous distribution. The second study was designed to generate a theoretical population, sample repeatedly from it, and smooth the results in a comparative study of the two  procedures. Both studies showed that spline smoothing techniques are a convenient and economical procedure for analytically smoothing test score distributions and generally give good results. The second study found that, of the methods, method 2 produced better results and was more robust with regard to the choice of smoothing parameter. Both methods were easy, efficient and economical to use. Statistical tables of standard deviations and means are included. (EGS)",

The study found that the Board-mandated approach is by far the most expensive of the three alternatives, costing from 30 to 150 percent more than the other approaches. It should be noted that over 95 percent of the costs which were recorded in this analysis were not incremental or  out-of-pocket costs but rather were &quot;opportunity costs&quot; resulting from (1) providing teachers with a half day of release time each semester to work with their colleagues on jointly developed departmental exams, (2) teachers spending additional time developing final exams, and (3) allocating roughly 25 percent of academic subject coordinator time and 1150 equivalent days during the previous summer to the development of uniform countywide exams.

Specifically, the study was designed to: (1) determine whether the revised screening procedures were being implemented in an appropriate and uniform fashion; (2) assess the extent to which more Black and Hispanic students were included in the screening and being selected for programs in an equitable fashion; and (3) reexamine findings from a 1979-80 study regarding the use of various instruments and procedures. The findings indicate that while some changes consistent with the revised guidelines have taken place in the screening and  selection process, serious problems continue to exist; and procedures intended to increase minority participation are having only a slight impact. Further, implementation of the screening process continues to be inconsistent across schools. Comments by the staff of the Gifted and Talented Program, which took issue with some of the findings in this report, are also included. (Author/BW)",

        "description":"While the seventh and ninth grade Maryland Functional Mathematics Tests (MFMT) appear valid and well constructed, the 65 percent passing rate for Montgomery County Public Schools' ninth grade students raises questions about the 81 percent passing score set for the MFMT. This standard is far stiffer than the 59 percent set for the Maryland Functional Reading Test (MFRT), passed by 96 percent of Montgomery County ninth graders. Additional comparisons to the California Achievement Test (CAT) results support this apparent difference in standards. Reversing cutting scores would create an apparent &quot;reading crisis&quot; and passing mathematics rates would be 90 percent. Passing rates for special education students was low, ranging from 3 to 32 percent for the five different levels. Marked  differences in the ninth grade test passing grades of racial and ethnic groups, and disparities with CAT results, may indicate bias in the MFMT. The passing percentages were: Blacks: 34, Hispanic: 42, Whites: 70, and Asians: 77. Analysis of passing rates by school and by math class indicate that with the present cut score, the problem is countywide and largely confined to students taking Math 9A and Algebra I, Part 1A. Nine charts and tables accompany the discussion. (BS)",

Analyzed in conjunction with each approach were reliability and validity data as well as practicality of the assessment approaches. The reliability and validity data are extensive and high for the NBME. The NBME is the least complicated instrument to administer and score. However, it cannot assess client-clinician interactions utilizing live subjects. Reliability and validity data on observation methods are sparse; and where data exists, the coefficients are generally  low. Multifaceted evaluation techniques have provided more accurate assessments of student competence, but require more time and more people to administer multiple assessments. A final issue related to the assessment of clinical competence involves the determination of a generally acceptable definition of competence. (Author/BW)",

        "description":"To help engineering schools improve their minority student retention rates, the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME) undertook a Retention Research Program. The program consisted of two parts. First, NACME funded 11 projects which planned to add to or modify one or more minority student support services. Second, NACME used data from all the proposals originally submitted (51) and from the 11 funded projects to draw conclusions about factors contributing to retention success. Analyses of proposal data revealed that the three support mechanisms significantly related to success were: (1) monitoring of student performance and early warning of academic difficulty; (2) formal interaction among the minority engineering program, its students, and the engineering  faculty; and (3) a summer pre-freshman program to diagnose participants' academic strengths and weaknesses and provide the assistance indicated. Analysis of project data yielded a number of significant findings, the most important of which was that retention can be dramatically improved through the addition or modification of one or more support mechanisms to those services already in place. Other findings underlined the importance of the following: summer sessions plus extra coursework during the year; provision of services by a minority rather than an all-students program; improved study skills courses; and students' previous participation in a pre-engineering program, positive academic self-concept, and motives for choosing engineering.

In light of the fact that Hispanic youth with similar socioeconomic levels to Blacks engage in delinquency at lower rates than Blacks, the article also tries to explain how Hispanic adolescents living in a high crime area such as the South Bronx in New York City manage to avoid delinquency. Four theories--the social control theory, the opportunity structure theory, the social disorganization theory, and the crime deterrence theory--are examined to determine their applicability to Hispanic delinquency and to consider how they may be modified to reflect the life circumstances of inner-city Hispanic adolescents. Throughout, the discussion  indicates how the little knowledge available about Hispanic inner-city delinquency, as well as findings of the Hispanic Research Center's exploratory fieldwork in the South Bronx, necessitates extending conceptualizations of delinquency. Finally, the article examines how acculturation, a key factor in Hispanic life, is interrelated with other factors associated with delinquent behavior. (CMG)",

Analysis of crime rates for the city as a whole indicates that Hispanic crime patterns are different from those of Blacks and Whites. Hispanics have lower than expected crime rates, given their socioeconomic level. Hispanic youth appear to have a pattern of offenses closer to that of Whites than of Blacks, while Hispanic adults have a crime pattern closer to that of Blacks than of Whites. At the same time, Hispanic juvenile crime is more similar to that of Blacks than Whites with respect to maturing out of delinquency: both minority groups have a higher ratio of juvenile to adult crimes than Whites.

The research highlighted the conceptual importance of such factors as peer interaction and legitimate and illegitimate opportunities. It also emphasized the limitations of existing conceptualizations of delinquency-related factors, particularly the notions of &quot;delinquent orientation&quot; and &quot;strategic life styles.&quot; It aided, too, conceptualization of how factors described in the literature of different conceptual traditions may interact to produce delinquency or to avert it.  Finally, the research made clear the need to carefully develop measures of delinquency and peer and family interaction, as well as other factors. Careful measurement of these variables may permit research to better capture aspects of adolescents' and parents' lives relevant to delinquency and its avoidance among Puerto Rican youth in the South Bronx.

        "description":"In 1982, Protection and Advocacy, Inc. (PAI) was awarded funds to provide advocacy services to Hispanic and Asian developmentally disabled persons residing in California. Initial target populations selected were the urban Korean, Vietnamese, and Hispanic communities of Los Angeles. The project's goals were (1) to provide training in self-advocacy skills; (2) to increase availability and accessibility of services; and (3) to insure attainment of services through advocacy for human, civil, service, and legal rights. The acculturation process of California's Asian and Hispanic groups is encumbered by language, family, and religion. But each subgroup has its own reasons for being reluctant or unable to discuss problems or seek assistance. Buddhist-influenced groups, for instance,  feel enormous guilt over disabled family members. For many Hispanics, social services bear the stigma of &quot;charity,&quot; and undocumented Hispanics must avoid any attention. PAI had to develop a methodology that addressed these characteristics--and one that educated culturally insensitive providers. To reach target groups, PAI undertook an extensive media campaign. It led training workshops for consumers and providers, translated a manual on California programs for the disabled, and produced information brochures in Spanish, Vietnamese, and Korean. Two types of advocacy were provided: short-term assistance and direct representation. The project has managed to narrow the California access &quot;gap,&quot; but one of many continuing problems is the lack of knowledge displayed by many service providers  regarding their responsibility to provide equal and accessible services to minority communities. After the termination of grant funds, PAI will be institutionalized. (KH)",

        "description":"The Bilingual Demonstration College Preparatory Program, in its second year of funding, provided English as a second language (ESL) and native language instruction, in addition to bilingual instruction in mathematics, social studies, and science, to 120 Spanish-speaking students in grades 9-12 at George W. Wingate High School (Brooklyn, New York). The program had two major foci: assisting students in successfully completing high school, and encouraging them to enter postsecondary education. Students were mainstreamed during their junior year, although some continued to take ESL or English reading courses to enhance their English skills. The program supported administrative and support services staff, curriculum development activities, supportive services to program students,  staff development activities, and monthly meetings for parents. Analysis of student achievement indicated that program students met English language development objectives in the fall but not in the spring. Further, the overall passing rates of program students in mathematics and social studies courses were significantly lower than the passing rates of mainstream students in comparable classes. The attendance rate of participants was greater than that of the general school population. Based on the evaluation, a number of recommendations were formulated toward improving the program's effectiveness. (GC)",

Stated objectives included student achievement in bilingual skills classes, work experience in summer internships, regular meetings with the career advisor for counseling, visits to business offices, and workshops involving representatives of various businesses and occupations. The specific instructional program available to Project CRIP participants varied from site to site, but included English as a second language and native  language instruction and content-area instruction. The project's career awareness component included counseling, lectures, presentations by outside speakers, and informal no-credit classes in computer programing, career education, and office skills. Staff development activities and encouragement of parent participation also took place under Project CRIP. Students were assessed in English language development; growth in their mastery of the native language; mathematics, science, social studies, and business courses; and attendance.

Although the program emphasized vocational skills training, its ultimate goal was to develop proficiency in English and to prepare students to meet graduation requirements. The program developed and adapted curriculum materials in mechanical drawing, automotive machine shop, home maintenance and repair, bookkeeping and record keeping, American history, and consumer economics. Support services for program students consisted of guidance and career  counseling. Staff development activities included monthly department meetings and workshops. Program parents were members of the advisory committee. Quantitative analysis of student achievement showed significant gains in English and Spanish reading and industrial arts. Passing rates in mathematics, science and social studies ranged from 49 to 99 percent. The attendance rate of program students was greater than that of the general school population.

The earlier volume focused on Washington, D.C. as a central model and viewed urban problems very broadly. Based on findings presented in the earlier volume, the present volume examines the particular problems of urban environments that are different from Washington, D.C. in geographic and socioeconomic character. The hearings transcribed here were held in Philadelphia, Houston, and Los Angeles in 1981 and 1982. Witnesses (40 in number) are primarily local in their concerns and involvement. Problems discussed fall into three general categories: crime, housing, and employment. The Philadelphia  section focuses on the witnesses' concern that the loss of Law Enforcement Assistance Administration funds would substantially undermine law enforcement--even as violence in the city is increasing. In Los Angeles, the most discussed concern is over the rise of youth gangs and violence, a problem said to arise from unemployment and nonassimilation of recent immigrants (particularly Hispanics and Asians). The Houston hearings contain testimony that this city's &quot;boom&quot; is deceptive and does not extend to persons at the lower levels of income. Like those in the other cities, Houston witnesses favor increased Federal involvement toward solving their city's problems. (KH)",

The report defines &quot;help-seeking behavior&quot; as any communication about a problem or troublesome event that is directed toward obtaining support, advice or assistance in times of distress. The use of two types of support--&quot;formal&quot; or professional help, and &quot;informal&quot; (friend and relative) help--are described. The type of help provided by these sources and respondents' satisfaction with help received are also reported. Problem types were divided into five categories--financial, employment, crime, family, and health. The study's interview questionnaire is explained, and results are discussed. It is asserted that black help-seeking behavior has been little studied, even  though some research has indicated that blacks are reluctant to seek help. The current study's findings are said to contradict this stereotype. Formal and informal sources of support are held to be critical in the lives of blacks when seeking aid to a problem; the type of support utilized, however, depends upon the nature of the problem encountered. The paper concludes with statistical tables describing the sample and showing results. (KH)",

        "description":"This report (based on testimony presented at a 1984 public hearing and a review of the literature on educational reform) addresses the role of equity in attaining effective public education, especially in Kentucky, by describing educational problems of that State. The basic premise is that excellence cannot be achieved without equity, and that recent &quot;at risk&quot; reports have not fully acknowledged this fact. Children who do not &quot;fit&quot; into Kentucky's schools are identified as black, poor, handicapped, female, and/or dropout. They are said to suffer from two basic inequities: (1) lack of access, which excludes them and their parents from certain programs and decision-making processes; and (2) lack of preparation for post-school employment and inability to find jobs commensurate with  their skills. Seven equity problems specific to Kentucky are outlined and recommendations are made for their solution: (1) School reform must include the provision of necessary social services. (2) Education should not depend on the wealth of the students' community. (3) Discipline practices in Kentucky are, in general, too severe. (4) Students, parents and citizens must be involved in school decision-making. (5) Educational services are not being improved in proportion to the rising standards. (6) Basic skills are being defined too narrowly: the purpose of education is to prepare children for full participation in a democratic society. Finally, (7) the current trend in vocational education will not result in better job opportunities, but will in many cases deny students a sound academic  education. (KH)",

Examination of the gross dropout percentages over the first 15 months suggests that impacted-only (nonreassigned, but in impacted schools) minority students were twice as likely to drop out as unaffected (nonreassigned in nonimpacted schools) minority students. Black and Hispanic males were even more likely to drop out if they were reassigned to impacted schools. However, reassignment had no appreciable effect on Hispanic females, and reassigned Black females dropped out at a rate no higher than unaffected Black females. Anglo/Other males had a pattern similar to Black females and Anglo/Other females; that is, they were not much  affected. The gross percentages over the longer term (2 1/2 years) suggest an impact of a different nature. Hispanic males had a high dropout rate regardless of assignment. The likelihood of dropping out for Hispanic females and Black males increased moderately if in an impacted school and markedly if reassigned. Black females were most likely to drop out if they were impacted only. Anglo/Others dropped out least when reassigned. When the gross percentages were controlled for grade point average, grade and discipline results were different for some of the groups. Either way, however, the results indicate clearly that desegregation had a negative effect on the holding power of the school district for some students. (CMG)",

After examining the data, the district might decide to make any of the following changes: (1) initiate policies that limit the number of students who are served by more than one compensatory program; (2) take further steps to decrease disruptions in a student's day; (3) create a mechanism for coordinated planning between the compensatory teacher and the regular program  teacher; (4) determine whether the available compensatory funds can be used to lower the pupil-teacher ratio for each classroom; (5) reorganize administration of the program; (6) look for ways to increase instructional time; (7) use program resources to hire teachers, not teacher aides; (8) consider concentrating the program resources at earlier grade levels, including pre-K; (9) consider implementing the techniques and curricula from research studies on mastery learning and cooperative learning; and (10) remember to do intensive staff development with teachers and principals when any changes are made in the program.

        "description":"A case study of 1100 high school teachers in a large urban district that has experienced declining enrollment for eight years illustrates several of the exit options and career mobility effects of riffing (reduction in force). The findings show that during decline, freely chosen movement out (exit), or laterally (moderate number of location changes), or to enhanced positions was reduced for all, riffed or not. But women and minorities were more likely to experience forced exit (riffing) and more apparently nonvoluntary lateral moves. Further, women were more likely to end up with unwieldy teaching loads, including more preparations in more diverse contents areas. When given the exit options of resignation and retirement, more senior women took them than men, but the content areas  which showed the greatest percentage of voluntary exit use were typically male dominated areas (industrial arts and math), where the risks of exit were reduced due to external demands. To young teachers, especially young female and minority teachers, riffing signaled their second class citizenship. To potential teachers, it signaled that high schools are not places of professional growth. And to the school district itself, riffing signaled, or should have signaled, the district's declining long term health. (CMG)",

The role of the  Federal government in quality education is also discussed. The guide ends with a list of questions to be used by board members as a way of assessing how much they know about their school district and in which areas they need more information.

The project had three basic components: STAR I, the Gold Star Mentor Program, and a Tutorial component. In STAR I, participants worked six hours per day, five days a week. Biweekly, they attended training workshops which focused on the exploration of career options, educational/attitudinal motivation, and the sharing of worksite experiences. The Gold Star Mentor Program sought to create summer &quot;partnerships&quot; between business/community leaders and 60 high school participants in STAR  I in an effort to provide the students with role models and increased career exposure. The tutorial component provided experiences for high school students as teacher aides and/or tutors. Through analysis of records, observations, interviews, and questionnaires, the evaluatators concluded that, overall, the three components achieved their goals.

        "description":"This book presents four perspectives on student discipline: legal and historical, empirical, educational, and futuristic. Part I examines the legal history of student discipline in papers by J. John Harris III, Richard E. Fields, and A. Reynaldo Contreras (Chapter 1); Richard E. Fields (Chapter 2); and David G. Carter, Sr. and Cynthia L. Jackson (Chapter 3). The authors hold that corporal punishment and suspension, although approved by the courts, solve problems for teachers and administrators at the expense of those who look to schools for social and economic advancement. Part II presents empirical perspectives on discipline. Chapters 4-6 (by Christine Bennett, J. John Harris, III, and Camilla A. Heid) report results of a study of the causes of disproportionality in suspensions  and expulsions of male and black students. Chapter 7 (by Heid and Contreras) presents a quantitative and qualitative analysis of minority student suspension. In Chapter 8, Meryl E. Englander discusses teacher management of classroom misbehavior. Perspectives on educational policy with regard to student discipline are investigated in Part III. First, in Chapter 9 Stephen Bower argues that educational policy that equates disproportionality with social discrimination tends to blur the distinction between race and class. Then Chapter 10, by Patrick Lynch, examines the effect of educational policy on the lives and personalities of students. The last section of the book, Part IV, introduces perspectives on discipline for the future. The role of researchers is considered by Frank Brown in  Chapter 11. Finally, in Chapter 12, William W. Wayson reviews the eight goals identified by Phi Delta Kappa's Commission on Discipline. Brief notes on the book's contributors follow the text. (Author/GC)",

Next, a project advisory committee and a group of local employers reviewed the task listings, made recommendations for changes  in them, determined the occupational skills needed by students in each program area, identified the major outcomes for the program and for each course of study, and identified the entry-level skills and the minimum performance levels for the program and for each course of study. Generally, the followup project participants were quite pleased with the original curriculum development effort.

        "description":"One of the major issues currently facing the United States is the impact of the emerging high-technology economy. Some experts suggest that the economy will require great numbers of very highly educated persons to fill the new high-technology jobs. Others, such as researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), predict that few highly trained people will actually be needed in a high-technology economy, because, while high-technology jobs will grow by high percentages, the actual numbers of new jobs will be small. The BLS instead expects the economy to require many more low-skilled jobs, such as clerks, waiters/waitresses, secretaries, and retail sales personnel, to work in an increasingly service-oriented economy. However, the BLS's predictions are based on the assumption  that the future economy will be similar to the present one, a premise that may not hold true. For example, the BLS expects that many more retail sales persons will be needed, but an upsurge of catalog shopping, and possibly computer shopping, may well cut the number of sales persons needed. On the other hand, the emerging high-technology economy may change some formerly low-skilled jobs to jobs requiring a much higher level of knowledge and skills. For example, the job of secretary has been upgraded substantially by the addition of word processing equipment and computers to offices. With this equipment, fewer secretaries may be needed, but they will fill much more complicated jobs. Therefore, the work force of the future high-technology society may, indeed, need greater levels of  education and higher-level skills, and the education establishment must prepare for this necessity.

All of the prime sponsors providing information for the study devoted at least some resources to  classroom vocational skills training, and all but one of them devoted at least some resources to on-the-job training. Of the 37 prime sponsors who provided reasonably complete information about the services they offered, 14 ran English-as-a-Second-Language programs and 25 provided some remedial classes. Prime sponsors were by far the most frequent deliverers of intake and assessment services, which included: (1) outreach and recruitment; (2) intake and eligibility determination; (3) assessment and preparation of employability plans; (4) counselling; and (5) referral of clients to other agencies. Community-based organizations were utilized the second most frequently for three of the five intake and assessment services examined. (MN)",

Three hundred and five surveys were distributed with 292 usable responses received. The male-to-female ratio was 131:161. The survey was designed to elicit students' knowledge/perceptions of 10 allied-health careers, and their perceptions of people versus machine orientation, work site, and work locale. Also elicited were data related to the students' knowledge of future career choice, college plans, and interest in a medical/allied health career. Data were analyzed by sex and  grade level for each of the career choices. The hypothesis that there exists a lack of knowledge or basic understanding of the allied health specialties studied was supported. Less than half (46.53 percent) of all answers were correct overall, and lack of knowledge did not appear to be sex linked. Certain careers were more closely correlated with correct answers than were others (e.g., speech pathology was more often correctly identified than was radiology technology). (Author/KC)",

To gather data for the project, researchers conducted five case studies that focused on business investment in newly developed career programs in five District of Columbia high schools. During the study, researchers compared the reasons of each of the five sponsors for participating in educational partnerships. Each of the sponsors involved indicated that social responsibility goals were important in their decision to participate in such a partnership; however, other motives for participation that were more closely tied to the individual businesses were also apparent. Included among these were public relations, investment in human capital, and perpetuation of support for the  capitalist system. Despite the similarities, the collaborative arrangements examined differed widely according to program objectives and how those involved viewed their roles. In the cases of the five programs examined, corporate involvement varied from attendance at quarterly meetings to weekly contact with program personnel. Although the researchers did not find any one model that appeared appropriate for all partnerships, even within the school system, they nevertheless felt that private sector interests can be compatible with the broader educational goals and objectives of school systems.

Based on data from the 118 questionnaires that were returned, it appeared that the six courses that were of most relevance to the graduates' jobs were courses in English, typewriting, secretarial procedures, records management, office management, and business communications. Data collected on the relative percentages of time spent on planning, organizing, directing and supervising, and controlling activities indicated that most of the respondents--whether they were office  managers or secretaries--seemed to assume more and more management responsibility as they progressed in their jobs. It also appeared that the training received by the respondents while in school provided them with the necessary background to function effectively in the managerial role. Based on the large amount of time that respondents spent in planning, organizing, directing, and controlling activities, the researchers recommended that curriculum developers place more emphasis on coursework geared toward the development and refinement of managerial talents.

        "description":"The technique of multivariate analysis is particularly suited to educational needs assessment research because it allows for the summarization of data across any number of learners or components of educational need to produce a single numerical index of need for each skill examined. In the needs assessment process, educational or training need is assumed to have three underlying dimensions: competence of the individual at a task or skill, relevance of the task or skill to the individual, and the individual's desire to further his or her learning of the task or skill. The use of multivariate analysis as a means for assessing educational need is superior to previous methods in that these earlier models could accommodate data for only two dimensions. In addition, the multivariate  analysis method manifests an increased sensitivity to changes in respondent distribution in the index of educational need. Finally, the model can accommodate different numbers and relative emphases of dimensions according to user-defined models and its method of computation is a relatively simple one. (This paper includes a discussion of the multivariate assessment technique as a model for assessing educational and training need, discussions of bivariate and multivariate cases of analysis, a computational example, a list of references, and six figures and one table illustrating various phases of the model and its standard error weights.)

        "description":"The purpose of a study was to determine what Louisiana vocational agriculture teachers were doing during their summer months of employment and then provide this information to individual teachers as an aid in planning the summer program. In early May 1983 a sample of 110 teachers completed an initial survey instrument on which they indicated what they thought they should be doing in their summer programs. Every two weeks during the summer the teachers completed a form that recorded what they had done. Results indicated that vocational agriculture teachers expect, and are expected, to do more than just to teach and to supervise supervised occupational experience programs (SOEP) during their summer employment. Approximately 20 teachers indicated that all 38 listed activities were  important and should be performed by all teachers during the summer. Teachers also indicated that 16.4 percent of time should be spent on SOEP alone. Recommendations were that teachers should allocate a major portion of their summer to student contact, time spent on non-student contact activities should be kept to a minimum, time should be spent with all students, and teachers should develop a daily plan for the summer.

The user of teleconferencing for instruction has to accept several underlying assumptions: lecture is not necessarily sound instruction, especially for adults; teleconferencing is easy; and teleconferences require planning. Benefits are personalization of content and feedback on lesson progress. To prepare for group processes, an instructor must use techniques that provide an &quot;instructional set.&quot; Using bridges or configurations on the telenetwork, the speaker can interact with groups in various patterns. The instructor can choose to have one group or any number of groups with any number of participants. Smaller groups generate greater interest and participation.  Planning group membership is important; a matrix or a tally sheet is useful for doing this. The instructor and program facilitator should remember when using small groups on the telenetwork that small groups may not be the best way for some topics and that some groups and the whole program should be considered when selecting techniques.

The complete workshop is designed to be offered in four two-hour sessions by a facilitator (teacher) who has received no special training beyond a thorough understanding of the handbook offered with the workshop materials. This technical report describes the development and evaluation of the workshop. Section 1  provides information about content and format and describes how decisions relating to those issues were made. Section 2 describes the field test and formal evaluation of the completed workshop.

The study assessed the role of the state and local school districts in meeting the needs of their vocational, employment and training, career, and adult education programs. The board's study concluded that, in general, while the Illinois education-for-employment programs have served the state well for over 60 years, recent changes in society and in the nature of the work force have significantly affected several segments of education and have had special impact on education-for-employment programs. In the course of the study, five major problems were identified. Included among these were the fact that programs are too often driven  by student interest rather than by labor market conditions, equipment used in such programs is often outmoded, the teaching staff of job-training programs is frequently in need of retraining, and a single educational entity is often unable to provide the necessary array of programs. The study concludes by recommending state leadership, local and regional initiatives and action to create a comprehensive education-for-employment program in Illinois, development of a new State Board of Education policy statement on education for employment, and development of a plan for the delivery of employment programs and services.

        "description":"A study examined the effects of participation in three types of federal job programs--classroom training, on-the-job training, and work experience--on the postparticipation employment records of black and white men and women. Using data from the Continuous Longitudinal Manpower Survey, researchers examined the employment records of 3,420 black and white individuals who had been enrolled in a Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) program for eight days or more. After making allowances for various sources of statistical error, the researchers determined that program assignment variables did have a significant effect on participants' post-program participation employment rates. For white men and women and for black women, participation in classroom training significantly  reduced the odds of being employed on the day after participation in a CETA program. In contrast, on-the-job training significantly increased the odds of employment when compared to participation in work experience programs. Compared to classroom training, the odds of employment after participation in on-the-job CETA programs were 4 times greater for white women, 3 times greater for white men, 2.4 times greater for black women, and 1.7 times greater for black men. For black men and white women, education is a second highly significant variable affecting the odds of employment the day after graduation from a CETA program. After analyzing the pros and cons of policies focusing on increasing the numbers of blacks and women in on-the-job training programs, the researchers recommended the  adoption of such policies.

Chapter 1 describes the evolution of worker participation in unionized settings and summarizes basic propositions in models of joint union-management change. In chapter 2 five case studies illustrate the dynamics of worker participation processes. Chapter 3 reviews the experiences of two major national unions and their industries--the United Steel Workers and seven major steel companies and the United Automobile Workers and General Motors and Ford Motor Company--with worker participation processes scattered across multiple plants. Each case illustrates the challenges involved in linking workplace  participation programs to the broader, more centralized collective bargaining structure and the broader strategies of the union and employers involved. Chapters 4 and 5 analyze through survey and interview data the views that rank and file members and local labor leaders hold toward worker participation. Chapter 6 draws on data from interviews, speeches, other public documents, and selected internal union documents to present the views of key national labor movement leaders on worker participation. Chapter 7 highlights implications for the labor movement and the U.S. industrial relations system. (YLB)",

These employers answered questions on the number of persons who applied for the last position for which they hired prior to August, 1981; the number of applicants interviewed; the hours spent recruiting, screening, and interviewing applicants for the position; and the number of offers made. Some of the findings were that firms that have many job applicants conduct more extensive searches (see more applicants and conduct more interviews) than firms that do not receive many job applications and that their cost of conducting an extensive search is lower. Therefore, these employers tend to rely on extensive search  methods rather than intensive search (finding out more about each applicant). On the whole, larger firms spent more time on each hiring than smaller firms. Additional time spent on searching correlated positively to the amount of cost associated with firing employees who are mistakenly hired. The study also found that employers seldom invest in all of the employee recruitment channels that are available to them, preferring instead to use informal recruitment mechanisms. Some of the reasons for this are that labor markets are not perfect, skills are often specific to certain companies, and it is costly to obtain information about the competence of job applicants. In addition, the study found that employers usually offer front-loaded compensation in order to attract workers if they are not  likely to quit later. (KC)",

Data for the study were gathered in telephone interviews with more than 3,500 employees conducted by the Gallup Organization. This report is organized in three chapters. In the first chapter, John Barron and John Bishop examine extensive search and intensive search, and determine which of these methods are used by different types of employers and why. Costs of each method are also discussed. Chapter 2, by John Bishop, explores why employers prefer informal recruitment mechanisms and the implications of this preference. The final chapter, by John Bishop and Suk Kang, asks the question: Why do employers underinvest in on-the-job training?  and analyzes the results of this employer policy. This chapter also looks at the relationship between employer decisions about on-the-job training and the effects of these decisions on society as a whole. An extensive executive summary and data tables are included in this report. Appendixes include statistical computations, the employer questionnaire, and references. (KC)",

Employers of these graduates were surveyed at followup. During high school youth were consistently accurate in perceptions of items having positive influence on employers' job hiring standards, consistently understood several employers' job performance standards, and underestimated the importance of negative information on hiring and of negative behavior and attitudes on employers' opinions regarding job performance. Students with the best  employment outcomes during the followup year were those who thought that employers had tough hiring standards but did not have tough job performance standards at the end of the senior year. Youth who received the highest evaluations of work habits and attitudes and productivity at the end of the followup year thought employers had tough hiring standards. Following this narrative of findings and study conclusions is a discussion of the implications and recommendations of the findings on youth's perceptions and a discussion of the effects of certain variables on youth's perceptions.

Eight chapters in part II attempt to describe segregation by considering economic approaches to sex  segregation, proposing a general theory to explain occupational segregation and wage differentials, criticizing this theory, reviewing the human capital explanation attributing segregation to women's preferences, reviewing literature linking sex typing in socialization to occupational choice, responding to that review, examining institutional barriers to sex integration, and commenting on that examination. The three papers in part III on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce segregation review literature to examine impacts, evaluate occupational desegregation in Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs, and comment on the previous paper.

The six keynote addresses include an historical overview of families and work followed by unique perspectives representing labor, corporations, government, and the family. Specific topics are union negotiations to deal with conflicting demands of work and family life; corporate accommmodations to family needs; influencing policy decisions relating to families and work; trends in women's employment, demography, and family composition; and the changing role of the homemaker. The nine concurrent sessions reflect a rich diversity of viewpoints concerning families and work. Emphases include stresses in  the family, sex roles and work, an historical perspective of families under stress, coping skills, distribution of household work, ethnic and minority differences, work policy, corporate policies and benefits, and public policy. Six reports on original research relate to methods of assessing conflict between family life and employment, role multiplicity of female academics, the impact of work on the mildly handicapped and their families, comparison of mothers' and daughters' sex-role attitudes, work roles and quality of family life among professionals and managers, and job sharing to manage family and employment roles.

It emphasizes positive collaboration with workers and the community to find new jobs for workers and maintain morale and productivity in the plant. The guide is divided into five chapters. The first chapter acquaints the reader with some of the benefits of work force reduction planning, while the second chapter presents the latest techniques in that process. It includes two sections: (1) general principles of work force reduction planning, which outlines the overall approach recommended in this guide, and (2) 17 key steps that companies must take to implement the recommended approach. The third chapter outlines key administrative and management issues related to operating an assistance center for employees being  terminated. Five main topics are discussed: overview of center operations, sequencing and coordinating services, center staffing, center bookkeeping and recordkeeping, and project evaluation. The fourth chapter provides more in-depth information on center services, outlines the special needs of terminated employees, and describes services that improve the chances of a successful adjustment. Community and government resources--specifically the Job Training Partnership Act--that can lower employers' costs of assisting terminated employees are discussed in the final chapter. Appendixes provide detailed information on designing and administering an employee questionnaire, on developing a services brochure for employees, and on the Title III Dislocated Worker Program of the Job Training  Partnership Act.

Score distributions from the study were needed by the Armed Services to set performance levels for accepting and assigning recruits. Three psychometric models designed to provide information about the operating characteristics of the tests and the items of which they are comprised were fit to the eight &quot;power&quot; tests of the ASVAB, based on a random sample of 1,187 respondents from the national study. The models in question were the one-, two-, and three-parameter item response models that were fit to the data by the marginal estimation approach by means of the BILOG computer program.  Results for each model and test included indices of overall goodness-of-fit, item parameter estimates and associated standard errors, item information indices, and test information and standard error curves. Appendixes contain the results of the analyses. Appendix A contains classical item statistics for each of the tests, including item percents-correct and item-test correlation, both Pearson and biserial.

The second chapter examines the library's general collection to find a whole range of materials that can help adult students at all levels from beginning reading through high school equivalency. It acquaints librarians and ABE teachers with the skills that adult new readers must master, the techniques and materials used to teach those skills, and the kinds of materials any public library will have on hand to help new readers develop those skills. Chapter III discusses questions and concerns  relating to special collections for ABE students, including organization and kinds of materials. Chapter IV suggests ways public libraries and ABE programs can work together to motivate students to use the public library. A process model for library-ABE cooperation is offered.

        "description":"Self-referenced content is generally remembered better and faster than information encoded in other ways. To examine how self-relevant information is organized in memory, three experiments were conducted, comparing the effects of target-first or word-first methodology. In the target-first condition, subjects (N=15) saw one of the two questions, &quot;Describes you&quot; or &quot;Describes Ronald Reagan,&quot; followed in one second by an adjective. In the word-first condition the adjective was presented first, followed in one second by one of the two questions. Subjects then completed a recall test, and the Self-Consciousness Questionnaire. In the second experiment (N=10) &quot;most students&quot; replaced Ronald Reagan as the target for other-reference, and the screen was blanked so that target and word were  not seen together. In the third experiment the target (or word) was left on the screen until the word (or target) appeared. Three different intervals between word and target were examined. Results of the experiments suggest that information about other people seems to be stored by person, not by tags with adjectives. In all three experiments the word-first procedure led to slower decisions than target-first. However, the situation was less clear for self-reference decisions; in one experiment the word-first procedure was faster and for the other two experiments there was no real difference. Overall, it seems that the self-concept is not like the concept for other people, and information may be stored redundantly, in a separate set and with critical adjectives. (JAC)",

To explore changes in attributions during task performance for both actors and observers, 90 female undergraduates participated in a procedure in which they received either 80 percent or 20 percent success feedback. After either 5, 20, or 40 trials they computed attribution measures. Subjects were randomly assigned to the role of actor or observer. The task involved raising a ball bearing balanced on a carriage to the top of a platform using a cord and pulley. Unknown to subjects, an electromagnet was used to affect outcome. Results showed that regardless of reinforcement level, at 20 trials observers were more internal than  actors; but at 40 trials, actors were more internal than observers, indicating that attributional differences developed over time and developed differently for actors and observers. Actors' focus may shift from the situation toward themselves, and observers' focus may shift from the actor toward the situation. (JAC)",

To investigate the effects of client learning style on: (1) satisfaction with the System of Interactive Guidance and Instruction (SIGI); (2) the rating of values; and (3) selection of the main occupation field of interest, 109 college students who were clients at a career planning and placement center at a large midwestern university participated in an exploratory study. When clients signed up to use SIGI they completed Kolb's (1976) Learning Style Inventory (LSI), Holland's My Vocational Situation, and a personal information questionnaire. At the end of the semester subjects were called and asked to assess their overall perceptions  of SIGI and its effectiveness. The results indicated that at least three of the four learning style groups identified by the LSI did not differ significantly in satisfaction ratings. However, significant differences were found between learning style groups for some values but not for others. No conclusion could be reached with respect to the relationship between learning style groups and the main occupation field of interest. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed and recommendations are suggested for future research in this area. (Author/JAC)",

Results of discriminant, functional, and correlational analyses showed that the female participants scored higher on the career related value scales (task completion, job involvement, meaning from work, and career importance) and the leisure importance scale. They also evidenced more conflict between home and career values. Male students scored as high as female students on the home value scale when their meaning from work scale was not extremely  high. Both sexes were equivalent on the importance of economic support and job specificity. Finally, occupational status of the mother was influential for female students but not for males. (MCF)",

The present study exposed male and female subjects (129 male, 191 female) to three distributive fairness conditions to examine the role of sex in fairness interactions. Subjects read a story dealing with the grade received by a student in a college course and responded to a questionnaire about the student and his situation. Dependent variables were perceived satisfaction, perceived conflict, trust in teacher, and grade fairness. Main effects for  distributive fairness were significant for all dependent variables. No significant main effects for sex were observed. There were significant &quot;sex x distributive fairness&quot; interactions for perceived grade fairness, satisfaction, and trust in teacher. Women responded more positively than men to over reward and more negatively than men to under reward. The &quot;sex x distributive fairness&quot; interactions indicated that distributive fairness treatments do yield sex differences for subjects who are not participants in the allocation situation.

        "description":"Historically pesonality has been predicated on behavioral consistency. To demonstrate the uniqueness of personality using three methods, 23 female college students initially recorded self-descriptive words at the end of each of 23 days. These words were then assigned favorability values from the Adjective Generation Technique norm list. First, uniqueness was demonstrated because variability of favorability within lists of most used words was significantly less than variability between lists. Second, to determine whether subjects' lists of most frequently used words tended not to overlap, and were thereby unique, a catalogue of 49 words from which subjects drew the labels most frequently used in self-description was compiled and compared to the estimated chance probability of  overlap in label selection. Third, 46 raters provided Semantic Differential reactions to the behavioral descriptions of each subject. An analysis of the results showed that subjects varied day to day in favorability of self-description more than they differed from one another in overall favorability of self-description, thereby showing little consistency. The observed overlap of at least one label among the subjects' actual lists of most frequently used words was not significantly different from the estimated chance probability. Raters' reactions indicated that they clearly saw the corresponding subjects to be unique. These findings present a dilemma in that although the labels used were unique, intrasubject behavioral consistency was not great, suggesting that not only attributions by  others but also dramaturgical quality (precision, clarity, and effectiveness of performed behavior) and dramaturgical value (uncommon behavior directed to several targets) may lead to behavioral consistency.

        "description":"Although the organizational structure and activities of youth gangs have been studied, little research has focused on law enforcement strategies to handle youth gang behavior. To examine how police handle youth gangs and law violation and to identify effective prevention and control strategies, the police gang control and youth personnel departments in 60 randomly selected cities were surveyed. An analysis of the results showed that 45% of the cities surveyed reported the presence of youth gangs and associated problems, while only 15 police departments reported having specialized youth gang units. Police gang control functions encompassed four classes of activities: information processing, prevention, enforcement, and follow-up investigations. Gang control programs featured  traditional strategies designed to prevent crime and apprehend offenders. Although a few large police departments appeared to have made large investments in prevention programs, the majority of agencies had made modest investments. Finally, many programs had management problems, due to the lack of written policies, personnel training, and evaluation methods. A comprehensive community gang control program focusing on management, program effectiveness, and delivery systems is recommended.

        "description":"Recently, the concept of gender has been introduced as a possible influence on hiring bias. To examine the relationship between gender perception and bias in hiring, a two-part study was conducted. In the initial phase, 99 college students developed descriptions of applicants that reflected gender characteristics. In the second phase, 63 college business students (31 females, 32 males) responded to one of the bogus applicants developed in phase one. The applicants were portrayed as feminine, androgynous, or masculine. Subjects were asked to indicate the likelihood that they would hire the applicant and the applicant's sex. An analysis of the results showed that the androgynous applicant was most desirable, and that the feminine applicant was least likely to be recommended for  hiring. Furthermore, in line with cultural definitions of gender, masculine applicants were perceived as male, and feminine applicants were seen to be female. These findings show that gender is linked with sex in socially prescribed patterns, with women being devalued by stereotypes that do not allow them to be seen as possessing masculine traits.

To examine individuals' reactions to occupations that varied in status and sex-typing, 184 college students (102 females, 82 males) rated items in the Career Expectations Booklet. Subjects indicated their affective reactions, performance expectations, and perceptions of the sex-typing for each occupation. Subjects also completed the Personal Attributes Questionnaire. An analysis of the results showed that affective reactions were influenced by status, whereas expected performance was determined by subject sex and status. Specifically, women's affective reactions to high status-masculine occupations were no different than men's, and were positive. Women's and  men's affective reactions to low status occupations were less positive than their reactions to both masculine and feminine high status occupations. Men expected to do less well than women in low status-feminine occupations. These findings suggest that women are becoming more motivated for high status occupations, while accepting the reality that they are still likely to work in low status jobs. (Author/BL)",

In light of this approach, a four quarter graduate counselor education program, focusing specifically on the training of social learning therapists, is proposed. The supervision process in this model encompasses four stages: imparting and training of specific skills, supervision of actual counseling sessions, self-monitoring, and program completion. During the first stage, the trainee learns generic verbal and nonverbal counseling skills through modeling, reinforcement, behavioral rehearsal, and self-as-a-model. In stage two, the trainee counsels community clients and achieves skills mastery through  peer feedback and individual and group supervision. In stage three, the trainee masters self-monitoring skills, which refer to the ability of the trainee to objectively assess and evaluate his own counseling performance. The skills are acquired through observation, feedback, and personal counseling. The fourth and final stage of the program involves certification of program completion. Supervisors, following this model, are specifically selected based on their training and experience in teaching and counseling, as well as their background in social learning theory. (BL)",

        "description":"In 1980 the first women graduated from the military and college training program at West Point. To investigate the progress of both male and female graduates as they assume leadership roles in the regular Army, 35 women and 113 men responded to a survey assessing career involvement and planning, commitment and adjustment, and satisfaction. Analysis of results showed that, in the area of career planning, all officers relied on self-initiated planning rather than help from a superior officer, with women reporting less help than men. Forty percent of the women and 19% of the men planned to leave the Army upon completing their obligation. There were no gender differences in graduates' adjustment to the role of Army officer; however, women were less satisfied than men with their  adjustment. Most women (72%) and most men (80%) felt their spouses supported their career, and most women (64%) and most men (56%) in dual career partnership reported that their careers were compatible. Finally, women felt less satisfied than men with their overall job. The findings suggest that gender differences arise when the role demands of the officer conflict with other roles, such as mothers and women. These findings are consistent with other research on the role conflicts and stresses involved in breaking into nontraditional occupations. (BL)",

To investigate expressed willingness to seek help, evaluations of help-seekers, and the influence of the Protestant ethic on help seeking, college students completed questionnaires containing descriptions of eight situations in which a person was faced with a problem. Ninety-seven subjects enrolled in an introductory sociology course were asked to indicate how likely they would be to seek help in the situations described; 104 subjects in other sections of the same course were asked to indicate how their evaluations of a person who sought help in these situations would change. Subjects were randomly assigned questionnaires in which the help to be sought was either direct or indirect. The  questionnaires concluded with the Mirels-Garrett Protestant Ethic Scale. Results indicated that subjects would be more likely to seek indirect help, help that aids persons to obtain a desired outcome themselves, than direct help, help that results in obtaining the desired outcome directly. Other subjects evaluated persons who sought direct help less favorably than persons who sought indirect help. Belief in the values of the Protestant ethic were inversely related to willingness to seek direct help but not related to willingness to seek indirect help. Belief in the values of the Protestant ethic were not related to evaluations of help seekers on either direct or indirect help. (JAC)",

        "description":"As the fit between job values and job rewards becomes more important to American workers, it is important to understand factors which may affect these values. Data from the combined General Social Surveys of 1974, 1976, 1977 and 1980 were used to investigate the influence of education, job prestige, earnings, age, sex, race, and family characteristics on the value placed on intrinsic rewards. Specifically, respondents (N=1,857) were asked to rank in importance five job-related rewards: high income; no danger of being fired; working short hours; chance of advancement; and having important work which provides a sense of accomplishment. The ranking of this &quot;sense of accomplishment&quot; reward, clearly intrinsic in nature, was the dependent variable in the analyses. Results showed that  having more education produced the highest ranking of the dependent variable. Having a father with more education and being white were also significantly associated with placing high value on intrinsic reward. Being older and having a father with a higher prestige occupation were also associated with intrinsic reward, while sex and the number of persons in the household were not related to this value. The findings indicate that the major determinant of the value placed on intrinsic job reward is pre-employment experience. Efforts to increase both individual and organizational outcomes by providing intrinsic rewards may not be successful for all types of workers. (JAC)",

        "description":"Previous research on physical attractiveness stereotypes about marriage have used stimulus individuals in isolation. To examine these attractiveness stereotypes using couples as targets, 72 college students (36 females, 36 males) rated eight photographs of four male-female couple types. Members of each couple were either matched (attractive male/female, unattractive male/female) or different (unattractive male/attractive female, attractive male/unattractive female). Judgments were obtained on the couples' likelihood of marital success, compatibility, parental competence, and sexual involvement. An analysis of the results showed that couples matched in attractiveness were seen as being more likely to be successful, compatible, and parentally competent than unmatched couples. The  attractiveness of individual couple members had no such effect on these items. Relatively attractive male and female couple members were also perceived as being more sexually active than unattractive individuals. These results tend to support a \"matching is good\" marital stereotype, which implies that perceptions of others' social happiness and success are not determined solely by ascribed physical attributes, that others are seen as achieving a more desirable status if they are seen as conforming to the matching stereotype.

To determine if similar relationships between binging severity and cognitive factors would hold for subjects who did meet the criteria for bulimia, anorexia, or both, and to determine if the BES would discriminate between those who report binging and those who do not, 48 female subjects were interviewed and given a battery of psychological tests including the BES and CFS. Analysis of results showed that anorexic subjects scored significantly lower on the BES than bulimics or bulimic/anorexic subjects. Significant correlations were found between binge eating and cognitions  of personal dieting standards and dieting self-efficacy. Subjects' greater tendency to binge was related to more stringent standards and to a lower sense of personal efficacy in sticking to a diet. The findings add to the concurrent validity of the BES since subjects who had high rates of binging as part of the criteria for their diagnosis (bulimia and bulimia/anorexia) scored higher than anorexics, who binge to a lesser degree, and therefore do not have binging as part of their diagnostic criteria.

        "description":"With the availability of so many definitions of and assessment devices for anxiety, researchers have stressed that the dimensionality of anxiety needs further investigation. To examine the dimensionality of three components of anxiety (trait anxiety, arousability, and neuroticism) two studies were conducted. In the first study, 123 high school students completed the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), which measures neuroticism, and Mehrabian's measure of stimulus screening (arousability). Factor analysis showed that arousability comprised two factors: emotionality and arousability. In the second study, 143 high school students (63 males, 83 females) completed an inventory that measured four factors: neuroticism, arousability, emotionality, and anxiety. The 60 assessment items  were compiled from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1970), the EPI, and Mehrabian's measure. An analysis of the results showed a high correlation between two of the factors, (neuroticism and emotionality), and therefore yielded a three-factor model of anxiety, encompassing neuroticism/emotionality, anxiety, and arousability. The results support the discriminant validity of the three constructs. (BL)",

Reading materials included Distar Fast Cycle, Distar Reading II, and basal readers. Observations were coded for the number of reading comprehension instruction statements, text-explicit questions, scriptal questions, decoding errors, comprehension errors, and general management. Findings revealed that teachers asked more factual questions of their lower grade and lower performing students, but reversed this pattern for inferential  questions. First grade teachers asked fewer than half the number of text implicit questions that third grade teachers asked. Third grade teachers asked from six to ten times the number of scriptal questions that first grade teachers asked. The number of reading errors the groups made held fairly constant from first grade through third grade. The biggest change in feedback took place after first grade, with teachers no longer sounding out corrections. Finally, time for story reading increased from about 7.5 minutes in first grade to almost 10.5 minutes in third grade. (HOD)",

In particular, it seems that one group of children might be distinguished by the strength of their top-down, conceptually driven processes and another by their strong bottom-up, text driven processes. To determine if these impressions of precocious readers' strategies provide a valid description of more than a few cases, 87 teacher-designated precocious readers at the kindergarten level were studied. The children completed a reading comprehension test; tests of reading, verbal ability, and short term memory; and a battery of oral reading measures. In addition, their parents completed questionnaires describing the reading histories and  reading habits of their children. Results indicated that precocious readers were especially adept at tasks that drew on processes above the individual word level. However, any generalizations about this group must be tempered by consideration of individual differences within the group. (FL)",

        "description":"After recounting a brief history of special education trends and reviewing two early models of learning disabilities, this paper calls for and describes a holistic approach to teaching students based on their abilities rather than their disabilities. It describes how psychologists of the 1960s viewed learning disabilities as a product of deficient psychological processing, and how professionals began to assess these processes. The paper proceeds to the 1970s and recounts the behaviorist theory of teaching reading by breaking the task into component parts and then teaching by curriculum objectives centered on specific tasks. Viewing the 1980s, the paper describes how cognitive strategy theories were pieced together from various other theories. Finally, it lists and describes  current problems in the field--reductionist models, division of learning, and deficit-driven assessment and instruction--and proposes a holistic model for instruction that directly counters these notions.

Overall, students ranked Bruce Catton's \"Grant and Lee at Appomattox\" as the best and it became the experimental text. The sentences in this piece were decombined--to reduce the fluidity of the writing--and then submitted to students, who ranked the text near the middle of the 11 sample texts. Next, students read and rewrote the decombined text, taking into account instructor recommendations regarding substitution, conjunction, and subordination. These student-recombined texts were  then given to another group of students, who ranked the ones that were most like the Catton original the highest. Analysis of original and recombined texts, to discover patterns that related to the arrangement of lexical sets to good writing, was inconclusive. A survey of students to determine features that accounted for the quality of the text indicated that the words \"it\" and \"and\" are significant. It seems that the small words provide the key link between the meaning and wording systems of a languge. (CRH)",

Mastery learning provides a structure for teaching that includes class instruction followed by small group work. It is a group-based approach to individualized instruction in which students often can learn cooperatively with their classmates. Mastery learning is a way to individualize instruction within the framework of a traditional group instruction classroom setting. The mastery learning instructional model described in this publication involves four steps: (1) teaching the unit to the class; (2) giving a test to check students' learning at the unit's end and then assessing  mastery of subject matter; (3) giving either enrichment activities or corrective activities to students as required; and (4) giving a second test to measure mastery again. This handbook also provides sample mastery learning units and answers to frequently asked questions about the mastery learning steps. (JMK)",

Paper 1 describes the origins of the DGPs and their present operation from the federal perspective. Results of a survey of DGP officers are summarized in paper 2. Paper 3 offers an overview of functions and possible activities of DGPs. In paper 4, the process of faculty development in the revision of teacher education programs is detailed. The problem of revising teacher education  curricula is discussed in paper 5. Descriptions of how curricula in elementary and secondary education can be changed are presented in papers 6 and 7. The work of projects in the areas of administration and school counselors and psychologists is the topic of paper 8. Following paper 9's discussion of different institutional approaches to project activities, a description is given in paper 10 of DGPs in supporting regional consortia. Paper 11 discusses the problems of program evaluation. Issues that may determine the future course of teacher education and educational services for handicapped students are considered in paper 12.

A checklist of 57 student expectations was developed from responses. A second sample of 291 students from 8 different college/university sources responded to the checklist. Factors were named to reflect areas of students' expectations for: (1) assessing the complexities of teaching; (2)  modeling professional practice; (3) acquiring practical insights and ideas; (4) practicing teaching skills; (5) understanding a variety of school and classroom settings; and (6) dealing directly with students. An analysis is presented in this paper of responses to each of these factors.

Much of this time is spent in spontaneous play in neighborhoods, around the dwelling unit, and on designated playgrounds. Unstructured and spontaneous play is an important part of a child's development. It is through unstructured, child-initiated play that the child is most often free to explore, to test, and to learn from feedback from the environment. This paper: (1) reviews the current major theory of play and play environments; (2) reviews the current research on play environments; and (3) looks at some ideas for the planning and design of play environments based on that research. The basic questions asked are: (1) What is known from the scientific literature about the relations  among the physical environment, children's play behavior, and subsequent development? and (2) How are the findings explained, and how are they used in applications to environmental policy, planning, and design? In investigating these questions, attention is paid to both designated playgrounds and neighborhood play spaces and comparisons made between the two. Eleven new implications for environmental policy and for the planning and design of play environments, based on the research, are offered.

        "description":"This research report offers a theoretical framework for interpreting and improving the incentives available to elementary school teachers by drawing together diverse threads of research on work motivation, reward patterns, and incentive systems across a broad range of work settings. The report draws upon data collected during a year-long study of 15 elementary school teachers, their 5 principals, and 10 central office administrators in one moderately large, urban, unified school district in southern California. This report includes the executive summary of the study as well as eight additional chapters. Chapter 1 offers an overview of teaching incentives, and chapter 2 reviews prior research on elementary school teachers' work motivation, and reward and incentive systems. In the  third chapter, the 15 teachers' work orientations and incentive systems are outlined on organizational, group, and individual levels. Chapter 4, \"Teaching Lessons: The Cultural Enterprize of the Classroom,\" describes lesson structure archetypes, variations, and elements. The fifth chapter discusses classroom management (rules and their enforcement) from the cultural perspective. Chapter 6 puts the five school principals' administrative work in cultural perspective. Chapter 7 talks about different cultural incentives and effective teaching. Chapter 8 discusses policy implications involved in teacher incentives and school achievement and administration. Appended to the report are methodological notes and references. (JMK)",

        "description":"The response to seatwork assignments of 26 high and low achievers in 8 first grade classrooms was examined. Students were observed during five half-days of school over a five to six month period. Teachers were interviewed twice during the year, with particular attention being paid to how they handled selecting seatwork assignments, presented them to students, monitored seatwork, and evaluated and gave feedback. A review of the data revealed that every poor responder was a member of a lower level reading group, and every high responder a member of a higher level reading group. These data suggested that seatwork was a qualitatively different experience for low achievers. Further analyses of the data revealed that poor responders differed in ease of answering questions, and used  strategies that helped them complete assignments but did not aid their understanding. These data suggested why achievement differences widen over time; lower achievers were spending less of their seatwork time in beneficial ways than were the higher achievers. Teacher data indicated that poorer responses of lower achievers could be related to the teachers' emphasis on seatwork as a matter of routine, assignment of work that was too difficult, failure to provide help-seeking mechanisms, and an emphasis on persistence and task completion rather than on task understanding. Case studies are appended of four high achievers and four low achievers. (JD)",

This report makes use of teachers' comments, made to the researchers conducting the study, about the teaching profession, teacher research, and their individual work. A chapter on generic features of teaching considers teaching in the context of many human practices, in an effort to identify the family of  practices to which teaching belongs. Social features of teaching and their implications for teacher performance are discussed in the next chapter. The next major section analyzes teacher performance and the features which make teacher performance \"joint,\" or dependent, upon other factors such as students.

The teachers ranked student characteristics first and curriculum materials second as factors influencing how they proceed in the classroom. An inservice training program, referred to as Professional Development Program  Improvement Center (PDPIC), was cited as a valuable source of decision making support, as well as the \"Stull Objectives,\" a teacher improvement system similar to PDPIC but focusing on behavioral management.

Discrepancies between students' post instruction conceptions and the scientific theories as taught often represent important failures of instruction. The existence and persistence of students' preconceptions implies that learning involves not only the acquisition or formation of new concepts, but also modification of existing concepts or their replacement with appropriate alternatives, i.e., conceptual change. Reported are study results that analyzed changes in fifth-grade students' conceptions that did (and did not) occur as they experienced  instruction designed to change their conceptions of how green plants get their food. It is noted that the instruction was based on chapters 3-6 of the Rand McNally SCIIS &quot;Communities&quot; unit. The strategy for the instruction sequence of the &quot;Communities&quot; unit is outlined in detail and a discussion of four ways (empirical ambiguity; ambiguity in discourse; attacking the wrong preconception; and loose framing of important issues) in which teaching for conceptual change can go wrong is presented. Implications for analysis and interpretation of empirical studies of conceptual change are also discussed. (JMK)",

Four studies are reported. The first describes five teachers and their students and explores, in classroom lessons, the cognitive processes students used in response to teaching and the cognitive processes their teachers intended them to use. The second and third studies employ analogs of classroom teaching in the form of short videotaped lessons. These sought to determine if elementary school students could be trained to perceive and act on common instructional stimuli and whether these operations would facilitate learning. The fourth study constituted an extension of the second and third  studies to regular classroom environments. Three major conclusions are offered: (1) Students and teachers operate in ways that reflect the mediating role of students' cognition in classroom learning; (2) Students can be trained to discriminate instructional stimuli and respond with pre-arranged cognitive strategies; and (3) Students' achievement is partly a function of cognitive strategies they activate in response to instructional stimuli perceived during teaching. Methodological issues attendant to the studies are discussed. (Author/JD)",

Important trends in public attitudes about the teaching profession are explored, as well as teachers' perspectives on recruitment and retention. Among the serious problems noted were comparatively low salaries, uncertain job security, and public and media attacks on the profession. Also noted were school problems which affected teacher morale--student attitudes and behavior, shortened school days and years, and decreasing autonomy and advancement opportunities. Two conclusions are drawn: (1) Just holding still, or maintaining the profession's appeal at its current limited level, will require significant effort; and  (2) Any real improvement in the attractiveness of the profession will require major efforts to redesign teachers' career patterns. Recommendations include: (1) higher salaries; (2) differential pay; (3) loans/fellowships; (4) more job security; (5) better public relations; (6) more supportive school environment; (7) tougher entry and renewal standards; (8) more flexible career ladders; (9) a master teachers corps; and (10) more teacher autonomy.

        "description":"A survey of parents of 1269 students in 82 first, third, and fifth grade classrooms in Maryland was conducted to investigate the effects (on parents) of parent involvement techniques (used by teachers) for learning activities at home. Some of the teachers were recognized by their principal for their leadership in the use of parent involvement, while other teachers frequently used parent involvement, and some used few, if any, parent involvement techniques. Survey results indicate that parents have generally positive attitudes about their child's school and teacher. However, many parents receive few or no communications from the school, few are involved at the school, and most believe that schools could do more to involve parents in home learning activities. It was also found that  teacher-leaders used parent involvement practices more often and more equitably with parents of all educational levels. Parents of children with teachers who frequently use home learning activities are more aware of teachers' efforts, receive more ideas from teachers, know more about their child's instructional program, and rate the teacher higher in interpersonal skills and overall teaching quality. Other types of parent involvement, such as routine communications from the school or parent involvement at the school, do not have as strong or consistent effects on parents. (Author/CJB)",

(3) Is utility a normative or a descriptive concept? and (4) How does the concept of knowledge utilization figure in the specialized discourse of social scientists? This paper analyzes the concept of knowledge utilization from the perspective of philosophy of language and philosophy of science. Knowledge utilization is a rhetorical evocation that implies concepts of action and knowledge. It is supported by two conceptual fusions. The fusion of value and utility draws on common sense, but does not exhaust colloquial understandings about knowledge and action. The conceptual fusion of knowledge and truth is  consistent with common sense but disregards scientific criticism. Both conceptual fusions are thus problematic. But empirical conditions associated with the concept of knowledge utilization mask and reinforce the problematic aspects of this concept. (Author/JD)",

The hierarchical argument contains two main points: (1) that content knowledge is a logical precondition for the activities of teaching; and (2) that the firm grasp of subject matter has to be relaxed to allow for its pedagogical, fluid control, that is, the extent to which teachers hold knowledge with ease and flexibility and keep the door open to different points of view. Lacks in the depth and assurance of teachers' knowledge of content can act as conceptual and behavioral traps that lead teachers and students away from education to outward forms of achievement, misconceptions,  and procedural concerns. However, factual and conceptual control of subject matter is not enough for teachers. Given the pedagogical requirement for flexible control of subject matter, knowledge of epistemology and history of science is a specific preparation for teaching. Knowledge of this kind deepens understanding of subject matter, encourages the mobility of teacher conceptions, and yields pedagogical knowledge in the form of multiple and fluid conceptions. Policy implications of this argument for the curriculum of teacher education, selection into the profession, and conventional modes of classroom induction are discussed. (Author/JMK)",

        "description":"The limitations and unique contributions of experiential learning across the learning-to-teach continuum (pretraining phase, preservice phase, inservice phase/on-the-job learning) were examined. Three vignettes are presented that describe specific examples of firsthand experience: student teaching, exploratory field experiences, and the field as a laboratory for courses in educational foundations and methods of teaching. The vignette analysis is guided by three questions: (1) What is the preservice teacher learning in the here and now of each experience? (2) How do these lessons of experience relate to the central purpose of teaching, that is, helping pupils to learn things? and (3) To what extent do these lessons foster the capacity to learn from future experience? The analysis  draws on studies of the social psychology of judgment, reinforcement theory, and research on teaching and teacher education. It identifies three pitfalls that arrest thought or mislead prospective teachers into believing that central aspects of teaching have been mastered and understood (the familiarity pitfall, the two-worlds pitfall, and the cross-purposes pitfall), and concludes with a discussion of how these pitfalls of experience in teacher preparation can be overcome.

        "description":"Year-long case studies of instructional practices in elementary school mathematics were analyzed to describe testing practices of seven teachers in three school districts in Michigan and the uses those teachers made of test results. Focused on were: (1) curriculum-embedded tests (in particular the Management By Objectives system); (2) the use of results of curriculum-embedded tests for placement of students; (3) content decisions; and (4) student evaluation. Each time teachers made placement decisions (e.g., to create homogeneous groups within classrooms), some form of curriculum-embedded test was used. When teachers made content decisions about topic selection and pacing, four distinct styles of curriculum-embedded test usage emerged: (1) not monitoring student progress and  referring to tests rarely, if ever; (2) relying on informal assessments (not labeled as tests) that are conducted with the intent of determining adequacy of student understanding; (3) using curriculum-embedded tests to make the domain for mastery clear and public but not actually to monitor student progress; and (4) using the results of curriculum-embedded tests as the sole criterion for deciding when a student can move on to a new topic. Overall, the data suggest that curriculum-embedded tests are important for some purposes, but not for others. (Author/JMK)",

Findings of studies on staff development have identified characteristics of successful inservice programs. Collaboration between all participants in organizing and planning the program is of prime importance. Essential, also, is that the program be based on an assessment of the real needs and professional concerns of teachers, and be focused on specifics that may be successfully translated into practice. School-based programs which include effective training components have been rated by participants as successful. Research on the stages of concern through which teachers progress  as they advance in their profession has identified a developmental pattern which evolves from the early survival stage, through an adjustment stage, and finally arrives at a vocationally mature stage. Staff development programs can be tailored to accommodate teachers' needs at different career stages. By offering more comprehensive staff development programs which use the stages of concern guidelines, well designed programs can be developed to help teachers become more effective. (JD)",

A systematic approach to classroom management is recommended that would deal with advance planning and preparation before the school year, and the establishment of procedures and routines that would be maintained throughout the year. Emphasis would be on well chosen and prepared academic activities which would focus students' attention and engagement. A detailed outline is given in this paper of a preservice teacher education course, offered prior to student teaching, and specifically designed to provide students with a comprehensive, skill-oriented approach to discipline. The following  classroom management topics are covered in the course: (1) a continuum of approaches to classroom management and discipline; (2) understanding students' personal and academic needs; (3) clarifying teachers' beliefs, values, and goals; (4) management of instruction; (5) managing records; and (6) planning for the first days of school.

Teachers stress problem solving, discovery, and concept learning in teaching physical education to young children. To assist teachers and students, kindergarten-grade 2, in developing a firm foundation in movement, the television series &quot;Leaps and Bounds&quot; was developed along with this accompanying teacher's guide. There is a total of 16 programs, each 15 minutes long and covering a specific skill area, in this television series. Skill areas are arranged sequentially from basic body awareness and control concepts to the more complex skills of kicking and striking. This guide for &quot;Leaps  and Bounds&quot; has been designed to take the teacher through the 16-program television series step-by-step. Each program has been divided into two major areas in the guide: program and lessons. The heading &quot;program&quot; and its subheadings (movement concepts, objectives, focus for the teacher, focus for the child, follow-up, and references) refer specifically to the television presentation. &quot;Lessons&quot; and its subheadings (lesson concepts, lesson focus, learning activities, culminating activities, and follow-up) refer to the three follow-up lessons designed for each program in the &quot;Leaps and Bounds&quot; series.

First, the descriptive, non-causal conclusions of the two hypothetical statisticians are both correct. They appear contradictory only because they describe quite different aspects of the data. Second, the causal inferences of the statisticians are neither correct nor incorrect since they are based on different assumptions that our mathematical model makes explicit, but neither assumption can be tested using the data set that is described in the example. We identify these differing assumptions and show how each may be used to justify the differing causal conclusions of the two statisticians. In addition to analyzing the  classic &quot;diet&quot; example which Lord used to introduce his paradox, we also examine three other examples that appear in the three papers where Lord discusses the paradox and related matters.

By 1926, the use of quotas by elite colleges had made discrimination in admissions through the use of tests somewhat superfluous. Socially selective schools, in this early period, probably sought the SAT primarily to help evaluate &quot;desirable&quot; borderline candidates who could not otherwise demonstrate clearly their qualifications. The enthusiasm of at least one proponent of the SAT's precursor, the National Intelligence Test, did stem in part from a belief that such tests could be used to identify and reject presumably less  intelligent college applicants from minority groups but by the time of the SAT's introduction, its creator, Carl Brigham, was skeptical that it measured intelligence. Although Brigham did support the &quot;native intelligence&quot; hypothesis early in his career, he publicly reversed his position in 1930 and thereafter stated that heredity had little to do with average performance on tests by ethnic groups.

In addition, other information about the test takers' current status was collected. The typical respondent had applied to one or two departments, was accepted by at least one department, and said that he or she was satisfied with the department in which he or she was enrolled. This picture changed slightly when applicants were grouped by undergraduate grades, GRE scores, sex, race, and  intended fields of study. There was evidence of self-selection by test takers to apply to more prestigious departments, based on their undergraduate grades and GRE scores.

To answer this question, an attempt was made to define both \"problems\" and their \"solutions.\" Then the evidence for the existence of general problem-solving skills that are independent from any specific field was examined. The analyses of skills within disciplines were reviewed to see if the skills are common across fields. Finally, the implications of the research for the assessment of problem-solving skills were studied. In general, it was concluded that similar skills are used in different fields, but that their implementation is so  dependent on mastery of the specific fields that any assessment of problem-solving skills would best be conducted within the fields.

        "description":"This paper reviews the now massive general literature showing that psychological tests are fair to minorities. This literature shows that there is no single group validity, there is no differential validity, and tests overpredict rather than underpredict minority job performance. Further evidence in regard to blacks is introduced from 51 validation studies done by the United States Employment Service. General Aptitude Test Battery norms for Blacks, Indians, Mexican Americans, Orientals, and the majority are compared. Although the majority is higher on cognitive abilities, three out of four minority groups are higher than the majority on psychomotor ability. Thus, there is a varied pattern of rank orders among groups across jobs of different complexity. In particular, it is shown  that for jobs of low complexity, the addition of psychomotor ability as a predictor simultaneously reduces adverse impact while increasing the validity and, hence, economic benefits of the use of tests for selection.

Indicators of IOR effectiveness are clustered into four major categories: organizational situations, structural characteristics, relational characteristics, and process characteristics. Organizational characteristics conducive to a collaborative IOR include the existence of potential resources, a generally cooperative environment, and congruence between the organization's goals and IOR goals. Structural characteristics of IORs include coordinating mechanisms, demographic conditions, and resource contributions. Relational characteristics of IORs  include interactions among individual representatives of member organizations, and complex and multiple ties at various levels. Process characteristics of IORs include degree of formality, features of the exchange process, and patterns of influence. Evaluations of IORs need to attend to these four components in the paradigm.

This drawback was resolved with the development by Kidder of a computer program which calculates a syntactic density score for writing samples. The purpose of this study was to examine the sensitivity of the Syntactic Density computer program as an instrument for measuring changes in language development among high school students in a writing skills instructional program. Students' pre and post writing samples were edited for spelling and punctuation and then input into the Syntactic Density computer program. Five items from the program's output were selected for analysis: total number of words, total number of T-units, words per T-unit, total score,  and syntactic density score. Although significant differences were not found between pre- and post-analyses in most instances, similar results obtained on other measures in the larger study suggest this was likely due to the absence of significant change in students rather than lack of sensitivity on the part of the instrument.

The second source of information was a needs sensing survey conducted by the NWREL Training Center, which included a study of local  education agency superintendents' needs regarding inservice practices/interests. The third source of information focused on NWREL staff perceptions of their own needs in the area of cost methods based on the types of service they have provided, or anticipate providing, to clients.

The cost analysis problem, costing of alternatives, discussion of costs, estimating the effects, and relating costs and effects are discussed. The appendices include: cost effectiveness of teacher preparation courses (possible program ingredients and cost items), final evaluation of student teaching form, and end of student teaching evaluation ratings and grade  point averages.

NWREL, local and state education agencies in Oregon and Washington, and two Portland area universities were represented at the conference. Jana Kay Smith presented a report which reviewed cost studies conducted at NWREL from 1978 to 1982. The report assessed the current practice of cost analysis in education and proposed a system to help determine the cost needs of a client requesting a cost study. Larry Picus had conducted the majority of cost studies reviewed in Smith's report and shared his experiences with applications of cost analysis methods in educational settings. Members of a panel  which consisted of local and state education agency and NWREL staff discussed prospects for cost analysis methods in their agencies. All panel members (Don Egge, Walt Hathaway, Zeno Katterle, and Robert Rath) were known for their interest in the area of cost analysis and for their experience in the conduct of such studies.

Five-, seven-, nine-, and eleven-year-old children were presented with short narrative passages within which were embedded three types of problems (nonsense words, internal inconsistencies, and prior knowledge violations), each of which could only be identified if a specific standard of evaluation were used (lexical, internal consistency, and external consistency, respectively). Since the focus of the study was on the effectiveness with which children could apply the standards, rather than on the likelihood that they would spontaneously adopt and then apply them, the subjects were explicitly instructed in advance that their task was to find the &quot;mistakes.&quot; Moreover,  the subjects were given immediate feedback after each trial and a second opportunity to find any missed problems. Although older children used all three standards more effectively than younger children, overall problem identification was considerably better than that reported in non-instructed settings. The internal consistency standard was applied least effectively, but even the youngest children were able to use it. The results illustrate the need to consider comprehension monitoring skills with respect to specific standards of evaluation, rather than as a unitary phenomenon. (Author)",

Three different types of problems were embedded within the passages to provide opportunities for students to reveal the use of different standards of evaluation. Half of the subjects were informed that they should use three particular standards in order to identify the problems (lexical, external consistency, and internal consistency); the remaining subjects were not given specific information as to the standards they should use. All problems subjects identified were classified as to the type of standard they reflected. The classification scheme consisted of the three targeted standards plus syntax, propositional cohesiveness, structural cohesiveness, and informational  completeness. Of particular concern were differences in the standards adopted by students receiving specific instructions and those receiving general instructions. Use of the lexical standard did not differ with instructional specificity, suggesting that students spontaneously evaluate their understanding of individual words. Students receiving general instructions rarely used the external and internal consistency standards, suggesting these are not criteria students typically adopt. Instead, they commented frequently on the structural cohesiveness of the passages. Students with higher verbal ability exhibited more frequent and more varied standard use than those with lower verbal ability. (Author)",

Half of the children were specificially instructed as to the types of standards they should apply in order to detect the problems (lexical, external consistency, and internal consistency); the remaining children were simply instructed to look for problems. Both quantitative and qualitative differences in standard use were revealed by the children's comments about all parts of the passages. Older and better readers used more different standards and they used them more frequently than younger and poorer readers. The lexical standard was more  likely to be adopted spontaneously than the other two standards and it was the only standard used by a substantial proportion of both younger and poorer readers.

        "description":"Poor, minority, and low ability students suffer most from the general lack of sustained opportunity to study mathematics in American public schools. Studies indicate that preschool and kindergarten students show only minor social class or racial differences in mathematical thinking and that differences in mathematical performance among older students directly relate to the amount of math studied. A 1978 National Assessment of Educational Progress study of selected 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds indicates that while the majority of American 17-year-olds have had 2 years of high school mathematics, black students have had only one year. While the National Assessment found no racial differences in cognitive level performance in mathematics, blacks had increasing difficulty with  mathematical content as they became older. At age 9, blacks showed problems with variables and relationships; by age 17, they showed problems in all mathematical content areas. Although black students showed more positive attitudes towards math learning than their white counterparts at all age levels tested, this motivation alone was not sufficient to insure successful math performance. The National Diffusion Network offers a catalog of successful public school mathematics education programs. Most effective programs have included the following elements: individualized and small group instruction, calculator usage, laboratory work, cross-age tutoring, remedial pull out, and team games.

        "description":"Australian aboriginal unemployment stands at somewhere between 45 percent and 80 percent, a situation caused, according to certain observers, by aboriginal attitudes and values regarding work and by educational disadvantage, not by anything in the working environment. According to this view, aborigines are said to be lacking in motivation, to attach little value to work, to be &quot;by nature&quot; noncompetitive, and to show minimal concern for their future well-being. Research contradicts these popular beliefs. Educational disadvantage limits opportunities for employment in white collar and professional jobs and in some circumstances may preclude training, but it should neither limit employment in semiskilled and laboring jobs nor affect opportunities for on-the-job training and  apprenticeships. Yet, for aborigines it does both. Research and anecdotal evidence suggest that discrimination is a major contributing factor to aboriginal unemployment. Furthermore, government-sponsored regional employment and training programs, which subsidize employers who train or make provision for training aborigines, have increased aboriginal job placements dramatically and are strong evidence that unemployment is due partially to employers' reluctance to hire aborigines. Aboriginal unemployment, then, must be viewed mainly within the broader context of unequal opportunity in recruitment, training, and work conditions, and not as something done to aborigines by themselves.

Despite several years of research on numerous aspects of the population turnaround, little is known about the role of aversion to particular racial groups in the shift, the degree to which many of the quality-of-life decisions given for moving contain racial overtones, or the involvement of blacks in the new migration. Examination of the racial composition of population growth in 75 Midwestern counties that have experienced substantial urban-to-rural migration shows that the immigrant stream is predominantly white. Analysis of the reasons for moving given by a sample of these urban-to-rural migrants clearly points to the importance of non-economic motivations that  can be interpreted as having racial overtones. Such issues as \"busing,\"\"urban crime,\" and \"undesirable conditions in the city\" may well be code words masking direct expressions of racial views. The paper ends by suggesting some means of exploring the hypothesis that racially-motivated aversion is implicated in the new migration to rural areas. (CMG)",

Two different aspects of the climate for  replicability were studied--issues surrounding dissemination and validation of the project, and emerging policy trends.

Recommendations are given for workshops, the development of a community resource system, pursuit of State validation, and possible adaptations in the project.

        "description":"The Promotional Gates Program was initiated in the New York City Public Schools in order to set and maintain citywide curriculum and performance standards, identify students unable to meet the minimum standards, and provide remedial instruction. Under this program, the promotional policy sets &quot;gates&quot; at grades 4 and 7; students unable to meet performance standards at the end of these school years are retained and given intensive instruction in reading and mathematics. This report examines (1) staff development in the program for 1982-83; (2) implementation of the Gates 1982 summer program and outcomes reflected in test results in August, 1982; and (3) the initial implementation of the 1982-83 Gates program and outcomes reflected in test results in January, 1983. Data in the  report refer to students held over in the 4th or 7th grade for the first time in 1981-82. Also presented are data on two subgroups of the Gates population: limited English proficient and resource room students. It is concluded that (1) program organization and administration through January, 1983, was more efficient than in the previous year; (2) appeal procedures were formalized and more consistently applied than in the program's first year; (3) reactions to staff training for the summer and school year programs were largely favorable; and (4) reading outcomes at the end of summer school and in January, 1983, were equivalent to or slightly better than the previous year's results. Problem areas are identified as student attendance, a shortage of instructional materials, and services to  limited English proficient students. (GC)",

The Harbor City Learning program, a partially CETA-funded project in Baltimore, Maryland, provided a comprehensive educational program on a year-round basis: part-time work experience and training in the public sector for those in traditional in-school programs; and an alternative curriculum mixed with paid job experiences for school dropouts. Graduates from the in-school group who were employed for six months or more were compared with subjects from the alternative program who met employment requirements.  Findings suggested that the alternative program served a useful purpose, inasmuch as its vocationally oriented training curriculum helped the participants bring their aptitude measures up to the level of those who had graduated from the regular school. This achievement was particularly noteworthy, since the alternative program subjects came from inferior home environments and had inferior school backgrounds. The study further indicated that the subjects from relatively better home conditions experienced more job satisfaction than subjects from more deprived homes because of lesser needs. (CMG)",

Data from questionnaires administered to the samples are analyzed through use of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Although the findings differ slightly from area to area, in general the findings are as follows: (1) In education, Cuban teachers are underrepresented in educational institutions, Cuban dropout rates are increasing, financial aid programs and bilingual education programs are being underutilized, and public child  care is inadequate. (2) In the social services, language and transportation problems increase service problems. (3) Language barriers, cost, and location factors influence the use of health services; hypertension and nonalcholic cirrhosis rates are higher for Cubans than for other groups. Overall, the data show that, although Cubans as a group have adjusted quickly to American society, many Cubans experience the social difficulties and problems characteristic of immigrants. The research findings are related to recommendations intended to help the government develop policies or modify existing policies, toward the end of improving delivery of services to Cubans. (CMG)",

        "description":"Changes in women's attainment of higher education during the 1970s have been dramatic. This paper documents trends toward women acquiring a higher proportion of degrees at all levels and moving into traditionally male fields of study. In 1980, females were awarded nearly half of all baccalaureate and master's degrees, slightly less than one-third of all doctoral degrees, and one-fourth of all first professional degrees. Moreover, on the undergraduate level, there were substantial increases in women's representation in traditionally male fields of study like business and management, agriculture, engineering, and computer science. Using regression analysis, the decline in an index of sex segregation by field of study among baccalaureate degree recipients is shown to be associated  with a decline in an index of sex segregation among professional occupations. These trends in higher education suggest that young women will exhibit a greater attachment to the labor force than their older counterparts. (Author/CMG)",

Project Concern began in September, 1966, as an experiment in educational intervention for children from Title I schools in the north end of Hartford, with emphasis on city-suburb cooperation in desegregtion. For this evaluation, the Metropolitan Achievement Tests in reading, language arts, and mathematics were administered to all program participants (516 suburban students in grades 2-10 and 139 inner-city students in grades 2-8). A student survey was used to measure participants' attitudes toward school and self-concept on a  continuing basis. Findings showed the following: (1) Both suburban and inner-city participants tended to exhibit statistically significant basic skill growth in reading, mathematics, and language arts at most grade levels. While such significant absolute growth was reflected in positive relative growth for inner-city participants, this was not always the case for suburban participants. (2) Self-concept and school attitudes of all participants in the areas of school and school work, classroom participation, and perception of teachers were quite positive. (3) The results for sustained cognitive impact were mixed, with some gains being sustained while others were not. (CMG)",

Jigsaw also provides  extensive practice in reading for meaning in whatever subject is used. Two forms of Jigsaw are presented, one requiring far less teacher preparation time than the other. Also given are directions for Rutabaga, which is TGT adapted to oral reading in elementary schools.

Preliminary findings on the impact of ECIA Chapter 1 (compensatory education) indicated that the ECIA legislation had not significantly eliminated administrative load or paperwork. It was reported that there has been a relaxation in testing requirements under Chapter 1; more interest in sustained effects studies at both state and local levels; and a change in the forms of parental involvement. Chapter 1 budget cuts had a more dramatic impact than the new legislation, bringing about dramatic reductions in  the number of children served. Preliminary findings on the impact of Chapter 2 (block grants) indicated that the legislation had increased flexibility and decentralization at the local level while reallocating some of the previous categorical funds to smaller districts. Most of Chapter 2 funds were being spent on materials and microcomputers, with evaluators primarily monitoring the flow and expenditure of funds. (CMG)",

        "description":"Observations of Chinese and Filipino middle school and junior high school classes in the San Francisco (California) and Seattle (Washington) areas show that the political and practical realities of the bilingual classroom are far removed from the models favored by bilingual education researchers. The typical APA (Asian Pacific American) \"bilingual\" classroom is multilingual, with five or six native languages spoken in the classroom, some of them understood by no one in the school district. Students are at different educational levels and have entered the classroom at different points throughout the year, and turnover is high. There is no appropriate curriculum, and teachers cope by using small groups and creative classroom management. Research that is related to what actually  goes on in such classrooms could help alleviate a very difficult teaching-learning situation. As this survey shows, current bilingual education research is not pragmatically related to what goes on in the classroom. Furthermore, there is no framework to facilitate the systematic observations of bilingual programs or to compare them. Frameworks which can be used in the future should be based on classifying bilingual programs in terms of (1) language used in major daily scheduling components; (2) language used in contacts among whole groups, small groups, individuals, teacher, and aide; and (3) bilingual teaching strategies.

Our primary thrust toward an industrial policy at present is the recognition that the United States must increase its industrial productivity. Before productivity can be increased, the following facts must be faced: (1) we are moving into a new economic era, one characterized by emphasis on information/high-technology/service industries; (2) productivity in this country has been too low for nearly 10  years; (3) a high-quality education is the essential foundation upon which this new economic era will be constructed; and (4) the American educational system is in trouble with too many functional illiterates and too many high school graduates who cannot read and add. Human resources are our raw materials for creating a new industrial order; therefore, our educational system must do a better job of preparing students for it. The present administration is attacking the problems in American education by reducing government regulations, emphasizing more basic and applied research, and emphasizing quality education and retraining. Recent grants have been made for projects to determine how technology can be used to improve education. Demonstration projects and \"lighthouse\" projects will be  conducted to show how schools can use computers; the television show \"3-2-1 Contact\" has been funded, and studies of computer use in the classroom have begun. If our nation's productivity and competitiveness are to increase, an improvement in the educational system is necessary. (KC)",

The guide has two general purposes. First, it provides information relating to the special resources available and the challenges faced by vocational education teachers. Second, it helps in four problem areas that are of broad interest to teachers and administrators: (1) how to locate instructional products fitting a perceived need; (2) how to select the best products available; (3) how to choose among alternative ways those products might be disseminated to constituents; and (4) how to help ensure that the products are used most effectively. The guide is organized in four parts. Part 1 contains general information on how to use the  guide, how to find instructional products, and how to disseminate instructional products. In part 2, general resources are listed by major curriculum areas and by state. The third part of the guide contains resources and references by the following program and topic areas: agriculture and agribusiness education, business and office occupations education, health occupations education, home economics education, industrial arts education, marketing and distributive education, technical education, trade and industrial education, basic academic skills, competency testing, computer applications, cooperative education, and instructional technology. The final part contains sample organizational abstracts providing information on organizations that are national or of interest to many program  areas. These abstracts list the major functions, vocational areas, description, major products, and contact information. (KC)",

The meeting provided practical classroom-oriented suggestions for teaching industry/technology-based industrial arts. The design of the symposium provided a keynote address, which gave a rationale for teaching technology, followed by two program interest sessions. At each session, two leaders in their area of expertise presented an answer to \"What should be taught and how could it be organized?\" The interest sessions concentrated on five major curriculum areas: communications, construction, manufacturing (enterprise and material processing), and transportation power and energy. The transcripts of the proceedings in this  document give suggestions for teachers to improve their teaching in each of the five areas. Articles are illustrated with line drawings. (KC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to try to determine older adults' motivations for and experiences in the educational system as well as to try to determine how their life histories were being woven into their educational experiences. Based on the work of state theorists such as Buhler and Erikson as well as on the life review concept of Robert Butler, the study focused on a group of older people (60-80) who were taking some form of adult education course. The researcher visited them in their homes on three occasions, each one week apart, and spent one and one-half hours on each visit tape-recording their thoughts. The interviews were somewhat structured. The first focused on the adults' motivations for pursuing education; the second was concerned with the actual experience of classroom  learning; and the last interview focused on the integration of the educational experience into the world of the learners. However, the interviewer let the subjects &quot;ramble on&quot; in hopes of evoking life review types of thoughts. The study found that many motivations exist for older learners to take adult education courses, such as social class, thwarted educational dreams, or a wish to go to college. The classroom experiences of the older adults were diverse; many were nostalgic; most were positive. The interviewer found that the life review process functioned as a counterpoint to classroom involvement as a means of restoring pride and self image when the adult education experience was not a good one. The life review also was used by the older people to remember specific scenes so as to  cope with difficult times as a source of data for solving life problems. At the same time, many of the participants seemed to be on the verge of taking new directions as they reminisced about the past. Thus, the life review process was used to integrate education into their lives and to move on from the experience. (KC)",

        "description":"A study identified strategies used in selected rural states for evaluating the effectiveness of vocational programs and services for handicapped and disadvantaged students. During the study, the researcher examined the documents used by 13 rural states to assess their vocational programs for handicapped and disadvantaged individuals. This examination consisted of a content analysis of the actual evaluation instruments and telephone interviews with individuals involved in program evaluation in each state. Based on this analysis, it appeared that the evaluation of vocational education programs for handicapped and disadvantaged students is an organized activity in most rural states, with 10 the 14 states in the study sample having evaluation programs. Nine of these states evaluated  vocational programs for special needs students separately from other vocational programs. The predominate evaluation strategy used to assess these vocational programs was to have one or more external evaluators visit each program to interview students and teachers, view program facilities, and observe the program in operation. Recommendations emerging from the study included calls to specify state education agency (SEA) purposes for evaluating vocational programs and to have state program evaluation systems include a mechanism for assessing the impact of program evaluation of the SEA on local education agencies and on specific programs and services.

        "description":"The Center for Independent Living of Greater Bridgeport and its operating agencies conducted a survey of 32 people, the majority of whom were developmentally disabled and residents of institutional or community settings, in both rural and urban areas. The aim of the survey was to determine the perceived needs and levels of independence experienced by these two distinct populations. A questionnaire was developed to gain information on individuals' lifestyles, services used, and levels of satisfaction. Areas addressed were demographics, education, employment and training, income and benefits, housing, recreation and leisure time, transportation, as well as medical treatment, counseling, advocacy, and legal issues. Overall, the findings showed that people living in the community  reported greater satisfaction and better use of both generic and categorical services in several areas including transportation, vocational training and options, and living situations. It was concluded that people living in the community reported a greater level of independence and fewer needs than their institutionalized peers. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A proposed model for the staff development of community college part-time faculty was designed for direct application at Clark County Community College (CCCC) in Las Vegas, Nevada. The model, which was based on a literature review, a survey of professional staff at CCCC, and a review by the CCCC study advisory committee, addresses the following areas: administration of the training, determination of training needs, development and organization of curriculum components, identification of the populations to be served, logistics of the training program, funding, and supportive services. Because most part-time faculty are employed full-time in jobs outside of the college, designers of the model determined that the most feasible way to provide training for these instructors would be  through on-campus, short-term workshops held on weekends and during school breaks. The potential curriculum of the training programs consisted of 50 topics dealing with the mission of the community college, institutional development and delivery, legal aspects of education, and classroom and lab management. Supportive services that appear necessary to ensure the success of such a training program include the publication of a part-time faculty handbook and accommodations such as flexible scheduling, released time, or travel funds to help teachers participating in the program.

(To explain the way in which organizational control operates, French and Raven postulated the following five power bases: reward, coercive, legitimate, referent, and expert power.) During the study, researchers surveyed 193 students from 10 home schools and 13 vocational and technical shops as well as 10 shop instructors. These individuals were asked to rank their perception of the frequency of use of each of the behavior control categories and to rate the effectiveness of each power base. Referent power far outranked the other power bases as the most effective means of control while punishment was ranked as the least effective control  strategy. In terms of frequency of use, students felt that the vocational teachers used referent and expert power more frequently than did the home school teachers, while the home school teachers are perceived to use punishment far more frequently than the vocational teachers. Based on these findings, recommendations were made calling for shop instructors to do more to cultivate their expert power and to rely more heavily upon legitimate than on reward power.

To illustrate the main points, results of extensive interviews with seven handicapped youth are juxtaposed with statistics and findings. The study looks at tne continuum of services offered to handicapped individuals, including understanding the disabilities and teaching mainstreamed students, teaching and training handicapped youth through vocational education, and postsecondary training and employment of handicapped youth. The impact of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 is assessed with emphasis on parent involvement in the Individualized Education Program process and Congress's failure to appropriate money. The level of service to handicapped youth by  vocational education in high schools and the involvement in Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs by handicapped youth are also discussed. The continuum of service from preschool to employment is then presented as exemplified by several exceptional programs. A narrative follows of events of 1982, during which the gains registered by advocates for the handicapped population were tested in all branches of the federal government. Recommendations are made regarding creation of a national commission to study the economics of preparing handicapped individuals for work and amendments to and implementation of the Job Training Partnership Act.

        "description":"The General Accounting Office assessed the likely impact of replacing personal income with the Representative Tax System (RTS) on the distribution of federal aid among the states in three formula-based programs. These programs were the General Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, known as the Revenue Sharing program; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, known as Medicaid; and the Vocational Education Act of 1963. The analyses indicated that if replacing personal income with the RTS were the only change made in the three formulas, federal funds would be redistributed away from states with high revenue raising potential from nonincome revenue sources. These were primarily states with relatively high energy production and, to a lesser extent, high property values and retail sales.  However, the rationale for replacing personal income with the RTS would argue in favor of additional formula changes as well. When additional formula changes were considered, no general distributional pattern emerged. This was because the distributional outcome was sensitive to which program was being considered and to precisely what other formula changes would be likely to be made. Appendixes present data tables with results of the analyses. (YLB)",

        "description":"Four kinds of measures of excellence are currently used in evaluating vocational education: components and process, occupational impact, equity, and individual student development. None of them displays the kind of precision that characterizes measures in the physical sciences. Furthermore, the nature of the enterprise to which these measures must be applied--vocational education--presents complications. Vocational education is not a single, homogeneous program, but many programs with differing purposes offered in various types of institutions. A further problem is that some of these measures are more pertinent for some varieties of vocational education than others. In addition, no general agreement exists on how the weighting of measures of excellence must be done. To achieve  relevance, a notion included in excellence, vocational education also must adapt to the &quot;dimensions of change&quot;--technological, economic, and demographic. Vocational educators have identified areas where program improvement efforts might best be concentrated. Problems that will affect the extent to which the excellence of vocational programs can be enhanced include the need for better evaluation; choice of precedence of program improvement actions; roles of federal, state, and local agencies; and obtaining of accurate, usable manpower demand data for program planning.

        "description":"Four of the policy statements for vocational education developed by the Wisconsin Board of Vocational, Technical, and Adult Education reflect concerns shared in the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Vocational and Adult Education. First, vocational education is accountable to the publics, namely students, employers, and state, local, and federal governments. Second, evaluation systems for vocational education are the responsibility of state and local units. Third, planning and implementation of vocational education programs is carried out by the local district with the assistance of appropriate state leadership and federal agencies. Fourth, state agencies responsible for vocational education provide leadership for evaluation of vocational education. Evaluating vocational  programs and measuring their effectiveness is difficult. Vocational programs have different purposes and are offered by diverse institutions. Four measures to evaluate vocational education--components and process, occupational impact, equity, and individual student development--all present similar complications. Two issues that will affect vocational programs are weighting evaluation measures and choosing which programs to improve. The proposed Vocational and Adult Education Consolidation Act of 1983 has these components: a simplification of the current Vocational Education Act and provision for a single consolidated grant to each state.

The next section reports findings with implications for further work in this area, including a list of job titles (with skills) important to Vermont industry and a  list of institutions interested in participation. Chapter 6 describes the brokerage service model. Two basic roles, ongoing needs assessment and brokering of custom training services, are emphasized. These other roles are considered: brokering of training materials, brokering of placement services, and faculty lend-lease. Constructive communication, undertaking of training programs, and adoption of the brokering service model are reported as outcomes in chapter 7. Chapter 8 summarizes project conclusions.

        "description":"Adult retraining is an important area for educators to understand because there appear to be some changes developing in the delivery of education and training. One change relates to the entry of private enterprise into the training field, such as the computer courses being held by Radio Shack. Other changes concern the population to be educated. This population tends to be more mobile than ever before, and older. These characteristics mean that many adults will be coming and going in training programs (having an effect on the types of programs that can be successful), and that adjustments in teaching strategies will have to be made to compensate for adults' slower reaction times and possible health problems. Other changes in the adult population that will affect retraining  include the possibility of job layoff (which may potentially make learners hostile or fearful), increasingly stressful ways of life, and smaller families. The explosion of knowledge as technology advances also makes the task of teaching adults even more overwhelming; the amount of information students must know constantly increases.

After receiving the contract, the college recruited a project director to serve in its Natural Sciences Division. The project director worked together with representatives from the faculty, local health care providers, and health educators from other colleges to develop a proposed curriculum. The curriculum turned out to be a 66-credit program designed to prepare students to provide community- and family-based health supportive services in the areas of disease prevention and health promotion. The curriculum, which had a strong natural science base, focused on the biological  and psychological aspects of human health and included studies in religion, sociology, and communication skills. During the course of the program development effort, project staff organized and implemented community and faculty workshops and developed a variety of resource materials, including project brochures, instructional materials, seven separately bound instructor resource guides, and evaluation forms.

Chapter 1 describes the origins and key features of TRADEC courses; succeeding chapters examine how they were implemented. These key features and issues in the operation of the TRADEC system are commented upon in chapters 2 through 9: initiating and maintaining a TRADEC scheme; the client populations; special curriculum features; learner benefits; employer involvement and commitment; implementation, monitoring, and support; assessment; and costs and viability. Chapter 10 presents five case studies of selected schemes within the five fields in which  implementation has been achieved. The final chapter compares TRADEC both with conventional vocational day-release courses and the emerging schemes of vocational preparation. It concludes that TRADEC schemes in design have the potential to align themselves with other approaches, but in operational terms more needs to be done. (YLB)",

The research design comprised three major elements. First, a developmental phase was devoted to identification and clarification of the key evaluation questions, construction of a detailed description of the system and its component schemes, and development of a set of working hypotheses. Second, empirical investigations of schemes currently in operation required four approaches to data collection: compilation of existing recorded data across all cases, survey of key evaluation variables across a representative sample, detailed case study of a  limited number of cases, and observation of selected system processes. Third, comparative studies were designed to draw &quot;broad-brush&quot; comparisons between the philosophy and implementation of TRADEC and those of vocational preparation and conventional day release. (Appendixes, amounting to approximately three-fourths of the report, include the primary evaluation questions and survey questionnaires for all participants in TRADEC schemes.) (YLB)",

        "description":"Ten parallel human service agencies (five urban and five rural) were compared to identify variations in the service delivery system and to compare the costs of service provision. The agencies responded to approximately 36 questions covering eight major areas and were compared and contrasted, urban versus rural, according to the type of agency. All of the agencies used some form of basic media advertising but felt more marketing was required. All participated in two or more multi-agency collaborative efforts, with the urban agencies generally involved in more such efforts. Advantages were reduction of duplication and utilization of participating agency strengths. Disadvantages were problems in dealing with conflicting personalities and loss of flexibility and control over  programs. All agencies were aware of other services for individuals ineligible for their programs and were satisfied with the number of referrals they made and received. The largest differences were found in their identification of priorities due to service gaps and future plans to address them. (These need areas are discussed in detail in five sections, which compare and contrast the 10 agencies by type of service offered. A table provides information regarding service fees, who determines rates, annual operating budgets, and total revenue generated.) (YLB)",

        "description":"This bulletin examines the employment problems of workers in relation to their family and household economic status, as measured by their family income and poverty-nonpoverty status. The bulletin is based largely on data from the March 1982 Current Population Survey of the Bureau of the Census that relates to the year 1981. For each of the three problems defined (low earnings among year-round full-time workers, unemployment, and involuntary parttime employment), poverty was found to be related to the problems but was not synonymous. Persons experiencing employment problems who were in families or households with additional earners usually did not fall into poverty, while those who were the sole providers for themselves and others more often did. Employment problems affecting  Black or Hispanic workers were more likely to result in poverty than for White workers. The linkage between employment problems and poverty-level incomes tightened between 1979 and 1981. The percentage of persons with an employment problem increased during the period. By 1981, 26.5 percent of those with low earnings, 19.1 percent of those with unemployment, and 16.7 percent of those with involuntary part-time work during the year were living in families or households with incomes below the poverty level. When those experiencing more than one problem during the year (7.3 million) were taken into consideration, 35 million workers were affected by employment problems. About 6.7 million of these persons lived in families or households with incomes below the poverty level. Using a longitudinal  subsample to examine the movements into and out of poverty for those in the labor force at some time in 1980-81, analysis of the data showed that for many workers, poverty was not a permanent or chronic problem.

        "description":"This document is a transcript of a Congressional hearing conducted for the purpose of discussing the workings of the new federal Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) as it applies to veterans. Witnesses included various officials of veterans groups, especially Vietnam veterans from Massachusetts, state officials of Massachusetts, a representative of the Veterans Employment and Training Service of the U.S. Department of Labor, and U.S. Representative Barney Frank who conducted the hearing. During the hearing, witnesses emphasized that the JTPA, as now written, allots only about $2.8 million for veterans' job training, amounting to only about ten dollars per Vietnam veteran. The money allotted for veterans' training in Massachusetts amounts to only about $218,000. The witnesses  stated that a much greater level of funding is needed if the JTPA is to make an impact on veterans' unemployment. The witnesses also stressed the need for representation of Vietnam veterans on the Private Industry Councils (PICs) that are responsible for overseeing the JPTA programs in each state. They said the councils should have a veteran membership about equal to the percent of veterans in the population. Another topic discussed by witnesses included the necessity of extending the length of time for Vietnam veterans to use their educational benefits. Prepared statements by some of the witnesses are also included in the document. (KC)",

It reviews evaluation users, dimensions, general procedures, and standards. Alternatives to designing studies of extension program results are cited in part 2. Four basic study designs used in evaluating extension program results are examined ((1) survey (ex-post facto), (2) time-series, (3) comparison group, and (4) field  experiment), and their relative suitability is linked to practical considerations based on the evaluation situation. This part also lists 10 specific facets of the study designs and illustrates how each may lead to alternative ways of constructing a design for a study. Part 3 provides a brief review of the conditions that lend themselves to alternative study designs and suggests contexts in which this resource publication should be viewed. (YLB)",

The first three papers provide an overview of the forum. They summarize the proceedings and policy considerations and address how vocational education and training can be responsive to change. The next four papers focus on occupational projections. Specific topics are accuracy and utilization of occupational forecasts, labor market models for college-trained workers, and reactor comments on occupational forecasting and projections. The third section on early warning systems contains four papers that address preparation of staffing requirements data at the micro- or plant level, a descriptive  survey of the employment effects of the defense budget, and reactor comments on these two presentations. Seven papers deal with state and local adjustments to changing labor market demands, specifically the states' human resource development role, local coordination and linking efforts among employment and training programs, vocational education's response to skilled industrial worker shortaqes, factors influencing vocational education program decisions, and two papers with reactor comments. A paper on the experiences of other countries in responding to changes in the demand for skilled workers and reactor comments conclude the volume. (YLB)",

        "description":"Teacher education institutions need to accept responsibility for helping to keep vocational and technical teachers technically current. The University of Minnesota is helping inservice teachers keep up-to-date in three ways. The largest number of teachers have been served through short technical workshops. The workshops have covered a wide variety of topics and have been taught by instructors from industry who received help in developing instructional plans and materials. The State Department of Education has provided money for the workshop coordinator's position and has subsidized the cost of the workshops. Teachers also enroll in internships that refer to industrial employment in the teacher's field of specialization. The state of Minnesota pays the essential costs, including  hiring of a substitute teacher and extra travel. Inservice teachers can also utilize a variety of other learning experiences through independent studies. Independent studies can center on participation in manufacturers' service schools, attendance at a trade show, travel, research and writing, and consulting. Some principles can ensure the quality of a learning experience. These include careful planning, analysis of need, statement of objectives, use of the community as a resource, integration of the technical updating into teaching, and evaluation of outcomes. (YLB)",

        "description":"Four high school special education teachers in the Vocational Education Program in the South Bend Community School Corporation participated in a mathematics program. They then conducted classroom research related to their inservice activities with their mildly handicapped students. Teachers used manipulative materials in their inservice sessions and indicated positive attitudes toward their use with low achievers. Each teacher selected a minimum of 10 students for participation in the study; the entire class participated in the activities. Focus of the study was student achievement on computation with whole numbers. Each teacher determined the format for use of manipulatives, such as Try-A-Tile Cards, math match card games, pathway activities, calculators, and dice games.  Increases in achievement on computations were obtained on all subtests and composites with one exception. Results lent support to the notion that use of mathematics manipulatives with slow learners can improve computation skills. In addition, classroom activities created a high level of interest in mathematics among many students. (YLB)",

Section B is a comparative analysis of the reports on innovative vocational training measures in West Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. It specifically features measures covered in the survey (initiative, implementation and control, financing, socioeconomic context), objectives of the measures (types of program, occupations for which training is given and final qualifications, innovation,  relationship to the labor market), context of the measures (differences between normal training and measures surveyed; course of training, content, and methods; supporting measures; training personnel), and evaluation (number of trainees, assessment of measures by participants and institutions/persons involved). The reports on innovative measures in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands are surveyed in section C. The final section makes conclusions regarding commonalities in the initiatives, participants' problems in innovative vocational education, and the role of equal rights commissions in initiatives.

A random sample of 293 handicapped students from secondary school districts in Illinois were studied. The students were in the categories of educably mentally handicapped (EMI), learning disabled, educationally handicapped, and behaviorally disordered. Their 1981-82 individualized education programs (IEPs) and course schedules were reviewed on-site, and data were collected identifying the extent to which these students were involved in vocational and industrial arts education coursework and had vocationally related information  on their IEPs. Only slightly fewer handicapped students were enrolled in vocational education/industrial arts classwork than the unhandicapped enrollment. The students' disability category did not seem to affect the quality of the vocational course placement, especially those labeled EMI. Services to handicapped placements were not being made in equitable proportions. The FACTS and the Vocational Education Data System were not found to be reliable sources for data on access and placement. (YLB)",

        "description":"A North Carolina project identified the elements influencing an institution's responsiveness to industry and developed a model to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of that response. Data were collected through structured interviews at each of 15 top-rated colleges and with representatives of two industries with whom the college had worked. Responsiveness models were generated using the findings, a literature review, and project advisory committee inputs. Major findings were presented at three regional dissemination workshops. Implementation strategies were discussed, and subjective evaluation of the models were secured from experienced personnel who attended. Nineteen elements affecting institutional responsiveness to industry were identified as being of &quot;some&quot; to&quot;extreme&quot; importance. The top six elements referred specifically to college commitment, policy, and/or activities that included reliability of the institution, strong personal commitment of the president to industry training, high quality of instruction provided, quick response and follow-through by the institution, tailoring of courses to meet specific industry needs, and flexibility of the institution. (Six figures show the participating colleges, weighted listing of elements, elements placed in six major factors, levels of responsiveness of institutions based on the factored elements and the services provided, and the combined responsiveness model.)

        "description":"During the summer of 1982, summer jobs programs organized and operated by the private sector were underway in numerous cities, often in addition to or in cooperation with the government-funded Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) projects. Of the 176 companies that responded to a Conference Board survey of 480 of the largest corporations in cities with populations of more than 250,000, 70 percent indicated that they participated in summer jobs programs in 1982. Most of the firms took part in programs for disadvantaged youth as part of community summer jobs programs, where the major portion of growth in business involvement in offering summer jobs has come. Most of the summer jobs were routine, low-skill clerical or maintenance positions, providing little if any  training. The motives cited by the survey respondents as most important lean heavily toward social obligation, such as &quot;an interest in advancing opportunities for youth,&quot;&quot;an act of social responsibility,&quot; or &quot;a means of practicing community involvement.&quot; Other reasons cited included &quot;good public relations for the company,&quot; and &quot;need for additional employees in the summer.&quot; Although one of the least pervasive motivations was &quot;peer pressure from other business leaders,&quot; this reason seems to be one of the key elements in putting together a successful community-based summer jobs program. The summer jobs experience was deemed to be relatively successful by most companies, and 66 percent say that they will participate again. The overall number of jobs created and youth placed, however, was  small compared to the need. Greater efforts, including year-round jobs programs sponsored by the private sector, are needed. (This report includes specifics of the summer jobs programs of 14 cities.) (KC)",

Discussed in the first part of the paper is the meaning of the JTPA for handicapped individuals. The next section of the presentation focuses on the special needs of handicapped individuals for vocational rehabilitative services, on the provisions for such services in currently existing federal legislation, and on the costs incurred by the public and private sectors in providing such services. Covered in an examination of the importance of the private industry council (PIC) are procedures for becoming a member of a  PIC, guidelines for evaluating a PIC, and types of JTPA services and activities that can benefit handicapped youth. Timelines for developing a PIC job training plan and procedures for enrolling handicapped students in JTPA programs are provided. The final sections of the paper explain the steps for obtaining and guidelines for using (1) JTPA 8 percent monies to state educational agencies, (2) 6 percent monies for incentive grants, and (3) Title IIB summer youth employment and training funds.

        "description":"Intended for people in government and other agencies who make decisions on policy or on funding for literacy, this short report of an international seminar on literacy summarizes seminar themes. The first topic considered is the rationale for investment in education. The connection between literacy and national development is stressed, and three interrelated components of a strategy toward literacy are defined: literacy for adults and out-of-school youth, Universal Primary Education, and adult continuing education. A discussion of literacy in context looks at the role of the national goals, the correlation between illiteracy and poverty, and the large number of the world's illiterates who are women. Adult continuing education is then discussed as effective followup or  postliteracy activity. Suggestions are offered for what can be done to promote literacy, including cooperation between third world countries, establishment of regional offices and associations as clearinghouses on training, and national training workshops for literacy workers. A final discussion of the meaning of cooperation focuses on five problem areas identified in the delicate area of international relations and understanding: project identification and formulation, cooperation among national governmental organizations, the selection and use of consultants, evaluation and monitoring, and conflicting reporting systems.

Nearly 100 pieces of literature related to sex equity in vocational education found in the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) database were reviewed. The following were identified as the most widely used strategies for the recruitment of students for vocational education program areas not traditional for their sex: use of role models, parental involvement, prevocational classes and workshops, community involvement, active encouragement of prospective students, publicity/promotional activities, use of sex-fair media and informational materials and inservice training  of teachers. The following activities were found to be useful for retaining students in vocational education program areas not traditional for their sex: supportive groups, moral support and explicit support of teachers and counselors, personnel training and awareness raising, unbiased language in the classroom, and placing nontraditional students in the same classes. Finally, the following activities were identified as being useful for the placement of nontraditional students in occupations related to their training: public relations, workshops for employers, student training, publicity, and promotional activities. The review concluded that sex equity actions should be expanded and be conducted continuously so that sex-fair attitudes and procedures will become standard. (KC)",

        "description":"This research was conducted to identify factors contributing to the enrollment of male high school students in Ohio in program areas nontraditional for their sex. Using the 1980 Executive Student Follow-up Report, 28 vocational education programs not traditional for males in Ohio (less than 20 percent male enrollment) were identified, and the top 20 programs according to number of males enrolled were found in 14 different schools. In 13 of these schools, interviews were conducted; through 17 interviews, 90 male students, 29 teachers, and 16 counselors were contacted. The males interviewed were enrolled in medical laboratory assistant, dental assisting, diversified health, cosmetology, bank teller, child care, home furnishings, and community and home programs. Most students  indicated that they were happy with their program choices, suffered little discrimination, and had chosen the programs primarily for their quality or because nothing else was available. Teachers, counselors, and administrators interviewed were overwhelming proponents of sex equity, and most had attended training to learn to promote sex equity in their institutions. Role models and sex-fair instructional and orientation materials were found to be significant factors in the recruitment, retention, and placement of male students in nontraditional programs. Based on the data gathered in this study, 16 recommendations were made for recruiting and retaining male students in traditionally female vocational education programs. These recommendations include providing all students with information  about all vocational programs, talking to students about job opportunities in traditionally female occupations, inviting parents of students to orientations to inform them about programs, developing promotional and instructional materials, showing males in nontraditional roles, taking students to job sites, and making sure the whole student recruitment process is sex fair.

During the study, researchers examined the distribution of jobs by sector and type of labor and used census data to assess the quality of jobs provided by different sectors. Based on this examination, researchers concluded that service sector growth is no panacea for the problems of cities. The survey data indicated that conventional rules of thumb such as the one stating  that the medical and health services sectors hire larger numbers of minority group members than do the average sector in any given city simply do not hold true upon actual research. Therefore, city planners who frequently make use of such rules of thumb should be cautioned that no good substitute exists for city-specific analysis of how sectoral development strategies will reduce structural unemployment. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that while some service sectors do seem to offer more opportunities for upward mobility than do areas such as durable goods manufacturing, others offer few or none.

Age 65 has been widely regarded as a customary age for retirement, given widespread eligibility for retirement benefits at that age. Substantial numbers of older workers leave the labor force. As more people continue to enjoy good health and are able to remain active through their 60s and beyond, the concept of what constitutes old age is shifting. Factors that affect the retirement decision include retirement benefits, age discrimination, mandatory retirement, and health. Findings of a study of mandatory retirement policies show that employees continued to retire at relatively early ages; competition between  older workers and youth, minorities, and women was minimal; and elimination of mandatory retirement will induce older workers to remain in the labor force. The 1978 ADEA Amendments permits mandatory retirement of executives and tenured faculty members at institutions of higher education between ages 65 and 69. The provision for the second group has since expired. (Recommendations are made for elimination of the mandatory retirement age, increased information dissemination, and encouragement of implementation of nondiscriminatory older worker employment policies.)

        "description":"This project was conducted to study home economics curriculum needs by surveying former secondary home economics students to determine what tasks they learned in class and what instruction would have been helpful in order to provide curriculum managers, developers of materials, administrators, and teachers with more guidance in meeting the needs of consumer and homemaking students. Secondary school graduates of 1978-1982 who had been enrolled in home economics courses in seven Louisiana parishes (n=1,442) completed questionnaires. Participants rated each of 42 listed consumer and homemaking tasks as having been taught or not taught in their home economics courses and as needed or not needed. All tasks were recorded as needed by a majority of former students. Thirty of the 42  tasks considered were rated as having been taught and needed while 12 topics were considered needed but not taught. Respondents' sex, employment status, number of semesters enrolled in home economics, and year of graduation caused variations in whether tasks were perceived as having been taught or needed. Problems noted in the study were the low response rate to the questionnaire (12 percent) and the fact that all tasks were rated as needed. It was suggested that in a more appropriate questionnaire former students might have been asked to rank the tasks in importance. (KC)",

        "description":"This report was prepared to fulfill the need for an information source on basic skills in the armed services. To prepare the report, researchers obtained and reviewed published literature from various document files. Service representatives of the Joint Service Working Group on Literacy/Basic Skills established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense prepared papers describing their service's basic skills programs, ongoing and projected. In addition, site visits were made to training programs. Results of the literature review indicated that for some two hundred years, a debate has taken place among those responsible for military training that focuses on the role of the military in providing basic skills training for undereducated applicants for military service. A representative  sample of the major arguments in the debate was compiled. In general, arguments against the teaching of basic skills in the military focus on pointing to the undesirability of permitting the less literate to enter military service, the costs of training the less literate, the use of limited assignments in lieu of basic skills training, and the ineffectiveness of basic skills programs in improving either basic skills or job performance. Those arguing for the teaching of basic skills counter that many less literate personnel perform as well as more highly literate ones, that screening instruments are not adequate to distinguish the inadequate, that avoiding the use of less literate persons in peacetime prevents their acquisition of training experience when mobilization requires their use,  that literacy training can be cost effective, and that less literate persons are required to fill slots in a volunteer military service. Research bearing on the debate was examined in three areas: selection and classification, job training, and job performance. (KC)",

Interviews and surveys were used to collect data from current RCCs and instructors at the Naval Training Center in Orlando, Florida. Seventeen leadership competencies performed by &quot;A&quot; school instructors were identified. Of these 17, there were 16 that are also performed by RCCs. The competencies that differentiate between superior and nonsuperior performers were determined. Data about background factors related to career leadership experiences were collected. Leadership competencies that differentiate men from women RCCs were identified. In order to determine actual leadership training requirements, data concerning competency difficulty,  importance, and frequency of performance were combined with data about competencies that differentiated superior and nonsuperior performers. All four of these factors were used to develop separate training requirements for men RCCs, women RCCs, and &quot;A&quot; school instructors. Critical leadership training requirements for all three groups were combined and nine competencies were recommended for training emphasis. Leadership attitudes, methods of RCC/instructor self-appraisal, areas of counseling difficulty, and intrastaff communication patterns were analyzed and data presented for consideration in course design.

        "description":"The strategy of expanding the modern industrialized economic sector and the formal education system that developing countries have followed during the past twenty years has recently been questioned. In these countries, the informal economic sector is dominant and includes many more people in small business, crafts, and services. An innovative approach to informal education, education derived on the job without formal training, may be needed for the people involved in this sector. The informal sector is characterized by the smallness of the work unit and consists of workers who can be classified into four groups: entrepreneurs, establishment workers, independent workers, and casual workers. The former two groups are often somewhat educated and can benefit from formal or nonformal  education, while the latter groups are often too illiterate or constrained by poverty or lack of time to make use of these educational means. For these groups, a variety of approaches to informal education may help. For instance, since most workers receive training through apprenticeships, improving the skills of the master could result in improving the education and skills of the worker. Another approach is to make technical assistance directly available to the employing establishment, e.g., sending a mobile unit. Other ways of providing training opportunity to workers in the informal sector include Vocational Improvement Centers and day release programs. Although these training approaches do not overcome all the problems associated with training in the informal sector, they are  promising practices linked to needs. (KC)",

By l990, they will revolutionize the way industry functions, replacing hundreds of workers and doing hot, dirty jobs better and more quickly than the workers could have done them. Robotics should be taught in high school industrial arts programs as a major curriculum component. The benefits to students are great. Robots are interesting and highly motivating, and the cost is reasonable when compared to other major acquisitions. Students can be made aware of a variety of career opportunities through the study of robotics. Finally, the study of robotics can bring schools and industry closer together in cooperative programming activities. In junior high school industrial arts, students can be offered hands-on experiences  with simple robots and microprocessors as control devices. By using the modular toy, Capsela, in combination with sensing devices and a computer interface, the fundamentals of robotics are within reach of both junior high school students' abilities and school budgets. The teaching of robotics can be an exciting and rewarding component of the industrial arts curriculum at both the high school and the junior high school levels. (KC)",

Following a description of learning disabilities in general, and the occurrence in adults in particular, nine observable characteristics of learning-disabled adults are discussed: (1) vision problems; (2) extraneous vocal sounds; (3) inability to match sounds to symbols or to distinguish between similar sounds; (4) confusion about sequential order; (5) inability to simultaneously integrate basic sensory channels for learning; (6) low level of frustration; (7) negative self-image; (8) poor concept of time; and (9) physical conditions resulting from metabolism problems. Recommendations for formal and informal diagnostic procedures are presented including observation,  selecting an instrument, and steps to take after testing. Nine specific teaching and learning strategies are offered for working with learning-disabled adults.

        "description":"Recently, the definition of functional literacy has been broadened to include the completion of a secondary education or its equivalent. This definition focuses on obtaining the functional competencies required to perform adequately in adult life. Three major sets of functional competencies are represented in models developed by the Adult Performance Level Project, the New York State External High School Diploma Program, and the state of California. Difficulties with traditional adult education programs have been accessibility and a lack of defined competencies. Competency-based adult education (CBAE) responds to this problem by providing an individualized set of competencies to meet adult needs. CBAE programs share these common components: (1) identified and stated outcomes or  competencies; (2) a formal assessment system; (3) functional literacy subject matter integrating both basic and life skills; and (4) certification of mastery of competencies. Research on CBAE indicates that: students, administrators, and staff have different perceptions of the importance of competency areas; no competency list is appropriate for all students; more effective ways of measuring competencies need to be developed; and competency-based programs are effective.

Surveys have revealed: companies believe that career development efforts enhance employee performance and improve utilization of talents; most organizations have some sort of career development activity and it is receiving increased attention; there is little agreement about how to make programs operational; and research has generally not preceded development and implementation. Research into the psychology of adult development can be applied to career development as well. By utilizing the process of adult development, individuals can be encouraged to achieve their full career potential, thereby  benefiting both the individual and the organization. Current approaches to career development involve: (1) individual career planning and counseling; (2) assessment; (3) career information services; (4) organizational career planning; (5) training and development; and (6) approaches aimed at special populations. Although much variety exists in these practices, it is clear that career development endeavors are significant undertakings in a rapidly increasing number of work settings.

In order to increase student persistence, programs and teachers should: address real needs; create a supportive learning environment; minimize problems and barriers; communicate accurately; and monitor attendance and dropout rate so that a problem can be identified and dealt with quickly. Variables affecting participation in adult education have been identified: (1) factors having to do with the individual; (2) socioenvironmental forces; (3) individual expectations; (4) the learning experience; (5) continuous evaluation; and (6) satisfaction with the learning experience. Among the models which have been advanced to explain participation  are the Congruence Model which states that congruence within the participant, and between the participant and the educational environment, can determine whether a person drops out; and the Chain of Response (COR) Model which is based on the premise that participation is not a single act but a chain of responses, each based on an evaluation of the individual's position in the environment.

        "description":"Vocational education has been altered to meet the needs of the growing number of adults participating in educational activities. Adult vocational education is a process by which adults prepare to enter an occupation or upgrade a present occupation. Programs and activities are designed to develop basic education skills, enhance occupational and career awareness, and support job preparation. Funds for adult vocational education generally come from three categories: public, private, and school-business cooperative programs. When designing programs, it should be kept in mind that adult learners are independent, have a reservoir of occupational experience which can serve as a resource, and have a problem-centered rather than a subject-centered orientation. Examples of programs and  curriculum include: (1) teaching material developed by the Vocational-Technical Education Consortium of States (V-TECS); (2) the Performance-Based Adult Vocational Education Project (PAVE) and the Competency-Based Adult Vocational Education Project (CBAVE); and (3) the 916 Area Vo-Tech School in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Specific areas or populations which have received special attention are: infusion into selected fields of study; undecided majors; workers and other adults; and women, disabled, and minorities. Elementary-secondary career education programs have focused on infusion, career guidance, and collaboration with the community.

If alternative work patterns become part of the normal work pattern, education will have to address the needs of individuals in the midlife stage. Implications for companies will be in the areas of tuition aid, retraining, and career development. Recent surveys  indicate that the preference of employees is to give up wages for time away from their jobs. The major reasons for choosing alternative work patterns seem to be to have additional free time to enhance the quality of life, to increase education and retraining, and to allow for better transition to retirement years.

A study estimated that 36 percent of all Americans are in some stage of the career transition process. Career changes are becoming increasingly common for women, for workers whose skills have become obsolete, for individuals experiencing a shift in values, and for older workers. Reasons for career changes are either internal or external. Internal or psychological factors are related to changes in individuals or their families. External factors are often related to economic or technological changes in the environment and the work place. Many adults have trouble making career transitions due to: (1) lack of motivation; (2) lack of access to information about  alternative careers and opportunities; (3) a narrow idea of available jobs; (4) limited education/training; (5) lack of funds; and (6) lack of counseling. A variety of educational and support services can be provided to help overcome these problems.

Three areas of concern for program development which have been identified by the Council on Exceptional Children (1980) are presented: accessibility, specially designed instruction, and cooperative planning. In addition, the following principles proposed by the Council are offered: (1) individuals with disabilities should be respected as adults; (2) they should have available the  wide range of programmatic options available to nonhandicapped individuals; (3) they should be provided with educational programs on the same economic and administrative terms as nonhandicapped individuals; and (4) they should have the same benefits as the nonhandicapped when they participate in adult education.

Five steps are essential to successful implementation: (1) understanding and commitment of top management; (2) active involvement of middle managers; (3) intensive training for all participants; (4)  preparation of the organization for implementation; and (5) establishment of rules and procedures. Training is the key element. The four levels of people who need to receive training are management, facilitators, team leaders, and circle members.

        "description":"This fact sheet offers guidelines to consider when developing educational programs for adults. Characteristics of adults which affect learning are discussed under the following headings: adult life cycle; time orientation geared toward immediacy; broad base of experience; independent self-concept; and social roles. The importance of allowing adults to assume responsibility for their learning is emphasized along with several ways in which this can be achieved. Four basic steps in the instructional design process are described: specifying objectives; identifying and arranging learning tasks; selecting techniques and devices; and developing evaluation instruments. Involvement of adults in the development of educational programs is discussed in relation to developing program  objectives, content, activities, and evaluation. Nine techniques for enhancing the learning motivation of adult students are offered. A bibliography is included which cites five resources available from the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) system. (DC)",

        "description":"Research has found that the need for personal space is greater for normal persons who are interacting with stigmatized persons, such as overweight people, and that one who is identified as deviant may be more sensitive to environmental cues and react more strongly to affective stimuli. To investigate the reactions to approach/distance among overweight and normal weight college females, 53 white women between the ages of 19 and 23 (28 overweight; 25 normal weight) were approached and given a monologue at a distance of 12, 24, or 39 inches, by a normal weight female confederate. Heart rates were measured during a 10 second baseline interval and for six 10 second intervals of the approach/distance manipulation. After the interaction, all subjects completed the Comfortable  Interpersonal Distance Scale (CID) and weight and height data were collected. An analysis of the results showed that overweight females significantly underestimated their actual weights. Analyses of heart rate during the confederate's presence showed that overweight persons' heart rates were greater than normal persons' during intervals 3, 4, and 6. There was no significant difference between the two groups in personal distance needs as measured by the CID, indicating that although overweight females are generally maintained at greater distance than normals, it is because normals need to maintain the greater distance from overweight people, rather than vice-versa.

        "description":"This report presents findings from the national research and reporting program, Monitoring the Future: A Continuing Study of the Lifestyle and Values of Youth, and is the sixth in an annual series reporting the drug use and related attitudes of high school seniors; the report covers the high school classes of 1975-1982. Two of the major topics covered are the current prevalence of drug use, and trends in use since 1975. Also reported are statistical data on grade of first use, trends in use at earlier grade levels, intensity of drug use, attitudes and beliefs among students concerning various types of drug use, and their perceptions of certain relevant aspects of the social environment. The eleven separate classes of drugs distinguished are marijuana (including hashish),  inhalants, hallucinogens, cocaine, heroin, natural and synthetic opiates, stimulants, sedatives, tranquilizers, alcohol and cigarettes. Most of the information deals with illicit drug use. A special section discusses the use of non-prescription stimulants, including diet pills, stay-awake pills, and the look-alike pseudo-amphetamines. Results of the survey of seniors from approximately 125-140 public and private high schools throughout the United States showed that, although about two-thirds of all American students try an illicit drug before they finish high school, the use of many illegal drugs as well as cigarettes is declining. About 1 in 16 students drinks alcohol daily and 41% had had five or more drinks in a row at least once in the 2 weeks prior to the survey. These levels of  substance use and abuse probably reflect the highest level of illicit drug use in the industrialized world. (JAC)",

A Healthy Emotional Self, seminar 2, deals with positive emotional health skills affecting students'  entire being, and with ways of helping others in the area of emotional health. A Healthy Social Self, the third seminar, discusses positive social skills, labeling, we-centered behavior, and methods of changing or enhancing social skills. The fourth seminar, A Healthy Mind, helps students learn to incorporate creativity, memory, and learning skills into their lives. Seminar 5, A Healthy Life Spirit, helps students learn about values development, moral development, positive attitudes toward life and death, and focusing on something larger than self. (JAC)",

        "author":["Stiles, William B."],
        "description":"Psychotherapists of different theoretical persuasions use systematically different profiles of verbal response modes. However, clients tend to use very similar profiles, regardless of what their therapist does. Disclosure comprises the largest part of this common client profile, and it distinguishes the client role from other roles. Higher levels of client disclosure are associated with external observers' ratings of good psychotherapeutic process, though not necessarily with participants' ratings of session depth and value. Relatively high levels of client disclosures are associated with participants' judgments that a session was relatively rough, difficult, and dangerous. And clients who are more depressed, anxious, or generally psychologically distressed have higher levels of  disclosures in psychotherapy. A helpful analogy suggests that client disclosure may be related to psychological disturbance as body temperature and white blood cell count are to physical infection. In the case of physical infection, a fever and an elevated leukocyte level are parts of the body's immunological response--mobilizing to fight the infection. Disclosure may be, analogously, part of a natural corrective or protective reaction to psychological disturbance. Primarily, it helps regain psychological homeostasis, and secondarily, it serves as a symptom of distress. This analogy makes sense of the distinctively high level of disclosures in therapy and of the theoretical and empirical association of disclosures with &quot;good process&quot;. It is also consistent with the correlation of  disclosures with psychological distress and discomfort. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"The need for vocational and personal attitude training for prisoners has been recognized for many years. In keeping with the commitment to individual prisoner's development, the Florida Department of Corrections developed a program of life skills training for inmates, the Life Skills Overview Module, in cooperation with local community colleges. To evaluate the success of the program, 19 faculty members who served as instructors (facilitators) in the program were surveyed. In addition, site visits were conducted to interview faculty members. A second procedure included the design and evaluation of a feedback workshop for facilitators, attended by the instructors, members of the Life Skills Task Force, and visitors from the Department of Corrections and the community colleges. A  third research procedure involved hiring a research consultant who investigated facilitator characteristics, support of the community college and correctional institution, and facilitators' evaluations of training and materials. The evaluation concluded that there was a generally high level of satisfaction among instructors. Individual factors included previous experience in correctional education, sex of instructor, and institutional support. Instructors who felt their students were highly motivated reported greater satisfaction with the outcome. Each instructor recommended that the program be continued and expanded and made recommendations relating to the role of the community college. The report includes the survey instruments, a budget summary, Life Skills Task Force position papers,  data on facilitators, feedback workshop data, and suggested specific actions. (JAC)",

        "description":"People tend to have both public and private selves, creating different images in their own minds, and in the minds of others. High self-monitoring individuals (SMIs), as identified through the Self Monitoring Scale, observe their public images and adapt them to produce desired effects. They tend to see themselves as pragmatic, flexible, and role-oriented. Their self-presentational skills are often used to promote smooth social interactions, to provide leadership, and to promote diplomacy. By contrast, low SMIs tend to maintain a consistent self-image regardless of the situation. They view themselves as principled, congruent, and trait or disposition-oriented. Their self-presentation reflects their mood state, personality attributes, and expressive behavior, suggesting they do  well in interpersonal relationships and fields where intimacy is important. Both high and low SMIs use thier skills to create social worlds in which their personality needs can be met. In social interactions, high SMIs prefer conversations with high clarity of definition in character and role, while low SMIs prefer conversations in which they feel similar to a member of the group. In leisure activities, high SMIs choose to spend time with \"specialists\" in the activity, while low SMIs choose to spend time with well liked individuals. Both high and low SMIs tend to form friendships with similarly high or low individuals. Although both types of selves have advantages and disadvantages, high SMIs pay for their orientation through the continual discrepancy between their true feelings and  attitudes and their actions. Future research should focus on developmental roots and societal roles of high and low SMIs. (BL)",

        "description":"Private sector vocational rehabilitation programs, which serve the vocational needs of industrially injured workers, have experienced tremendous growth since 1970. Legislative mandates, worker compensation insurance, as well as the ineffectiveness of state rehabilitation counselors to provide adequate job placements for disabled workers are all contributing factors to this growth. Surveys, however, have shown that despite the expectations for private sector rehabilitation, private agencies share the same difficulties as the public sector. This paper presents, in a five-step sequential model written for rehabilitation counselors, program administrators, and counselor educators, a rehabilitation program specifically designed for industrially injured workers. Each step is defined in  terms of function, purposes, outcome criteria, and procedures. Step 1 focuses on the assessment of the client's vocational, economic, medical, psychological, and social needs, motivations, and abilities. Step 2 involves the identification of a specific vocational rehabilitation goal, while step 3 identifies barriers and facilitators to that goal. During step 4, intermediate behavioral objectives toward accomplishing the overall goal are generated. The fifth and final step evaluates the effectiveness of the process and outcome of the rehabilitation activities. (BL)",

The section on systems issues explores four aspects of program implementation: curricula and program development; accreditation requirements for the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) and the American Association of  Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT); integration of marriage and family therapy into counselor education; and gender issues of family systems therapists. The section on training and supervision focuses on clinical training in family psychology and supervision from four perspectives: collegial process; a review of current practice; supervisee's perspective on live supervision; and the reflections of a supervisor. The alternative family lifestyles section addresses the training of divorce counselors and single parent family counseling. A list of references follows each article. (BL)",

        "description":"This 1982 national survey on drug abuse is the seventh in a series of surveys since 1971 sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. To investigate the current prevalence of drug abuse in a nationwide sample, 5,624 randomly selected Americans (aged 12 and older) were personally interviewed in their homes using a specially designed answer sheet to assure privacy. An analysis of the results showed a reversal of the upward trends in drug abuse charted in surveys through the 1970's. The use of marijuana among youths (12-17) and young adults (18-25) has leveled off and has significantly declined in the percentage of persons who currently use marijuana, alcohol, narcotics, and tobacco. In the older adult population (26 and older), lifetime use of marijuana and narcotics  increased between 1979 and 1982 and current use did not decrease; this trend reflects the fact that drug users in the early 1970s have now moved into a different demographic group. Older adults continued to show a decline in the use of tobacco. Persons who have tried hallucinogens, cocaine or heroin are a subset of those who have tried marijuana. Levels of drug use opportunity remained high with a majority of adolescents and young adults and 41 percent of persons aged 26 and older reporting the availability of the drug if they desired to use it. Similarly, a majority of young adults reported the availability of cocaine. (Numerous tables present the data. The survey questionnaire is appended.) (BL)",

To investigate elderly citizens' knowledge of senior center activities and services, 250 white older adults (125 center users and 125 nonusers) from a small urban community were personally interviewed about the services and activities provided by their local senior center. An analysis of the demographic data showed that the subjects were mostly married female homeowners with a median age of 71. Annual income was under $7500, and the majority had lived in the community for 50 years. All subjects were aware of the existence of the community senior center and 99 percent could correctly identify its location. Only a small minority of the sample was aware of any services, other than the 83 percent who were  aware of the hot lunch program. The local newspaper, family, and friends were the most cited sources of information by nonusers. As would be expected, center users were more aware of activities than nonusers. Dinner parties, cards, square dances, bingo, trips, and clubs, respectively, were the most recognized activities of the senior center. Center users identified the senior center publication as their major source of information. (BL)",

To investigate the effects of reality shock on organizational commitment, 109 bank tellers were monitored for 10 months after being hired. The subjects completed a modified version of the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) upon entering the teller program and again after 2 months, when they also completed the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire. After 2 months, branch managers evaluated the tellers' performance according to attendance, punctuality, number of customers served, and error rate. An analysis of the results showed that new employees definitely  experienced reality shock as their initial expectations were lowered by work experience. The tellers' perceptions of the job and career facilitation were significantly reduced over the first 8 weeks in the organization. Reality shock significantly influenced tellers' commitment attitudes and desire to remain with the organization. However, reality shock had little or no effect on employees' quantity or quality of performance or on turnover. (BL)",

To investigate the level of student involvement in doctoral level counseling psychology programs, student involvement surveys were completed in the spring of 1983, by 28 students and 33 directors (a response rate of 42 percent) whose program directors were listed as members of the Council of Counseling Psychology Training Programs. The surveys assessed formal and informal mechanisms of involvement; impact, barriers, and current level of satisfaction; and ideal levels of student involvement. An analysis of the results showed that both directors and students conceptualized high levels of student involvement  as necessary ingredients of well functioning programs, listing increased morale, satisfaction, and commitment as the organizational rewards of such involvement. However, directors, more than students, perceived student involvement as having greater impact on major decisions made by the faculty. Students reported being significantly less satisfied with their levels of involvement than were directors. Both directors and students described similar ideal levels of student involvement and similar barriers to that involvement in terms of student academic and financial demands.

To investigate the effects of misattribution and fear reduction on attraction, 36 male college students were ostensibly exposed to an electromagnetic field while an attractive female confederate recorded their cardiovascular data. Prior to the exposure, subjects were briefed on the apparent threat of the situation (low or high fear) and on the arousal they could expect from the field (low or high arousal). After ostensible exposure to the field, subjects completed a questionnaire assessing their liking for the confederate. An analysis of the results showed that fear had no effect on attraction, while expected  arousal from the electromagnetic field did correlate with attraction, supporting the misattribution theory.

This document reviews the criminal justice information policy as it relates to confidentiality and juvenile justice in an attempt to identify those qualities of the policy which protect juveniles in a way that reflects the principles and character of the society. Part 1 describes the history and philosophy of the juvenile justice system with particular attention to juvenile record confidentiality. Part 2 focuses on the creation  and maintenance of juvenile justice records from law enforcement and court system perspectives. Part 3 reviews disclosure of records including sealing and purging according to federal and state laws, sharing of records with the juvenile and adult justice systems, and accessibility and disclosure of records to subject, researchers, organizations, media, and the public. Part 4 focuses on confidentiality and media access, while Part 5 reviews the debate over confidentiality versus publicity. (BL)",

To investigate the effect of personal style on just world view, 109 male and female college students (who previously had completed the Just World Scale) completed a 22-item questionnaire assessing their optimism for the future; they were first made aware of either the relatively privileged or deprived aspects of their present status. An analysis of the results showed that subjects who scored high on the Just World Scale generalized their present status into the future in order to maintain their belief in immanent justice. Subjects who scored low on the Just World Scale responded to  injustice from an ultimate justice perspective where present privilege or deprivation was expected to be compensated for in the future. These findings suggest that the Just World Scale may be more accurately viewed as a measure of the defensive styles people use for protecting their belief in a just world than as a measure of commitment to the belief.

Psychoanalytic theory views resistance as a way to avoid the anxiety aroused by increasing awareness of unconscious materials and vulnerable areas in the person's life. Resistance is dealt with after it has occurred by confronting it through interpretation. The learning/behavioral approaches attempt to prevent the development of resistance by altering the format of information presented, by structuring the treatment using behavioral techniques, or by emphasizing client control in treatment planning. Hypnotic/paradoxical approaches are used either before or after resistance is evident. The client's resistance is used both directly (consciously)  and indirectly (unconsciously) to facilitate change. Since the hypnotic/paradoxical approaches are relatively recent methods, theory development and effectiveness research are still needed. (Author/BL)",

To examine whether perceivers would have difficulty in thinking of ways that people have changed, and in reporting instances of such change, 120 college students were asked to complete short essays in which they reported areas of constancy and of change in their best friends and in themselves. Results showed change judgments were equally as frequent as judgments of sameness, and this was true in judging others as well as self. Overall, the most frequent reference was to trait attributes, which accounted for 40 percent of all judgments. Such judgments were significantly more likely when describing areas of constancy rather  than change, and when describing a friend rather than self. Subjects were more likely to refer to constancy in interests, and more likely to refer to changes in goals and maturation than to constancy in this area.

The next five articles deal with special perspectives on needed or potential changes in counselor education, such as research, health counseling, behavioral counseling, mental health counseling, and the new field of state-of-consciousness counseling. The next three papers emphasize equity and basic human rights, including counseling in a culturally pluralistic  society, prejudice, and sex role issues. The impact of technology on counselor education and practice is discussed from the perspective of ethical issues. The next three articles delve into the future of guidance, through a discussion of significant changes in society and their resultant impact on what counselors do, and the need for counselor renewal.

The sections on minimum competency tests identify issues of current interest, e.g., the basic issue of definition; the impact of the emphasis on behavioral objectives, observable performance, and empirically derived evaluative criteria; and the struggle of the profession to develop a conceptual framework and research base. The issues involved in using minimum competency test results to meet high school graduation requirements are presented in the second major section of the review. The tensions between educational and societal trends affecting the use of  competency tests as a graduation requirement are reviewed in the context of differences between community and professional definitions of acceptable performance; the emphasis on test performance at the expense of other school objectives; and the moral, legal, and political issues of differential attainment of special students. The issue of early prediction of school failure and success is reviewed in a summary of articles reporting efforts in this area. Validity of screening systems, application and follow-up of approaches taken, and the role of counselors at the elementary or preschool level are discussed. Finally, a broad overview of current directions and applications in testing and assessment is provided. An annotated bibliography of ERIC references completes the volume.  (JAC)",

The instrument is designed for brevity and allows for the adjustment of items according to general or specific beliefs and behaviors.

After the race 84 of those runners responded to a more specific version of the SRQ in a telephone interview. Test-retest correlations of the subscales were  within the moderate range. Correlations of the items before and after the race showed responses to be remarkably stable. No sex differences were found on responses to any of the subscales. Although additional research is necessary, validity was somewhat supported by the study. Belittlement negatively correlated with loneliness and uncertainty positively correlated with loneliness and anxiety. No associations have been found between acceptance and other relevant constructs. (The SRQ and its specific adaptation for the post-race telephone survey are appended.) (BL)",

        "description":"Studies employing the Mooney Problem Check List (MPCL) have found that counseling center clients indicate more problems on the MPCL than nonclients. Domino and DeGroote identified 42 MPCL items concerned with self-satisfaction and a need for social contacts which further differentiated counseling seekers from nonseekers. In order to further validate the 42-item MPCL as a predictive instrument, three studies were undertaken. In Study 1, 40 students (24 male,16 female) were administered the MPCL upon entering the university. During the course of their college careers, 20 students were seen in counseling; the other 20 students served as controls. Student responses to the MPCL were classified according to the 42 identified items. An analysis of the results showed the classification  system correctly identified all controls but only 2 of the 20 counseling seekers. However, the items did significantly differentiate the two groups. In Study 2, 74 students (37 counseling seekers and 37 controls) were administered the MPCL, and their responses were classified according to the 42 items. An analysis of the results, as in Study 1, showed that the items differentiated the two groups, but failed to predict counseling seekers from nonseekers. In Study 3, scores from the second study were recalculated to improve the predictive accuracy of the 42-item MPCL. Cutoff points of 11 and 5 for counseling seekers were set. An analysis of the results showed that the cutoff point of 5 was significant in classifying counseled from noncounseled students. The studies validated the usefulness  of the 42-item MPCL in predicting who will seek counseling. However, separate norms should be developed at each university. (BL)",

        "description":"Historically, training for performance appraisal has focused on the same issues as instrument development--the reduction of psychometric errors in ratings. Efforts were centered around teaching people to use rating scales properly. A review of the literature shows these programs met with mixed success. While a meta-analysis of these data are premature, several hypotheses may be drawn: (1) knowledge of the job in question is more important than rating skills; (2) observational skills are important in real-world ratings; (3) the purpose and context of ratings are as or more important to accuracy than the training itself; and (4) accuracy should be the primary goal of training. Training for performance appraisal is far from universal. Most training efforts in actual use involve  learning how to use a particular form or system. One possible training method to improve accurate evaluations involves the use of multiple performance examples, such as videotape, to represent multiple levels of accomplishment. Little systematic knowledge exists about the mechanics of implementing a theoretically-based appraisal system. It is necessary to understand how the appraisal system functions in the operation of the organization. Considerations of equity, of the multidimensionality of job performance, or the cost of more refined observations may make more sophisticated measurement impossible to achieve. Reliable, valid measures that provide accurate determination of two or three levels of performance are an advance over biased assessment of five, or six or more. (JAC)",

        "description":"Most of the literature relevant to today's religious cults has paid scant attention to the parents of cult members. Two recent studies (1979 and 1982) of parents of ex-cult members revealed that initial parental responses to a child's cult involvement ranged from anxiety to terror. In general, the parents were baffled by their children's new affiliation, especially in those cases that began in the 1970's when there was little public awareness of cults. Negative parental reactions have been attributed to the threat cults pose to the family's economic goals and authority structure and to the appropriation of parental roles; few writers have recognized the disruption of the affectionate relationship within the family. Published accounts by parents of cult children reveal that  parents often blame themselves, and that most had difficulty finding the child. Of the 49 ex-cult members in the 1979 and 1982 surveys, 31 were rescued by parents and 6 defected voluntarily. Parents have turned to kidnapping and deprogramming, conservatorship, and civil suits against the cults. Since most cult members are legally adults, and most cults have First Amendment protection as religious groups, the courts have provided few clear-cut remedies. Family therapy can help preserve the family unit and prepare the family for an eventual harmonious reconciliation, but it is not a function of the therapist to aid in abduction or deprogramming.

        "description":"Previous research has indicated that Type A's have a higher need to control their environments, and respond more reactively to control loss than Type B's. To clarify the role of information processing in the control relinquishment decisions of Type A's and B's, 147 male and female college students took part in a problem solving experiment. Pairs of subjects worked independently on an initial 25 trial task and received feedback indicating that their partner had performed at a comparable or superior level. On a second task subjects combined their efforts, but only one could work on a given trial, necessitating a decision concerning how many trials each would attempt to solve. One third of the subjects made this decision prior to completing an evaluation of the initial performances.  Another third completed the evaluation first without knowing they would subsequently make a control decision. The final third of the subjects comleted their evaluations knowing that a control decision would follow. Results indicated that when the evaluations were completed last, or, when the evaluations were completed first but without knowledge of the impending decision, Type A's relative to Type B's failed to relinquish control to a superior partner. When the evaluations were completed with knowledge of an impending control decision, Type A's and B's did not differ in their decisions. These results suggest that, under appropriate conditions, Type A's engage in an automatic or mindless decision strategy with potentially maladaptive consequences. (Author/JAC)",

To investigate the interaction between teacher expressiveness, teacher sex, and student sex, 121 college students viewed a videotape of a male or female actor giving a short lecture using either expressive or nonexpressive communication. Students then completed a content test and a teacher evaluation. Results showed that the expressive teacher received the highest student evaluations using a global evaluation score as well as five factor scores. The nonexpressive male teacher, in particular, received very low ratings on two factors: organization, and stimulating  interest. His students also had the poorest performance on the achievement test. In contrast, students who watched a nonexpressive female teacher had the highest achievement. Differential attention as a function of sex-role appropriate characteristics were hypothesized as being mediating variables. Male and female students reacted to the instructors in similar ways, except that female students tended to view all professors as more organized than did male students. Future research might do well to examine teacher sex in studies of teaching performance and effective teacher qualities. (Author/JAC)",

Subjects were instructed in dream retention techniques and subsequently completed an ACL for each dream recorded weekly during a 3-month period. An analysis of the results showed no significant correlations between the subjects' self-waking psychological profiles and the subjects' dreaming profiles on 15 adjective need scales. Nor were significant  correlations found between the profiles generated by the subjects' significant others and the subjects' dreaming or waking profiles on 15 need scales created from the ACL.

Pretreatment assessment included parental interview, personality and IQ testing, and home observations. Posttreatment assessment included home observations and feedback measures. Throughout the study the Dyadic Parent Child Interaction Coding System  (DPICS) was used to monitor child deviance and noncompliance. In both treatment conditions, families were seen individually for seven or more videotaped sessions. Relationship-based training consisted of teaching the parents interaction skills in regard to play, prosocial behavior and social reinforcement. Contingency management training consisted of identifying and changing deviant behavior through point charts, homework assignments, and rewards. According to parent report measures both treatment groups improved relative to the control group. However, home observations revealed that only children assigned to the relationship-based approach significantly decreased deviance and noncompliance, which may be due to an emphasis on coaching parents in the use of social reinforcement.

Chapter 2 reviews chapters 2-4 of the first interim report to outline the record of accomplishment of earlier delinquency prevention efforts, and the program development evaluation.  Chapter 3 describes changes made in the measures used in the school action effectiveness study. Chapter 4 describes the kinds of delinquency prevention projects in the initiative, the major influences on the evaluation, and the development of the prevention projects during the second year of the Alternative Education Program. Chapter 5 provides an overview of the school-level evaluation results. Chapter 6 summarizes information about the effects of interventions targeted at high-risk individuals for projects that have such targeted interventions as distinct, evaluatable components.

Among males, correlations with MPAs  were significant for the Physical Activity and Clumsiness factors of the lifestyle inventory as well as for the emotionality, extraversion, sex-role and Type A personality measures. No significant correlations were found for females. The observed results provide further evidence that temperament has a biological basis.

To address these methodological issues, 20 published studies cited in the Smith study, from two treatment domains, i.e., the effectiveness of client-centered therapy (N=17) and transactional analysis (N=3), were coded according to type of therapy, allegiance of investigator, diagnosis, estimation methods, comparison treatment, subject solicitation, treatment center, and source of means. Effect size and population effect size were computed according to the methodology in the original  study. An analysis of the results showed a lack of homogeneity of effect size estimates. The success of client-centered therapy and transactional analysis appeared to depend on investigator bias, location of treatment, diagnosis, and presence of a comparison treatment. Specifically, these two treatment methods appeared to be most successful when applied to problems that occur in academic settings. Caution is recommended in generalizing the results of Smith's study, which overly represented academic problems and educational counselors compared to those in medical settings. (BL)",

The analysis is divided into four components: actors, factors, processes, and strategy critique. The first section discusses the major actors in the discharge and placement decision making process, i.e., the treaters (physicians, nurses, social workers, and discharge planners), the timekeepers (utilization reviewers and medical reviewers), and the supporters (patient, family and friends, and outside agencies). Each actor's role and impact on the decision making process is discussed. Next, three factors, treatment purpose, treatment cost, and patient resource structure,  which influence both length of placement and decision making behavior, are analyzed. The decision making process is examined in terms of the relationship between these three factors and the behavior of the actors. Based on this interaction, a discharge and placement model is offered and illustrated in a series of charts. Implications of the decision making process for community-based long term care agencies are discussed and suggestions are offered to facilitate identification of hospitalized clients who will benefit from placement in a long term care facility. A critique of the model, with an eye toward the realities of the social world and the medical actors, completes the paper. (BL)",

In order to investigate conformity and interpersonal dominance in Type A personalities, 87 male college students completed the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS), a measure of coronary proneness. Students located at either extreme of the scale (12 Type A; 11 Type B) participated in the conformity experiment by making a series of stimulus discriminations. On 4 of 16 trials, a subject responded after three confederates had agreed on an incorrect response, and then again when seated alone in another room. Normative data were collected also on a larger sample of subjects.  Analyses of results showed that, under social pressure, Type B subjects conformed to a significantly greater degree than Type A subjects. Data on a subset of the sample and the larger normative sample indicated that social pressure to conform was responsible for differences in judgmental accuracy of stimuli (conformity measure). Additional research is needed to evaluate task salience, status of group members, and subjects' perception of the consequences of their nonconformity in order to understand more fully the differences in conformity for Type A and Type B individuals.

As a part of a larger study aimed at describing alternative settings for juveniles, two dimensions of institutionalization, i.e., perceived organizational control and institutional program design, were examined in 30 settings in six different states. Perceptions of organizational control were collected from 134 members (72 percent line staff, 28 percent supervisory personnel) across all sites, using a matrix charting the level of influence in treatment decision making for all staff members. Four clusters of sites  differing on perceived control were identified ranging from an administrative hierarchy (N=6), to a middle-level control model (N=3), to a resident/supervisor model (N=9). Sites were also clustered according to 19 items representing variables related to program rules. A cross-tabulation of each site's membership in the two clustering solutions (the organizational control measure and the program variables) showed that case frequencies were distributed nearly randomly; congruence between the cluster solutions appeared nearly nonexistent. That the two measures were unrelated may reflect measurement inadequacy, or may mean that the two constructs are only marginally related to each other. (MCF)",

To assess cultural world views, the Cultural Attitudes Repertory Technique (CART), which examines the content and structure of an individual's personal system of cultural constructs, was developed. In the CART instrument, twelve cultural groups are categorized by an Alike/Different dichotomy and then the constructs are rated on a seven-point Likert-type scale ranging from family-oriented to independent. The result is a matrix of 144 ratings (12 constructs by 12 elements), reflecting an individual's perceptions of various cultural groups from the individual's unique world view. The instrument was  administered to a female college student both before and after a course in counseling ethnic minorities. The CART was able to document that, following training, the student's awareness of cultural differences increased, although her system remained poorly integrated. The case study was beneficial in establishing the CART as a flexible tool that could be used in examining cultural world views. The CART can be used as a self-exploratory exercise in a variety of settings, particularly in counselor training. Ratings on the CART can be plotted over time to graphically illustrate attitude changes. Further empirical research is needed to document its usefulness. (BL)",

However, some confusion exists in the analysis of quality on ratings obtained from different rating scale formats and from different raters. To clarify this confusion, a study was conducted to assess the quality of judgmental ratings provided by four rater sources. Six indices which seem to be meaningful for assessing the quality of judgmental ratings by different raters, i.e., leniency, range restriction, halo, dimensionality, inter-rater agreement, and predictive validity, were used. Middle level managers (N=344) were judged on their managerial role effectiveness by 272 superiors, 606 subordinates, and 470 peers, who rated ten specific roles, three overall  performance variables, and completed the company's formal performance rating. Results indicated that self-ratings were slightly more lenient, but had the least halo. Superiors' ratings had the most restricted ranges and the highest level of halo. Peer ratings contained less halo than the ratings by superiors and subordinates, had less restricted ranges than superiors' ratings, and showed some level of predictive validity. Subordinate ratings had the least restricted ranges, but more halo than self-ratings, and had the lowest predictive validity. There was low inter-rater agreement on the effectiveness ratings across all the rater sources. The results indicate the need for further research to provide a better understanding of the nature of ratings provided by different segments of an  organization. (JAC)",

To study the support exchanged in marital dyads, a behavioral observation system was designed and used to detect changes in the marital relationship of one white, middle class family participating in an Early Intervention parent training program. The behavioral observation system recorded supportive functions (cognitive guidance, social reinforcement, tangible assistance, socializing, and emotional support) at 30 second intervals as well as the directionality of the support. Observations were recorded during evening, home-based family interactions every 2 weeks for 5 months. Concurrent with the  observed interaction periods, the parents proceeded through the parent training program from baseline to Intervention Level 3. An analysis of the results showed that it was possible both to monitor supportive behaviors reliably in a home setting, and to document changes in these behaviors. Changes in inter-parent support were found concurrent with involvement in the parent training program. Individual modification of dimensions of emotional support were also increased through the use of feedback and goal setting, as monitored by the observational system. (BL)",

A well-written story for beginning readers will relate goal-directed event sequences in a coherent and relatively complete form, but understanding the story involves processes extending beyond the text as given. It draws on readers' prior knowledge of story structures, real world creatures, story world characters, and rhetorical devices. No simple prescription can be made for integrating stories and reading. But a consideration of the impact of cultural variation on reading comprehension, problems in text selection and comprehension instruction, and the relation of story reading to other kinds of reading suggests general  guidelines to teaching and research: (1) materials should be accommodated to the needs of children from diverse backgrounds; (2) children need to read meaningful stories as soon as they are able; (3) being read to also improves reading comprehension; (4) reading and responding to literature exercises reading comprehension skills; (5) simplification of stories is not simple and is often counter-productive; and (6) children can be taught to predict and to ask questions.

The second section discusses several kinds of explanations that have been postulated for these phenomena, including the ideas that capacity increases with growth and that changes in the kinds and the availability of memory structures create developmental differences. The third section introduces theoretical memory structures and  explicit learning mechanisms that have been postulated to operate in two general theories of learning and memory, while the fourth section speculates on how a learning theory embodying these structures and mechanisms might explain the phenomena in the first section.

These findings may indicate, however, not that teachers fail to make instructional decisions, but that research methodology lacks the sophistication to identify teacher decision making.

Two weeks prior to testing, students were given a 50-item completion test assessing their knowledge of American football and rugby union. After two practice sessions were completed, subjects were told to begin reading the test passage on football and rugby and to stop when they came to a pause signal. At this point, they were asked to briefly summarize what they had read so far and to state what they were thinking or doing as they read to comprehend that  portion of text. They were also asked specific probe questions to identify the use of problem solving strategies. Findings indicated that the more knowledge subjects had about a topic, the more they evaluated what they were reading, drew inferences, and made direct comparisons between familiar and less familiar passages. Students with below average comprehension ability evidenced a greater number of errors in recalling the content of the passages, made fewer evaluative comments, and drew fewer inferences while reading less familiar passages than their average classmates.

        "description":"Differences between metaphors and similes have often been overlooked in the experimental literature, and the comparison theory addressing comprehension of simile may be less appropriate to the more transformational properties of metaphor. It is proposed that one of the variables associated with the difference is affective response, leading to the hypothesis that the metaphor's greater power to unsettle a subject's view will be accompanied by a higher incidence of affective responses. A first test of this hypothesis was made using 54 fourth and fifth grade children and 70 college students. The data from the children were in agreement with the hypothesis--they generated a higher frequency of affective responses to metaphors than to similes. The adult data, however, were  inconclusive, showing a slight trend in the opposite direction. A second experiment with 33 college students investigated the degree of affective shift in response to metaphors, similes, or literal paraphrases in a story. Results showed greater affective shift in the simile condition than in either the metaphor or literal conditions. The findings suggest that, in contrast to children, depth of affective processing rather than frequency of affective ideas may be a key factor in adult figurative response. (Author/FL)",

Following three months of basic skills instruction, 47% of the original sample were administered TABE and TSCS posttests. Results showed significant gains for all students in language, math, and reading, with the greatest gains in language and the least in reading comprehension. Problems in administering and scoring the self-concept scale invalidated that test's results. Findings failed to indicate a way of using information on student age, ethnicity,  type of prison sentence, and institution's security level to predict which students would gain the most from either classroom or CMI instruction.

        "description":"Eighty high school students enrolled in social studies classrooms participated in a study exploring the hypothesis that field dependence-independence is a perceptual dimension of cognitive style influencing text structure variables and the quality of free recall. Based on results of a test of field dependence/independence, 10 subjects served in each cell of a three-way factorial design. The factors were whether the subject's cognitive style was identified as field dependent or independent; whether the top-level structure of the target selection was organized as comparison-contrast or cause-effect; and whether the target selection contained inserted signals. Subjects were directed to read the target selections without making notes or marking the text to recall information for  later rewriting, to take as much time as they needed to read, and to take the recall test when ready. Results indicated that (1) top-level structure and presence of signaling influenced readers' recall of text when the total amount of idea units was used as the sole dependent measure; (2) comparison-contrast top-level structure facilitated performance on each type of proposition for both field dependent and independent learners; and (3) cause-effect top-level structure, whether with or without signals, posed greater barriers for good readers' literal recall than did any other single variable.

        "description":"An examination of the introspective evidence of artists and scientists on their creative processes suggests that determining the causes underlying the transformation of material in thought is the key for understanding creativity. A similar problem underlies the transformational process of understanding metaphor. T.S. Kuhn's view of scientific revolutions and the nature of thought in dreams provides evidence for transformations in thought under the impact of experiential anomalies. Such transformations are guided by or express affective states or attitudes. Evidence for the productive role of affect in thought can be found in several sources, including research on the frontal regions of the brain and the affective correlates of response to metaphor. An adequate theory of  creativity must await further research on the anticipatory properties of affect, but a useful place to begin research is with the response to metaphor. (Author/FL)",

Spache's claim that most teachers are unable to design valid and reliable assessment materials. Subjects were 60 fourth and sixth grade students who were administered the Nelson-Reading Test, the reading subtests of the SRA achievement series, and a teacher-constructed cloze procedure testing student independent, instructional, and frustration levels. Multiple regression analysis indicated high statistical correlations between selected levels of cloze procedure and standardized test scores. Significant correlations were obtained among the three levels of cloze procedure, and no single variable was found to be  a good predictor of reading achievement. Many combinations of variables in the prediction models, however, were found to be highly significant predictors of the Nelson-Reading Test scores.

Subjects were 83 early childhood education majors enrolled in two field-based reading methods courses offering six weeks of university instruction and four weeks of classroom experience. Students responded to questionnaires that elicited their attitudes toward the observation/evaluation process and the strengths and weaknesses of the university supervising teacher. Results showed that, contrary to what some of the literature suggests, the university supervisor is still perceived by students as playing a vital role in the students' professional development. The students' perceptions of what contributed to a supervisor's effectiveness clustered largely in three  areas: attitudes, handling of the observation process, and the manner in which feedback was given. Finally, students' concerns did not concentrate on the strengths and weaknesses of a particular supervisor, but tended to generalize to the supervisory process itself.

No significant differences emerged for the three groups on the first five quizzes, but on quiz six students in the graphic organizer group with  summarization training achieved significantly higher scores than either of the other groups. This group also received significantly higher scores in a summarization exercise with text materials of college-level difficulty.

Subjects, 62 learning disabled high school students, were divided into an experimental and a control group and assessed for prior knowledge of a social studies textbook passage. In the SFA activity, the experimental students completed a relationship chart listing the passage's major concepts and related vocabulary, then rated the relationship of each vocabulary word to each major concept. The control group looked up 10 of the passage's &quot;difficult&quot; vocabulary  words in the dictionary, writing down the definition and an appropriate sentence. The results of the ANCOVA for the total score on the comprehension tests given after the study sessions indicated that the SFA group scored significantly higher than the vocabulary &quot;look-up&quot; group.

These two discourse types correspond to schemata that vary in their organizational components, and these differences can be expected to produce differences in the processing of text. For example, research has shown that for young adults of high verbal ability, the more organized discourse type--comparison--yields better recall of information than does the less organized type--collection--for descriptions of a topic. A study was conducted to explore the view that the learning of information from discourse can be enhanced by matching its organization to the learner's prevalent learning strategy. The subjects, 40 young, 38 middle aged, and 40 old adults, completed a  demographic survey, health questionnaire, survey of reading habits, and the Quick Word Test. Scores on the word test indicated that approximately half the subjects in each age group were high verbal and half were average verbal. Subjects read especially constructed passages with different discourse structures and responded to recall questions. Results showed that the comparison structure yielded superior recall for all age groups. No interaction was found, however, among discourse type, age, and verbal ability.

In an evaluation of the course, students reported that they used the computer for drafting papers and some even used it for prewriting. Two-thirds of the students were comfortable with the computer after the second paper. Most found the formatting and revision-enabling functions of the computer helpful, but fewer than half made much use of the computer's functions of moving chunks of text around or making global corrections.

Schemata dictate what information will be attended to, what interpretations will be made of it, and how it will be remembered. Both self-schemata and other-schemata help individuals organize and interpret their environment. This concept of self versus other schemata has implications for all information programs, especially in regard to the memory function of information processing. Since a number of pieces of information or experience produces complex schemata, the public relations practitioner should realize that mere exposure to a series of communications on a single topic could produce more mature schemata than those resulting from a single  article, report, or release. Timing is another key variable in the practitioner's understanding of how schemata dictate thoughts on and affective reactions to messages. To judge from the effects of mass media press releases, public relations staffers should allow readers or viewers time to mull over message content. The timing for releasing information is also critical. By tailoring messages to fit an intended audience's schemata, public relations practitioners can have a greater influence on message impact.

Surveys were completed by 55 weekly and 45 daily newspaper editors in a large eastern state.

The proportion of weekly and daily editors regarding as important or unimportant letters reflecting conflict presented an almost perfect inverse  relationship. These results lend support to the notion that newspapers are reflections of the social structures in which they operate. The tendency of daily newspapers--usually published in larger heterogeneous communities--to report more conflict, and the inclination of weekly newspapers--usually published in smaller homogeneous communities--to suppress it, illustrate the importance of the social environments in which these newspapers operate.

Analysis of incorrect attempts indicated student knowledge of acceptable orthographic patterns and, in some cases, knowledge of the word's visual structure. Incorrect attempts contained initial silent  consonants more often than medial or final silent consonants.

        "description":"To understand and describe a developmental learning progression of choices students make in forming chains of relationships in their narrative texts, a study used the Cohesive Harmony Index to measure cohesion in children's written narratives. Data were obtained from 36 grade school children at intervals of four months over the students' first four years of school. Cohesive harmony was expressed as the ratio of central tokens, (lexical items related through identity, or coreferential, chains) to relevant tokens (lexical items participating in similarity, or coclassificational, chains). Coding of the narrative texts followed the scheme set out in &quot;Cohesion in English&quot; by Halliday and Hasan. While it was expected that cohesive harmony scores would improve gradually over a period of  years, results showed that children who were able to write stories rapidly achieved high levels of cohesive harmony at the beginning of second grade. Identity relations took precedence in early writing, while similarity relations came to dominate children's fourth grade texts. Furthermore, although reiteration was expected to be a major chain-forming relation in children's first stories and to gradually diminish in importance as children developed, it grew in importance over the entire four years studied.

        "description":"Working from a knowledge gap hypothesis stating that as amounts of information in a community or society increase, segments of the population with more education and higher socioeconomic status acquire this information at a greater rate than do lower status groups, a study examined the contributions to neighborhood residents' knowledge of local affairs issues. The Phillips neighborhood, a large, predominantly low-income and working-class neighborhood in south Minneapolis, Minnesota, was selected for study. A random sample of 239 residents was interviewed and asked to name and rank the most important neighborhood problems. Their responses were compared to local issues identified by city planners and neighborhood leaders. Content of the two neighborhood newspapers was analyzed for  coverage of the issues. Other analyzed variables included involvement in groups specifically concerned with the issues, personal experience, interest, and education. Data analysis supported the knowledge gap hypothesis. It was also noted that neither reading the neighborhood papers nor participating in groups compensated for lack of education. Even though participation and local press readership led to knowledge gains for the less educated, the more educated were able to make even greater gains. (HOD)",

In addition to considering the purpose of newspapers, the first section discusses responsibilities of journalists, a code of journalism standards, approaches to writing news, slanted reporting, objective reporting, elements of news stories, the \"5 w's\" and \"how\" in news stories, news leads, news story structure, feature stories, techniques of interviewing, a checklist for news stories, and a checklist for feature stories. The second section presents guidelines for community-focused student journalism projects. It is arranged into suggestions for selecting  a topic, organizing a folder, using resources, conducting specific lessons, forming project groups, writing summary reports, doing layouts, discussing problems, and getting a story. The booklet concludes with a checklist for student reporters; a discussion of problems and pitfalls; ideas for extra credit, field trips and trip activities; and a bibliography. (HOD)",

        "description":"The School Program Addressing Non-attendance (SPAN) is an alternative program in Morton, Illinois, East High School addressing the needs of students removed from their regular classes for excessive absenteeism. Materials and activities used in the SPAN English program are both highly motivating and general enough to benefit students when they reenter the freshman or sophomore English sequence. To avoid repetition, literature is selected from works seldom read in the regular classroom. As there is little time to explore topics in depth, SPAN English emphasizes grammar, helps students identify and imitate five basic sentence patterns, and develops a basic vocabulary for discussing sentence construction. The program also requires that students write four or five multiple paragraph  compositions during the 10-week term using the modes of persuasion, definition, or process. Reading activities involve developing strategies for reading textbooks and literature. In general, the program's important features are (1) limiting educational objectives to a manageable number, (2) stating the objectives clearly in language students can understand, (3) maintaining consistency with the regular English program, (4) coordinating reading and writing activities, and (5) providing students with frequent and positive feedback.

        "author":["Trzyna, Thomas"],
        "description":"Current approaches to the research paper rarely emphasize more than secondary research in library collections and data bases. Instructors can help students expand their range of possible information sources by posing three questions: Who is likely to know about this? From where does information on this subject come? and, Who pays for this information? Such an approach distinguishes between knowledge of &quot;data&quot; or discrete facts, and knowledge of &quot;danda,&quot; the structure into which facts fit and by which they can be interpreted. It also recognizes that people and organizations, not books or articles, are the ultimate sources of information. As the first step in data gathering, students should consult experts in the field or information offices of professional organizations. These  sources can provide information about the field's structure of debate and also help to identify major articles or publications on the issue. Sources of funding are also important because information often can be traced and accessed through its funding source. An awareness of the structural organization of a discipline can also direct students to many print sources that are guides to people and organizations in the structure. This approach to research is intended not to replace but to supplement the traditional bibliographic approach, enabling students to gain rapid access to more current information and to learn structural information that will help them interpret the data they collect.

        "description":"Of great concern among researchers is the effectiveness of holistic scoring, which is necessarily product-centered and decontextualized, in measuring writing quality, the mental processes necessary for writing, or teaching skill. The Committee on Teaching and Its Evaluation in Composition of the Conference on College Composition and Communication has made suggestions for shifting the focus of evaluation from the product to the process. Furthermore, it stresses the need and makes suggestions for viewing language teaching from a constructivist stance rather than from a reductionist position. The writing quality evaluations of much of the research in written composition, clearly more reductionist than constructivist, fail to take into account the purpose of the writer, the writer's  audience, or the sociopolitical context of the writing act. Future research in writing should utilize the six evaluation instruments suggested by the committee that take into account the goals of both course and teacher, the background and preparation of students, and many other factors critical to the learning experience. Research in written composition should also consider language change over periods longer than a single academic term. Unfortunately, researchers today are caught between the expediency of experimental research and the completeness of naturalistic inquiry. One demands empirical inquiry based on the tenets of logical positivism, and the other requires a costly commitment to naturalistic inquiry based on the belief in a multiple reality. (HOD)",

Students wrote compositions one day and revised them a few days later. Revisions were categorized as formal, word level, phrase level, clause level, sentence level, and multisentence level. Results showed no differences in revisions for the two composition types. There was a trend at grade 11, only, for good students to make fewer formal revisions and more revisions of other kinds than average students. There was a significant decrease in formal revisions from grade 5 to grade 11;  otherwise, the number of revisions made at the various levels by grade 5 students was very similar to the number made by grade 11 students. Grade 7 students, however, made significantly fewer revisions than did grade 5 or grade 11 students. The findings provide little evidence for age-related or ability-related differences detectable by tallying revisions of the kinds examined. (Author/FL)",

One such strategy is to provide students with complimentary copies of \"Language Arts\" and ask them to read two or three articles that especially interest them. Another strategy asks students to read, select, and submit one or two articles from the \"English Journal\" that could be included in a class anthology of effective teaching practices. Still another assignment requires students to offer solutions/suggestions for problems raised in \"Classroom Practices,\" a series published by the National Council of Teachers of English. A procedure that calls for considerable student involvement is the \"mini-conference\" in which students are asked to role-play published  professionals, offering their ideas and strategies in conference-fashion to other members of the class. Writing assignments can call for the use of professional publications as models and stipulate a teacher audience for essays. Yet another strategy allows students to substitute conference attendance and participation for a major course assignment. By incorporating such practices in a methods course, students can learn to profit from professional studies and to practice a professional role. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study tested the hypothesis that spoken language has a strong direct influence on the encoding process, and that speakers of nonstandard dialects have a different set of problems with the written language and make identifiably different errors than do speakers of standard dialect. The subjects, 13 standard and 13 nonstandard dialect speakers enrolled in adult basic writing courses, completed a variety of writing tasks in different discourse modes as well as tasks involving oral language. Errors were counted and categorized as follows: those not linguistically based, but rather &quot;ignorant&quot; or perceptual in origin; those that might be explained as nonlinguistic or linguistic in origin; those that were unambiguously linguistic in origin; and those noted but not counted. Results  indicated that, among adult basic writers (1) differences in reading comprehension skills seemed not to account for differences in total quantities of errors or for differences in types of errors committed; (2) such is the overriding influence of nonstandard dialect on encoding behavior, that even when composing and cognitive skills were on the same level, nonstandard dialect speakers were likely to produce many more errors than were standard dialect speakers; and (3) nonstandard speech patterns apparently accounted for two highly stigmatized categories of errors--hypercorrect linguistic forms and wrong whole-word verb forms--and for a large portion of omitted inflectual suffixes.

Articles in section one cover curriculum models for integrating the language arts, methods of integrating language and subject matter, and the relationship between a child's grasp of meaning and language skills. Topics in section two include the development of writing in a language arts context, student created books, the impact of  different instructional methods on student reading, fostering language play, and ways of integrating reading with music, art and drama. Section three discusses such issues as achievement assessment in the language arts, parent involvement in language arts programs, teaching underachieving children, and integrating perspectives on monolingual and multilingual children.

        "description":"A metacritical judging model for contest oral interpretation that evaluates the performer's critical decisions is designed to meet three criteria: (1) it attempts to incorporate the advances of oral interpretation scholars outside the forensics community with the activity at forensics tournaments, (2) it recognizes that forensics competition is fundamentally a pedagogical activity, and (3) it recognizes that a forensic tournament is different from a public performance and calls for appropriately different behavior. To evaluate the fit between the literature, the performance, and the performer's critical judgment, the metacritical judge must view the interpretation as an argument. The judge evaluates both the introduction and the performance to determine whether claim, literature,  and performance all support each other. The metacritic must also evaluate the worth of the introductory claim to determine if the critical thinking behind the performance is really interpretation or merely description. The most important implication for the metacritical model is the increased importance of the introduction to the judge's decision. Other implications include a call for interpretation-specific criticism from the judges rather than performance-specific criticism, a potentially greater depth for the performers, and interpreters' recognition of the rhetoricity inherent in poetics.

The first section of the paper reviews the sociolinguistic tradition, which views communicative competence as situational, interactional, functional, and developmental. The second section discusses the referential tradition, which is concerned with role-taking, comparison skills, and propositional meaning. The third section examines the speech communication tradition, focusing on two strands--social perspective taking and effectiveness of communicator style--and a third strand, restricted to communication education, that has attempted to delimit  specific skills appropriate for testing competence within the school. The paper then uses arguments from speech act theory regarding the links between referential and social meaning to argue the need for an interactional definition of communication competence linking referential, social, and structuring aspects of continuing discourse. It concludes with a discussion of the implications of such an integration. An extensive bibliogrpahy is included. (FL)",

Subjects, 33 members of two different university human relations groups, met in their groups three times a week over a seven-week period. During the first group meeting, each subject completed personality inventories, measuring extroversion-introversion and neuroticism. During each of the remaining sessions, a facilitator gathered  data using an interpersonal feedback form especially prepared for the study consisting of six sets of scales that rated feedback as either beneficial or harmful, useful or useless, or valuable or worthless. Throughout the study, they also completed weekend reflection forms, with similar scales, to gauge whether their evaluations had changed with reflection. Results showed that approximately 90% of the received feedback was perceived as beneficial, useful, and valuable. There was a positive relationship between the giving and receiving of useful feedback, and extroversion, neuroticism, and self-actualization scores were not found to be related to the giving of useful feedback.

Information on speech departments indicated three general patterns: speech departments were combined with drama or theatre in nine institutions, speech was a separate department in seven institutions, and speech courses were scattered throughout the curriculum in nine institutions. The ACM had no separate speech departments and the GLCA had seven colleges with speech departments. Only one ACM college had a college-wide speech requirement. Drama departments also indicated a pattern. In eight  institutions drama was a separate department--five of these were in the GLCA and three in the ACM. Acceptance of drama courses for fulfilling requirements was much more common than acceptance of speech courses; in the GLCA, drama courses were accepted in every institution. The GLCA seemed to have a stronger performance emphasis in the preparation of many of their faculty members, while the ACM had a more traditional research focus. Through research efforts by the Small College Committee of the Speech Communication Association and the development of the Programs of Limited Size organization within the American Theatre Association, both the shared concerns and the special needs of these differing groups can be better understood.

They then identified the three items showing the greatest incremental differences between their personal and group scores. Subjects' responses were grouped into four general clusters: those listing justifications for changed opinions, those comparing competing arguments, those citing sources as support, and those indicating the group process as an explicit  factor in changed ranking. Tentative generalizations from these responses included the following: (1) group rhetoric is inherently related to the consensual development of the group; (2) rhetorical ideas develop from comparisons, which are themselves facilitated by the small group setting; (3) rhetorical transactions are a function of leadership; (4) the construction of an argument in a small group setting is an interactive, social phenomenon; and (5) consensus is frequently a matter of compromise and cooperation rather than agreement.

        "description":"The goal of instruction in mainstream dialect (MD) acquisition should be to expand students' oral communication skills to include skills needed for academic and economic success, thereby making alternate dialect speakers bidialectic. This implies recognizing students' home dialect as a valid linguistic system and a part of their identity. Although seldom used in classrooms, an \"indirect\" approach to MD instruction is advocated by most language arts experts. In this method no explicit instruction in dialect differences is given but students are exposed to models of the dominant dialect. A more direct and consequently more effective approach consists of both formal instruction in dialect differences and exercises in using the MD. This approach (1) is less confusing to alternate  dialect speakers, (2) provides more opportunities to use the MD, (3) increases student motivation, and (4) helps to discourage use of the \"correction\" method. Such instructon should begin in preschool and early elementary grades, since the sooner students begin to speak the MD, the more comfortable they will be with it and the more likely they will be able to code switch. The early instruction is also more effective because young children still enjoy playing with language and sounds and are more willing to risk sounding strange when they use new language patterns.

In the first phase of the study, 177 college students generated lists of BATs and BAMs, and then, working in groups, arranged them in categories. In the second phase, 18 BATs with sample BAMs were taken from the lists and used to generate an instrument that was administered to 204 public school teachers, who indicated how often they used each to get their students to change behavior and how effective they were in achieving this. They also indicated how often their students used the same techniques in getting them to change behavior. Results  showed that the teachers relied primarily on reward-type BATs. They also reported that their students did not frequently employ any of the BATs to change teacher behavior. Potential predictors of differential teacher use of BATs were not found to be meaningful.

Upon completion of the first course, students should be able to (1) respond aesthetically to theatre; (2) recognize theatre as a reflection of human needs; (3) perform first independently and then as a member of a group; (4) consider the various possibilities for careers within the theatre arts; (5) solve problems creatively through the application of the techniques of relaxation, imagination, concentration, and sense memory; (6) convey attitude and emotion through a variety of verbal and nonverbal behaviors; (7) demonstrate a knowledge of theatre  terminology; (8) identify the characteristics of various forms of dramatic literature and styles of production; and (9) demonstrate an understanding of the relationship among artist, theatre, audience, and society. After completion of Theatre II students should be able to perform basic tasks of technical theatre; demonstrate appropriate stage and acting techniques; perceive the relationship between a period of history and the theatre it produced; assume the identity of a specified character, based upon a thorough analysis of a script; read and interpret a play for possible class performance; and identify career opportunities in acting and technical production.

        "description":"Of the many specific situations in which the exercise of suasory influence may be necessary to assure that a decision making group meets its analytical responsibilities, five appear to be particularly important. These are circumstances in which (1) a group is violating accepted procedural norms, (2) an authority figure or high status group member is exerting undue and improper influence on the course of a discussion, (3) the majority is inappropriately exerting pressure for uniformity, (4) members of the group are displaying inferential deficiencies, and (5) participants are basing judgments on stereotypic thinking. These situations suggest that suasory influence is more appropriate under circumstances in which the interests of rational choice can be furthered. Suasory  intervention, however, could well worsen an already undesirable situation. Efforts to reorient group members toward a decisional act may be so subtle as to go unnoticed, so weakly stated as to go unheeded, or so direct as to arouse animosity toward the initiator. A potentially fruitful area for future research, therefore, is the examination of the relative effectiveness of alternative modes of suasory influence. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study examined the effects of teachers' use of explicit explanation on students' levels of metacognitive awareness of the reading process and on their reading achievement as measured by a standardized test. Subjects, 22 fifth grade teachers from 13 different elementary schools, were observed by researchers who had been trained in using a management observation form. After rating the teachers as high, medium, or low classroom managers, the researchers then randomly assigned each to a treatment or control condition. Teachers in the treatment condition were trained to use explicit explanation during reading instruction, and those in the control condition were trained in classroom management techniques. All teachers were asked to incorporate what they had learned into their  classroom lessons with low reading students. The students in all classes were tested previous to instruction using a standardized reading test and again following it. Results showed that the students of treatment condition teachers were more aware of what they had been taught than were students of control condition teachers. In addition, there was a significant positive relationship between teachers' explicit explanation and students' metacognitive awareness.

        "description":"A number of studies consistently identify the importance of communication skills, both oral and written, as vital to employability. Speech communication departments, however, have been slow either in responding to industry's needs or in informing students of the high correlation between communication skills and employability. Some of the possible obstacles to restructuring the curriculum to include a communication training course or program are (1) instructors' doubts about their ability to develop and teach the courses, (2) the assumption that training techniques are only a fad, and (3) the belief that concern with the nonacademic career relevance of education will not enrich the discipline's scholarly and educational activities. Broadening the scope of traditional approaches to  speech education curricula can produce students who are better able to meet the need for communication education in business and industry. The focus of the traditional speech methods courses could be expanded to include units on conducting seminars, workshops, and comprehensive training programs. In addition, existing courses in organizational communication could be expanded to include a unit on training and development. Emphasis could be placed on topics unique to human resource training. By thus changing the curricula, the communication educator can become more prevalent in industry. (HOD)",

The scale was then administered to 91 male and 148 female undergraduate students. Four dimensions of role behavior were tested: role dominance, role sensitivity, role adaptability, and role flexibility. Also tested were sex role attitudes. Findings showed that biological sex was a less consistent predictor of role communication patterns than role variability. Role variability appeared to better explain development of opposite-sex friendship than biological sex. On the other hand, biological sex did appear to mediate  social-role attitudes more consistently than role variability. It was concluded that the global gender stereotype frequently attributed to males and females was not consistently manifested in perceptions of communication role behavior.

        "author":["Isenhart, Myra W."],
        "description":"To help adults develop an awareness of midlife issues, to encourage personal acceptance of the transition, and to introduce appropriate coping skills, a speech communication course was designed that relied on river trip activities to develop insights about this passage. The vehicle for the seminar was a four-day raft trip down the Green River, sponsored by the Colorado Outward Bound School. Several months before the course, participants were informed about midlife transitions (changes in biological conditioning, the sequence of generations, and evolving careers) and given an annotated bibliography on midlife. During the course, group discussion drew attention to the analogies between the river passage and midlife transition: (1) the current of the river is like adult development  which can be anticipated but never completely controlled, (2) submerged rocks below the surface of the river are like stressful periods in the transition that often present themselves first as smooth nonevents, and (3) the circular currents of water reflect the sense of limitless time when no progress appears possible. Specific attention was also given to the communication skills of listening, confrontation, and teamwork. One difficulty of the course, however, was that the timing and spacing of the seminar units were entirely dependent on the ability of the staff to predict and produce river activities that were meaningfully integrated with the seminar. Nevertheless, unsolicited letters from participants confirmed the value of the course. (HOD)",

        "description":"Verbal and nonverbal dimensions of communication are a vital part of competitive group discussion. Specific nonverbal elements that have been found useful in competitive group discussion include environment, proxemics, kinesics, objectics, and chronemics. For example, equalizing arrangements for the discussion in the best area of a room enhances the environment and places a minimum amount of attention on this variable. The physical distance between members is another important variable, influencing the perceived status and power of members and the weight given to their ideas. An area over which discussants have the most control is kinesics or gestures. By encouraging another discussant with positive facial expressions or discouraging participation with scowls or negative  expressions, a group member can influence the kind of interaction that occurs in a round. Objectics, or the dress and personal accessories of a speaker, indicate those individuals with status and power in a group. A final nonverbal dimension is the impact of clocks and time upon the kind of discussion that occurs in a round. All of these elements can influence a judge's perception. To become active and effective members of a discussion, students should consider each of these nonverbal dimensions. (HOD)",

        "author":["Winebrenner, T. C."],
        "description":"Communication scholars have recently focused attention on songs as artifacts of popular culture. Current literature implies that the contexts of music communication are defined by the relationships that songs establish between artists and their audience: persuasive, expressive, and commercial. As the commercialization of music is an inherently rhetorical process, it is in this commercial context that rhetorical theory and popular song must find union. The appeal of popular songs can be explained through Kenneth Burke's concept of identification with others, an essentially rhetorical process. Thus, a song that begins as an artist's personal expression becomes, through identification, a vicarious expression by the listener. Music serves as a repository for the concerns of the  society in which it is found, both communicating and reflecting normative values. It is also the nature of the music itself, and not the vocal or lyrical aspects alone, that accounts for its popularity. Thus a rhetoric of popular song would be incomplete if it failed to address the rhetorical implications of music style. Audiences either relate or fail to relate to music according to their ability to identify with the particular style. Taken as a whole, the social theory of music suggests that popular songs function as communicative events. In addition to serving the ends of persuasion and artistic expression, music is a medium of vicarious expression for audiences as collectives and as individuals. (HTH)",

        "description":"To learn more about small group interactions, a study investigated the characteristics of women's conversation in its own right rather than compared to a male model of conversation. The researcher spent 10 months as a participant/observer in a women's weekly circle (WWC), a group of mothers of young children who met once a week. The researcher focused on storytelling as a form of social interaction that would embody the communicative style and interactional norms of the group. Early sessions were transcribed from memory and later sessions from tape recordings. Impressions and interpretations of the group's interactions were verified through participant interviews at the end of the observation period. It was found that, unlike the typically competitive conversation of men, women's  conversation was characterized by cooperation and support. Stories reflected vicarious as well as personal experiences and prototypical as well as specific events, and were told in order of occurrence or expanded from a kernel. Turn-by-turn talk was not suspended to permit story telling to take place in conversation. WWC members characteristically made linking remarks, thus facilitating the telling of stories, highlighting story connections within a series, and showing their connection to the ongoing stream of interaction. The sharing of common problems through storytelling was much more common than self-aggrandizement through tales of personal adventures and exploits. (HTH)",

Longitudinal data on individual careers in education were used, primarily for educators in Oregon during the period 1971-81, but in some instances for educators in New York during the 1970s. Little evidence is found of sex discrimination in salaries of teachers in the 1970s, and only very small sex-related differences in wage responsiveness and interdistrict mobility were noted. Evidence on promotions to administrative positions indicates that in the early 1970s female teachers were significantly less likely to be promoted than similarly qualified male teachers, but that by the late 1970s the  difference was no longer significant. In addition, formal index measures of discrimination declined by about half during the same period. By 1980 no evidence is found of salary discrimination among administrators, when experience in education is allocated into teaching and administrative components. These findings suggest that equal employment opportunity and affirmative action efforts initiated during the 1970s contributed to a reduction in employment discrimination against women in education.

To determine whether schools are better characterized as rational bureaucracies or as loosely coupled systems or whether some schools belong to each model, four dimensions were operationalized (goal consensus, centralization of influence, vertical communication, and rule enforcement) that would receive high scores in a rational bureaucracy. Approximately 1,300 teachers from a random sample of 50 schools drawn from southeastern Pennsylvania were administered questionnaires that collected data concerning the organizational structures of their schools.

Other highly rated alternatives among the eight listed were raising graduation requirements and expanding inservice teacher training. During the past 3 years (1979-82), nine out of ten districts reported implementing one or more activities to bolster achievement. Although urban, suburban, and rural districts are similar in their graduation requirements, urban districts tend to emphasize minimum  competency tests and homework assignments more than rural districts. Minimum competency tests and scores from the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and American College Testing (ACT) Program revealed no consistent pattern of positive relationships between requirements and achievement.

Researchers surveyed 165 principals in two New York State counties about their negotiations roles and level of managerial discretion. Statistical analysis indicated that negotiating role and school district size were significantly related to differences in principals' on-the-job discretion. Principals in smaller districts had more discretion than those in larger districts. Through regression analysis it  was determined that the roles of negotiator and active consultant provided principals with higher levels of perceived on-the-job discretion than did the roles of passive advisor and nonparticipant. Discretion was examined in such areas as assigning pupils, teacher discipline, calling additional meetings, and other managerial powers. The data did not indicate that sitting at the bargaining table provides principals with any stronger discretionary authority than being an active consultant does, but researchers concluded that principals should be consultants in the bargaining process to protect their own jobs and autonomy.

Other classroom variables directly related to student achievement include engagement rate, student engaged time, prior learning, and instructional overlap. The RBS approach to instructional improvement involves training supervisors and teachers to run through a four-phase decision-making cycle related to each of these five variables. First, teachers collect data on student achievement and their own classroom procedures. Second, teachers compare their data with  data that researchers have collected on classrooms where achievement results are known to be high. Third, teachers select or prepare ways to modify their classroom conditions, and last, teachers implement their modifications. Staffs can be trained to calculate engaged time, try new techniques, and tag learning deficiencies before planning instruction. Results show that improvement efforts can succeed provided that school staff at all levels lend in their support. (LH)",

        "description":"Potential revenue prospects for the public schools in the Midwest basically depend on the future outlook for the midwestern economy as a whole. Accordingly, a comprehensive analysis is undertaken of the midwestern economy and tax base, and then of trends in educational spending. Topics include: (1) economic growth and taxation systems; (2) demographic and economic trends; (3) federal, state, and local revenue systems; and (4) state education systems in the Midwest, in general and state by state. The latter includes analysis of declining public school enrollments, shifting sources of school revenues, school expenditures, and finance reform. The study concludes that policy-makers in the Midwest will continue to be confronted with difficult decisions regarding trade offs between  cutting public services and increasing taxes. Furthermore, revenue-limiting provisions may make it difficult for states to raise sufficient public service revenues. Accordingly, states are likely to place greater pressure on local governments to increase their share of school financing. A 5-page bibliography concludes the study. (TE)",

        "description":"An intensive two-phase study of teachers' unions in three small school districts in southern New York State over a 10-year span investigates the changes within the union movement and assesses the impact of unionization on the school systems. The study discloses that teachers' organizations and the collective bargaining process are subject, over time, to internal and external constraints that restrict the scope and direction of union activity to teacher welfare issues, despite the sincere interest of leaders and members in substantive professional concerns. Internal constraints include the need for membership unity and for support from statewide labor organizations, while external constraints range from budgetary limitations to school board opposition to encroachment on their  sphere of authority. These constraints may be counteracted by a strong commitment to professional goals by the union leadership, along with rank and file involvement in such issues. The impact of unionization in these school districts is generally beneficial: (1) greater teacher participation in decision-making facilitates workable solutions to problems; (2) administrators' fears about the union protecting incompetent teachers are largely imaginary; (3) although it limits administrators' flexibility, a contract clarifies rights and responsibilities; and (4) communication is enhanced among teachers, administrators, and school boards.

The study, which focused on case studies of three suburban superintendents' management of five to seven major issues, used raw data consisting of interviews with superintendents and other participants, observations of board of education and administrative committee meetings, administrative documents, and newspaper articles. The data were collected and subjected to a six-level method of qualitative analysis in which increasing levels of analytical abstraction were applied, culminating in a general model of issue management and domain. Summaries of project output and papers either in draft or printed separately  in part two of this report are included. The study has brought to light major themes including effective issue managers' avoidance of surprising their constituents, the importance of administrative mechanisms, rehearsal as a key aspect of issue framing, and incremental reframing of issues. Cited as methodological contributions to the project are computer assistance in qualitative research, content analysis strategies such as word count and analysis of the subject's causal assertions to derive a &quot;mental map,&quot; and informant collaboration in interviews.

The report involves fundamental questions of evaluation, measurement, and other processes and prior factors concerning Title IX compliance. Stratification variables were socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Interview data provided the dependent variable in the study. Measurement control variables included demographic, fiscal, legal, and organizational variables. The report concludes: (1) that federal programs to reduce sex bias in schools produce many  of the intended results; (2) that institutional change regarding Title IX can be measured by a valid and reliable quantified/scaling procedure; and (3) that among the factors affecting the success of compliance efforts are demographic factors (such as size and location of the school district) and the degree of involvement of the superintendent or assistant superintendent. Numerous tables and figures provide the CCSEE Title IX implementation instrument and pre- and posttreatment raw frequencies of response and posttreatment scale-item correlations. (PB)",

First viewed as a cause of retrenchment, desegregation later becomes the catalyst for resource redistribution and program innovation. As a corollary of this resource mobilization process, the customary budget channels are bypassed. New bureaucracies, budgets, and programs are overlaid on old ones, resulting in significant shifts in the power that accompanies access to funding sources. Litigation accounts for the deviation of desegregation budgeting from the normal budgeting process. In sum, the courts have become levers for mobilizing funds for schools. In effect, desegregation litigation introduces into an urban  school system a new budget system, complete with new actors, new paradigms for thinking about resource allocation, and new avenues of revenue generation. This budgetary system will presumably merge eventually with the established system. The paper concludes that by observation of decision-makers' conceptualizations of budgetary categories, researchers may better understand the politics of management in an era of austerity. (PB)",

The premise for the study was based on three findings: (1) staff expectations influence the school's ability to change, (2) the tactics used and the ability to initiate change are affected by building organization, and (3) the school as a workplace affects staff development. The researchers found that school innovations as described on paper would take more energy and tenacity to implement than was available for their research project. They also found that the schools in the study had little ability to support change, so the researchers had to work to increase that ability.  Outlined are eight characteristics crucial in the establishment and maintenance of a peer coaching system. The researchers' experiences lead them to suggest that the introduction of new practices is very difficult, and that peer coaching would require adequate time in practice before any meaningful evaluation might be made of its success or failure.

Three methods of selecting participants are discussed: selection on the basis of affiliation with reference groups, on the basis of representing the population at large, and on the basis of demographic analysis that identifies significant groups. Actual choice of selection  method has depended upon philosophical preference; for selection to be based upon more objective criteria a common unit of measurement must be identified.

        "description":"On account of concern about declining achievement levels of high school graduates and proposed state legislation increasing graduation requirements to address this concern, this report analyzes current and proposed high school graduation requirements in Illinois, based on data compiled from local school documents, and compares the data to statistics nationwide, from other states, and from selected urban schools. Major findings are as follows: (1) Illinois' 16 unit requirement falls at midpoint relative to other states; (2) 75 percent of the states exceed Illinois requirements in English, math, science, and social studies; (3) only two schools exceed the requirements specified in proposed state legislation; (4) the proposed legislation is unduly restrictive for college-bound and  non-college-bound students alike; (5) the proposals necessitate extensive modification of existing policies over a short time for schools lacking adequate resources to make such adjustments; (6) there is no evidence that increasing requirements affects student performance (in fact, there is evidence to the contrary). The study concludes that the quantity of graduation requirements has no discernible effect on achievement, whereas an outcome-based approach, specifying performance expectations, is more likely to achieve desired improvements.

Research methods included review of legislative documents, telephone surveys of school districts in and out of state, and examination of statistical records on attendance and transportation costs. Based on this research, it is recommended that the current mandate be repealed, to be replaced by state reimbursement of local transportation services. The mandate's original  purpose--to remove barriers to school consolidation--has largely been accomplished, and school districts willingly provide transportation whether they are covered by the mandate or not. Furthermore, the mandate does little to encourage efficiency or responsiveness to local needs.

The study revealed that since 1959 (when the minimum required daily instructional time was extended to 5 hours), the substantial increase in new instructional mandates and ancillary educational services, reflecting a common belief in education as a vehicle for social change, has imposed a burden on school time allotments, as new programs necessarily displace time  previously devoted to the basic purposes of schooling. Accordingly, an increase in the school day or school year in itself will not guarantee improved student achievement. Rather, the state should define the academic core of instruction, mandating five hours each day for language arts, foreign languages, mathematics, science, and social studies (including history), while adding two hours to accommodate other instructional services. Appendixes are provided, including statutes, regulatory references, and selected statistical data. (TE)",

A total of 15 fellowships were awarded to 3 cohorts of postdoctoral fellows. The program's major strengths are cited as recruitment of promising candidates and their research collaboration with senior educational researchers, twice weekly research seminars, computer seminars, a visiting scholars program, support for attending  national research conferences, and the conference held for participants in all three cohorts at the end of the 3 years of funding. The training program included a second year of &quot;mentor-fellow&quot; research collaboration that, for a variety of reasons, was evaluated as the weakest part of the program.

The service mandate is a legal requirement (not contingent upon federal financial aid) that states or districts provide educational services satisfying federal standards to target groups of students. Following discussions of existing mandates to serve handicapped and limited-English-proficient children and theoretical attributes of mandates, fiscal and allocative effects of mandates on federal, state, and local budgets, distributive impact, and effects on services for target groups are discussed. An analysis of policy implications concludes that while service mandates are more certain in  effect, more efficient in directing resources, and more easily monitored than federal grants, state and local budgets carry the financial burden of mandated services, and existing fiscal inequities are likely to be exacerbated as federal authority is extended to allocating part of state and local revenue. It is suggested that the disadvantages of mandates can be minimized by accompanying them with grants, and that a mandate plus block grant system could provide services for present target groups as well as for the educationally disadvantaged.

Almost half the report describes 15 components of the mandated program, providing for each its statutory or regulatory source, a brief historical review, and a summary of its current level of implementation. The analysis concludes that: (1) the mandates generally do not provide clear statements of expectations for schools or  students; (2) compliance criteria are so general that the quality of outcomes is not addressed; (3) the mandates do not imply a reasonable assurance that students will achieve certain knowledge or competencies; (4) the absence of mandates would probably affect schools' instructional programs; (5) mandates as a group constitute an acceptable minimal instructional program for elementary school but not for secondary education.

To test the hypothesis that the manner in which the principals report that they would solve a problem would be characteristic of their psychological types, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Principal Problem Strategy Questionnaire (PPSQ) were administered to 86 principals. The MBTI was scored for preferences in perceiving (sensing or intuitive) and judging (thinking or feeling) functions to generate a psychological type score. The PPSQ consists of 12 problem situations for which principals described what action they themselves  would take. Answers to the PPSQ were coded for the respondent's psychological type functions based on MBTI results, and six Q-sorters independently classified PPSQ responses by characteristics of psychological types. Results indicate that perceived problem-solving strategies of sensing and intuitive type and thinking and feeling type principals are significantly different, and that the principals studied overwhelmingly perceived and judged problem situations according to their psychological type characteristics. It is concluded that if reported strategies reflect actual strategies, psychological type is a major determinant of leader behavior. (MLF)",

Certain absolute legal standards for this baseline educational entitlement are posited to exist; this claim is supported by complementary analyses of (1) the right to equal educational opportunity under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; and (2) protected interests under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A synthesis of these two legal analyses reveals that equal educational opportunity presupposes some entitlement to minimum quantity and quality of education. In practice, this means that  planning, diagnostic, and program requirements must work to allow second language minority students to participate effectively in the regular instructional program. It is observed that the establishment of such a baseline standard of educational adequacy provides an objective basis for educational malpractice litigation, since states and school districts must demonstrate that they have adequately, affirmatively, appropriately, and effectively instructed the student in all the skills, concepts, and courses required for high school graduation.

The audits for a 6-month period ending September 30, 1983, are graphed and significant audits highlighted; the resolution of audit reports and the total recovered funds are also noted. A survey of investigations tallies the numbers of cases, indictments, convictions, and restitutions involving Department of Education programs and recounts the results of significant investigations. Major management improvement efforts, which identified problem areas and recommended changes in wasteful or fraudulent procedures, are reviewed  for their contributions to the department's internal efficiency. The appendixes include a guideline for the public on eliminating fraud and waste in federal education programs and a 6-month compilation of the audits on Education Department programs. (JW)",

        "description":"This study is a comprehensive exploration of six mechanisms of control, both hierarchical and nonhierarchical, which constrain the work of elementary school principals but provide them a balance of control and autonomy. The database consists of extensive indepth interviews with 113 elementary school principals in 59 school districts from 3 suburban counties, focusing on their relations with their central district offices. The hierarchical control mechanisms examined include supervision, input control (personnel and monetary controls), behavior controls (for administrative and instructional tasks), and output controls (student testing), while the more diffuse nonhierarchical mechanisms of control include selection-socialization (patterns of hiring and ranking) and environmental  control (derived from school community relations). For each of these control mechanisms, variation in patterns of usage are analyzed, characteristics are described, and practical implications of trends emerging from the data are discussed. An extensive conclusion summarizes findings on each mechanism of control and on the relationship between organizational control and such factors as school social status and district size. These findings are collectively brought to bear on a discussion of the principal's role. An appendix provides the interview form and the fact sheet filled out by all those interviewed. (TE)",

Accordingly, this study focuses first on field research methods in policy settings as a general topic, then on problems specific to women in this area. A researcher must be aware of informal coalitions or networks of influence and power, the posturing and manipulation in policy games, and the special norms and traditions in policy settings. Appropriate ways are therefore proposed for managing role, entry and access, data gathering, reciprocity, ethics, and reporting in such settings. Because these issues must be managed differently at different stages in the research, separate sections are devoted to overcoming initial barriers, the  exploratory stage, the focusing/analyzing stage, and methodological issues during the checking/testing phase. Thereafter, a discussion of male-female dynamics, coupled with a review of the pertinent literature and a consideration of women's inherent advantages and disadvantages in such research, leads to recommendations for appropriate role fronts for female researchers.

Some studies have concentrated on social and psychological differences between men and women leaders, while a second group notes workplace attitudes toward stereotyped male and female traits. Both of these types of studies have lacked measures of leadership effectiveness. However, a third group, considering the inequities facing women leaders, has broken through male-oriented leadership studies. But the most productive studies of women leaders have identified general leader behaviors and skills and have shown no significant differences between effective male and female leadership. Using specific behaviors found to be common among effective  leaders of either sex, a new study examines school union leaders, male and female, to determine the skills they rated highest in their jobs, their motives and incentives, and their reasons for choosing union rather than school administration. Men and women, it was found, agreed on essential skills in leadership and on most incentives; however, a majority of women, unlike male counterparts, found union leadership attractive because they could remain in teaching.

Although planning such a collaborative interorganizational relationship (IOR) seems to require both appropriate structures among member organizations and methods of communication that encourage shared decision-making, a sample of IOR's in Massachusetts shows that the interaction processes were of more importance than organizational structures in determining a collaborative relationship. The type of coordinating structure chosen for an IOR depends largely on the extent of school system input in the decision-making process. Although resources available to member  organizations can also be coordinated to save money and improve service, such cooperation requires clearly specified units of exchange and terms of reciprocity. Moreover, each organization's domain must be specified in problem-solving activities of collaborative IOR's. (JW)",

In particular, the law did not provide for modifications of its policies in improving public education opportunities for handicapped children. A critique of policy implications and lessons of P.L. 94-142 is possible by examining the law under the categories of policy formation, implementation, evaluation, and termination. Some laws, such as P.L. 94-142, may reflect only one perception of educational problems and thus become prescriptive. Moreover, the procedures for implementing policy often are defined after the fact; in the case of P.L. 94-142, problems of  interagency cooperation and appropriate local strategies have surfaced. Policy evaluation, which in theory should oversee the implementation process, may often be neglected due to lack of data or to public opposition to elements of the originally formulated policy, as has occurred with P.L. 94-142. Finally, policy termination, little discussed by educational policy-makers, should be considered even in the policy formulation stage; neglect of such considerations may account for dissatisfation with P.L. 94-142.

These procedures as currently practiced do not do justice to the importance of the principalship, nor do they manifest any consistent likelihood of attracting or selecting the best qualified candidates. Chapter 3, &quot;Pathways to the Principalship,&quot; provides case histories of five principals of varying competence, in order to illustrate the vagaries of the selection process from the applicants' perspective. Chapters 4 and 5 describe three promising alternative procedures  currently in use at five school districts: (1) assessment centers; (2) district operated internships; and (3) &quot;exemplary&quot; common practices. A comparative analysis follows, delineating the differences between the conventional practices and these alternatives. The essential advantages of the latter derive from sequential screening, which provides more objective, reliable, and comprehensive data for assessing applicants, so that appointments are based more on merit than on contingencies. Guidelines are therefore included for developing or revising a principal selection procedure. A bibliography and an appendix describing the study design and methodology are included. (TE)",

Results revealed that hearing impaired Ss reported a significantly greater amount (nearly 1 hour more daily) of daily television viewing than hearing Ss. Hearing impaired Ss showed significantly more affinity toward television and were more likely to perceive TV as depicting reality than were hearing Ss. Further, hearing impaired Ss reported significantly greater frequency of  viewing and greater enjoyment of captioned programs than programs without closed captions. Significant differences in viewing frequency were found for four of the five program categories and in level of enjoyment for two categories.

Features of the selected districts (urbanicity, number of schools, enrollment, predominant ethnicity, and number of handicapped students), and of microcomputer systems (number in use, location, instructional applications, and administrative applications) were charted. The findings underlined the importance of collaboration with other microcomputer applications in the district and noted similarities in use by special and regular education. Applications for special education were identified, including administrative (such as child count data and student  records) and instructional uses (such as computer assisted instruction, and vocational/career counseling and training). Specialized applications for special education were also identified, including as communication aids and individualized education program monitoring systems. Centralized and decentralized patterns of supervision were revealed, and factors important to the growth and utilization of microcomputers (including existence of skilled persons with authority) were noted. Analysis of the balance between instructional and administrative applications revealed that growth of microcomputer systems was strongest where mixed applications were present. Examination of training procedures revealed a variety of approaches and cited the importance of coordinators for growth beyond the  initial adoption phase. Emphasis in special education applications on drill and practice exercises and educational games was noted along with a lack of integration with instructional management systems and ambiguous relationships to individualized education programs.

        "description":"The report presents case studies of microcomputer use in 12 school districts' special education programs. The case study approach was designed to focus on organizational issues, specifically the following four: nature of collaboration between regular and special education, centralization or decentralization of decisionmaking in implementation phases, cooperation between administrators and educators regarding application (administrative vs. instructional), and training in the use of microcomputers. An initial section analyzes data across the case studies. Major findings include overall collaboration in the use of microcomputers between special and regular education, especially, at the building rather than district level; the importance of a small team approach to implementation;  lack of conflict between administrative and instructional applications in microcomputer systems; and emerging trends in designation of a coordinator to supervise implementation. Each of the 12 case studies reports on program development and chronology, features of the microcomputer system, and organizational aspects. (CL)",

Attrition tables were developed for each school district and for the total state via analysis of computer data tapes for the years 1976-1983. Reasons for termination were analyzed from the viewpoints of special education directors as well as of personnel. Extensive statistical data are reported showing local and state attrition rates. Rates were relatively constant for the five years from 1977 to 1982. Rates are presented for 24 categories, including adaptive physical education, administration, gifted, and early childhood education. Problems in data analysis are noted. Sections 2 and 3 report data on reasons for termination and on the  individuals' willingness to return to special education. Family relocation (including moving, maternity and marriage) was the largest category cited as reason for leaving. Of those personnel citing many reasons for not returning, lack of administrator support and paperwork burdens were frequently reported as major problems. (CL)",

Although the decrease in average frequency can be explained by physical growth, the decrease in frequency variability cannot be explained as easily, especially in this age group. Based on analysis of spontaneous language samples of this study's 14 infants, the hypothesis that developmental decreases in average frequency and frequency inter-utterance variability occur before 3 years of age, and in infants as young as 11  months, is supported.

        "description":"Results of a study of the efficacy of foreign language instruction at the elementary school level are presented. The study provides new information permitting comparison of three program types--Foreign Language in the Elementary School (FLES), partial immersion, and immersion--currently used in schools in the United States. The results are based on achievement in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in French and Spanish as measured by the Modern Language Association (MLA) Cooperative Foreign Language Proficiency Tests. The following research questions are addressed in the study: (1) How do different foreign language program types affect student performance on a standardized language achievement test in terms of total time or intensity of instruction and use or non-use of  the foreign language to teach core curriculum subjects? (2) How does variation among schools within a given language program affect performance on the MLA test in terms of (a) articulation or continuity at the individual school level and within the school system, (b) socioeconomic status of students, and (c) number of years of program operation at the individual school level? (3) What is the correlation between self-assessment of language skills and performance on the MLA test? Overall, the results show immersion programs to result in student test performance significantly higher for all skills than FLES programs, and partial immersion programs to result in test performance at a level between total immersion and FLES programs. Policy implications based on the variety of interactions found  are discussed. (MSE)",

A chapter on program needs addresses the specific needs of American Indian language groups, Alaskan language groups, Puerto Rican language groups, and rural populations, and the general need for public awareness of bilingual education practices and results. Bilingual education as a potential for economic development and legislative direction and reauthorization issues are discussed in separate chapters. Council  recommendations are made in each of these areas of concern. The projected directions and general recommendations of the Council are outlined in a concluding section. Specific recommendations for initiatives in policy formation, program development, and research are made to the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Language Affairs, the Secretary of the Department of Education, and the President of the United States.

        "description":"La Salle College's three-track Bilingual/Bicultural Master of Arts Program is described and its first operational year (September 1982 - August 1983) is evaluated. Track I served teachers of English as a second language, Spanish as a first language, and other classes within bilingual education programs. Track II served students from other fields wishing to develop competence in Spanish: for example, nurses and police with extensive contact with the Spanish-speaking community. Track III served non-degree students, some of whom were educators. All faculty were bilingual in English and Spanish, equal emphasis was given to language, culture, and educational practice, and field experience was part of the program. The program evaluation concentrates on Tracks I and III, funded by Title  VII. The classes were found to be more varied than in most graduate programs, with more than one instructional approach used in each course. The languages of instruction were both Spanish and English in all but Spanish language classes. A summer immersion program included language, workshop, and field experience components. The field work involved observation or volunteering at an institution or organization serving a Hispanic clientele. Student evaluations of instruction were generally highly positive, and negative assessments were followed up. Formative evaluation of students' progress indicated most were doing acceptable graduate work, although some would have benefited from help with mechanics such as writing and research skills. The program was generally found to be well-conceived  and well-managed, consistent with the philosophy of bilingual education, and successful in helping students meet its goals. (MSE)",

A separate survey instrument was used for each academic level, but all inquired about language programs currently available and recently discontinued; language program preferences; foreign language and cultural training and skills possessed and used professionally; support from faculty, administrators, and parents; program content and  emphases; and attitudes toward international awareness. In addition, the higher education survey asked about enrollment and enrollment trends, graduate study, program rationale, admission and graduation requirements, foreign students, study abroad, and related interdisciplinary programs. The questionnaire used for businesses focused on the individual business' need for foreign language and/or cross-culturally skilled employees and the availability of such employees. Results are tabulated and discussed, and specific recommendations are presented for instructional and program improvement at each instructional level. (MSE)",

Adaptation of the syllabus has had five goals: (1) relevance to work and life in Japan; (2) student awareness of the functional dimension of the underlying structure in Japanese; (3) use of the comprehension advantage (generally greater comprehension than output); (4) increase in genuinely communicative practice; and (5) a foundation for continued learning. Five kinds of activities were included in the syllabus  adaptation: functional description, direct practice of functions, situational practice, introduction of cultural content, and over-the-head materials (unrestricted in structures and vocabulary) for listening and reading. Issues yet unresolved in the adaptation include whether to use traditional texts and supplement them heavily or write another text, the limitations of training in functional awareness, the need for more comprehensible input, communication versus accuracy, and increased student responsibility for learning.

This course was begun in 1979 to counter an elitist image of foreign language courses. Course topics encouraged students to explore the languages fully by: being activity-oriented; facilitating adaptation to new sound and grammatical systems; dealing with major cultural concepts; including intriguing sounds, expressions, and gestures of the target languages; addressing the relationship of geography to occupations, food, clothing, and so on; dealing with the language's history and contributions to American culture; attempting to elicit interest in the target countries; being addressed, when  possible, in a single class period; encouraging values clarification; and promoting career awareness. The languages (French, German, Latin, and Spanish) each were responsible for 20-22 class meetings during the semester. Each of the four language teachers involved developed activities from the standard unit topics provided. The course has been well received by teachers, students, parents, and administrators. Appended materials include: lists of specific activities for each language, a 1982-83 course schedule, results of teacher and student surveys regarding the course, student grade statistics for 1981-82, and the district's total foreign language enrollments for the fall semesters of 1975 through 1982.

Specific study objectives were as follows: to determine the general factors associated with the direction of development (growth, stability, stagnation or decline) for institutions receiving substantial support from Title III of the Higher Education Act; to identify developmental activities that seem to be serving their function well, in terms both of federal intent and institutional needs and purpose; to ascertain the types of impacts and consequences that these activities might have on institutional condition; and to identify the factors associated with positive impact and consequences. Twenty publicly-controlled and 32 privately-controlled institutions  were selected randomly from those with prime Title III grants effective in the 1981-1982 academic year. This sample included 27 traditionally black and 24 nonblack institutions, and 10 two-year and 41 four-year institutions. Each institution was asked to nominate up to 12 development activities that had made a positive difference with activities to be drawn from each of three areas: fiscal, administrative, and educational and support program improvement. Findings at the institutional level and at the activity level are summarized. (SW)",

After an overview of the study, the history of Title III, and the nature of institutional development, characteristics of the sample institutions and development activities are described. Attention is also directed to criteria for selecting institutions that are viable or vulnerable, and factors that influence development. Additional analyses cover a  structure for defining and viewing developmental activities as a unit of analysis, and the ways activities may contribute to the broader institutional viability specified by Title III. Finally, the interactions of fiscal, management, and program activities, and implications for Title III are discussed, as are special issues and a model for development.

Both low- and high-achieving college students were given CJ tasks, consisting of general information questions, before and after a brief training session. In addition, as part of the initial CJ test, half the students in each achievement group were asked to provide reasons why they selected a particular answer. Training included personal feedback about each student's performance on the CJ pretest and discussions and written exercises directed toward teaching students to weigh carefully the evidence for why a particular answer was correct. Findings include the following: low achievers were more overconfident than were high  achievers; the requirement to provide reasons for why an answer was correct reduced overconfidence for low, but not for high, achievers; and training led to significant improvement in CJ performance, although the effect was greater for low than for high achievers. It appears that high achievers were more likely to engage spontaneously in those cognitive activities that are important to making appropriate judgments about what is known. (Author/SW)",

Attention was directed to two- and four-year colleges that were not federally funded, as well as to institutions whose cooperative education programs were federally supported. Data from a 1975 directory of grant recipients were obtained for 860 programs. Based on an 8-year profile of reported student enrollment, these programs were divided into five growth groups (discontinued, increased, decreased, fluctuating, and stable). A second research agenda was to determine institutional characteristics, the history and  nature of cooperative education, and general information about the community. Questionnaires were sent to 612 institutions still offering cooperative education in 1982 as well as to 296 colleges with discontinued programs, and a total of 312 usable responses were obtained. Finally, data were collected on the kind of award, the years involved, and the dollar amounts. It was found that 34.4 percent of the programs that had been operating in 1974-1975 had been discontinued by 1982-1983. A questionnaire is appended. (SW)",

Study methods included a literature review and a survey of practitioners concerning the advantages and disadvantages of a single appropriation versus several appropriations. In addition to surveying directors of the fiscal services divisions of 49 state legislatures, a telephone survey was conducted with other public multicampus institutions whose organizational structure was similar to the University of Alaska. Of the 25 systems surveyed, including Alaska, nine received funds for their operating budget through a single appropriation. The only variables that were identified relating to whether or not an institution received a single  appropriation were the land-grant status of the institution and the unique political and socioeconomic circumstances of the state. The literature review and suggestions from the fiscal analysts of the states provided several viewpoints that relate to six basic issues: organizational flexibility, depoliticizing of the funding process, accountability, efficiency, legislative oversight and understanding, and increased funding. Three recommendations are offered including that the university should continue to improve its management procedures and then be awarded a single appropriation. (Author/SW)",

In addition, chemistry achievement subscores were calculated from regularly administered chemistry course examinations. Results indicated a fair amount of colinearity among math  scores and the tests of visualization. Males did significantly better than females on the SAT-M, the ROT test, the FASP test, three chemistry achievement subscores, and the total chemistry score. A comparison of students with low and high visualization scores revealed significant differences among females on all chemistry achievement measures and on the SAT scores. The findings suggest that visualization skills play a role in chemistry achievement and that visualization skills may be more important in this context for women than for men. (SW)",

Distance education is used in many content areas in economically diverse countries. Individuals who must learn at a distance have ongoing obligations (e.g., employment or caring for young children) or physical handicaps, or they live in geographically isolated areas. Distance faculty members are commonly called mentors or tutors, because they direct students to learning materials and personnel, provide emotional support, and evaluate students' progress. The more that distance learning expands students' heterogeneity, the greater the need for  nontraditional recruitment, admissions, registration, and counseling. Despite a strong trend toward the use of multiple media, the major way of providing distance education remains printed materials. It is only when enrollment is high that the use of technology, especially broadcast media, in courses becomes cost effective in comparison to classroom-based students' achievements. Thirteen kinds of media that deliver instruction to distance learners are considered. An extensive bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"The history of military manpower policy and college student deferment is reviewed, with attention to the Selective Service College Qualification Test (SSCQT). By passage of the Selective Service Act of 1948, Congress recognized the need to maintain an adequate number of scientific, professional, and specialized personnel in both civilian and military pursuits. A student deferment plan was proposed whereby candidates could qualify to continue their education on the basis of class standing or a specified score on a nationally-administered educational aptitude test. In the fall of 1950, the Selective Service System contracted with Educational Testing Service (ETS) for the development of the SSCQT, a 150-item examination measuring a student's verbal and mathematical ability. The  student deferment plan had vocal proponents and opponents. From 1951 to 1954, ETS tested over 500,000 students and conducted a statistical analysis program to supply the Selective Service System with information needed to operate the testing program. The SSCQT was operated by Science Research Associates for about 6 years. The Vietnam War and related anti-war and anti-draft movements renewed public debate over military manpower policy in the mid-1960s. In 1973 Congress replaced the Selective Service System with an all-volunteer army. A selected bibliography is provided. (SW)",

Problems of data collection concerning minority students are identified, including the following: methodological difficulties in identifying the race of respondents and in weighting procedures that may result in inflated or deflated estimates of minority college enrollment; the use of unrepresentative samples of minority students and colleges as the sources of data on which conclusions about minority students are made. Information concerning the flow of minority students through higher education is also examined, along with the fields of study minority students pursue and the way that their choices change. The evidence suggests that minority students  are highly motivated to achieve college and advanced education, but there is unequal distribution of minorities into types of colleges and programs and differential dropout rates. Despite a high enrollment rate in college, the pool of minority college seniors who enter graduate or professional school is smaller that it ideally would be. Attention is directed to programs that have attempted to alter minority students' negative perceptions of business and to provide the needed financial aid. Directions for future research are also addressed and a 35-item bibliography is appended. (SW)",

Major findings, which are based on a 1982 survey of over 5,000 high school seniors, include the following: two-thirds of  seniors who planned to attend college and who expressed a preference for an out-of-state institution indicated that the institution's reputation for high academic quality was one of the three reasons for their selection; and 39 percent of seniors cited the availability of a particular educational program at the chosen out-of-state institution as one of the three reasons for their selection.

Responses to the questionnaire, which is appended, were received from 79 students in electrical engineering and computer science, 49 in mechanical engineering, 25 in civil engineering, 12 in engineering science, 11 in industrial engineering and operations research and 12 in other programs. Findings include the following: students across all programs viewed the employment prospects for students in electrical engineering  and computer science as being excellent (and generally better than those in other programs); nearly three of every four students in computer science suggested that their enrollment in engineering was contingent on being in computer science itself; almost 90 percent of the sample of graduating seniors reported that they were satisfied with their education in engineering and with their specific program as well; and only half of the seniors expressed satisfaction with the faculty advising they received.

The survey was undertaken to provide a profile of students enrolled in the Continuing Studies Division of the private, urban college. Responses were obtained from 652 evening students and 151 provisional students of the private, urban college. It was found that younger adults, many of them single and without dependents, made up a large part of the student body. These students were typically not affluent, were more interested in business degrees than liberal arts degrees,  and were paying for education with their earnings and savings and some support from employers. Students in a provisional admissions program designed exclusively for new high school graduates were less likely to pursue business degrees, were paying for education with loans and grants as well as savings, and were somewhat more interested in liberal learning than were the older adults. Both groups of students chose the college primarily because of its good academic reputation. (Author/SW)",

It is suggested that redefining the role of the ADN graduate has not resolved the mismatch of educators' goals and the hospitals' requirements. Therefore, the NCP decided to demonstrate how curricular change could be used to improve the performance of new ADN graduates. One of the three demonstration projects in Florida was Manatee Junior College's clinical electives and preceptors program, which was  designed to provide students and nursing graduates the opportunity to take electives in clincial nursing for credit. The second demonstration program was Santa Fe Community College's elective in gerontological nursing, which centered on the knowledge and clinical abilities needed to improve nursing care of the elderly. Finally, the third project at St. Petersburg Junior College involved alternative teaching strategies (adjunct instructors, peer tutors, and mini-practicum). A 24-item bibliography is appended. (SW)",

The primary data source is the 1981 Survey of Doctorate Recipients, which is appended. Attention is directed to the increasing number of Ph.D.s awarded over the last decade or two, especially to women and minority groups. For 1973-1976 Ph.D.s, the analysis covers variables such as employment status, field mobility, type of employers, tenure status, and academic position. Comparisons are made by field, sex, postgraduation plans, and employment setting, and with other Ph.D. year cohorts. Findings for science and engineering Ph.D.s include: almost two-thirds of the 1960-1964 graduates had firm commitments for  employment immediately after receiving their doctorates, compared to only half of the 1977-1980 graduates; and there has been an increasing movement into nonacademic employment for recent science and engineering doctorate recipients. Findings for humanities Ph.D.s include the following: for 1973-1976 graduates, a larger percentage of women were part-time employed in 1981 than were men; and except for the fields of art history and music, a maximum of one-third of the graduates were working in nonacademic jobs.

        "description":"The nature of novice programmers' mental models for BASIC statements following preliminary BASIC instruction was assessed with 30 undergraduates who were taught BASIC through a self-paced, mastery manual and who were simultaneously given hands-on access to an Apple II microcomputer. Following instruction, the students were tested to determine their conceptions of what goes on inside the computer during the execution of each of nine BASIC statements: (1) LET A = B + 1; (2) PRINT C; (3) LET D = O; (4) PRINT &quot;C&quot;; (5) IF A IS LESS THAN B GOTO 99; (6) INPUT A; (7) 20 DATA 80, 90, 99; (8) 30 READ A; and (9) 60 GOTO 30. Data gathering instruments included a questionnaire to obtain information on the subject's demographic characteristics and background in mathematics and/or computer  programming; the IBM Programmer Aptitude Test; and both verbal and visual (diagram) tests on the nine statements. Results showed that despite adequate performance on program generation mastery tests, students possessed a wide range of misconceptions concerning the statements they had learned. This paper presents a catalog of the subjects' mental models for each of the statements, frequency tables showing incorrect or incomplete transactions produced for each statements, and a six-item reference list. Appendices include instructions, a sample page, and a sample protocol from each of the two tests on the BASIC statements. (Author/LMM)",

        "description":"The frequencies of specific types of verbal attractiveness stereotypes portrayed on television commercials and regular programs were determined in two studies. In the first, the 4,294 commercials aired between 8 and 10 p.m. on the 3 major networks were observed during a 7-day period in the spring of 1982. Statements related to attractiveness were recorded and coded according to nine categories: beauty, average, ugly, young, old, weight, figure, look/style, and bright. Results indicated that when all categories were combined, 25.6% of all commercials contained at least one of the attractiveness categories. Female performers and male voiceovers were far more likely to make the statements exhibiting the attractiveness categories than male performers and female voiceovers. In the  second study, which focused on 150 weekly television programs, an average of 2.4 statements per hour were recorded that exhibited the attractiveness categories. Across all programming, agents of the statements were usually males, recipients of the statements were more often female than male performers, and the statements more often referred to women. Implications are that television is acting as a powerful promoter of attractiveness stereotypes. Tables show the coding system categories with examples and provide detailed study results. (LMM)",

Individual sections focus on the AESP experiment, which began with 15 receive sites in 8 Appalachian states; the plan for its transition into an expanded, self-sustaining organization; and the use of the  NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) ATS-6 communications satellite. The second chapter traces the development of ACSN into an independent, nonprofit organization using a commercial satellite to provide 3,300 hours of programming annually to a nationwide audience, and the changes for the organization produced by the addition of cable television distribution. A look at ACSN and the future discusses its new name, ACSN-The Learning Channel, and its business plan, program services, program syndication, and corporate development. (LMM)",

A general, interpretative account is given of the background history of the Appalachian Educational Satellite Project (AESP) experiment, which supplied graduate credit courses to teachers located in remote areas of the Appalachian region using an experimental  NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) satellite from 1972 to 1975. The maintenance, refinement, and expansion of the original mission of AESP from 1976 to 1978 are described, including the development of a strong research and evaluation program to guide network operations. The incorporation of ACSN in 1979 as an independent agency is documented, and it is noted that the network provided 64 hours per week of programming to more than 1.5 million homes in 42 states in 1982.

Half of the observations were made from two-way television mediated lessons transmitted from the Veterans Administration Hospital in Temple, Texas, to College Station, Texas, while the remaining presentations were made in a traditional manner with the professor present in the classroom. A classroom observation system based partly on Gagne and Briggs' events of instruction was developed to obtain low-inference data regarding instructional strategies used during classroom presentations. Cognitive achievement data associated with the course,  Measurements in Medicine, were collected and analyzed with respect to the instructional delivery method and were compared with parallel data from students in a previous class who had received traditional instruction. Results indicated that similar instructional strategies were used by the professors regardless of the presentation mode, and that achievement was at least as high on materials presented over two-way television as they were on material presented with the professor present in the classroom. Seven references are listed. (Author/LMM)",

        "description":"In exploring the impact of microcomputers and the future of the university in 1985 and beyond, a distinction should be made between computing literacy--the ability to use a computer--and computer literacy, which goes beyond successful computer use to include knowing how to program in various computer languages and understanding what goes on mathematically, logically, and/or electronically inside the computer. Though computer uses in higher education in the future are difficult to predict given the propensity of the educational system to resist change, some of the possible current and future uses include word processing, submission of manuscripts to textbook editors, teacher student communication, faculty work at home, online access to library holdings, interactive computer  network conferences, student advising and schedule planning, use of videodiscs as interactive &quot;textbooks,&quot; and artificial intelligence applications. The university must promote and encourage computing literacy in order to survive. While the initial cost for providing computers may seem unrealistic, the potential savings could significantly reduce administrative overhead. Computing will become more central to the function of professionals, and, because information is power, will increase the power of the individual. (LMM)",

It describes the districts and the kinds of hardware and software they use and contrasts their implementation plans, noting that one plan viewed microcomputers as assisting in the total educational program through computer assisted instruction, while the other viewed computer literacy and programing skills as the sole purpose for using microcomputers. The design of the questionnaire and the type of information sought are described, and the statistical analysis is reported for the following issues: demographics, microcomputer  experience, what teachers think about microcomputers, how teachers feel about microcomputers, what teachers wish from microcomputers, the consequences of exposure to microcomputers, and how such exposure changes what teachers think and influences their feelings and wishes. Results of interviews with district personnel are provided as well as a summary of questionnaire comments. Conclusions address the implications of these data for the introduction of microcomputers into the educational process.

Libraries were the central topic of both meetings, but they were considered as part of a system that also includes book and journal publishing, the obligations and concerns of university administrations, the needs of scholarly disciplines, and the guidance of foundations. Forum I was intended to identify and explore primary issues needing national attention while Forum II focused on national and regional library cooperation in collection development and preservation. A summary of discussion from Forum I focuses on the future of research libraries and the possible need for fundamental library changes to cope with rapidly changing  publishing and information service systems. Topics discussed include bibliographic services, shared resources, preservation, technology, library economics, and professional education. A background paper for Forum II by Walter J. Haas outlines the purpose of the meeting and the case for a planned approach to collection development and preservation. The paper also lists questions for discussion related to bibliographic information, library collections, cooperative collecting, and preservation. A summary of conclusions on the national aspects of collection development, the preservation of library materials, and related issues is also presented.

Ss were studied in the special preschool and followed up in regular public school classrooms. Analyses were also conducted to determine the communication demands in elementary school classrooms, and investigations  were made of milieu intervention techniques (e.g., modeling and incidental language teaching) for use as auxiliary training procedures. A major finding was that while comprehensive language training efforts resulted in significant generalization, the generalization was limited to those structures within the child's general developmental level. Students did not appear to have acquired a generalized \"learning to learn\" strategy. Suggestions for improved programming focus on ways to incorporate research and generalization. (Author/CL)",

Modeling and feedback were used in all training conditions. Interactions between dyads were videotaped. Analysis of communication frequency and accuracy data revealed that Ss receiving both comparison and message formulation training had the largest  gains in communication accuracy following training and also demonstrated impressive increases in communication frequency.

Additional findings showed that poor phonatory control and lack of control over duration were the salient characteristics of children who exhibited the least gains in speech intelligiblity, in general, and across all speech features, in particular.

Ss were exposed to a pre-training experience consisting of either free play or general imitation training. Ss were then taught to produce nine manual signs, three by each of the training techniques. Post-test data revealed that Ss receiving the pre-training imitation experience produced a greater number of signs to criteria and a greater number of correct responses to the sign stimuli. Ss responded more frequently to sign stimuli presented in the imitation alone or imitation/molding training modes than in the molding alone mode.  (DB)",

The hypothesis is explored that deaf mothers modify their language when directly addressing their children in the same fashion as hearing mothers. Utterances containing pointing behaviors and modulated verbs were isolated. Findings in phonological, semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic domains clearly support the hypothesis that deaf mothers modify and simplify their language in conversation with their deaf babies. Data further supported previous reports that young developing signers do not make use of the inflectional/verb modulation system of the ASL in the early stages of acquisition. Children  combined deictic points and lexical signs. Similarly, the mothers did not employ much modulation in their language with their children. Strategies used by mothers included explicit forms of reference to referencing non-present objects, locations, and people through indexic incorporation and verb modulation. (Author/CL)",

Following an executive summary, an analysis of four major aspects of the law's implementation is detailed. A section on students receiving a free appropriate public education cites data on the number of students served, services for children from birth through age 5, services to secondary and postsecondary aged students, services to institutionalized and previously institutionalized students, and personnel. The next section provides an update on the implementation of key provisions of the Act assuring the rights of handicapped children. Information is provided on the least restrictive environment provision, precedural safeguards,  protection in evaluation, and initiatives of the Department of Education, Special Education Programs (SEP). The third section reports on assistance to states and localities in educating handicapped children. Discussed are the amounts and use of federal, state, and local funds for serving handicapped children; technical assistance to the states; SEP review of state programs; and other SEP administrative responsibilities. The final chapter examines efforts to assess and assure the effectiveness of programs educating handicapped children. Reported are federal evaluation efforts and studies, procedures being implemented for state and local evaluation efforts and state and local evaluation studies. A major portion of the document consists of appendixes concerned with evaluation of the  Education of the Handicapped Act, discretionary programs administered by SEP, and data tables. The data tables include child count tables (by state, age, and handicapping condition); personnel tables (special education teachers, other staff, and student teacher ratio); least restrictive environment tables (number and percent of children served in different educational environments by age and state); population and enrollment tables (census projections by state and age); and a financial table showing state grant awards under P.L. 94-142 for the fiscal years 1977-84. A final appendix provides background and methodology concerned with determining the costs of special education and related services. Additional tables and figures present data throughout the report.

A group of 72 undergraduate students randomly assigned to four treatment groups read and were later asked to recognize sentences from a passage. In one group, subjects were told nothing about the passage from which the sentence was taken. In the other groups, the subjects were (1) told the title before reading the sentence, (2) told the title after the reading and before the testing, or (3) told the title before and asked to relate the sentence to it. After the initial passage reading, subjects were given a brief mathematical distractor test and then asked to identify sentences as old or new. Results show that title availability during encoding significantly increased both  recognition of target sentences and rejection of distractor sentences. Providing the title immediately prior to testing but after reading did not improve performance over the no-title condition. It appears that awareness of context during encoding enables subjects to engage in unique encoding processes benefitting recognition as well as recall memory. (MSE)",

Contract learning, a procedure in which student essays are error-analyzed for repeated mistakes, can do so. Correction of those repetitions becomes a set of goals on a written contract signed by the teacher and student, and the student works to accomplish the goals by the end of the term. Contract fulfillment may involve either remediation or self-motivation. Fulfillment is based on a slowing, stoppage, or reversal of error trends by the term's end. Contract results provide a new, individualized, criterion-referenced source of measurement information to be integrated with other criterion-referenced (task based) and norm-referenced (rank based) sources in an advancement  decision using multiple references. Examples are given of this technique, based on 2 years of experience with the contract learning procedure. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"A procedure for implementing a 24-day intensive language course that involves eight thematic lesson plans uses a 3-day cycle of instruction based on the Lozanov method. The classroom is organized to be as free as possible from typical classroom associations, using chairs in a semi-circle without tables or desks. The first 3 days are structured to avoid any stressful or outwardly embarrassing situations for the students, and are entirely oral, without any written text. For each of the eight lessons, the first day's task is getting acquainted. The first presentation of new material is followed by a break, during which the teacher assigns character names and new seating to the students, who never return to their own names. The remainder of the day is spent in holistic processing of  the material. Speaking, when required, is done as a group and not individually. The primary goal of the second day is to reinforce and activize the first lesson's material, including detection of stresses picked up by students, articulatory exercises, lexical and grammatical reinforcement, and singing. The third day brings the highest student participation level, moving from the first day's holistic processing and the second day's mixed processing to the final day's highly analytic and cognitive processing. On this day, the theme characters are adapted to other situations outside the text, a departure from the Lozanov method. Use of the Lozanov method in the Soviet Union in the last 5 years has been highly successful. (MSE)",

The rating scale was a 10-item instrument devised for the goals and content of each workshop and was administered immediately before and after workshop sessions. The questionnaire was distributed after each  workshop. The self-rating scale allowed assessment of the effectiveness of the sessions by relating gains in the participants' self-rated awareness of cultural issues to the specific activities chosen for the workshops. To varying degrees, both workshops were perceived as useful by participants, with questionnaire comments corroborating rating scale information. Participants in both workshops made significant gains in self-rated cultural knowledge. Further research into the long-term value of such training in helping educators become more effective in cross-cultural settings at home and abroad is recommended. (Author/MSE)",

The evaluation was carried out with a standardized group test of English comprehension, an individually administered test of oral proficiency, questionnaires, observations, followup questionnaires and tests, informal techniques, and curriculum analysis. Most of the soldiers in the programs were well-educated Puerto Ricans with weak oral English skills. The programs' length and content varied widely. All three produced gains in English proficiency, with gains increasing with the program length. ESL training was found to be positively related to lowering of attrition rates. Although ESL participants generally liked their programs and teachers, they  felt the need for more practice in conversational skills. Supervisors were generally supportive of the programs and made qualitative decisions between soldiers scoring 50 or more and those scoring less than 50 on the standardized test. Evaluation results suggest a need for greater emphasis on spoken English, more realistic expectations of what can be accomplished in a short time, and systematic training of Army ESL teachers. The need for ESL in the Army is affirmed, and the possible lowering of the current criterion of language proficiency is discussed. (MSE)",

The study examines and describes these elements: (1) the general characteristics of the region and population served by the school district; (2) the characteristics of the services provided by the districts to students of limited or no English speaking ability; (3) changes that have occurred in  types of services delivered by the district to language minority students, and the influences of those changes; and (4) the level of academic achievement obtained by students who have participated in the programs, as measured by standardized achievement tests. In addition, the procedures used in the conduct of research, services delivered at each site, and the individual sites are described, and an interpretive summary of the findings across sites is presented.

The overall study's major conclusions are that: (1) English instruction is critical for the development of reading and  writing skills in English, but those students coming to school with a greater command of natural language in English maintain an advantage in the long-term development of those skills; (2) To the extent that native-language instruction is effective in developing native language literacy skills, transfer of the underlying academic proficiency occurs with mastery of the second language; and (3) English oral grammar skill is advanced through exposure to both natural and formal language in English, but oral discourse skill, a formal language factor, will most likely be developed through formal rather than natural language exposure.

The results of the data gathering are summarized for each of the three communities: (1) an urban, primarily Asian community of Seattle, Washington with multiple language groups; (2) the larger of two El Paso, Texas, school districts, which has a majority of Hispanic Americans, and (3) two neighboring rural New Mexico school districts serving primarily Navajo students. The descriptive summaries for each community include information on the region and population, factors influencing change in educational practices for minority-language  students, educational services presently available to limited-English speaking students, program exit criteria, length of stay in programs, and student achievement. It is concluded from these three descriptive studies that special language assistance programs continue to be needed, and that federal policy should be broad enough to allow communities considerable latitude in designing appropriate services. Benefit is seen in the use of the non-English home language in the classroom. Results of the analytic study of Cantonese bilingual education in the Seattle site are also summarized, including information on student characteristics, language proficiency, and literacy skills as measured by a number of distinct tests, and the literacy predictors examined.

The findings are integrated with current research and theory related to academic development in bilingual contexts, focusing on the policy implications of the SEDL findings. First, the general question of how research findings relate to educational policy is briefly considered. It is suggested that much of the confusion about the research basis for bilingual education derives from educators' and policy-makers' failure to  appreciate the role of theory in the formulation of policy. The alternative policy-related theoretical arguments for and against bilingual education are outlined and the major SEDL study findings are examined in relation to these theoretical positions. The results of other related studies are reviewed and the extent to which policy-relevant theoretical principles emerge from the data is considered. (Author/MSE)",

The major findings of the SEDL study are reviewed and related to previous research and theory concerning linguistic mismatch occurring when  instruction is in a language not fully understood, the maximum exposure hypothesis of language learning, and the interdependence of first- and second-language skills.

Ways that colleges can contribute to reform of the schools are also addressed. It is claimed that many students have difficulty when they must use higher-order academic skills, such as analysis, application, and problem solving. There is increasing consensus across the county regarding the high school curriculum. As standards are raised and learning outcomes are better defined, educational tests should assume a new role. Improved learning by students also requires improved teaching. Positive actions that are needed include: improved working conditions and teacher salaries; positive incentives and  recognition for teaching excellence; strengthened community support for teachers and schools; more opportunity for participative decisionmaking; and better teacher supervision and evaluation. Additionally, greater understanding of today's youths and higher expectations of students are a necessary part of educational reform. Teacher preparation and promoting transition from secondary to postsecondary education are examples of ways that higher education can help the schools. (SW)",

Attention is directed to an environmental scanning model that is congruent with the concept of strategic planning and that emerges from one portion of the futures research community, issues management. A third planning model, the strategic planning process model, is proposed as a combination of long-range planning and the environmental scanning model. It is suggested that supplementing long-range planning with strategic planning concepts will help deal with a changing external environment. The environmental scanning model begins with scanning the external environment for emerging trends and issues that pose threats or opportunities to the organization. Each potential issue  or trend is then analyzed in the evaluating/ranking stage as to the likelihood that it will emerge and the nature and degree of its impact on the organization. Forecasts are made and each of the issues and trends are monitored for their relevance and accuracy. The strategic planning process consists of six stages: environmental scanning, evaluation of issues, forecasting, goal setting, implementation, and monitoring. (SW)",

The study population consisted of 76 students. Responses were obtained from four groups of students using a quasi-experimental pretest/posttest group design. Factors positively or negatively affecting professional role conception were isolated. Analysis showed that younger, unmarried, full-time generic students achieved highest professional role conception scores, while older RN students achieved highest bureaucratic role conception scores. Although RNs with 2 to 5 years nursing experience scored highest on the bureaucratic scale, cumulative nursing experience beyond 5 years did not increase bureaucratic  loyalties. Professional role conception increased slightly with continuous enrollment in nursing courses. The results suggest that professional role values should be continually reinforced throughout the curriculum to counteract bureaucratic role conceptions acquired by RNs in work settings and stereotypical service role conceptions held by generic nursing students.

The classes prepared students for examinations to meet general education graduation requirements. All test scores from 318 sections representing 27 courses from the fall semester, 1980 were analyzed. Section sizes ranged from 13 to 1,008 students. Sixteen content areas were represented. The findings suggest that at the college level, class size may be a much less important influence on student achievement than previously thought. It appears that increasing class size from current levels of 20 to 40 students up to several hundreds of students may not radically affect college student achievement. It is concluded that decisions concerning class  size in colleges and universities should be based on issues other than concern about student achievement (e.g., classroom facilities, course budgets, students' demand for classes).

Each class was observed at least once a week for one semester. A trained observer recorded the verbal interactions using the Expanded Cognitive Interaction Analysis System. The observation data were analyzed to determine whether differences occurred in the teaching techniques used in different disciplines or by different instructors. Students also ranked instructors according  to their effectiveness. Findings include the following: students rated instructors more highly who tested at higher cognitive levels (e.g., gave essay exams); instructors who relied heavily upon visuals were rated lower than those who used them only at strategic points; all of the instructors lectured an average of 80-95 percent of each class session; and there was more student talk per instructor question in the higher-rated classes.

The Debriefing Interview Guide was also administered to encourage and guide discussions between a trained interviewer and students after returning from study abroad. The findings suggest that changes in three dimensions of personality functioning  were associated with study abroad: increased interest in reflective thought and in the arts, literature, and culture; increased interest in the welfare of others; and increased self-confidence and sense of well being. An increased tolerance for ambiguity and interest in reflective thought combined with greater sensitivity and emotionality, and an increased interest in the esthetic suggest that study abroad can be an important general education component of the liberal arts curriculum.
